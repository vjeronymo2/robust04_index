			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 3 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Humberto  Corado, Salvadoran defense and public security minister, said  the second phase of Operation Fuertes Caminos, conducted jointly  with the U.S. Army, could be suspended should legal action  materialize. The minister added that President Alfredo Cristiani  and the Armed Forces will accept a Supreme Court of Justice  (CSJ) decision should it rule that the presence of U.S. troops  in the country indeed violates the Constitution.    The first phase of Operation Fuertes Caminos began in August  1993, but the Bar Association of El Salvador filed a suit in the  CSJ, claiming the joint operation was unconstitutional because  the presence of U.S. troops violates the Constitution.    The first phase of the operation ended in December 1993, but  the CSJ has yet to make a decision. The second phase began on 1  May with the presence of 400 soldiers -- U.S. engineers -- and a  similar number of Salvadoran military personnel.    Official sources said Fuertes Caminos is designed to  construct a number of structures, including schools, roads, and  water wells, structures that will benefit about 50,000  Salvadorans who live in rural areas. The projects are being  carried out in the hamlets of Miraflores and San Juan Nonualco,  La Paz Department, 5 km west of San Salvador.    The defense minister added that the projects will continue  for as long as the CSJ fails to issue a ruling. The projects  are scheduled to end on 20 August. The U.S. Government is  financing Fuertes Caminos at a cost of $1.5 million.    It was reported in San Salvador that 1,147 tons of equipment  and provisions to furnish the joint operation have been unloaded  in the port of Acajutla, east of San Salvador. Corado pointed  out that some of the equipment brought by the U.S. soldiers will  be donated to the Salvadoran Armed Forces.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (6): Investors still keen - Roland Adburgham looks at the industrial base For Wales, one of the coups this summer was the announcement that Tech-Board, a Pounds 40m start-up UK company, would site a hardboard mill, employing 200 people, near Ebbw Vale in Gwent. Mr Malcolm Graham, Tech-Board's chief executive, explained why. 'The region's strong manufacturing heritage and the availability of a quality, highly motivated workforce played a major part in our decision,' he said. 'The excellent communications with the rest of the UK and continental Europe, via the Heads of the Valleys road and the M4, were also important.' Other key factors, he said, were the support of the Welsh Office, local authorities and the Welsh Development Agency. British Coal Enterprise, the job creation offshoot, put in Pounds 250,000 of the venture capital. Similar stories from other companies explain why Wales continues to attract manufacturing investment. The combination of welcoming local authorities, active development agencies and the availability of grants helped Wales to be the only UK region to increase manufacturing's share of gross domestic product between 1980 and 1992. Inward investment has played a crucial part in enabling Wales to retain a manufacturing base, despite the contraction of its traditional heavy industries. There are about 350 overseas-owned manufacturing plants in Wales, nearly 100 more than in 1985, and employment by these has risen by 50 per cent. While competition to win such projects has become tougher, inward investment has not stopped. In May, for example, the Canadian company Fisher Gauge opened a European headquarters at Welshpool, Powys, to make small die-cast components. Mr Bill Fisher, president, said it chose Welshpool because of 'its good transportation links and good working environments'. In July, Nippon Electric Glass and Schott Glaswerke said it would site a Pounds 200m manufacturing plant at Cardiff Bay. Fears that the world recession would make Wales vulnerable to cutbacks of 'branch-plants' appear overstated. There has been retrenchment: Wella, the German group, is closing its Ondawel hair cosmetics unit at Pontyclun, near Cardiff, with the loss of 150 jobs. Compton Webb, a uniforms maker with several UK plants, shut its Newport factory with 230 redundancies to reduce capacity. The closure this year of BP Chemicals' ethylene cracker plant at Baglan Bay meant 600 jobs were lost. However, non-Welsh companies are continuing to invest in their businesses in Wales. This spring, Sony opened a frame-making operation at its Bridgend television plant, increasing its Welsh workforce to about 2,700. Another Japanese company, Sharp, is investing Pounds 5.5m in its microwave oven plant at Wrexham, Clwyd. A criticism of many inward investments has been that they have provided only low-paid assembly-type work. But Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, comments: 'Overseas companies, once established, are becoming more committed to Wales, viewing the principality as the best location for European headquarters, research and development and manufacturing. This is, in turn, improving both the number and the quality of jobs.' Such projects this year have included a Pounds 2m European research and development centre for Calsonic International, the Japanese-owned radiator company, at Llanelli. Automotive components have become one of the principality's key industries, ranging geographically from Ford's engine plant at Bridgend in south Wales to Toyota's engine plant on Deeside, north Wales. It is estimated about 20,000 are employed in the sector. It is often overlooked that the steel industry, where there has been huge investment, remains one of the biggest employers - British Steel has a workforce of more than 14,000 in Wales. Aerospace has also become a sizeable industry. Its labour force is over 11,000 people, spurred recently by the British Airways Pounds 75m maintenance base at Cardiff-Wales airport and Pounds 23m avionic component repair business at Llantrisant. In a different sector, an interesting turnround has been achieved at CP Pharmaceuticals, which a management buy-in team acquired last year from Fisons. Mr Andrew Coveney, finance director, says the company - based at Wrexham and making hospital and generic products - had been under threat of closure after multi-million pound losses. 'Since then, we have gone from strength to strength, having changed from being an outpost of a big plc to become a medium-sized, thriving, profitable and totally independent company.' The 194 jobs were retained and 20 more people have since been recruited. Another company in a growth industry is Nimbus Manufacturing at Cwmbran, Gwent. It made the first compact disc in Britain 10 years ago and now produces over 35m annually. It is investing Pounds 2.5m in its plant, which employs 300 people, this year and sees immense potential for CD-ROMs, the discs which store text, video, sound and graphics. Mr Howard Nash, managing director, describes Cwmbran as a good location for its road distribution - though, like other south Wales businessmen, he is concerned at the possibility of future motorway tolls. Wind farms are another novel - but controversial - industry, with a belated recognition that there needs to be tight control over their siting. Europe's largest wind farm, with 103 turbines, is at Llandinam, Montgomeryshire. Among investments this year by indigenous businesses has been that by Control Techniques, a leading producer of electronic drives and controls. At Newtown in mid-Wales, it is spending Pounds 8.5m to expand its European headquarters, R&amp;D and production. Stephens &amp; George, which prints about 100 magazine titles, is investing Pounds 3.7m at its Merthyr Tydfil plant. Halo Foods, at Tywyn, Gwynedd, has a Pounds 3.25m expansion to meet demand for its Halo chocolate snack bar. There are signs, as the recovery gains ground, of increasing activity. The venture capital group 3i put Pounds 8m into 17 Welsh companies in the year to March. It reports a 'noticeable increase in the level of growth of capital funding, as businesses moved to strengthen their balance sheets to take advantage of post-recession opportunities'. Made, the valleys enterprise agency, advised in 1993-94 on 182 business plans with an overall funding need of Pounds 10.5m, three times the amount sought in the previous year. As big businesses continue to reduce their workforces, much will depend on the growth of such smaller, indigenous businesses. One need is for more component suppliers and the Source Wales programme, run by the WDA, encourages links between companies. Another scheme, organised by the Welsh Office and Wales Quality Centre (a non-profitmaking company to promote quality improvement), is 'Inside Welsh Industry'. This is a series of visits to selected companies to enable business people to learn from their techniques and technologies. To promote technology transfer, Transtech International fair, organised by the WDA, is to be held in Cardiff in early December. It will enable academic and research organisations to meet companies so as to encourage partnerships for product development.</p>

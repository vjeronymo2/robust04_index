			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Leading Article: High costs of going green Environmental politics are entering a new phase. After two decades of frenzied environmental rule-making, attention is switching to questions of compliance and enforcement - and to the costs of cleaning up. Governments, pressure groups and industrialists need to take more account of that change if environmental policy is to move forwards. The raft of environmental laws and treaties which has been passed at both national and international levels has focused particularly on industrial pollution. The European Commission alone has issued about 200 'green' directives. This regulatory flurry has gone some way to answer the early campaigns of environmental groups. Politicians have begun, rightly, to call for more uniform enforcement of these rules, recognising that countries can secure trading advantages - or suffer - from discrepancies in the way that environmental rules are applied. Last year's move to set up an EC network of pollution inspectors was a step in the right direction. But better policing is far from the whole answer. A more measured approach to costs is also required. A dramatic example is the US's Superfund programme to clean up contaminated land. The US General Accounting Office has suggested that the costs to the government's Environmental Protection Agency and the private sector could be Dollars 300bn in 1990 money over the next 30 years, and that the defence and energy departments could face further liabilities of Dollars 200bn. Complying with these regulations would undermine large parts of the banking and insurance sector. No wonder such compliance looks increasingly unlikely to happen. New rules Uncertainty about whether past regulation will be enforced can also stall important new rules. In the UK, a decision on whether to remove more of the traces of lead in drinking water, following new, tougher World Health Organisation guidelines, is becoming embroiled in the debate about whether EC pesticides standards are too high. Governments should not try to conceal the fact that some past regulation is unworkable and that priorities must be established between competing claims. In some cases they will be right, too, to re-examine the scientific and economic basis for the rules. The EC water directives, among the oldest of European green rules, are a case in point. For their part, environmental pressure groups deserve much of the credit for the tightening of controls on pollution. But unless they recognise the change of mood, they risk being left out of the next phase of the debate. For example, they have not had much of a role in shaping European water standards because of their unwillingness to concede that some of the quality levels they are demanding go beyond what is necessary to protect public health. On the sidelines Similarly, they have been almost entirely excluded from the debate over Britain's coal industry, and may put themselves on the sidelines of this autumn's UK government review of nuclear power. Coal-burning power stations are among the main causes of carbon dioxide emissions, implicated in global warming, whereas nuclear power emits none. However, the main lobby groups' entrenched opposition to nuclear power has led them to put more weight than is yet credible on the potential of energy efficiency schemes and wind and wave power as alternatives to coal. But if the environmental groups are to play a bigger role in the debate about compliance and to have a chance of telling the public whether companies are meeting pollution regulations, they need more information. Too many details of industrial emissions are kept hidden on the grounds of commercial confidentiality. Making companies publish data on the amount of waste discharged to sewers would be a start; so would releasing more reports from the many government committees studying the health effects of pollution. Ultimately a civilised policy towards the environment will depend on all parties concerned being fully informed and seeking agreement both on what is desirable and what is affordable. This is the second of a series of editorials on environmental issues. The first was published on July 21.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Software goes multinational THE multinational company that wants to standardise on a single software package faces an enormous language problem. A package written in English will be easy to use in the US or UK but employees in Germany or Saudi Arabia may have problems. To help alleviate this, Seagull Business Software of the Netherlands has developed the Text Translation Tool (TTT) which enables the company to translate between most languages. These include Hebrew, Arabic and Farsi. To do this TTT, sold in the UK by Solution One of Tewkesbury, extracts text from software written for mainframes or minicomputers and transfers it to a PC. The human translator then types over the words or phrases in the new language. TTT integrates the new text into the original software. Seagull: Netherlands, 78 12 18 55; US, 619 486 1848. Solution One: UK, 0242 620076.</p>

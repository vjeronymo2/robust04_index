			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Tourism spending up 7% to Pounds 25bn BRITONS SPENT more than Pounds 25bn on tourism to all destinations last year in spite of the recession, an increase of 7 per cent in real terms from 1991, the UK tourist boards said yesterday. Travel to destinations outside the UK fuelled the growth, however, with holiday areas in Britain seeing their market share decline, according to the English, Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh tourist boards. Spending on tourism outside the UK by British travellers rose in real terms from Pounds 12.62bn in 1991 to Pounds 14.41bn last year, while British tourists travelling in the UK spent Pounds 10.66bn, compared with Pounds 10.85bn in 1991. Each of the four tourist boards registered declines in real spending in their region. Last year 80 per cent of trips were to destinations in the UK, but those outside the UK lasted twice as long and cost five times more. The report reveals a variety of distinctions between the four main regional tourism markets of the UK. Of English tourists, 90 per cent visit English destinations, while 50 per cent of Scottish tourists choose to holiday in Scotland. Just 22 per cent of Welsh tourists holiday in Wales, while 66 per cent of Ulster travellers holiday in Northern Ireland. England remains the most popular destination in Britain, accounting for 47m, or 59 per cent, of all UK residents' holidays. The most popular type of holiday destination in England remained the seaside resort. Other points of the study include: Hill-walking, hiking and rambling ties with swimming as the most popular activity pursued on holiday, closely followed by visiting cultural and historic sites. Travelling by car to holiday destinations was the preferred means of transport for 78 per cent of travellers. Hotels, motels and guest-houses accounted for 21 per cent of holiday accommodation on all trips, with many more people - 37 per cent - staying with friends and families. August was the most popular month for holidays - 19 per cent of all trips start then. UK Tourist: Statistics 1992. English Tourist Board, Department D, Thames Tower, Black's Road, London W6.

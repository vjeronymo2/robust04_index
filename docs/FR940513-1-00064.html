			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of the NRC recommendation, Clean Air Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments of 1990 (the 1990 amendments) added a new section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Act, section 183(f), that requires the EPA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgate standards applicable to emissions of VOC and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other air pollutants resulting from the loading and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unloading of tank vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 amendments also revised section 112 of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require the EPA to publish a list of categories of major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources and area sources of listed HAP and to promulgate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions standards for each listed category of emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources. In the Agency's initial list of categories of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources to be regulated under section 112(c) of the Act, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine vessel loading and unloading source category was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed because the Agency intended to regulate the emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of HAP as well as VOC under the authority of section 183(f)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act (57 FR 31566, July 16, 1992). After publication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this initial list of source categories, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided to regulate HAP emissions from major sources of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine vessel loading and unloading facilities under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority of section 112 of the Act (58 FR 60021,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 12, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Legal Authority for Tank Vessel Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Clean Air Act Section 183(f)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 183(f) of the Act requires the Administrator,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in consultation with the Secretary of the Department in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the Coast Guard is operating, to <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Promulgate standards applicable to the emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of VOC and any other air pollutant from loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and unloading of tank vessels (as that term is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined in section 2101 of title 46 of the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States Code) which the Administrator finds causes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or contributes to, air pollution that may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably anticipated to endanger public health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or welfare. Such standards shall require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of reasonably available control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology, considering costs, any non-air-quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits, environmental impacts, energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements and safety factors associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative control techniques. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Act further directed the Administrator to limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of the standards, to the extent practicable, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loading and unloading facilities and not to tank vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standards were to be promulgated within 2 years after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enactment of the amended Act and must be effective within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 years of promulgation. The Coast Guard was directed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue regulations ``to insure the safety of the equipment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations which are to control emissions from the loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and unloading of tank vessels *&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Clean Air Act Section 112  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title III of the 1990 amendments revised section 112 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act to reduce the amount of nationwide air toxics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. Under title III, section 112 was amended to give  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPA the authority to establish national standards to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce air toxics from industries that generate these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. Section 112(b) contains a list of 189 HAP, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of which are to be regulated. Specific HAP on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list include benzene (including benzene from gasoline),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toluene, and hexane. Section 112(c) directs the EPA to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this pollutant list to develop and publish a list of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories of major and area sources of the pollutants on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HAP list. National emissions standards for hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air pollutants (NESHAP) will be developed for each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source categories on that list. The list of source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 16,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 (57 FR 31576) and was revised to include marine vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loading and unloading operations on November 12, 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (58 FR 60021).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NESHAP are to be developed to control HAP emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from both new and existing major and area sources according  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the statutory directives set out in section 112(d) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. (Section 112(a) defines a major source as any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stationary source or group of stationary sources located  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within a contiguous area and under common control that emits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or has the potential to emit considering control, 10 tons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per year or more of any HAP or 25 tons per year of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination of HAP. An area source is any stationary source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is not considered ``major''.) The statute requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards to reflect the maximum degree of reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of HAP that is achievable for new or existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources. This control level is referred to as the ``maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achievable control technology (MACT)'', the selection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which must reflect consideration of the cost of achieving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emission reduction, any nonair quality health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impacts, and energy requirements for control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels more stringent than the MACT floors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MACT floor is the minimum stringency level for MACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. For new sources, MACT must be no less stringent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the level of emission control already achieved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice by the best controlled similar source. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing sources, MACT must be no less stringent than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average emission limitation achieved by the best performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 percent of existing sources or the best performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 sources in categories or subcategories with fewer than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jun 02, BNS -- The European Parliament  fully supports Lithuania in its efforts to become an associate  member of the European Union, the president of the European  Union [EU], Egon Klepsch, said at a press conference in Vilnius  Thursday. The press conference completed Klepsch's official  three-day visit to Lithuania.    Klepsch said the time is right for Lithuania and the EU to  make "resolute decisions" on associate membership. In his  words, Lithuania's economic progress gives hope that nothing  will hinder the process.    The European Parliament president once again emphasized that  he is pleased with the successful implementation of the troop  withdrawal agreement between Lithuania and Russia.    This proves, he said, that Lithuania has the ability "to  combine common interests" and can become a peace mediator in the  Baltic Sea region. Such a role is also predetermined by  Lithuania's geographical location, he said.    Klepsch expressed hope that the Lithuanian-Russian agreement  on the most favored nation trade status will soon come into  effect. He also praised the Lithuanian municipal elections law,  which was adopted Tuesday. Klepsch said the law meets Western  requirements.    Commenting on his visit to Lithuania, Klepsch said he  obtained much information about different political forces,  discussed Lithuania's relations with the European Parliament and  cooperation between the three Baltic states.</p>

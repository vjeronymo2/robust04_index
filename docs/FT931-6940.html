			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: SA steel producer down 27% EARNINGS at Iscor, South Africa's largest steel producer, dropped by 27 per cent in the six months to December as a higher portion of sales were exported while dollar prices were weak. Although turnover rose by 5.8 per cent to R4.3bn (Dollars 1.37bn) from R4.05bn a year earlier, weak export prices eroded profit margins. Pre-tax profits fell 18.4 per cent to R307m, from R376m, despite the benefits from the rand depreciating by more than 10 per cent against the dollar in the second half of 1992. Iscor was also helped by a reduction in financing costs, the result of lower interest rates and strict cash management. Attributable profits fell 27 per cent to R125m, from R171m, while earnings per share dropped to 6.7 cents, from 9.2 cents. The interim dividend was cut by one-third to 2 cents a share from 3 cents. Total steel tonnage sold during the year fell by 1.8 per cent, with domestic sales falling by 9.9 per cent. The shortfall was made up by a 6.5 per cent increase in exports, which rose to 53.3 per cent of total sales volumes from 49.1 per cent in 1991. As an austerity measure, capital expenditure was reduced to R267m from R393m, with only essential replacements and maintenance taking place. Iscor predicted a similar level of earnings for the second half. The domestic market is not expected to improve, and dollar prices of exports are expected to remain weak. Offsetting this will be benefits from lower inflation and interest rates in South Africa.</p>

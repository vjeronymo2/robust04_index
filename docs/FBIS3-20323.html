			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Eugen Georg Schwarz report: "Kohl Is Catching Up"] </F>   [Text] In the past, when there was only one television  channel, the television directors bridged half-time breaks in  soccer matches by showing a lion in the goal, at first sleeping  peacefully, then slowly awakening, stretching, readying itself  to leap as soon as the whistle sounded for the second half.  Helmut Kohl reminds us of this television lion of the past.    The chancellor seems to be at the stage of awakening. In  March, 31 percent of the Germans would have elected him  chancellor in direct elections, which is 7 percent more than in  February. Challenger Rudolf Scharping, who has looked like the  sure winner of the next Bundestag elections for many months,  lost a sensational 8 percentage points (52:44).    Also, regarding questions by Basis Research for FOCUS about  the assessment of the desired qualities of a chancellor, Kohl  caught up and Scharping lost. The only big problem is still the  "pleasant personality" of the man from Palatinate. "The advice  of Peter Boenisch alone, that the old man should not wear  glasses anymore, is probably not sufficient," an assistant image  polisher in Bonn's Konrad-Adenauer House said.    Even though the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] will have  to  beware of breaking into cheers, one cannot speak of a change in  the trend away from the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  and toward the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU], either.  However, the general political climate has improved slightly  for Kohl and his team -- but mainly in the west.    Whether this is due to the chancellor's appearance at the  Hamburg party congress; to his policy statement, which was  generally received positively there; or to Rudolf Scharping's  not very straight course of the past weeks (tax policy,  nursing-care insurance) remains to be seen.    Asked about the better government team and the competence in  solving the most important questions, the CDU/CSU is, quite  certainly, catching up to a considerable extent.    While in February only 26 percent of those polled decided in  favor of the coalition as the better team (SPD: 41 percent), the  Scharping team's lead has shrunk to 36:33 four weeks later. In  the west, the ratio was even equal. Here, the CDU/CSU and the  SPD received 36 percent each as the better government team  (CDU/CSU plus 9 percentage points, SPD minus 5 percentage  points).    However, if the point is who is more competent to solve the  most important political problems, the SPD is still clearly  ahead of the Christian-Liberal coalition. In March, 28 percent  counted on the current Federal Government (in January and  February 24 percent each); 38 percent (in January 39 percent, in  February 46 percent) thought the SPD would be more competent as  a government party. Even though Kohl and his team regained the  lead in competence, the quarrel regarding economic policy,  internal security, and price stability, Scharping's team  continues to dominate in all other political fields.    Seven months before the Bundestag elections in October, the  decision has not been made by far. A considerable part of the  voters -- in the east and the west -- are unsure which  government they actually want and whom they are supposed to vote  for.    This becomes clear from the answers to question: "Which  Federal Government do you expect after the elections?" A total  of 21 percent (in January 20 percent, in February 18 percent)  believe in a coalition with a CDU/CSU leadership or a CDU/CSU  solo government. A total of 40 percent favor an SPD-led  coalition or an SPD absolute majority (in January 37 percent, in  February 49 percent).    However, despite this seemingly big lead, the SPD's victory  is not at all certain. An employee of Basis Research says:  "Only when such a poll yields more than 60 percent for a  certain party or a certain coalition, one can say for sure: The  decision has been made." Uncertainty over voting behavior still  reigns in particular in the new laender. Even though, just as  in the west, here, too, only one out of four says: "I do not  know whom to vote for." However, asked "How certain is your  current decision for the elections?" only 53 percent say: "I  would certainly vote for the party I mentioned."    In the old laender, 74 percent are certain, which  corresponds  to a federal average of 69 percent. Public opinion researchers  register firm links with the parties only as of 80 percent of  decisionmaking certainty.    The silver lining on the dark CDU/CSU horizon also gives  rise  to hope in the chancellor's office when the question is asked of  how voters would decide if the elections were held next Sunday.  In March the CDU/CSU gained 12 percentage points and now has 36  percent. The SPD goes down from 39 to 38 percent, the Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] from 8.5 to 7 percent,  Alliance 90/Greens from 9.5 to 9 percent. Honecker's heirs, the  Party of Democratic Socialism, is still elected by 4 percent.  The Republikaner go up from 3.5 to 4 percent, the others from  1.5 to 2 percent. The Instead Party and similar parties do not  have any chance of entering the next Bundestag.    After the disaster in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein,  things are obviously getting problematic for the FDP, also at  the federal level. The raw figures of the March poll, which  primarily reflect the general mood, see the FDP at only 6  percent. Even though this result rises to 7 percent after  additional calculations, already now the FOCUS Political Compass  indicates that the FDP will not get over the 5-percent threshold  with its regular voters alone. It must commit itself to a  coalition statement, because it will need coalition votes.    The CDU/CSU cannot be indifferent toward the fate of the  FDP.  If the coalition partner fails, the CDU/CSU's prospects to  remain in power go down to zero. Then even an absolute SPD  majority would be possible, just as in Lower Saxony.</p>

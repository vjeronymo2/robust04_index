			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK car market With the UK car market already resembling a multiple pile up, the devaluation juggernaut just adds to the carnage. Some 50 per cent of cars sold in the UK are imported, and Pounds 3bn of foreign components went into UK assembled cars in the first half of the year. To maintain margins, overseas manufacturers need to raise prices by 10 to 15 per cent in a market where sales have declined by 24 per cent in three years. The UK market weakness is only underlined by the government's decision to allow cars without catalytic converters to be sold for another year. In such conditions large price rises are impossible, but manufacturers will be hard pressed to cut costs or to spread their overheads by increasing volumes instead. As dealer and distributor margins were already badly mauled by the recession, most of the pain will fall on manufacturers, with companies such as Volkswagen, BMW, Renault and Peugeot the worst affected. But cost savings can only partly offset the devaluation losses. Some price rises are bound to seep through. To protect their market position, manufacturers will delay rises, but that will only be a matter of months, especially if companies trusted to the ERM and left their sterling exposures unhedged. Of course, there are winners. Rover has substantial sterling costs and should benefit in export markets. The Japanese investment in Britain also looks increasingly smart. UK component suppliers such as GKN may win further export business. But, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that, in the UK car market at least, devaluation will mean price rises without growth.</p>

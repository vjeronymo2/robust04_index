			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / German industry 'on mend' The slump in production of Germany's manufacturing industry has bottomed out and most sectors can expect some recovery in the coming year, according to the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute. Export orders, especially from China and south-east Asia, but also from the US and eastern Europe, have already helped to stabilise output levels in the hard-hit engineering, iron and steel industries, according to Ifo's latest monthly report. Hopes for a hesitant recovery cannot disguise the sharpness of the downturn, which has sent manufacturing production down 7.5 per cent in 1993, after a drop of 2 per cent in 1992 - overall, a drop of about one-tenth in output since the peak of mid-1991. Engineering production has fallen by 10 per cent in the past year alone and investment goods manufacturers have seen a loss of 15 per cent. However, Ifo researchers are relatively optimistic about the coming year, thanks to an improvement in industrial orders, especially for export, and to an end to the deeply pessimistic mood which has coloured all its surveys of business opinion for the past two years.</p>

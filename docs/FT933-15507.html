			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Wills Group share holdings realigned A REALIGNMENT of share-holdings at Wills Group, which distributes high specification fluid handling equipment, coincided with the signing of exclusive distribution agreements with three companies in the former Sigma Group, recently privatised by the Czech government. Stockbrokers Greig Middleton have placed 24.7m shares in Wills with its management and institutions. More than 21m were sold by Galactic Enterprises and the balance represented the rump of the holdings of the banks which assisted in the 1991 restructuring of Wills. In addition, Galactic's holding of 4.1m warrants has been bought by a family trust of Mr David Massie, Wills' chairman. Sigma's products will expand significantly Wills' range of fluid handling and instrumentation devices.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Currency debt re-rating threat hits Italian futures ITALIAN government bond futures fell steeply yesterday afternoon on news that Moody's Investor Services, the US credit rating agency, had placed Italy's long-term foreign currency debt rating of Aa3 under review for a possible downgrade. Moody's last reduced Italy's foreign currency debt rating to Aa3 from Aa1 in August. Earlier in the day, the Italian government bond market had been supported by news that the government of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato had survived its second vote of confidence in the space of three weeks. Late in the day, the Liffe March BTP future traded at 95.51 on volume of 19,343 contracts, down from a high of 96.50 in the early afternoon, and below the previous day's close of 95.86. Moody's said it had taken this action because of two concerns, firstly because of the lack of progress in reducing the country's public sector deficit, and secondly, because efforts to improve the fiscal balance have been impeded by the deepening political crisis. Moody's also lowered the domestic currency rating of Enel, the electricity authority, to Aa3 from Aa1 and also placed the rating under review for further downgrades. Enel debt is guaranteed by the Italian government. A total of Dollars 62.5bn worth of debt is affected. Meanwhile, the Bank of Italy said it planned to change the auction system for government securities. Mr Bruno Bianchi, head of the central bank's monetary and financial division, said the revised system would be computer-based in order to shorten the time of the auction. The new system could go into effect next year. Currently, banks participating in the securities auctions must send a telex to the central banks to make their bids. UK GOVERNMENT bonds rose steadily to close at the day's highs, supported by a slight recovery in the pound from its record lows. The long end rose between  1/4 and  1/2 point. The gain at the shorter end was limited to 1/32 point. The Liffe March long gilt future rose to the day's high of 103 9/16 late in the day, up from the previous close of 103 1/16 , in volume of 25,902 contracts. Trading was quiet and dealers said the market appeared to be stuck in a range of about one point on either side of current levels. They added that the market remained at risk on the downside, due to the continued vulnerability of sterling. US TREASURY prices gave up their mid-day gains to turn broadly lower yesterday afternoon. The decline followed news that Daiwa Securities America, the US arm of the Japanese securities firm, has been banned from placing customer bids at treasury auctions for three months. The news prompted speculation that other Japanese brokerage firms might liquidate their US security holdings. Daiwa can still bid on its own account. Yields on the treasury's bellwether 30-year bond inched back towards the 7 per cent level after moving lower in at mid-day. The long bond rose about 1/2 point at mid-session, but in late trading it was quoted  5/32 lower at 102 7/8 yielding 6.892 per cent. On Monday, the long bond broke through the 7 per cent barrier for the first time in 15 years. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged to yield 3.960 per cent. The Federal Reserve entered the open market to add liquidity to the banking system by arranging four-day system repurchase agreements. Fed Funds were trading at 3 per cent, the Fed's perceived target for the rate, when the intervention occurred. The market shrugged off news that unemployment claims rose 4,000 in the week ended February 13 to 325,000. Expectations had centred on a rise of 8,000 to 10,000 for initial weekly claims. GERMAN government bonds were little changed in the cash market late in the afternoon but the long Bund futures were slightly firmer. The Liffe March bund future rose to the day's high of 94.67 in moderate volume of 45,008 contracts, up from the previous day's close of 94.52. Dealers said that yesterday's inflation data from the western German state of Baden-Wurttemberg had dampened hopes of a credit policy change by the Bundesbank at its fortnightly meeting next Thursday. Consumer prices in Baden-Wurttemberg, the third of western Germany's four largest states to release inflation figures for the month, climbed 0.5 per cent in the month to mid-February and rose 4.1 per cent. The latest figures represent a mild slowdown from January's consumer price index monthly rate of 1.2 per cent and the annual rate of 4.2 per cent. But the figures continue to show an inflation rate above the 4 per cent which the Bundesbank regards as too high.</p>

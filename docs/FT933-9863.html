			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / No new Hermes credits for Russia GERMANY'S federal Economics Ministry will not extend new export credit guarantees to Russia. However, the decision will not apply to other countries of the former Soviet Union. A spokesman for the ministry said the risk in extending fresh Hermes credits to Russia was too great for the German government to bear. By the end of next month, Russian enterprises will owe DM500m (Pounds 194.5m) in interest payments on imports bought from Germany. Total exposure by the Hamburg-based export credit insurance agency to the former Soviet republics is about DM30bn. Bonn had last year already placed a ceiling of DM5bn on the amount of credits available to Russian and companies from other republics importing from west German enterprises. It also insisted that German exporters had to show that what they were exporting would help generate foreign exchange earnings for former Soviet republics, and/or prevent an east German enterprise from collapsing. Export credits to the whole of the former Soviet Union amounted this year to DM4bn.</p>

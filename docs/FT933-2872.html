			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank looks to fill in the gaps - Chief executive Hilmar Kopper outlines his equities expansion plan DEUTSCHE Bank is poised to expand its international equity operations as part of plans to round off the foreign growth of the past 10 years. Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive, said the bank did not feel 'under any pressure' to make a stockbroking takeover. 'But if we see a gem, we might take it, even if it's expensive,' he said. Mr Kopper said dealing in shares and derivate products was the only area in which the bank felt under-represented. 'We're basically happy with the bank's structure now. There are just some geographical regions and product areas to fill in,' he said. Predominant among them was equities, where the bank, especially outside Germany, did not have the same international clout it had in bonds or other banking activities. Speaking just before a rare meeting of Deutsche Bank's 13-member managing board in Milan this week, Mr Kopper stressed any stockbroking acquisition would have to meet the bank's strict rules on adequate return on assets. Takeover candidates were being regularly reviewed, subject to meeting the bank's return on assets criteria. The bank saw no contradiction between its growing interest in equities and its continuing defence of German rules limiting shareholders' voting rights, and protecting companies from takeovers. In spite of the substantial reforms passed to improve Frankfurt's standing as a financial centre, Mr Kopper said further measures, such as insider trading laws and disclosure of minimum share stakes, were still needed to bring domestic financial markets into line with the US and UK. 'I'm still a firm defender of restricting voting rights, as long as there are no other tools in Germany to maximise transparency. Once we have such instruments in place, I wouldn't want to defend restrictions. Indeed, I think we would set an example ourselves,' he said. Mr Kopper said Deutsche Bank was content with its European retail banking network, meaning that acquisition-based expansion plans for France and possibly the UK were now on the back burner. However, it was still keen on expanding in Italy, where its Banca d'America e d'Italia subsidiary, bought in late 1989, expects to have 160 branches by year-end. Although Deutsche Bank's managing board has looked at about six Italian bank acquisitions over the past 12 months, 'nothing had been quite perfect', said Mr Ulrich Weiss, the managing board member responsible for Italy. 'We are quite willing to invest more in Italy,' said Mr Kopper. The targets were small: regional banks with a tight cluster of branches in economically-attractive regions. Deutsche Bank was not interested in buying into the state-controlled banking or insurance operations due to come on the market shortly under the Italian government's privatisation plans. It was keen to play a part in Italian privatisation, but remained wary of buying into any bank it felt was too big for local staff to manage, he said. On the earnings front, Mr Kopper confirmed that net group profits this year would be broadly unchanged. There was considerable uncertainty over earnings in the domestic market in the second half. The bank might be obliged to make substantially higher bad-debt provisions, he said. The bank's forecast that Germany's recession had bottomed out, and for a gradual recovery early next year, meant many small companies now in difficulty could still go bankrupt if they failed to find adequate working capital for the upturn, he warned.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Switching staff to a new range of duties - Case study of The small firm Morrisflex, a small manufacturer of rotary tools and finishing machinery, has been gearing itself up for the VAT changes since April. The company, which exports one-third of its Pounds 3m turnover, mostly to other European Community countries, is fortunate in having a full-time computer manager, says company secretary Jeremy Theaker. Many companies of similar size - Morrisflex employs 75 people - would not have a computer specialist and so would have to employ outside consultants. Morrisflex's computer manager is currently working on creating a database for the information the company will now have to collect, though it expects it will also have to do additional manual data collection. Morrisflex recently wrote to its 100-plus European Community customers to ask them for their VAT numbers which will have to be included on all invoices from January. Just over half have replied so far but there was a particularly poor response from Germany (which is issuing new VAT codes) and Italy. There was a good response from the Netherlands, says Theaker. Morrisflex, based in Braunston, Northamptonshire, does not see much advantage from the switch to the new VAT system. It does not, for example, expect to benefit from the removal of border checks because it sends most of its consignments by parcel post. This means it does not normally experience customs delays or have to bear the cost of clearing agents.</p>

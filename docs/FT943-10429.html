			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / HK urged to curb data collection The Law Reform Commission in Hong Kong is urging the government to adopt legal controls on collection and use of information about individuals, arguing that failure to do so could cripple the colony's status as an international trading centre. The government, is examining the Commission's proposals and expects to decide in the next two months. Although some protection is offered by existing legislation and a voluntary code, the Commission believes the absence of comprehensive legal protection could prove a handicap from 1996, when it is expected the European Union will require its member states to control transfer of personal data. Mr Stuart Stoker, secretary of the Law Reform Commission (a body chaired by the attorney-general), said anecdotal evidence exists of UK companies being prohibited by data protection regulations from transferring data overseas because the specified country lacked protection. The Commission is recommending: The appointment of a privacy commissioner to oversee the proposed scheme; Legal regulation of all data relating to the individual; all such data to be protected by reasonable security safeguards; The right of individuals to obtain and, where necessary, correct personal data. Where damage has ensued, individuals may be entitled to compensation; a ban on passing such data to a third party. The proposals would stop data holders passing lists to direct marketing companies, and would allow redress to those penalised by inaccurate or information. The government is one of the biggest holders of personal data, but substantial banks are held by insurance companies and financial houses.</p>

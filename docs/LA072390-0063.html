			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SKINNER TAKES PRIDE IN TAKING ADVANTAGE;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: AS BACKUP TO ALL-STAR SANDY ALOMAR JR., CLEVELAND'S RESERVE CATCHER  LOOKS TO MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY.  </P> <P> Joel Skinner's strategy at the plate seems to be a simple one: Ignore a  pitcher's past glories, forget his notoriety and never consider him unbeatable.  </P> <P> "A guy's got a ball in his hand and you try to hit it," said Skinner, a backup  catcher for the Cleveland Indians. "You take pride in what you're doing, that's  all."  </P> <P> Skinner had reason to be proud Sunday.  </P> <P> Playing in place of Sandy Alomar Jr., Cleveland's All-Star catcher who was  sidelined by a sprained left thumb, Skinner had a double off starter Mark  Langston, a three-run home run off reliever Willie Fraser and scored twice to  help the Indians defeat the Angels, 8-1, at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> His homer to left, his first of the season, came on a 3-2 pitch in the third  inning. It gave Indians a 7-1 lead.  </P> <P> "At that point in time, I was just trying to work myself back in the count,"  said Skinner, who was playing in only his 25th game of the season.  </P> <P> "I was just trying to make contact. . . . Striking out has always been a thorn  in my side. My ratio is not all that good."  </P> <P> Going into Sunday's game, Skinner, a former standout at Mission Bay High School  in San Diego, had struck out 24 times in 66 at-bats. The last time the Indians  met the Angels in Cleveland, July 1-2, Skinner struck out four times in five  at-bats, but also received a bases-loaded walk.  </P> <P> The last time he faced Langston, on May 30 at Anaheim, Skinner drove in two  runs with a single in a 4-2 Cleveland victory.  </P> <P> Skinner shrugged when asked about his success against Langston, whose record  fell to 4-12 with the loss Sunday.  </P> <P> "He's been a tough pitcher over my career," said Skinner, 29, and a six-year  veteran of the majors.  </P> <P> "I didn't have much luck against him when he was in Seattle. I think coming  into this year, I only had one or two hits against him."  </P> <P> But Skinner was sharp Sunday. After Felix Fermin grounded to third to lead off  the second inning, Skinner hit a breaking ball down the left-field line for a  double. He scored on Jerry Browne's single to give Cleveland a 3-1 lead.  </P> <P> Defensively, Skinner also played a part in an impressive outing by starter Greg  Swindell, who improved to 6-5 after giving up six hits and one run in eight  innings.  </P> <P> "He did real well," Swindell said of his catcher. "I think with him and Sandy,  we have two of the best catchers in the league. I tend to know him better than  I know Sandy anyway, so it was nothing (to pitch to him). I never had to shake  him off once."  </P> <P> Skinner said it was just a matter of making the most of his opportunity.  </P> <P> "You just try to contribute," he said. "You can't go out and play for yourself  -- that's a key part of being professional.  </P> <P> "The thing people don't realize is that it's a lot of fun to play. And when you  get to, you make the most of it so you can keep playing."  </P></p>

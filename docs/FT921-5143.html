			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Trade News: G7 seen as key to Uruguay Round deal ONLY a crisis summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations, or EC heads of government, can get a Gatt Uruguay Round agreement this year. Brussels officials concluded this after Monday's sterile meeting here of EC trade and farm ministers. It reflects a growing conviction that the chance of a trade deal is slipping away, because of EC and US inability to agree farm trade subsidy cuts. In Germany, the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) stepped up calls for a summit to end the Gatt deadlock. Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, SPD parliamentary leader, urged Chancellor Helmut Kohl to contact President Francois Mitterrand to win a compromise. A Gatt round failure could cost Germany 1m jobs, he said. Ms Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, SPD finance spokesman, said it was 'incomprehensible' of Mr Kohl not to make Gatt his priority. She urged him to call for an emergency EC summit. The ruling coalition is split on the issue, with Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, urging a G7 summit. Failure would be a 'catastrophe'. The suggestions were dismissed by Mr Dieter Vogel, government spokesman. A special summit could hinder negotiating necessary changes in policies, he said. He rejected suggestions that German-French links were the critical factor in the current Gatt talks. 'It is not just a question of German-French relations, nor just of agriculture. It is a European-US theme.' Mr John Major, UK prime minister, who last autumn took a lead inside G7 in urging a successful outcome, phoned Mr Kohl yesterday to discuss the standstill. Mr Mollemann had promised Mr Kohl would phone President Mitterrand and President Bush to mediate, but Mr Vogel said no such calls had occurred. Brussels yesterday sent, to Gatt in Geneva, schedules listing the amount of food subsidies from which cuts would be made. In doing so, it overrode ministerial objections that this implied a pledge to cut the volume of subsidised exports, and the amount of subsidy. The EC is thus formally adhering to Gatt's timetable to end the Round before April 19, and is trying to arrange more talks with the US later this week. But France, backed by the UK, Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium, was 'unyielding' in opposing restraints on exports, as opposed to subsidy, Commission officials said.</p>

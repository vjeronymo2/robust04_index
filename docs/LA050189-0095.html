			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ALICE' A FEMINIST REVUE WITHOUT THE OUTRAGE  </P> <P> Oh, no! Not another feminist revue, Alice! Please say it isn't so!  </P> <P> That might be one's first reaction to the nomenclature -- "feminist revue" --  but "A . . . My Name Is Alice," which opened Saturday at the Old Globe's  Cassius Carter Centre Stage, is more winning than its English primer title.  </P> <P> It has class and a decidedly optimistic (if slightly diffused) point of view,  delivered by a sum total of 28 savvy contributors (from Amanda McBroom to Steve  Tesich) and a director who understands the value of restraint (Julianne Boyd).  </P> <P> Boyd and film maker Joan Micklin Silver ("Crossing Delancey") originally  conceived of "Alice" as a response to the more militant feminist outbursts of  the angrier 1960s. They took their time to collect their material and pare the  show down to size, assembling and disassembling this collage of songs and  scenes, until they had it the way they wanted it. That was 1983. In its present  form, "Alice" is about many aspects of being female -- good and bad -- in a  world populated by men and other creatures, all given their due.  </P> <P> And it doesn't gripe.  </P> <P> Au contraire. Upbeat is the name of this game. If "Alice" can be chided for  anything, it would be for managing to remain inoffensive. It has its occasional  cliches (yet another sketch or two set in the confessional of the beauty  parlor) and its sentimental indulgences (as in a daughter's song to the mother  she feels she has failed, or the sisters who learn to appreciate one another  rather late in life). But these are bracketed by enough bracing self-mockery,  good humor, keen observation and plain fun to serve as appropriate and even  welcome pace-changers.  </P> <P> A lot of the show's success rests with the five performers in charge: the  quizzical Roo Brown, brash young Rozz Morehead, hip Susan Mosher, elegant  Michele Pawk and big-voiced and big-hearted Avery Sommers. Each is distinct,  talented and unstereotyped.  </P> <P> At about two hours with an intermission, the performers riff through "Alice,"  moving with ease from the wistful ("At My Age," wherein an inexperienced  18-year-old and a widow-of-a-certain-age share counterpoint tribulations about  the trials of blind dates) to the sly ("I Like the Boys," says Morehead in a  celebration of the gentler, kinder elements in the opposite sex), to the  out-and-out parodies of a kindergarten teacher-parent conference (Brown and  Pawk) and a macho all-female basketball team ("Good Sports").  </P> <P> The Act One finale, "Bluer Than You," is an artful lesson in how to top the  other person at feeling sorry for yourself ("My man called me such terrible  names . . ." -- "Your Man speaks to you?" or "When I get up in the morning . .  . " -- "You can get up in the morning?").  </P> <P> It goes on like this, with the second half serving up more of the same and  hitting such familiar locales as a male strip joint ("Pretty Young Men") and  the inevitable psychiatric clinic ("Honeypot," raised a couple of notches by  Sommers' joyously sexual performance). Along the way we go through the  seemingly unrelated but amusing vamping of a German-born French chanteuse  (Pawk) and Morehead's rousing declaration of independence when she tells her  decamping boy-friend that parting as enemies beats the dickens out of parting  as friends.  </P> <P> A delectable leitmotif that repeats throughout the evening is the reading of  poems by Brown "from my collection, 'For Women Only.' " The poems change, but  their hilarious awfulness doesn't.  </P> <P> Cliff Faulkner has designed a simple platform set, simply lit by John B.  Forbes. But "Alice" is not about settings or costumes (by Shigeru Yaji). It is  about lampooning at its merriest and mildest.  </P> <P> "Alice" lacks the outrage satire requires. And even though the show is only six  years old, its targets are beginning to feel worn. They were predictable to  start with and have since been hit by others. What this production has going  for it chiefly is quality -- in the performers and in the distinction of the  individual sketches.  </P> <P> In this sense, "Alice" is everything that the long-running "Six Women With  Brain Death or Expiring Minds Want to Know" aspires to be but isn't. You can't  rise much above written material any more than you can sink too far below it.  Saturday night's spontaneous ovation for "Alice" partially at least attests to  that. A final word of commendation: Musicians James Raitt and Gary Scott are  terrific.  </P> <P>  At the Cassius Carter Centre Stage, Simon Edison Centre for the Performing  Arts in Balboa Park, Tuesdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays 7 p.m., with  matinees Saturdays and Sundays at 2. Until June 11. Tickets: $20.50-27.50;  (619) 239-2255.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> After months of grieving for his dead companion, Laguna Beach Mayor Robert  Gentry conquered his worst fears and picked up the phone to get the results of  his AIDS blood test. He tested negative for the virus that causes the incurable  disease. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome took the life of Gentry's 15-year  companion, Gary Burdick, on Jan. 23. "I don't know if anyone knows what it's  like to even consider testing after you've just buried someone who you have  cared for and nurtured for 15 years," Gentry said. Gentry is the only openly  homosexual public official to be elected in Orange County.  </P></p>

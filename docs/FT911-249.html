			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Brooke in crucial Belfast meeting MR PETER Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, will today try to rescue from near collapse his plans for round-table talks on the province's future at what could prove a 'make or break' meeting in Belfast. Unionist and nationalist leaders are expected to be presented with alternative suggestions for the venue of negotiations involving the Irish government. If agreement cannot be reached, Mr Brooke will have to decide whether it is worth continuing the talks. Mr Brooke is believed to have discussed possible fall-back positions with Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, at a four-hour meeting in London on Friday. He has taken gambles before in his talks initiative; successfully bringing Northern Ireland's constitutional parties together with a 'take it or leave it' offer before Easter. This time, the Northern Ireland Office appears to be hoping that, after a weekend of reflection by the parties involved and the threat of an embarrassingly early collapse of the talks, there will be sufficient movement today for a compromise to be reached. But Mr Brooke knows there will seem little point in continuing to debate a logistical detail indefinitely. Failure to reach a compromise on this issue suggests the goodwill believed to exist before talks started had been exaggerated vastly. Already two weeks have passed, out of the 11 set aside for round-table talks. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, leaders of the Unionist parties, again insisted at the weekend that they would not hold talks with Dublin ministers anywhere in Ireland while the Republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland remained. The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party believes that meetings should rotate between London, Dublin and Belfast. Constructing defences, Page 9</p>

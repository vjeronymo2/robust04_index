			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHILD ABUSE BATTERS INVESTIGATORS AS WELL AS VICTIMS  </P> <P> The faces of child abuse victims, often bruised and bloodied, leave a lasting  impression. These are children, after all, virtually helpless against adults --  most often their own parents or guardians -- who for whatever reason commit  violence against them.  </P> <P> Recently, two local cases have brought new attention to the problem of child  abuse. In January, San Diego police arrested Henri Mathis Dyson and her son,  Harold Alexander Dyson, after reports that children were being abused at their  foster home in Mira Mesa.  </P> <P> Police learned of the case when an infant under the care of the Dysons -- who  have pleaded innocent -- was taken, near death, to a local hospital.  </P> <P> Just this week, photographs of twin boys, age 2 -- the county's latest known  victims -- were shown on television in an effort to apprehend whoever abandoned  them in a Del Mar hotel.  </P> <P> Mary Stables, a San Diego County sheriff's deputy, said the boys suffered "deep  bruises from hand imprints on their faces like they were shoved, cuts on their  necks and cigarette burns on their stomachs and sides." She said both boys had  been sexually abused.  </P> <P> If such stories and pictures are horrifying to the average person, to parents  who can't fathom such crimes happening to any child, much less their own, what  about the people who investigate and treat abuse cases? How do they deal with  the rage and grief that such cases breed?  </P> <P> "I go home each night and say, 'Wow, this case tops all the others,' " said  Versie Auzenne, 34, a registered nurse who has worked five years in the Center  for Child Protection at Children's Hospital. "But there's always another one to  top that one. They seem to get worse instead of better. . . . And they just  keep coming."  </P> <P> "The most difficult cases you deal with are the deaths," said Dan Dennis, who  investigates child abuse cases as a detective for the San Diego Police  Department. "There's a lot of stress, a lot of hidden stress that creeps up on  you later, in dreams and so forth. Your mind's set on the investigation, going  50 directions at once, making sure everything's right.  </P> <P> "You get away from it for a while, all of a sudden you think you're relaxing,  and then you just feel . . . real tired. Brain drain has set in. It's hard to  get up and do it again."  </P> <P> Rick Carlson, who works with Dennis in the same unit, said most police officers  working the child abuse beat can do it for two years -- no more.  </P> <P> "It's two to three years max," he said. "Me, I've been in it for a little over  a year, and I'll work in it another year or so, but no more. After a while,  you're like a sponge. You're saturated. With each new case,  </P> <P> you say to yourself, 'OK, I've had enough. I don't care to see another hurt  kid.' But somehow you summon the motivation to do one more."  </P> <P> Carlson said most of the children he sees are 3 to 8 years old and that burn  victims upset him the most.  </P> <P> "The worst are the ones where a child has been submerged in hot water as  punishment," he said. "It's hard to believe anyone would do that to a child.  Most of the people who work in this (14-detective) unit are parents. These  cases always stimulate your emotions."  </P> <P> Carlson said the job is so tough that at times investigators walk out of  interviews between social workers and victims when the talk gets too rough.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Giving 'Yourself a Breather'  </P> <P> "A detective sitting in on the interview will just lay down his pen and walk  out," Carlson said. "He'll say, 'I'm sorry, I can't take it anymore.' And  that's good. You just have to give yourself a breather sometimes."  </P> <P> Carlson and Dennis recently spent 2 1/2 months investigating allegations of  abuse at the Dysons' Mira Mesa care home for foster children. Police believe  that as many as 5 dozen children may have been tortured at the home since the  granting of its license six years ago.  </P> <P> Victims, from 17 months to 12 years old, told police they feared for their  lives when they were tied to a kitchen post and beaten. They claimed to have  been made to sleep on a cold garage floor and inside a bathtub.  </P> <P> Dennis said he's improved as a listener, especially when a kid is the talker.  Nowadays, he said, it's important not only to gauge the needs of a child but  also to ferret out the truth about abuse. He said some of the accused are  innocent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'You Really Have to Listen'  </P> <P> "You really have to listen to what these kids are saying," he said. "We had a  case the other day where a boy came to school with a black eye. He told the  nurse his father got mad at him and slugged him. Well, we found out that wasn't  the truth at all. His older brother threw a toy at him. The dad was a good dad,  no wrongdoing."  </P> <P> Often, though, abuse is present and the consequences are grim.  </P> <P> Dr. David Chadwick has seen plenty of wrongdoing. "I saw a kid last night," he  said, "who will almost certainly die -- from deliberate asphyxiation."  </P> <P> Chadwick is chief medical administrator at the Center for Child Protection at  Children's Hospital, a pediatric specialist who has dealt with abuse cases for  25 years. He said the difficulty of his job comes not just in the "pain" and  "outrage" inherent with the territory but with frustrations over the justice  system, the very machinery aimed at stopping the abuse.  </P> <P> "A lot of the social workers out on the front lines investigating these cases  are music majors, rookies -- a lot of 'em say, 'Well, it was my first case.'  There shouldn't be a 'first case' for work of this nature," Chadwick said. "We  see abused kids coming back here a second and third time. That shouldn't be.  The amazing thing is, the Department of Social Services in San Diego County is  better than 90% of the agencies in the country, and it's not very good. This is  the stuff that drives me crazy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aware of Burnout Rate  </P> <P> Chadwick is aware of the burnout rate among law-enforcement officers and said  that isn't the case at the hospital.  </P> <P> "Law enforcement doesn't place a high priority on child abuse work as a career  objective," he said. "Burglary and homicide are the high-prestige beats, and  that frustrates me too. The San Diego police was one of the first departments  in the country to create a special unit. The sheriff (John Duffy) had a good  unit, but he dissolved it last January. We're pretty mad at him about that,  needless to say.  </P> <P> "Everybody suffers in this system," Chadwick said. "If the head of the  Department of Social Services went to the County Board of Supervisors and said,  'I need 50% more funding; I need to stabilize the office,' do you know what  would happen? Next year, he wouldn't be the head of the department."  </P> <P> Nurse Versie and Chadwick said the emotional frustrations of child abuse cases  are, at times, monumental. So, they let themselves cry if they have to.  </P> <P> "It's not cool for a cop to cry," Chadwick said, "and that's too bad."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deciding What to Do  </P> <P> Irene Becker is a social worker who supervises the child abuse hot line  (560-2191) for Child Protective Services, a division of the county Department  of Social Services.  </P> <P> "For me, one of the toughest things is deciding at the moment of the call what  I should do," she said. "Do I send a social worker out right away? Do I wait a  while, a few days? Do I send them out at all? Depending on what I do, a little  life may hang in the balance. The iffy cases, the gray cases are the toughest  for me. The clear-cut cases are by far the easiest."  </P> <P> Becker said media coverage has intensified public awareness of the issue. It  has also magnified her caseload and made life harder.  </P> <P> "The hardest part of our job is dealing with the numbers -- the overwhelming  number of people calling in," she said. "The most discouraging aspect is the  incredible rise in referrals over the nine years I've been here. There doesn't  seem to be any end in sight."  </P> <P> Becker's 25-person staff fielded 57,665 "referrals" -- calls into the hot line  -- in 1987. The number soared to 67,223 last year and will undoubtedly rise  this year, she said.  </P> <P> "We average about 5,500 calls a month," she said.  </P> <P> The calls come from schools, hospitals, doctors, nurses, dentists,  optometrists, day-care providers, relatives, neighbors -- anyone concerned  about a specific case to the point of reporting it, even if they can't be sure  of criminal wrongdoing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concerned About Numbers  </P> <P> Chadwick is also concerned about numbers. His center averages an outpatient  load of about 1,500 children a year. In 1986, he saw 100 kids on an inpatient  basis. Last year, the number tripled. He said about 20 kids a year die at the  hospital from injuries linked to child abuse.  </P> <P> Chadwick is also frustrated by lawyers, by the nation's adversarial system of  justice. At 62, he said he's tired of being an expert witness twice a month for  prosecutors hoping to convict someone of child abuse. He's frustrated that they  don't succeed more often.  </P> <P> He said he is also frustrated -- and saddened -- by changes in society. He said  the "loss of the extended family in American life" has probably contributed to  the problem.  </P> <P> "Maybe your mother-in-law drives you crazy," he said. "But, if a mother-in-law  is there, in the house, chances are you're not going to beat the kid. The more  we have people in private, isolated situations, the more likely we'll have  abuse. I don't see it going away anytime soon."  </P></p>

This programme of action, together with the theses of the  party's detailed programme, was submitted on Tuesday for the  consideration of a plenary meeting of the Communist Party's  Central Executive Committee. Addressing the meeting with a  report, party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov noted that all the  previous hypothetical programmes just described the communists'  intentions in case of their coming to power. In contrast to  them, now the party should develop a plan of concrete actions.  "We are to formulate our tasks exactly as an opposition force",  Zyuganov added.    The communist leader expounded on the principal ideas to  form  the basis of the proposed programme of action. Remaining in  opposition to the political and economic course followed by the  Russian president and government, the Communist Party plans to  make its contribution to the process of achieving civic peace  and accord. However, Zyuganov said, civic peace does not mean  universal fraternization. Struggle between various social  trends is inevitable, but it should not destroy the state, he  stressed. To prevent this, a broad coalition should be formed.  "The political spectrum of such a coalition may prove quite  extensive and range from communists and socialists through  nationalist patriotic movements to centrists and true  democrats", the leader specified.    Zyuganov recalled the conditions that the parliament's  communist faction considers necessary to achieve civic peace.  They provide for an immediate turnabout on the current social  and economic line, formation of "a government of national  confidence resting on parliamentary majority" (which "calls for  removal from the government of such people as Kozyrev, Chubays  and others"), immediate payoff of debts to peasants and of  delayed wages to workers, urgent measures to fight corruption  and organized crime, as well as "restoration of a renewed union  state on a voluntary basis at Russia's initiative".    According to the communist leader, the strategic goal at the  current stage is to expand the opposition footing, to build on  this basis a large-scale bloc of forces and to push it to power  by parliamentary means. Early presidential elections (without  Boris Yeltsin's participation) would be the best variant,  Zyuganov believes.    The party leader expressed regret over increasing political  inertness in Russia and urged party members to prepare "quietly  and pragmatically" for a new upsurge in social activities. The  Communist Party's primary organizations, whose age and social  composition "is not in line with the spirit of the times",  should work for "rejuvenation of the party" and "stop stewing in  their own juice". Zyuganov called to put into practice "the  small steps theory": to set up standing election committees, to  participate in public organizations, above all in trade-unions,  to step up propaganda activities and so forth.    The short-term programme of action is expected to be adopted  at the Communist Party's conference in April, while the detailed  strategic programme is to be passed at the 3rd party congress  scheduled for this autumn.</p>

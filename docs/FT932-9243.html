			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SE Banken wins UK insurance foothold with Interlife buy SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, plans to take its first step into the UK insurance market through the purchase of Interlife Assurance, an Essex-based life insurance company. The Swedish bank, which is carrying out the deal through its SE-Banken Forsakring insurance unit, wants access to the British company's licence so that it can offer Swedish customers international alternatives to domestic unit linked insurance schemes. Interlife had 1992 premium income of Pounds 4.4m with funds under management totalling some Pounds 11.5m. The operation is being sold by a group of European insurance companies comprising Aachen Re of Germany, Trygg-Hansa SPP of Sweden and Interamerican of Greece. SE-Banken said finalisation of the deal was subject to the settlement of a legal dispute between Interlife and Lautro, the regulatory authority. SE-Banken Forsakring generated SKr600m (Pounds 53m) in premium volume from new sales in the first quarter of 1993; its assets total SKr3.6bn.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles published in Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 7 and  8 February in connection with the revision in U.S. strategy for  defending the ROK that was reported by THE NEW YORK TIMES on 6  February.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO on 7 February carries on page  1,  a 300-word report by reporter Kim Sung-yong from New York on a  new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK.    Under the headlines, "To Seize Pyongyang if North Korea  Invades South Korea" and "THE NEW YORK TIMES Reports Change in  U.S. strategy in ROK Defense," the report quotes the U.S.  newspaper as reporting on 6 February that "the United States  recently amended its strategy on defending the ROK in order to  cope with possible changes in the situation on the Korean  peninsula, such as North Korea's recent moves for nuclear  development." The report also quotes the U.S. paper as  reporting that the new strategy was initiated by the former  Commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea and supplemented by Gary  Luck, the present Commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea.    Both the moderate HANGUK ILBO and the moderate TONG-A ILBO  of  7 February carry 300-word reports respectively by New York-based  correspondent Kim Su-chong and reporter Kim Cha-ung in New York  on the front page regarding the new U.S. strategy for defending  the ROK. The reports cite THE NEW YORK TIMES as reporting that  if North Korea attacks South Korea, the United States even has  plans to seize Pyongyang and overthrow the Kim Il-song regime.  They also note that the U.S. daily is concerned over North  Korea's concentration of its conventional armed forces and  weapons near the DMZ.    On page 5, the moderate TONG-A ILBO carries a 2,500-word  "gist" of the contents of the new U.S. plan for defending the  ROK. Under the headlines, "A Plan For Advance Beyond Pyongyang  Yet To Be Determined," "North Korea Increases Artillery  Positions Around Yongbyon Nuclear Site 10 Times," and "Five U.S.  Radar Systems Now Under Operation," the gist includes two parts.  Under the subhead of "North Korea's Strategy for a Southward  Invasion and Its Military Strength," the first part describes  the gist of the content of North Korea's strategy for invading  South Korea and its military capability, while noting its recent  preparations for a southward invasion, including the possible  infiltration of its special commandos into the rear area of the  ROK and U.S. forces, the deployment of more antiaircraft  artillery units in Yongbyon area, and the troop concentration  near the DMZ.    Under the subhead of "Plan For Defending The ROK" the second  part describes the gist of the contents of plans for various  joint operations between the ROK and U.S. forces, to repel North  Korea's invasion.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on 7 February carries on its  front page a brief 200-word article by New York-based  correspondent Pak Su-man on the new U.S. strategy for defending  the ROK and follows it up with a 900-word analysis of this  development by the same reporter on page 4 under the headline of  "From Whence Did the New U.S. Defense Strategy Emerge?" Noting  recent reports of U.S. plans to deploy Patriot missiles and  Apache helicopters to South Korea and to send an aircraft  carrier to Korean waters, as well as the moves to refer the  North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, the  article says that the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK  reflects the recent stance of the hard line group in the United  States toward the North Korean nuclear issue.    Expressing concern that the U.S. strategy for "seizing  Pyongyang" will aggravate Pyongyang, the article stresses that  the strategy can be viewed as a sort of pressure on North Korea  in connection with the North Korean nuclear issue.    Noting North Korea's possession of various types of  missiles,  including the Nodong-1 long-range missiles; its development of  the Nodong-2 missile; and the recent reports on concentration of  North Korean troops and huge amounts of various types of  artillery guns near the DMZ, the article concludes that "even if  North Korea accepts nuclear inspections, the Korean peninsula  will still remain a dangerous region as long as these North  Korean moves continue."    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN on 7 February publishes on  page 1 a 140-word report by Washington-based correspondent Chong  Yon-chu on the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK under the  headlines: "The United States Has Established a Plan to `Seize  Pyongyang in Case North Korea Invades the South'" and "THE NEW  YORK TIMES Reports The United States is Stepping Up Its  Strengthing of U.S. Forces in South Korea and Deployment of the  Latest Weapons." The report briefly quotes THE NEW YORK TIMES  report on the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on 8 February publishes on  page 4 a 900-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi  Kyong-hyon analyzing the new U.S. strategy for defending the  ROK. The article notes the order by the U.S. Department of  Defense to U.S. reservists to be ready for participation in the  Team Spirit exercise, reporting that "this is an ultimatum  calling for North Korea to clarify if it will accept nuclear  inspections." The article notes that such stern countermeasures  against North Korea have two meanings: One is that the stern  countermeasures are a kind of procedure for the U.S. Government  to take in case negotiations with North Korea on the nuclear  issue fall through -- realizing it has become difficult to  expect a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue -- and the other  is that they are a demonstration to threaten North Korea to  accept nuclear inspections.    Regarding the 6 February THE NEW YORK TIMES report on the  new  U.S. strategy for defending the ROK, the article notes that the  strategy is also another means to apply pressure on the North  Korean leadership in connection with the nuclear issue, adding  that "in view of such a recent U.S. hard-line attitude we cannot  rule out a possibility that the International Atomic Energy  Agency, IAEA, and North Korea will continue negotiations on  nuclear inspections."    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on 8 February publishes on  page 3 a 800-word editorial entitled "Washington's Hard-line  Atmosphere Toward North Korea." The editorial notes the growing  tension on the Korean peninsula, including North Korea's  increasing military threat following the U.S. announcement of a  plan to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea, the resumption  of the Team Spirit exercise in case North Korea continues to  refuse nuclear inspections, and THE NEW YORK TIMES report on a  new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK in which "seizure of  Pyongyang" is mentioned. In conclusion, the editorial urges  North Korea not to sever dialogue with the IAEA on nuclear  inspections.</p>

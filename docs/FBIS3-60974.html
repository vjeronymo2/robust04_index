			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Salih Ceviker] </F>   [Excerpts] Frankfurt -- It has been learned that Alparslan  Turkes, leader of MHP [Nationalist Movement Party], met with the  national taekwondo team member Kenan Aygun -- whom the  Counterguerrilla uses to commit assassinations -- in Frankfurt  on 25 December, last Saturday. It is being claimed that Turkes  asked Aygun to carry out assignments to be given by MHP's  organization abroad. [passage omitted]    The [north] Cyprus press had carried reports to the effect  that Aygun, who met Turkes at the Frankfurt headquarters of the  Turkish Federation last Saturday, was working in affiliation  with the [northern] Cyprus's Taekwondo Federation, which is  under Counterguerrilla control, and that he was involved in  various murders and stabbings.    Aygun had told the newspaper KIBRIS, owned by Asil Nadir,  that the Directorate of [north] Cyprus Civilian Affairs  Department, which is known to be the headquarters of the  Counterguerrilla in Cyprus, had asked him to abduct a Turkish  officer held in prison on the Greek Cypriot side.    YENIDUZEN quoted Aygun, who is reportedly a member of the  inner circle of Nadir's bodyguards, as saying that MIT [Turkish  Intelligence Organization] interfered in the 1991 elections in  northern Cyprus and that the Commander of the Cyprus Peace  Forces General Ali Yalcin had sent a threatening letter to the  leftist [Turkish] Cypriots asking them to support the National  Unity Party.    It was learned that Aygun, who was expelled from Cyprus, was  beaten up and gravely injured in Germany for his revelations.  It was reported that the attack took place in Frankfurt's  Galluswarte quarter on 6 October 1992. It was learned that  Aygun, who was hit on the head with an iron bar and sustained  knife wounds to his forehead and abdomen, was taken to hospital  by police. Noting that the attackers also searched Aygun's  home, the police officers said that the attack was designed not  to kill him but warn him.</p>

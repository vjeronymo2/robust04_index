			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / South Korea growth slows South Korea's gross national product growth rate slowed down in the third quarter to 7.5 per cent because of a summer drought that affected agriculture, the central bank said yesterday. Economic growth has gradually declined from 8.9 per cent in the first quarter and 7.8 per cent in the second. The economy has expanded by 8 per cent during the first nine months of 1994. But the third quarter posted the biggest jump in industrial investments, at 23.4 per cent, since the beginning of 1988. Companies are expanding production facilities to meet an export boom caused by the weak Korean currency. Private consumption rose by 7.6 per cent during the third quarter, raising concerns of growing inflationary pressure. Inflation is now hovering just below the government's target of 6 per cent for this year.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (7): Overseas markets remain crucial - In spite of a recovery on home ground, Andrew Baxter finds that the proportion of sales going abroad must remain high if manufacturers are to maintain their pole position in the industry / UK construction equipment The UK is one of Europe's most important centres for the manufacture of construction equipment, and exports have been a vital element in achieving and maintaining that position. Whether British or foreign-owned, equipment manufacturers usually export 50-80 per cent of their products, although the percentage varies depending on the companies, the product lines and the state of the UK market. The traditional boom-and-bust cycle in the UK construction industry means that in a recession as deep and long as the most recent one, the percentage of sales going to the home market will inevitably fall. The importance of strong positions in as many export markets as possible cannot, therefore, be overstated. With domestic market conditions recovering strongly from the trough of recession, and some continental markets still flat, the proportion of sales going to export markets could fall back for some companies - but not by much. This is because of the strength of markets such as the US - which recovered from recession a year earlier than the UK - and continuing growth in markets, such as those in south-east Asia, which have been immune to recession. Statistics from the London-based Corporate Intelligence Group's off-highway research division emphasise the importance of exports - whatever the conditions in the home market. Last year, it says, 16,070 backhoe loaders were produced in the UK. Of these just 2,667 were sold in the domestic market. As for mini-excavators, UK factories produced 2,954, of which 643 were sold in the UK. In the smaller, more specialist category of asphalt finishers for roadmaking, just 25 of the 220 units produced in the UK were also sold there. The effects of the UK construction industry recession are illustrated by statistics for rough-terrain lift trucks. In 1991, just 850 of the 3,250 UK-produced units were sold in the UK. Two years later, 2,103 of the 3,795 units manufactured in the UK went to the domestic market. At J. C. Bamford, the largest UK-owned construction equipment producer, overseas sales have hovered between Pounds 233.5m and Pounds 271.9m in the past five years. UK sales, meanwhile, have been much more volatile, ranging between Pounds 149.4m and Pounds 78.8m over the same period. JCB's direct exports were up nearly 40 per cent in the first five months of this year, compared with the same period of 1993. Exports to North America have more than doubled, while those to continental Europe  - viewed by JCB as its 'home market' - rose by 25 per cent as markets emerged from recession. A long-term growth prospect for JCB, meanwhile, is the Asia Pacific region, which accounts for 6 per cent of exports. Sales in the first five months soared by 64 per cent. At Fermec, the Manchester-based producer better known by its MF Industrial brand, exports represent more than 80 per cent of its business. In the first five months of this year, exports to North America have risen more than 400 per cent while sales to the rest of the world beyond Europe - mainly Australia, Thailand and Israel - have more than doubled. Fermec attributes the success to its new range of backhoe loaders and, in North America, to a new supply agreement with Kobelco America, the Japanese-owned distribution company. Foreign-owned producers are also heavy exporters from their UK plants. Caterpillar UK, the British part of the world's biggest construction equipment producer, had sales of Pounds 235.4m in the period from December 1992 to November 1993. Of this, Pounds 28.8m derived from the UK, Pounds 66.2m from continental Europe, Pounds 89.2m from the US and Pounds 51.2m from elsewhere. Komatsu, the world's second biggest producer, has its European factory for hydraulic excavators at Birtley near Newcastle. Of nearly 1,200 units produced last year, 272 went to the UK market, but that was dwarfed by the 615 units which went to Germany. Further north, the Scottish contribution to the exports picture should not be ignored. Lanarkshire-based Atlas Hydraulic Loaders says that more than 52 per cent of its 1993 sales were exports, the bulk going to the continent and Germany in particular. Excluding exceptional sales to eastern Germany in the first six months of last year, this year's exports by Atlas, part of Germany's Atlas Weyhausen, are ahead of 1993's. Exports to France are up 220 per cent, to the Netherlands up 50 per cent, to Australia up 50 per cent and to Chile up 67 per cent. Exports to the Gulf states have fallen considerably, but this is not an important market for Atlas. At Terex in Motherwell, at least 70 per cent of the dumptrucks, loaders, scrapers and other plant made by the US-owned company is exported. The plant, which was once at the periphery of Terex, is now its global centre for construction equipment. A supply agreement with O&amp;K in Germany accounts for a significant part of exports, but China is probably the plant's biggest market - because of equipment that is shipped complete and broken down kits which are supplied to a joint venture in China that assembles one of the Terex rigid dumptruck models.</p>

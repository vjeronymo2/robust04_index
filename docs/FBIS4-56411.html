			<p>BFN     [Text] Bridgetown, 2 May (PL) -- Today, Fernando Ramirez de  Estenoz, Cuban ambassador to the United Nations and first  foreign relations vice minister, begins heading a UN mission  before the World Conference of Small Island States meeting in  Barbados.    Ramirez de Estenoz told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba was selected  to preside over a special group, including Syria, Tunisia, and a  UN official, to negotiate in the name of the UN's decolonization  committee at the Bridgetown session. "It has to do with  consulations on a very important and delicate topic, dealing  with the colonial status of some member-countries of the  alliance of small island states," the diplomat said.    Of the 41 members of the alliance, known as AOSIS, nearly  one-fifth still maintain a colonial status. In the Caribbean,  French overseas territories (Martinique and Guadeloupe),  Montserrat, Anguila, Bermuda, Turks and Caicos, and the Virgin  Islands have not yet gained independence.    One of the problems that makes the UN decolonization  committee's work difficult is that in most of these territories,  under colonial tutelage economic development prospects, future  independence is unfavorable in the current international  situation.    In Anguila and Bermuda, several plebiscites have resulted in  majority votes against independence because the population  considers survival in these small states unlikely without  financial backing.</p>

Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG that even "our best friends" are saying it is high time  for German foreign policy to be "fully capable of acting."  After all, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], which  has been blocking the necessary constitutional change, also  speaks out for a permanent seat in the Security Council. But  this cannot be achieved, if Germany wants to play a special  role. The Social Democrats, on the other hand, are warning  Kinkel not to pay too high a price. The foreign minister "wants  to get into boots that are too big for him by all means," SPD  Manager Guenter Verheugen said. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping  wants to comment on the matter at the Military Defense Meeting  in Munich on Saturday [5 February].    Kinkel told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that the resolutions of the  U.S. Senate are in accord with what he hears from the  administration in Washington. A talk he had with UN Ambassador  Madeleine Albright has confirmed his impression that the Clinton  administration is in favor of Germany holding a permanent seat  in the UN Security Council, but that it expects Germany to be  fully capable of acting. London and Paris have changed over to  those in favor under similar conditions, he said.    "We want to be in the Security Council," Kinkel said, but  "not with foam at the mouth." This is, of course, only possible  if there is an overall extension, which includes the Third  World, he said. Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, with whom  he had just talked, does not see this any differently, he said.  Germany only has a chance to get a permanent seat if "it fully  stands by its duties."    Kinkel said it is unfortunate that the SPD chairman, who  realizes that the Bundeswehr has to take on a new role, was not  able to get his way at the party conference. He said he is  calling upon the SPD to end its "blockade." Otherwise, the only  hope that remains is the Federal Constitutional Court.    In resolutions that were obviously aiming at the German  discussion, the U.S. Senate twice called on Germany recently to  participate "fully" in UN military missions. Republican  senators said that if Bonn and Tokyo wanted to get onto the  Security Council, they must become aware of the link between  global power and responsibility. Many Germans do not seem to  have realized that rights are always linked to duties.    In the opinion of SPD Manager Guenter Verheugen, Kinkel's  "very brisk approach" meets with international criticism rather  than serious support. He said he thinks that the envisaged  reforms of the Security Council will get stuck "in the masses of  unsolved problems." The fact that Washington links Bonn's  application to expectations "that we cannot and do not want to  fulfill," is an additional aggravating factor. If the ticket to  the Security Council has to be paid for with the willingness to  "take part in an un-German, selective practice of interventions"  by military means, the price is too high. According to  Verheugen, a "somewhat more cautious approach" is necessary.</p>

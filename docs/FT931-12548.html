			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Hurd hits at US over UN council: Ally rapped for dues delay MR Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, hit at US calls for reform of the UN Security Council yesterday, saying: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' For good measure, he also rapped Britain's ally over the knuckles for not paying its UN dues. Stressing that Britain had 3,700 troops on UN service, in six different operations, Mr Hurd added pointedly: 'We pay our bills on time (whereas) others who carry a heavy burden of international responsibility do not'. He was sure 'the new US administration will find a remedy for past delays'. Mr Hurd, addressing the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, avoided any direct criticism of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who had said this week that it was 'time for some reorganisation of the UN', including permanent membership of the Security Council for Germany and Japan. Pointing out that Mr Christopher had also acknowledged 'the complexity of that decision', Mr Hurd added: 'You can say that again'. Such a change, he said, would require amendment of the UN Charter and therefore a wide degree of consensus. 'It can't be solved simply by adding Germany and Japan.' Candidates for permanent membership would be very numerous, and the outcome would be 'hard to predict and slow to reach'. Meanwhile, 'the Security Council has to get on with its job'. Mr Hurd also complimented France, a fellow permanent member whose position, like Britain's, might be challenged in any reform. Pointing out that France had more than 6,000 troops on UN service, many of them alongside British soldiers, he remarked: 'In this new world, the interests of Britain and France are increasingly similar and intertwined'. The foreign secretary's main theme, in a wide-ranging address, was that an international effort, 'comparable to those of 1815, 1919 and the years after 1945', was needed 'to avert a continuing slide into disorder', and that Britain wished to play 'a worthy part'. But he stressed that British troops in the former Yugoslavia had 'a humanitarian not an enforcing role', arguing that 'no democracy could justify to its people' the forces and risks that would be required to 'impose and guarantee order' there. Mr Hurd reiterated British support for the Geneva conference on Yugoslavia.</p>

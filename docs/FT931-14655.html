			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Property: Moments of madness bring in the money - England's follies are now highly prized for their individuality and spectacular siting the ultimate status symbol; but the follies of the 18th and 19th century have now become an integral part of the British landscape. Some regard them as vulgar ostentation, but Gwyn Headley believes them to be the 'manifestations of architectural individuality that made this country the cynosure of the world'. Headley is so convinced of the appeal of follies that he and three partners have launched Pavilions of Splendour, an estate agency specialising in unusual buildings. Prices, in keeping with the general theme, are quoted in guineas. The follies on offer cost between one guinea and 1m guineas. Most follies were expensive jokes with no utility other than as somewhere to store the croquet sticks or shelter from the rain. Now, however, those that survive are much sought after as unusual homes, built as many are in prime scenic locations. Take, for instance, Sway Tower, to the south of the New Forest. Headley believes it is 'the greatest pure folly tower in Britain' - joint agent Fox &amp; Sons describes it as one of the most remarkable buildings in England. The tower, started in 1879, took Andrew Thomas Peterson six years to complete; from the belvedere on the 218ft summit, there are breathtaking views as far as the Isle of Wight and Salisbury cathedral. The present owner, Paul Atlas, said: 'Peterson was an eccentric judge who returned from Calcutta determined to prove that it was possible to build a tower without reinforced concrete.' No scaffolding was used by the 40 labourers working on the job. Atlas bought the cottage in the shadow of the tower in 1973; he bought the tower later and poured all the family's energy and cash into its restoration after the 1987 gales. In June last year, it opened as one of Britain's most unusual hotels, with just four bedroom suites housed in the tower with its 330 steps. There is an indoor swimming pool, a floodlit tennis court and other outbuildings, including a snooker house. Together with the cottage, Sway Tower can be bought for one million guineas. Another folly on the agency's list is Hadlow Tower, soaring 170ft above Tonbridge, Kent. The grade-one listed, octagonal tower was built in 1838 as an addition to Hadlow Castle, built by William Barton May in the late 18th century and known as May's Folly. The current owner, Michael Kiesser, is looking for a partner to buy a half-share in the folly for about 700,000 guineas, to establish some form of leisure enterprise. Pavilions of Splendour has some decidedly unsplendid temptations as well; there is, for instance, Deepings Lodge, in Deene Park, Corby, Northamptonshire, which could be your home for just one guinea. The snag is that the guinea buys a 21-year full repairing lease, and there is a lot of repairing to be done on the little 19th century stone lodge, plus the provision of main services. After many years as a hospital, Craig-y-Nos Castle, in Abercraf, Powys, has been restored to the sort of elegance furnished by soprano Adelina Patti, who bought it in 1878. Patti built a scale replica of Bayreuth State Opera House, plus aviary, conservatory, winter gardens, chapel and many other rooms. Although much of the restoration is complete, there is potential for developing the remainder of the castle. This means the 550,000 guineas price guide could be just a start, but there is already a monthly turnover of about Pounds 30,000 from functions and musical events. But is it fair to describe builders of what we call follies as eccentric? 'My great-aunt Jessie would have said that her amphitheatre and temple of the winds were two of life's essentials,' said John Blake, who inherited Clovers, in Tenby, from the old woman. Jessie Allen lost her fiance in the first world war and threw herself into a drama teaching career at Cheltenham College and at her Welsh clifftop home. Many a budding thespian had a first taste of Shakespeare in the amphitheatre. Jessie's Indian-style bungalow has now been replaced with a five-bedroom, single-storey home, with distant views of Lundy and Caldy Island and the Devon coast. There are five acres of land sloping down to private, sandy beaches. The amphitheatre, with tiered seats cut into the ground, has a raised stone stage. Nearby is the temple, built by Royal Academician Alan Strawbridge; it once had glass wind chimes suspended from its domed cupola. The house, land and follies are offered for 250,000 guineas. Knight, Frank and Rutley has had a good year for Shropshire follies. After agreeing terms for two of the four follies at Weston Park, the firm now offers Sham Castle in Acton Burnell, Shropshire. Built in the 1780s as a music room for the Bruce Smythe family who owned the surrounding estate, the folly was restored in the 1980s and is now a comfortable home with remarkable views. The hexagonal first-floor drawing room and its intricate plaster-work ceiling is especially beautiful. The agent eschews guineas, asking Pounds 185,000 for a 90-year lease. Among a number of follies on the market is a little castle and a stone boat house on the Didlington Hall Estate, Norfolk; but Savills says a buyer will have to take on the 460-acres of lakes and farm and all the buildings as well. The original mansion was demolished in 1950 so this could be one of the best building 'plots' in the land. Savills also moves with the times, giving the guide price in pounds - Pounds 850,000. Likewise with Hamptons, which suggests Pounds 200,000 for the octagonal gazebo in the gardens of the original Richmond Palace, by the Thames. The beautiful folly, dating from the early 18th century, has been meticulously converted into a little home; among the features are arrow-slit windows, now filled with stained glass salvaged from a nearby church.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yoichi Nishimura] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- Russia has decided to tighten law  enforcement against poaching boats in the Sea of Okhotsk and  other waters off the Far East, including the northern  territories [Kuril Islands], starting on 20 April.    The crackdown is code named the "Fishing Season '94"  operation, and it involves mobilization of the Border Patrol,  local government authorities in the Far East, Russian Navy's  Pacific Fleet, and even reconnaissance satellites. Several  Japanese fishing boats have recently been captured in waters off  the northern territories, and the Russian crackdown is obviously  targeting these Japanese fishermen.    On 19 April, Border Patrol Commander Nikolayev stated as  follows in Kamchatka: "As an economic major power, Russia has  to protect its own economic interests. Our neighbors should not  forget about it. Russia intends to establish `civilized' border  lines -- this means the border exists to secure national  interests."    The crackdown on poachers will be continued until October.</p>

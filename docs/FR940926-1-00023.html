			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> (b) How dealers not resident in the State obtain certification for ginseng roots harvested in that State and how this type of commerce is controlled by State law;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Ginseng law enforcement procedures, violations discovered, and remedies; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) A sample of the current-year State certificate of legal take and origin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program for Cultivated Ginseng  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 21, 1980 (45 FR 68944), the Service announced that it would approve export of cultivated ginseng only from States for which the export of wild-collected ginseng was approved because those States had programs that could adequately document the source of the ginseng. On October 4, 1982 (47 FR 43701), the Service announced that it would approve export of cultivated ginseng from other States if procedures had been implemented to minimize the risk that wild-collected plants would be claimed as cultivated. The Service continues to consider granting such approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of North Dakota has applied to export cultivated ginseng, and the Service is proposing to approve such exports from this State. North Dakota is considered outside the native range of ginseng. The State of Michigan (which is within the native range of the species) was granted interim approval to export cultivated ginseng from the 1993 harvest. The State has been working with the Service to finalize procedures under a new State law and is planning on completing their submission requesting approval of their ginseng program prior to the publication of the final rule. The Service is considering the approval of such exports from this State. The Service's proposal to approve Michigan's program is dependent upon receiving the required information. The State of Maine (which is within the native range of the species) has passed legislation setting up a State program for cultivated ginseng and is working to complete their submission for export approval for cultivated ginseng only. The Service is considering the approval of such exports pending satisfactory completion of the application for export approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Export Approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 23, 1991 (56 FR 41806), the Service approved multiyear export of 1991&hyph;93 harvested ginseng only from States with a legally regulated ginseng program that provided for a State certification and inspection system and that satisfied the other criteria of the Management Authority and the Scientific Authority. The export of wild and cultivated ginseng harvested from 1991 through 1993 was approved only from the 19 States indicated in the Code of Federal Regulations [50 CFR 23.51(e)(1)]_see the 1991&hyph;1993 column in the table at the end of this document. Documents containing information that provided the basis for the Service's findings of legal take and origin are on file at the Office of Management Authority at the address given above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such export approval means that any ginseng legally harvested during those years from Service-approved State programs may be exported at any time when accompanied by appropriate State certification and valid Federal export documents granted by the U.S. Management Authority. For example, ginseng legally harvested in 1992 under a Service-approved State program may be exported in 1994 when accompanied by the 1992 State certificate of origin, a 1994 export document issued by the Management Authority, and an exporter's invoice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Multiyear Findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of monitoring State ginseng programs and the status of ginseng since 1977, the Service expects that States from which the export of ginseng has been approved will continue to satisfy CITES requirements and that continued export of ginseng from these States will not be detrimental to the survival of the species. Therefore, States previously approved for export of ginseng for the 1991&hyph;93 harvest seasons need not submit completely new applications for export program approval for the 1994&hyph;96 harvest seasons. However, in relation to both the set of criteria used by the Scientific Authority and the set used by the Management Authority, each State needs to reaffirm the validity of its existing program and to notify the Service of any modifications or changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This report with information on the 1993 harvest, reaffirmation of the ongoing State program, and any new program information should have been received by May 31, 1994, from all States from which ginseng export has been approved for the 1991&hyph;93 harvest years (see 56 FR 41806; August 23, 1991). The States of Iowa and Wisconsin have been notified of the Service's concerns over the lack of State certification for wild ginseng. Therefore, the Service is proposing to approve export of wild and cultivated ginseng from these two States for 1 year only. Findings allowing further export will be made based on compliance with Service requirements. The Service is proposing to find that the status of the species and State programs is such that the 1994&hyph;96 harvests of ginseng for export will not be detrimental to the survival of the species for 17 of the 19 States approved for the 1991&hyph;93 harvest seasons. In addition, the Service is proposing the approval of exports of cultivated ginseng from Maine and Michigan, pending receipt of required information, and from North Dakota, which is outside the species' native range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any States wishing to initiate export programs for ginseng should begin working with the Service early so that their finalized request for approval can be submitted by March 31 of the year in which the State anticipates certifying that season's ginseng for export.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service export approval is subject to revision prior to the 1995 and 1996 harvest seasons if a review of information reveals that Management Authority or Scientific Authority findings on any approved State may need to be changed. The Service proposes not to grant general approval for export of ginseng originating in any State not named in the 1994 codification of 50 CFR 23.51(e), for one or more of the following reasons: (1) The species does not occur there; (2) no harvest of the species is allowed by the State; or (3) the Service does not have current information needed for Management Authority and/or Scientific Authority findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that States for which ginseng export is approved by the Service maintain successful programs so that export is not detrimental to the survival of this species, the Service plans to annually review the export documents returned from U.S. Department of Agriculture ports and the information and data submitted by the States, including any unexplained changes in harvest levels and any other concerns presented in the State-submitted reports. Taking into account the State evaluations, the Service will continue to make an overall evaluation on the status of ginseng. Notices will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in 1995 and 1996 only if new information or changed conditions show reason for revised findings or guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Export Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Valid Federal CITES documents are necessary to export wild or cultivated ginseng roots, major root parts, or plants. Applications for these documents should be sent to the Office of Management Authority at the address given above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ginseng may only be exported through ports with personnel and/or facilities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA ports) that have been designated by the U.S. Department of the Interior (49 FR 49238, October 25, 1984; see 50 CFR 24.12). For each export, the exporter must present to the port inspector of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine (APHIS/PPQ), the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Ginseng roots or plants being exported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Original State certificates of origin for the ginseng (or foreign export documents for American ginseng imported into the United States). An exporter or dealer may split an original State certificate by striking a line through the original weight on the certificate and stating in numbers and words the new lower weight of ginseng to be exported. This change in weight must be certified by the dealer or exporter with the written words ``I made these changes on (date)'' followed by the full legal signature of the dealer or exporter. The modified State certificate of origin must bear this certified change in ink, in original form, and be readily legible or also given in printed style.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. One completed Federal CITES export document (permit or certificate) with two copies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. One copy of the exporter's executed invoice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The APHIS/PPQ port inspector may sign and validate the CITES documents only after a satisfactory inspection of the contents of the State certificate(s) of origin, the exporter's invoice, CITES export documentation, and the shipment. Once the CITES documents are validated, the inspector will forward the State certificates, one copy of the CITES export document, and the exporter's invoice to the Office of Management Authority for recordkeeping and reporting. The second copy of the Federal CITES export document goes to the exporter. The original CITES export document authorizes the international shipment of the ginseng and will be collected by the importing country for its recordkeeping and reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

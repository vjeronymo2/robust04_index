			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER NO. 44 COLLAPSED, DIED FIVE DAYS BEFORE GATHERS;  </P> <P> SPORTS MEDICINE: AMERICAN'S DEATH IN ENGLAND REAFFIRMS DILEMMA FACED BY DOCTORS  TREATING ATHLETES.  </P> <P> The circumstances were uncanny. They were 6-foot-7 basketball players. They  were 23 years old. They wore No. 44. They collapsed during games and died five  days apart.  </P> <P> Victims of heart problems.  </P> <P> Tony Penny, formerly a Central Connecticut State player, died Feb. 27 in a  Manchester, England, hospital after collapsing during a game.  </P> <P> But the similarities to the death of Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers don't end  there. Penny's death, too, exposes the pressures physicians face when caring  for athletes who want nothing more than to return to the games they love.  </P> <P> Dr. Milton J. Sands, a cardiologist at New Britain, Conn., General Hospital,  understands this dilemma.  </P> <P> He was sued for $1 million last May for disallowing Penny from playing in 1986.  Although Penny dropped the suit in December, Sands remains affected by the  incident.  </P> <P> "I never dreamed I would have been sued to protect a life," he said.  </P> <P> Sands said he empathizes with Gathers' physicians -- Michael Mellman and Vernon  Hattori -- who might be named as defendants in a suit expected to be filed this  week in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of Gathers' family.  </P> <P> The doctors find themselves in the midst of controversy involving questions  about how the Loyola star, a probable first-round NBA draft choice, could be  allowed to play if he suffered from heart problems.  </P> <P> Sands said his dilemma was whether to take care of his patient physically by  not allowing him to play or to take care of him psychologically by approving  his return.  </P> <P> "Psychologically, it was difficult because the one thing he cared about almost  more than life itself was basketball," Sands said. "To not allow him to play  was to do a disservice."  </P> <P> Adding to that immense pressure were calls from the Central Connecticut  coaching staff, calls Sands termed as subtle reminders as to Penny's importance  to the team.  </P> <P> "They would ask, 'How's he doing? We really need him. When do you think he  could get back to play?' " Sands said. "Then the university was asking the same  thing."  </P> <P> Although Penny averaged only 2.5 points, he was the team's leading rebounder  and a defensive enforcer in his senior year. He started 15 games.  </P> <P> "The doctors are trying to do the best they can for the athlete," Sands said.  "The conflict is tremendous. Team members and friends were calling. They all  wanted the same thing: 'When are we gonna get Tony back?' "  </P> <P> Sands treated Penny in 1986 when the basketball player was brought to the  hospital after an apparent heart attack. Penny, then 19, complained of chest  pains after lifting weights.  </P> <P> He had played a dozen games during the 1985-86 season when he was found to have  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is the enlargement of heart and thickening  of its muscles. Sands told him to play was to risk death.  </P> <P> Penny did not play. He stayed at Central Connecticut on scholarship, studying  toward a dual degree in communications and psychology, which he later earned.  He coached incoming freshmen. But for two seasons he missed the game.  </P> <P> Penny, whose parents are from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts, returned to  England before his senior year and decided to seek the opinion of a London  cardiologist. She and a colleague said he could play, explaining that the  condition was normal for black West Indian males.  </P> <P> He returned to Sands armed with medical evidence of his health.  </P> <P> "Tony was convinced that he was feeling fine," said David Rybczyk, assistant  coach for Central Connecticut.  </P> <P> Sands would not budge. But the university was more flexible. After all, it had  varying opinions from respected physicians.  </P> <P> Penny was allowed to play under an agreement arranged by his attorney and the  Connecticut state attorney general's office. He had to sign a waiver releasing  the university from liability and undergo stress tests periodically to ensure  he was healthy. When he skipped a test before the final game of the 1988-90  season, he was not allowed to play.  </P> <P> Letting him play "was probably the wrong thing to do," Sands said. "I never  wanted to be right like this."  </P> <P> Rybczyk said he was shocked when he heard of Gathers' death March 4 after he  collapsed during Loyola Marymount's West Coast Conference tournament game.  </P> <P> "I was just getting over that grieving process when Hank Gathers suffered the  same thing and it brings it right back again," Rybczyk said.  </P> <P> Penny had collapsed the night of Feb. 27 on the bench after playing eight  minutes for the Manchester Giants of the English professional league. His coach  said he was reaching his potential and had started the past four games.  </P> <P> Then it happened.  </P> <P> "Tony was not reckless," Rybczyk said. "Tony was convinced nothing was wrong  with him. He told me if he found out he had it he was willing to live with it."  </P></p>

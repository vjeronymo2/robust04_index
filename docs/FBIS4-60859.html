			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, April 29 (TURAN)--US President Clinton said  that he will annul the amendment of the US Congress to the  "Freedom Support Act". At present, according to the amendment,  it bans the use of US governmental assistance to Azerbaijan.    This ban also restricts assistance vis-a-vis projects  addressing peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict. "The solving of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict  within the CSCE Minsk Group framework is the best way to annul"  the Freedom Support Act, said the President.    In his reply to President Aliyev, the US President said that  he opposes such restrictions since they limit the activity of  the United States that is aimed at the support of reform and the  peaceful settlement of the Karabakh conflict.    President Clinton said that transport communications  following the Armenia-Nakhichevan route must be unblocked so as  to deliver humanitarian assistance to the peaceful population in  that region.    The letter also contained an announcement about the newly  appointed US representative to the CSCE Minsk Group, Joseph  Prescelli, who, according to the US President, will "closely  cooperate with representatives of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Russia  and other states to put an end to the war by diplomatic means".    The US President assessed President Aliyev's adherence to  settle the conflict within the framework of the Minsk Group and  expressed hope that it will establish close cooperation to  achieve peace.    The amendments to the "Freedom Support Act", which also  includes a ban on humanitarian assistance delivery from US  governmental agencies to Azerbaijani governmental entities, was  adopted by the US Congress in October 1992.    In March 1994 Azerbaijan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent  a  letter to the US Senate, in which it asked for an annulment due  to difficult situation of Azeri refugees.</p>

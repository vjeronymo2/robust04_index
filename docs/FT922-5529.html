			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: First quarter rise for ADT in spite of difficult markets ADT, the car auctions and security company with a London and New York listing, yesterday reported first quarter profits up 4 per cent at Dollars 32.1m (Pounds 17.8m) despite continuing difficult economic conditions in North America and Europe. Sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 318.9m and earnings per share by 9.5 per cent to Dollars 0.23. The company also confirmed the appointment of three new independent non-executive directors chosen with the agreement of Laidlaw, the Canadian transport group which has a 28.4 per cent stake in ADT. The non-executive directors will form an audit committee which will set its own agenda but which is designed to bring more corporate governance to the company. Last April, Laidlaw suspended a case in a New York court which claimed ADT had made misleading profits disclosures in relation to transactions with its associated companies. The case was dropped after ADT agreed, among other things, to appoint four Laidlaw directors and four mutually acceptable non-executive directors. The three new directors are Mr Peter Slusser, the president of a private investment bank in New York and a former head of mergers and acquisitions at Paine Webber, the investment bank; Mr James Pasman, a director of First Boston Investment Fund and a former chief executive of Kaiser Aluminium; and Mr Alan Henderson, vice-president of administration of Ranger Oil and a director of Ranger Oil UK. In security services, Mr Michael Ashcroft, ADT chairman, said the commercial sector remained soft but the group made progress in the residential market. Operating profit in the division rose 3.8 per cent to Dollars 30.2m. The auctions division was hit by continuing low levels of new car sales and operating profit fell 8.5 per cent to Dollars 20.4m with the greatest fall in the UK. ADT said it expected overall performance of the auctions division this year to be equal or just ahead of last year's performance.</p>

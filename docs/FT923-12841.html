			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hitch hits Walbrook rescue plan A PROPOSAL to rescue Walbrook Insurance, a subsidiary of London United Investments which is in administration, has been referred to the US Securities and Exchange Commission following questions over the procedures it has followed. Walbrook stopped paying claims on May 29, two years after it ceased to write new business. It told leading policyholders in Chicago and London over the last few days that it had a balance sheet deficit of Pounds 170m. The directors of the company are urging the policyholders to endorse a proposed informal scheme of arrangement which would leave the existing executives in charge and require large creditors to subscribe to redeemable preference shares equivalent to 60 per cent of the amount they are owed. However, Mr John Dingell, chairman of the US House of Representatives sub-committee on oversight and investigations, wrote to Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the SEC, on July 9 calling on him to examine the nature of the Walbrook offer. He has asked whether the stock offering should be covered by the registration and disclosure requirements of Federal securities laws; whether the Walbrook directors can disclaim legal liability for the offering; and whether the SEC is examining the 'propriety' of the offering. The letter follows correspondence to the sub-committee from the receiver of Transit Casualty, a Missouri-based insurance company which went into receivership in 1985 and which is one of Walbrook's largest creditors. Transit has been leading a group of policyholders which oppose the offer from Walbrook and would prefer to place the company in provisional liquidation. It applied last month in the high court for a liquidation order, and its hearing has been postponed until early August. Those opposing the plan are trying to avoid the slow-moving schemes of arrangement established for the so-called KELM group of companies to which many are also creditors and which are other subsidiaries of London United Investments. The SEC refused to comment yesterday on whether it had launched an investigation. An official said that public offerings had to be registered with the SEC before they could be announced, but private placements did not. Walbrook said yesterday that it had not been contacted by the SEC, but its lawyers were asking the commission to see whether it wants any information on the offer.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / German parties want to reimpose unification tax Germany's three potential coalition partners yesterday agreed that a controversial tax surcharge introduced shortly after the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990 and dropped in 1993 should be reimposed. In negotiations on a coalition programme, the Christian Democratic Union of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the Christian Social Union, its Bavarian-sister party, and the liberal Free Democrats, promised to reduce the state's share of GDP from 51 per cent to 46 per cent by 2000, cut 14,000 federal government jobs, and introduce more privisatisation, particularly in the transport sector and telecommnications. Mr Erwin Huber, general secretary of the CSU, said all parties had agreed that the 'solidarity' tax surcharge would be reintroduced next year since it was a crucial instrument to reduce the budget deficit which had swelled following financial transfers of DM150bn (Pounds 61bn) to eastern Germany since reunification. The 7.5 per income tax surcharge is expected to raise an annual DM27bn to DM29bn. The current deficit is DM68.8bn. Until yesterday, the FDP had insisted that the coalition impose a timetable for ending the tax, but Mr Theo Waigel said this week it was 'unrealistic'. FDP officials said they 'could live with the compromise' in which the tax will be reviewed annually. However, Mr Werner Hoyer, general secretary of the FDP, won some other concessions in the party's bid to reduce the role of the state, cut back the bureaucracy and gain more financial assistance for the Mittelstand, the small and medium-sized enterprises considered the backbone of the German economy. Massive public works, particularly for the infrastructure in eastern Germany could be thrown open to the private sector. Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of the CDU, said the role of the state would be further reduced as the coalition would attempt to scrap or decrease the bureaucracy, while enterprises would be given more opportunity to introduce part-time work as a means of promoting more employment. 'The next legislative period will try and push through more debureaucratisation,' said Mr Hintze.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Competition for fairness - Why the UK government is about to change the law on anti-competitive behaviour Last week's announcement by the UK government that companies indulging in anti-competitive behaviour may shortly be liable to swingeing fines looks like good news for small and medium-sized businesses struggling to get a toehold in the market. Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK trade and industry secretary, launched a green paper setting out three options for a change in the law covering abuse of market power. At first sight, he appeared to be addressing a relatively minor problem, judging by official statistics of the number of investigations into alleged abuse by individual companies in recent years. The Office of Fair Trading has investigated just 35 complaints of anti-competitive behaviour by a dominant company under the terms of the 1980 Competition Act. In 13 cases the complaint proved unfounded. In a further 10 the dominant company gave undertakings not to reoffend and in 10 instances the case was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a full investigation. The MMC also carries out between six and 12 monopoly investigations each year under the 1973 Fair Trading Act. The problem, however, may be much larger than appears from the statistics, according to Mr Michael Reynolds, a partner in City law firm Allen &amp; Overy. Many companies believe that they have to live with a dominant supplier and it is better not to rock the boat, he says. Others may view the present UK regime as so ineffectual that it is not worth complaining to the OFT. In contrast to the European system for tackling abuse of a dominant position, the current UK system is weak on deterrents. There are no financial penalties, and injured parties have no right to sue for damages. A business accused of anti-competitive behaviour will not be penalised until it has been investigated by the competition authorities and has subsequently broken undertakings not to offend again. The system is slow and cumbersome. By the time the competition authorities decide that a monopoly is operating against the public interest or a company is guilty of anti-competitive behaviour, the victim may have been forced out of business. In addition, companies that feel they are the victims of anti-competitive behaviour face considerable difficulties in persuading the authorities to investigate. They need evidence not only of abuse but also of intent. Without some form of documentary proof that the dominant company is deliberately trying to stifle or eliminate competition, the authorities are unlikely to act. Proving a refusal to supply or the existence of an unlawful tied-product agreement is relatively straightforward, but establishing that a dominant company is deliberately pricing its product at less than cost in order to squeeze the competition out of the market is more complex. Although predatory pricing has not been much of an issue in the UK, it could now become more of a problem. Privatisation, particularly of the utilities, could alter how such behaviour is defined. The government has stated that the utilities should not be placed in a more favourable position than other parts of industry. But, at the same time, it acknowledges they should not be penalised for doing something such as cutting prices which they are specifically authorised or required to do under their regulatory regimes. The problem in predatory pricing cases is deciding where to draw the line between legitimate response to new competition and unlawful action. Competition authorities know that too lenient an approach would make it easy for dominant firms to eliminate competition. But too interventionist a stance could hamper the vigorous competition between companies which competition policy is designed to promote. Following the European Court decision last year in the Akzo case, when the Dutch chemical company was fined Ecu7.5m for predatory pricing, it is clear that pricing at below average variable cost by a dominant company in order to eliminate a competitor will be treated as unlawful. The Court also ruled that pricing below total cost but above average variable cost would be treated as abusive where it was part of a campaign aimed at eliminating a competitor. But that left a grey area where prices are set between variable and total cost and there is no discernible campaign to drive a competitor out of the market. The extent to which businesses find themselves under scrutiny for alleged predatory practices or other anti-competitive behaviour will depend on how dominance is defined under the UK's new law. The UK currently takes a broader approach than the EC to the definition of market power. A business is deemed to have a simple monopoly if it has 25 per cent of the market, irrespective of whether it has real market power. In Europe actual dominance - the degree of market power which allows a company to operate without taking into account the activities of its customers or competitors - is the issue. The Commission takes the view that a dominant position exists when a business has at least 40 per cent of the market and its rivals have significantly less. Other factors such as barriers to entry for new competitors are also relevant. The UK government has indicated that if it opts for a general prohibition on abusive market behaviour it will look at the feasibility of extending the prohibition to catch abuse by companies with a lesser degree of market power than is implied by the EC's 40 per cent test. Significant technical and legal hurdles would have to be overcome, but if the UK succeeded in making any company with a market share of a minimum 25 per cent liable for anti-competitive practices, the impact on UK industry could be far reaching. Mr Reynolds' advice to companies which suspect they may be treated as dominant under the new regime is to give serious consideration to the adoption of a competition law compliance programme. Companies inclined to dismiss such advice as not entirely disinterested, or tempted to ignore the dangers of falling foul of a new prohibition system should take a look at the recent case concerning Tetrapak, the Swedish packaging group, he says. Last year the Commission fined Tetrapak a record Ecu75m for abuse of a dominant position following a complaint by one of its competitors. Few industries can afford to take fines of up to 10 per cent of turnover in their stride. But if a company breaches the law the existence of a compliance programme can be a significant mitigating factor in the level of fine imposed, he adds. The consultation period for the new UK legislation, which will almost certainly be included in next November's Queen's Speech, runs until the end of February. There is little doubt that the government and the UK competition authorities favour the third option. But it is equally clear that running two systems in parallel - the EC's general prohibition while retaining the monopoly provisions of the Fair Trading Act - could lead to considerable confusion and uncertainty for industry. For many businesses, knowing how and against what criteria their behaviour will be judged is the most important factor. Option two, which would bring UK practice more closely into line with EC competition rules, offers the greatest degree of certainty.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   THE THREE OPTIONS FOR CHANGE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retain existing case by case approach under 1973 Fair Trading Act and 1980 Competition Act for dealing with anti-competitive practices. OFT to have stronger investigatory powers. Businesses liable for damages and possible civil penalties for continuing abuse.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Introduce general prohibition on abusde of market power backed by tough investigatory powers and fines up to 10 per cent of worldwide turnover.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Introduce prohibition, tough investigatory powers and financial penalties, but retain monopoly investigation provisions of Fair Trading Act.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

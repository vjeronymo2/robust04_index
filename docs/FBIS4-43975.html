			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis announced  today that Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative on Cyprus, will arrive on the island at 1730 this  afternoon and at 2000 will be received by President Glavkos  Kliridhis. The spokesman also said that UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali had a telephone conversation with President  Kliridhis last night and announced his intention to send Clark  to Cyprus. Kliridhis, the spokesman added, asked Butrus-Ghali  whether Clark would be carrying any letter. Butrus-Ghali said  Clark would not. The government spokesman added that tonight's  discussion at the presidential palace will concern the UN  secretary general's report, which was submitted to the Security  Council on 30 May, and particular emphasis will be placed upon  Butrus-Ghali's proposals.    The spokesman repeated that the Greek Cypriot side's  position  remains clear: Discussion of the confidence-building measures  has ended and we remain committed to the 21 March document.  Answering a question, the government spokesman stressed that  our side will not yield to pressure from the United States and  Britain.    Finally, the spokesman said that President Kliridhis will  leave for Corfu tomorrow morning on board a private plane  instead of this afternoon as scheduled.</p>

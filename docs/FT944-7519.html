			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: An offer they could not refuse Sir, It is not surprising that the Isles of Scilly top the school league table of 108 local authorities ('Exam results improving, league tables show', November 22), as Scillonians enjoyed the benefits of compulsory education years before the mainland. This was due to the foresight of that benevolent autocrat, Augustus Smith, who charged Scillonians a penny a week for attendance but tuppence if they played truant. Is there a lesson here? R T D Wilmot, 12 Kylestrome House, Cundy Street, London SW1</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan: "Afghan Opposition </F> Dispatches Delegation to Saudi Arabia and Iran to Express Its  Opinion"]    [Text] Peshawar--An Afghan opposition delegation is  preparing to go to Saudi Arabia and Iran to familiarize the two  countries' officials with the opposition's demands and with its  proposals to settle the crisis between itself and President  Borhanoddin Rabbani.    AL-HAYAH has learned that the delegation, which represents  the High Coordination Council for the Islamic Revolution,  includes 'Abdol Hadi Arghandwal as representative of the Hezb-e  Eslami (led by Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar);  Hashamatollah Mojaddedi on behalf of the Islamic National  Liberation Front (led by Sebghatollah Mojaddedi); Dr. Talib on  behalf of the (pro-Tehran) Shiite Hezb-e Wahdat; and 'Abdol  Samad on behalf of the Uzbek militias.    The delegation will leave for Tehran today and will proceed  for Riyadh from there, carrying with it the opposition's  leaders' visions and viewpoint on settling the crisis.    The delegation has met with Pakistani Foreign Minister  Sardar  Asif Ali and ambassadors of the [UN] Security Council member  states, in addition to heads of the Islamic states' diplomatic  missions in the Pakistani capital.    The meeting was held at a time when opposition sources have  said that the Pakistani foreign minister has agreed in principle  to the opposition plan that calls for the resignation of the  president and his prime minister simultaneously, for withdrawal  of the armed elements from the capital, and for forming a  provisional council to manage the country's affairs until  elections are held.    Meanwhile, the two parties to the conflict have continued  their military preparations at a time when fierce fighting has  been raging on between them in Kabul. AL-HAYAH has learned that  Hekmatyar has told Afghan notables who met with him recently  that he is about to complete building a military airfield in  Surkhab, south of Kabul.    This is the second airfield constructed by Hekmatyar in the  areas under his control. The first airfield, built two weeks ago  in Dasht-e Saqawa, near Char Asiab (where Hekmatyar lives), was  subjected to missile attacks launched by the government forces.  But the new airfield is located beyond the government missiles'  range and it can accommodate fighter aircraft, contrary to the  old airfield, which can only accommodate passenger and freight  aircraft.    Informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that Surkhab Airfield  has  been fitted with a very sophisticated radar capable of  monitoring the airspace extending to the Pakistani border. It is  well known that the Surkhab Airfield plan has been ready since  the days of former President Mohammad Daud (1973-78) and that  this airport was supposed to be an alternative to the current  Kabul Airport.    Moreover, battles continued between government and  opposition  forces yesterday and military aircraft controlled by General  'Abdol Rashid Dostam, the Uzbek militias' commander, raided  artillery positions in central and northern Kabul for the second  consecutive day.    The aircraft targeted the hill on which the television tower  is built and where artillery pieces belonging to (pro-Rabbani)  former Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, whose faction  controls the central part of the Afghan capital militarily, are  deployed.</p>

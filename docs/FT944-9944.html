			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: The rise and rise of a shrewd operator - In a profession where fools rush in, the conductor Kent Nagano has trodden very carefully indeed These are powerful days for Kent Nagano. A decade after arriving in Europe as an unknown Japanese-American conductor, he cuts one of the most glamorous profiles in today's image-conscious music world. As music director of the Opera de Lyon since 1989, he has played a key role in developing its international reputation and progressive repertoire. He is also revitalising Britain's oldest symphony orchestra, the Halle, which he conducts on Thursday in his first Manchester concert of the season. Appointed principal conductor two years ago, he has only just begun to make an imprint on its programmes. In 18 months, he hopes to lead the Halle into Manchester's new Pounds 42m concert hall. In a profession where fools rush in, Nagano has trodden carefully. He has avoided the core classical repertoire, exposing himself only in 20th century scores which show his analytical grasp and communication skills to advantage. For his London debut a decade ago, he conducted Frank Zappa. In Salzburg, he has given lucid performances of Messiaen and Stravinsky. He champions John Adams' minimalist music on both sides of the Atlantic. But he has yet to convince large sections of the music business. 'There's too much plastic,' says one agent, pointing out that Nagano has yet to conduct major works by Mozart, Verdi and Wagner. 'I think the shine from outside is better than what is inside.' Nagano is certainly an image-maker's dream. With his oriental features and shoulder-length hair, he wows audiences wherever he goes. In Manchester, he introduces complex modern scores in his soft Californian accent. In interviews he talks like a campus guru, articulating artistic goals as 'visions and dreams'. 'Music is a sharing experience', he says. But with Nagano music is rarely a great emotional experience, or one of spontaneous inspiration. Some orchestral musicians have likened him to a machine: he rehearses and re-rehearses, demands clockwork precision and leaves nothing to chance. 'He's a recording producer's dream - he conducts it exactly the same way every time,' says a member of the Lyon orchestra. Nagano, 42, whose Japanese grandparents emigrated to California 70 years ago, carries many traits of his mixed cultural background. He practises the martial art of Shintaido and married a Japanese pianist. He is a modernist who speaks of his regard for tradition, an artist with an understanding of market value, a man with big long-term ambitions who has calculated every step of his career. His introduction to Europe came through the French composer Olivier Messiaen. Nagano, who grew up on a Californian artichoke farm, was conducting Messiaen's music at Berkeley, and invited the composer to work with his orchestra. Messiaen was impressed. He brought the young conductor to Paris in 1983 to help prepare the world premiere of his opera Saint Francois d'Assise. Messiaen introduced Nagano to artists' agent, Sylvio Samama, who saw in him a talent worth nurturing. Once his reputation was established, Nagano walked out on the agency and has never looked back. He is now said to command around Pounds 15,000 per concert. Lyon and the Halle were shrewdly chosen. In both cases, Nagano could be guaranteed a certain amount of limelight, without the competitive environment of Paris or London. Both had secure artistic foundations and vast untapped potential. In Lyon, the Opera was in the midst of a seven-year nomadic existence while its home was rebuilt. The situation was a godsend for an operatic ingenu like Nagano. He was able to rehearse and record extensively, choosing the kind of exotic repertoire which would generate publicity but no unfavourable comparisons. Louis Erlo and Jean-Pierre Brossmann, the Opera's co-directors, offered experience, media introductions and a handsome budget. Nagano was their conduit to high musical standards and a younger audience. In terms of personality, Nagano was perfect for Lyon's new high-tech Opera building, which opened in May last year. His Lyon recordings have won international awards, and he has now been invited to take the company on tour to San Francisco and New York. In Manchester, too, Nagano invested in an organisation at a low point in its fortunes. The Halle had a worldwide reputation, but was not of worldwide quality. Eclipsed by orchestras in Birmingham and Liverpool, it needed awakening from the sleepy conservatism into which it had lapsed since the death of Sir John Barbirolli in 1970. At first sight, Nagano was a strange choice. He was barely known in Manchester, and his repertoire had little in common with the Halle's. The two have taken time to adjust to each other. Nagano plunged in with Boulez and Stockhausen, which did not go down well in Bradford and Sheffield. He tampered with the money-spinning formula for Manchester's summer Proms, which then made a loss. He made disparaging comments about the orchestra's recent past, denting the musicians' pride. He also clashed with David Richardson, the chief executive who recruited him. The Halle's board of directors sided with Nagano, and Richardson left two months ago. The orchestra is now being run by Alan Dean, a Mancunian businessman with fund-raising experience, who says his priorities are to raise Nagano's profile in the community, increase corporate sponsorship and reduce the Halle's Pounds 400,000 deficit. No-one doubts that Nagano was the right man to shake up the Halle. His predecessor, Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, improved playing standards, but had no public face. Nagano, by contrast, is a crowd-puller - a key factor in the orchestra's move to the new hall. Nagano talks knowledgeably of the Halle tradition, which he summarises as 'excellence, innovation and courage. We have to redefine the tradition, renourish it, refocus it toward the future.' Critics say the orchestra is sounding refreshed. Nagano has worked hard on technical aspects - 'almost to the point of putting the players off,' says Gerald Larner, who has followed the Halle's fortunes since the Barbirolli era. 'The sound has become smoother, softer - the kind of thing you need for John Adams. But there hasn't been the same degree of artistic illumination and inspiration.' Nagano says there should be no hasty judgments. 'We all agreed from the beginning that this was a long-term commitment, something with roots that are going to bring benefits far into the future, and will require patience. I really feel I'm laying the bricks, assembling the structure.' The conservative programmes for the current season - plugging important gaps in both Nagano's and the Halle's repertoire - suggest he recognises the need for consolidation. Next March and April, they will make the first of a projected series of recordings. There will be a festival to open the new hall in May 1996, before Nagano's contract comes up for renewal. 'I've no doubt he'll use the Halle as a stepping stone - he's a clever operator', says Larner. 'He's not going to spend a lifetime here, and he would be well advised not to. But if he can pull the orchestra round, it sets him up for life for other things.'</p>

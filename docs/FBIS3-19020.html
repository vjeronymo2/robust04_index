			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Willy Claes by Colette </F> Braeckman; place and date not given: "On the Situation in  Rwanda, Burundi, and Zaire"]    [Text] [Braeckman] You have just come back from Rwanda, and  Defense Minister Leo Delcroix is flying out there today. What  are your feelings after having seen the situation in the field?    [Claes] I cannot hide my concern at the present political  vacuum, an economy in free fall, and the fact that the  conditions which would permit the implementation of the Arusha  accords have still not been met. But we cannot wait any longer:  All the parties which feel able to participate in implementing  these accords should do so, even if they leave others to join  them later. Otherwise, I fear that Rwanda may move toward an  almost structural confrontation between the ethnic groups.    [Braeckman] You have issued warnings and threatened to  suspend cooperation. Have you been heard?    [Claes] My comments have not been followed by results, that  is the least you can say: While I was in the country a  political leader was assassinated, and I know that a lot of arms  are held by the civilian population. I see no other solution  than the implementation of the Arusha accords, even if a great  deal will remain to be done after that. The two armies must be  merged, a large part of those bearing arms must be demobilized,  and an emergency plan must be drawn up for the economy. This  too will require funding.    [Braeckman] How do you view the recent events in Burundi,  and  more massacres in Bujumbura?    [Claes] It is clear that the Army does not accept the power-  sharing formula which emerged after the election of President  Ndadaye and which was reproduced when his successor was  appointed.    [Braeckman] Following the putsch there were calls for  Belgian  military intervention in order to avert further clashes, were  there not?    [Claes] That is true. We were asked to send 2,000 soldiers,  but it was clear the Army did not agree. There was a risk of  violent confrontation. It was subsequently decided to send in a  stabilization force consisting of troops designated by the  Organization of African Unity. Belgium was ready to make a  financial contribution of US$2 million to this force.    But even this, the dispatch of 180 men, was not acceptable  to  the Army. There was then talk of sending in 65 officers  responsible for health and hygiene tasks, which was by no means  a stabilization force. But the Burundian Army considered that  even this was humiliating. During my talks with the government  it became clear that the authorities want to reorganize the  Army, they want to separate off the purely military activities  of the gendarmerie and create a sort of republican guard.  Belgium's help was requested, but if we now decide to restore  military cooperation with Burundi, I wonder what kind of welcome  our experts will receive and how we can take their suggestions  into account.    [Braeckman] Belgium is still interested in Central Africa.  But is it not one of the last remaining countries which is?    [Claes] This very morning I explained to the UN  secretary-general's representative for Africa that there was a  danger of countries in the industrialized world becoming  disheartened over Africa, of turning their backs on it, if the  Africans themselves did not give minimum guarantees of stability  in order to allow a fruitful return to cooperation. You know  that within the European Union, Belgium and France are the only  two remaining champions of the African continent. It is only  the Maghreb on the one hand and South Africa on the other which  are still considered to be of interest. I must also point out  that 85 percent of the Belgian cooperation budget is still  destined for Africa. This cooperation must not become  impossible.    [Braeckman] Turning now to Zaire, does the Western troika  still exist?    [Claes] Together with Paris and Washington, we will accept  the result of the current parliamentary sessions. We obviously  recognize the new structure (HCR-PT, High Council of the  Republic-Transitional Parliament), as it is the result of  accords negotiated by the Zairians themselves. Negotiated, but  not yet signed. Together with our partners, we support any prime  minister drawn from this new Zairian Parliament: For us, it is  not a question of individuals, but of principle. The HCR-PT is  for us the new source of legality in Zaire. But I repeat that  solid guarantees will be required before any further  international aid is available.</p>

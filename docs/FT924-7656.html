			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Property: Yorkshire peaks and troughs THERE ARE not many buyers in the Yorkshire Dales these days, but this does not seem to be getting through to those owners who have been chasing the market downwards for the past three years. There are few country houses in Yorkshire worth more than Pounds 1m, but this does not stop people trying to get more. Earlier this year, the Marquess of Zetland thought he had found a buyer for his Copt Hewick Hall estate near Ripon. He had been asking Pounds 2m for his 13-bedroom Regency house standing in 88 acres and he accepted an offer, only to have the buyer pull out. Anxious to find a buyer before February 1993, when he plans to move to the Zetland family seat, Aske Hall outside Richmond, North Yorkshire, the marquess reduced the price of Copt Hewick Hall to Pounds 1.25m. 'That is an extremely attractive price and I am quietly confident that we will sell the property by Christmas,' says Johnny Jackson, of J H Jackson &amp; Co at Boroughbridge (0423-323171). Joint agent Henry Holland-Hibbert, of Lane Fox in London, confirms that there has been interest from overseas and the UK - but as yet no buyer. If Copt Hewick Hall cannot attract a buyer at Pounds 1.25m, what chance does David Aykroyd have of finding one for the Priory at Nun Monkton, near York, for which he is asking Pounds 4.5m? That price was placed on the property in June 1991, and still holds today. 'I agree that it an extraordinary price,' says Johnny Jackson, this time joint agent with Strutt and Parker in Harrogate (0423-561274). 'But we have had several people interested in buying the whole estate, as well as those who just want to buy the main house.' The reason the Priory is so expensive is that it is not just a magnificent William and Mary house, built some time between 1660 and 1690 and listed Grade II*. Nor is it because it has 257 acres of farmland and parkland. It is because it represents the perfect property for a businessman - a beautiful house with offices and warehousing in beautiful grounds. David Aykroyd inherited it from his father, Colonel George Aykroyd, who bought it in 1948 for Pounds 25,000. The 11-bedroom house has been restored and remodelled internally under the architectural supervision of Sir Martyn Beckett. In 1987, David Aykroyd built 5,000 sq ft of offices in the grounds in the form of a traditional country house designed by Malcolm Tempest. Next to this he created 23,600 sq ft of warehouses in traditional materials. The offices are let to the Yorkshire Fine Wines Company, which David Aykroyd used to own until he sold it to Bibendum Wine of London. The Yorkshire Fine Wines Company occupies the offices and warehouses on a 25-year lease from 1987 at a rent of Pounds 69,307 a year, with upward-only rent reviews every five years, the first of which is due on November 23. It is this commercial element that accounts for some - but not all - of the Priory's Pounds 4.5m price. What sort of properties are selling in Yorkshire? Strutt &amp; Parker recently sold Cliff Lodge, a nine-bedroom Victorian house at Leyburn, with four acres of gardens. The asking price was Pounds 350,000, but it went for just over Pounds 300,000. 'Pounds 300,000 will buy you quite a lot of property in Yorkshire at the moment,' says Philip Procter, of Humberts in York (0904-611828). When Crayke Cottage, a six bedroom late Georgian house, came on to the market in 1991, its asking price was Pounds 400,000. A buyer was found at Pounds 350,000 but fell through. When the property was remarketed in August at Pounds 297,500, a buyer was found within three weeks. Bryan Jarram, of Jackson-Stops &amp; Staff at York (0904-625033), who is offering Hornington Grange at Bolton Percy, near York, at Pounds 295,000, 32 per cent below its original price of Pounds 350,000, blames 'stubborn Yorkshire clients who won't lower their prices' for the glut of unsold properties.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: HOMEMADE TWIST ON PRETZELS  </P> <P> Pretzels date back to the Middle Ages, according to "Women's Day Encyclopedia"  (Fawcett Publications, 1966). Supposedly they were first baked by an Italian  monk as a reward for children learning their prayers.  </P> <P> Their popularity spread through Central Europe. Even today, a gilt pretzel  hanging over a door in Switzerland or Germany designates the establishment as a  baker's shop. Soft pretzels have the oldest history; however, the crisp variety  was being produced commercially by a bakery in Lititz, Pa., in 1861. The  following recipe is for this latter type, but if a lighter texture is desired,  allow the formed pretzels to rise about 20 minutes before baking.  </P> <P> Pretzels are prepared from a simple yeast dough, kneaded until it is smooth and  elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to grease the top and let  rise in a warm, draft-free area until doubled.  </P> <P> Punch the dough down and divide into 16 equal portions. Roll each between the  palms of your hands into a rope about 16 inches long (Step 1).  </P> <P> To form the pretzels, cross the ends of the rope, forming a circle (Step 2).  Twist the ends once again (Step 3), then pull up and over to meet the top edge  of the circle (Step 4).  </P> <P> Place the shaped pretzels on a foil-lined baking sheet, brush with beaten egg  (Step 5) and sprinkle with coarse salt (Step 6) before baking.  </P> <P> Pretzels are a traditional food of Oktoberfest celebrations in Germany and  throughout the rest of the world. The homemade variety are best served still  warm from the oven, accompanied by mustard and beer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOMEMADE PRETZELS  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups warm (105 to 115 degrees) water  </P> <P> 1 package dry yeast  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon sugar  </P> <P> 4 1/2 cups flour  </P> <P> 2 eggs, beaten  </P> <P> Coarse salt  </P> <P> Pour water into large mixing bowl. Sprinkle yeast and sugar over surface. Stir  until dissolved.  </P> <P> Mix in flour. Form into ball. Turn out onto lightly floured board and knead  until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Place dough in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in warm  place free from drafts until doubled, about 1 hour.  </P> <P> Punch dough down. Divide into 16 equal portions, about 2-ounces each. Form  pretzels. Place about 2 inches apart on greased, foil-lined baking sheets.  Brush with beaten eggs and sprinkle with coarse salt.  </P> <P> Bake at 475 degrees 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from baking  sheets and cool on wire racks. Makes 16 pretzels.  </P> <P>  Suggestions for column topics may be sent to Back to Basics, Food Section, The  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

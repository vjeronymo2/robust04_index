			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report ZINC was the outstanding performer on the LME, although all other base metals moved ahead yesterday. Three-month zinc rose Dollars 32 at one stage to a 14 1/2 -month high of Dollars 1,265 a tonne. Traders said they could see no fundamental reason for the rise, and expect hedge selling to be attracted by the higher levels. However, charts were constructive, with recent consolidation above Dollars 1,230 signalling a rise to around Dollars 1,260. European Zinc Institute data showed February world smelters stocks down 17,300 tonnes, but this reflected shipments to LME warehouses and not into consumption, traders said. LME stocks rose around 35,000 tonnes in February. London COFFEE closed lower despite a statement from Brazil's president supporting talks on a new international agreement with economic clauses and export quotas. New York COTTON futures remained higher at midday on buying inspired by bullish fundamentals and technical factors. US cotton consumption for February (9.73m bales) marks the highest consumption for that month in 25 years, the National Cotton Council of America said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Bold campaigner for reform in Japan: A call for privatisation of the country's postal ministry In Japan's much touted drive to reform its bloated bureaucracy, one force that has been woefully absent is clear leadership from the country's politicians. In spite of all the talk by the authorities, the pace of reform to date has been slow and the steps taken or being proposed have been half-hearted and superficial. As Japanese industry, and the US government, become more vocal in pressing for further deregulation, Mr Junichiro Koizumi, an eighth-term member of the House of Representatives and former minister of posts and telecommunications, has emerged as a rare politician with a recipe for dramatic change. The soft-spoken Mr Koizumi has ruffled many feathers in the Japanese political and bureaucratic community by calling for the break-up of the postal ministry as the key to reducing the role of government in the country's affairs. 'The best way to tackle the issue of administrative reform is to privatise the activities of the postal ministry,' Mr Koizumi declares. 'The aim of administrative and fiscal reform is small government. I believe that means that what private business can do should be left to the private sector and the government's role should be restricted to a small number of essential functions.' In that respect the postal ministry is clearly a leading candidate for reform because so many of its businesses are easily transferred to the private sector, Mr Koizumi says. Japan's ministry of posts and telecommunications, apart from being responsible for delivering the nation's mail, runs the largest savings system and the largest insurance company in the world. Deposits in postal savings accounts as of March, 1994 amounted to Y183,535bn (Pounds 1,177bn) while the assets of the postal insurance fund totalled Y74,345bn. The postal ministry thus competes not only with private delivery services but with private banks and insurance companies as well. Putting the postal ministry's businesses into private hands would reduce the role of government in economic affairs and could serve as a model for privatising many other activities performed by the government, Mr Koizumi argues. Mr Koizumi's contention has less to do with championing free market forces than with concern over Japan's future finances. 'If the government continues to do what private businesses can do just as well, the size of the administration will continue to swell. People need to realise that in order to avoid having to continuously raise taxes, it is crucial to reduce the functions of the government's bloated administration.' Unless measures are taken to reduce government functions, 'no matter how much taxes are raised, it will be like a drop in a bucket that has a hole in it,' he warns. Mr Koizumi's campaign to privatise the postal ministry as a first step towards genuine administrative reform is an unusually bold act in a country where politicians have long been expected to leave policy up to the mandarins in Kasumigaseki, Japan's Whitehall. But a third generation politician who has served twice as minister of welfare, Mr Koizumi is used to controversy. Two years ago he became the man whom bureaucrats love to hate when on the very day he was appointed postal minister he broke a Kasumigaseki taboo by speaking out against a key policy of his bureaucrats. His latest mission also appears so far to have won him more enemies than friends. As in the UK, where efforts to privatise the post office were recently thwarted by the resistance of several politicians, Mr Koizumi's idea of privatising many of the functions of Japan's postal ministry faces opposition not only from bureaucrats but from every political party, including his own Liberal Democrats. Neither is it particularly popular among the general public. 'Most people still think it is not necessary to take such a drastic step,' he concedes. Few politicians, not to mention the mass media or the general public, are as exercised as Mr Koizumi about the need to adopt radical measures in order to tackle the financial squeeze on the public purse that is bound to come. But politicians are also afraid of the consequences of speaking out. The postal unions are a formidable force in Japanese elections because of the size of the post office. Direction must therefore come from the very top - from the prime minister himself, who will need to present the idea of privatising the post office as a cabinet policy. If that can be done, Mr Koizumi is sure there are many politicians who will be willing to follow the lead. He does not expect such leadership to come from Mr Tomiichi Murayama, prime minister, whose Social Democratic party would be unlikely to risk alienating the postal unions. He believes Mr Murayama will do a reasonable job in carrying out some aspects of administrative reform and deregulation. But the reform of a few state-controlled organisations does not go to the heart of the problem. Politicians and the public will realise what needs to be done and be willing to act only when the financial situation of the government becomes more desperate. 'Until then,' Mr Koizumi says, 'I will have to proceed with patience.'</p>

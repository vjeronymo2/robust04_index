			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / The Long View: Personal pension blues Personal pensions have always carried the potential of a disaster just waiting to happen; more than one disaster, in fact, because the storm that broke this week over badly-advised transfers out of occupational schemes into personal plans is likely to be followed by another when the several million people who have signed up for rebate-only and other small-scale plans discover that the eventual benefits will prove to be derisory. The first crisis, over unwise exits from occupational schemes, has now been uncovered by the bureaucrats of the Securities and Investments Board who, five years too late, have found out that the fact-finding and paperwork connected with some 400,000 out of 500,000 transfers was deficient. Just because there was corner-cutting in the procedures does not necessarily imply that the advice was always wrong. At the same time, it does not follow, either, that if the forms were filled out impeccably, the advice was always right. The suggestion is that the individuals clearly have lost out in a significant proportion of the cases - more than 100,000, anyway. These allegations strike right to the heart of the retail investment industry. We are not talking here primarily about rogues on the fringe (although there have been some of those, too). According to Paul Trickett of the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme, who has watched with mounting concern over several years as some Pounds 700m has been transferred into personal plans, the leading recipients of the money have been TSB, Pearl Assurance, Prudential Assurance, Britannic Assurance and Legal &amp; General. Who should we blame? There is a parade of candidates, starting with the regulators themselves for failing to get their act together. In 1988, freshly-installed under the Financial Services Act, they were apparently too busy drawing up rules about 'best advice' to check what was actually going on in the market place. The life companies obviously can be criticised for accepting the transfer business eagerly without asking questions about the quality of advice given to the customers. They might say in their defence, however, that they were only responding to the political spirit of the time. The Thatcher government adopted the concept of personal pensions and then promoted them as part of its drive towards individual responsibility and popular capitalism. But it was careful to stop short of saying that people should leave occupational schemes. You might also attach some culpability to the occupational schemes, which built up such a bad reputation during the 1970s and early 1980s for swindling early leavers. That provided the splendid sales line for the personal pensions peddlers that it was not safe to leave capital at the mercy of your former bosses (an angle which acquired another dimension after the Maxwell scandal two years ago). Thanks mainly to legislation, however, deferred pensioners (who have left a company, but retain future rights in its pension scheme) are now better protected against inflation than they were. Finally, are the individuals themselves partly to blame? They are notoriously unwilling to pay for unbiased counselling and prefer to accept 'free' advice from salesmen. Perhaps the emerging results serve them right. The SIB still appears to be pre-occupied with the procedural details. The idea is that if enough pieces of paper are filled in and enough information gathered, the investor will somehow be protected. It would have been much better if, from the start, the SIB had focused on the motivation involved. A decision on pensions is highly technical and requires advice which is not only expert but unbiased; the intermediary must be prepared to advise 'no' as well as 'yes.' In almost all cases, though, personal pension business has been driven by commissions. The intermediary is paid highly for persuading the client to transfer out, but receives nothing for telling him that his best course is to leave his capital in an occupational scheme. It is a mystery why the regulators should be surprised in these circumstances to find there has been widespread mis-selling. There is talk of upgrading the training of personal pension intermediaries and introducing special categories of advisers, but such measures are unlikely to do a lot of good unless the remuneration is detached from the product sale. But the commercial reality is that investment products are sold only in big numbers by highly-motivated intermediaries. This is why many of the life offices have been fighting fiercely against the fairly modest commission disclosure proposals, now in the pipeline, which might expose the 'free advice' myth. Personal pension plans remain perfectly good products in themselves so long as they retain 40 per cent tax relief on premiums and the right to tax-free lump sum benefits. In these respects, they escaped damage in the Budget. If substantial payments - at least 15 per cent of earnings  - are made into a plan over a long period of years it should deliver fair value. In general, there is no reason for panic. Nevertheless, the general over-selling of personal pensions has created an expectations gap. Most people have a vastly exaggerated idea of the benefits they are likely to get. Although investment returns generally have been quite favourable over the past few years, the same cannot be said of annuity rates, which are worsening all the time as gilt yields fall (see page VI). For a married couple to buy a fixed pension of two-thirds of average male earnings (now Pounds 350 a week) transferable to the survivor they would need a fund of about Pounds 150,000 - and inflation-proofing would cost much more. Few people can hope to get anywhere near such a level. Don't book that round-the-world cruise just yet.</p>

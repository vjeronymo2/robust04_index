			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent firms on hopes of lower interest rates BOURSES ended the week on a firm note encouraged by the prospect of lower interest rates, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's traders saw a chance to reverse the downtrend of the past week and a half, as better than expected figures from Siemens on Thursday lifted sentiment. The DAX index ended 20.81 or 1.4 per cent higher at 1,544.55, 0.9 per cent better on the week. Turnover rose from DM3.7bn to DM5.2bn. There was some short-covering, but the triple options expiry had little influence on the cash market. Cyclicals made the running, with Volkswagen up DM9.50 or 3.7 per cent to DM268.90, Daimler DM12.10 higher at DM550.50 and Thyssen DM4.80 better at DM171. Siemens rose another DM9.70 to DM588.60. In retailing, meanwhile, Douglas extended Thursday's gains on 1992 sales figures which led Merck Finck, in Dusseldorf, to estimate unchanged earnings of DM32 a share for 1992 and issue a buy recommendation. The shares rose DM20 to DM446. PARIS rose for a second day on continued domestic and foreign interest. The CAC-40 index ended 23.54 higher at 1,827.08, down 1.3 per cent on the week, in turnover of FFr2.9bn. Eurotunnel remained attractive to buyers, as the stock put on FFr1.45 to FFr34.15 in the day's heaviest volume of 4.9m shares. Euro Disney rose FFr2 to FFr66 on news of a change in chairman. Matra and Hachette continued to be active on speculation about the terms of their merger. Matra added FFr13.30 to FFr236 while Hachette put on FFr3.55 to FFr90.85. AMSTERDAM saw turnover lifted by the expiry of options and the CBS Tendency index gained 0.3 to 97.7 for a 1.1 per cent rise on the week. Publishers were active after Wolters Kluwer, up 80 cents at Fl 85.20, restated its forecast of a 20 per cent rise in 1992 net profit and announced the acquisition of Liber, Sweden's second-biggest publisher. Elsevier improved 70 cents at Fl 123.30. MADRID continued its rally with another 4.71 gain in the general index to 228.69, up 2.1 per cent on the week. Buying was concentrated on interest rate-sensitive stocks as hopes of lower rates encouraged investors. Banco Santander was Pta190 firmer at Pta4,700. MILAN ended higher in active trading on the final day of the January trading account as news of new fiscal incentives for the stock market encouraged buying. The Comit index rose 10.44 to 478.62, up 4.8 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at around Thursday's heavy L386.3bn. Generali continued to set the pace for the market - adding L1,530 to L33,420, then rallying to L34,000 after hours. Stet rose L90 to L2,020 after Siemens of Germany expressed interest on Thursday in buying Stet's telecommunications equipment subsidiary, Italtel. But Credito savings shares continued to slide on confirmation that Iri would not allow them to be converted into ordinary shares. They fell L93 to L1,810. STOCKHOLM was lifted by Ericsson, up SKr4 to SKr18 in the B shares, and hopes of lower interest rates. The Affarsvarlden index gained 4.4 to 927.0, down 2.25 per cent on the week, as turnover fell to SKr585m from SKr866m. Electrolux went against the trend with a fall of SKr4 to SKr233 on overseas selling. OSLO closed steady in moderate trading with medium-sized companies grabbing investor interest. The all-share index edged up 0.2 at 385 points, down slightly on the week, in turnover of NKr222m. There was unusually heavy trade in the shipping company Norsk Amerikalinje which closed at NKr9.40, a rise of over 9 per cent over two days. COPENHAGEN closed higher in the wake of Prime Minister Poul Schluter's resignation, the KFX index closing up 0.80 at 75.97. The general belief was that a new government would not lead to drastic changes in Danish economic policy and might even make it easier for Danes to vote 'yes' in the spring's scheduled referendum on the Maastricht treaty.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- January 15                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open      10.30      11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1087.14    1087.65    1087.54     1086.48 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1160.15    1160.67    1160.49     1158.96  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00      14.00      15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1086.97    1087.90    1089.45     1089.58 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1157.97    1158.37    1158.33     1160.32  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jan 14    Jan 13    Jan 12    Jan 11     Jan 8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1076.93   1063.02   1071.43   1069.87   1080.25 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1154.08   1144.79   1152.84   1155.95   1167.34  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1090.67; 200 - 1160.93 Low/day: 100 - 1086.05 200 - 1156.62.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

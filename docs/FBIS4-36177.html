			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 5 Jun (MENA) -- 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, who was  recently appointed deputy prime minister and foreign minister in  the Aden government, holds officials in Sanaa responsible for  continuing the war and violating Security Council Resolution  934, which stipulates an immediate cease-fire in Yemen.    In an exclusive statement to MENA, al-Asnaj called for  isolating these officials regionally and internationally. He  said: Giving them the feeling that there will be a decision to  isolate them will make them accept the cease-fire  unconditionally.</p>

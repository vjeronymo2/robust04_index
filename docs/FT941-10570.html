			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / More big losses for Lloyd's forecast Lloyd's of London is set to announce heavier-than-expected losses when it reports its results for 1991 and 1992 over the next 18 months, Chatset, the company that analyses the insurance market's figures, said yesterday. In its latest forecast Chatset estimates that losses will amount to Pounds 2.05bn for 1991 and up to Pounds 1bn for 1992, bringing the market's cumulative deficit since 1988 to more than Pounds 8.5bn. The 1991 loss, to be announced in May this year in line with Lloyd's three-year accounting system, is expected to be widely spread across the market. Even so, many Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported Lloyd's - are expected to have difficulty meeting calls. Mr John Rew, co-editor of Chatset, predicted that the solvency test, in which Lloyd's assesses the ability of Names to meet liabilities in order to continue trading, would be 'extremely difficult'. Explaining the 1991 loss, Chatset said a rise in cargo and hull claims and inadequate rates had depressed the results of marine insurers. 'Rates had not increased either far or fast enough,' it said. US risks were also inadequately priced and claims from catastrophes such as typhoon Mireille in Japan and the Calgary hail storms in Canada would also leave many underwriters with losses. Lloyd's had also been hit by poor investment returns and higher-than-expected syndicate expenses, partially because of the cost of administering more than 200 syndicates no longer in business. 'Lloyd's does not have the funds invested to create returns to meet the losses that they are generating,' Mr Rew said. This remained the market's 'fatal Achilles heel'. About half the 1991 loss will stem from claims on syndicate years of account that have been left open because of uncertainty. This so-called 'back year deterioration' would also keep Lloyd's decisively in the red in 1992, Chatset said. It predicted 1992 'would be another bad year for Lloyd's' and 'an overall loss of up to Pounds 1bn if old years continue to ravage the figures'. By contrast 1993 has 'all the hallmarks of a first-class year', following rate increases and the absence of any heavy catastrophe claims. But Chatset questioned whether profits would be sufficient 'to cover back year deficiencies' and other costs. Chatset, which has often been highly critical of Lloyd's, said in the editorial to its latest Lloyd's League Tables that Names should accept the market's Pounds 900m settlement offer. 'Chairmen of action groups hype their membership up with cries of there being more money in court . . . Our advice would be to take what is on offer and be grateful for small mercies.'</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE ROCKET LOSES SOME FIREPOWER;  </P> <P> CLEMENS' FASTBALL AND POPULARITY ARE NOT UP TO SPEED IN BOSTON  </P> <P> It is sunny and Sunday, hot and humid, as Roger Clemens emerges from the Boston  Red Sox dugout and slowly makes his way toward the bullpen. He is followed by  low murmur, high indifference, sparse applause. Absent is the simmering  anticipation, the excitement, the human electricity that a Clemens start used  to generate. There isn't even a group of half-lit, sun-baked crazies poised to  slap homemade Ks up on the bleacher wall. But at least there is no booing.  </P> <P> When the Red Sox's two-time Cy Young recipient was introduced on Opening Day in  April, he was treated to an a cappella chorus of vilification the depths of  which are usually reserved for someone wearing New York Yankee pinstripes. In  an off-season television interview, Clemens made comments that were interpreted  to be critical of the city of Boston.  </P> <P> Noses got out of joint, ire was raised. And no one can dish it out quite like  the Boston faithful with a sense of mission. "They boo," the dearly departed  Bruce Hurst says comparing other fans, "but they don't pass out doing it."  </P> <P> Just three short seasons ago, Roger Clemens was the toast of Beantown. He set  down 20 batters on strikes in one game, pitched the Red Sox into the World  Series (24-4, 2.48 ERA, 238 strikeouts), was named American League and All-Star  Game most valuable player and won the Cy Young Award. The following year he  earned a second All-Star berth and another Cy Young (20-9, 2.97 ERA, 256  strikeouts).  </P> <P> Last season, Clemens was 15-5 (2.24 ERA) heading into August, cruising, it  seemed, toward his third 20-victory season and yet another Cy for the mantle.  </P> <P> And then mortality set in.  </P> <P> Clemens went 0 for August (five losses, 7.33 ERA), finishing the season at  18-12, with a 4.82 ERA in his final 10 starts.  </P> <P> There was talk of injury, that his vaunted 95-plus-m.p.h fastball was lacking.  </P> <P> Some said his season changed after a late July game in Texas in which he threw  161 pitches in 101-degree heat.  </P> <P> There was mention of a lower-back injury he sustained at home when he had to  twist and throw a rug he was lifting to avoid dropping it on his infant son.  </P> <P> In September, Clemens said he had "severe tendinitis" in his right shoulder  that was related to the back injury.  </P> <P> But Red Sox physician Arthur Pappas said the shoulder was just sore and that  the real problem was a muscle pull in the rib cage.  </P> <P> Everyone did agree that something was wrong.  </P> <P> "Guys were saying he wasn't throwing as hard," says Red Sox second baseman  Marty Barrett. "When they got to second base, they would say he was just  throwing 90, as opposed to his usual 95."  </P> <P> But the pitch that earned Clemens such harsh treatment at the throats of the  home folk came in an early December TV interview from his winter home in Texas.  Said Clemens in part: " . . . There are some things going on there in Boston  making it a little bit tough as far as your family. . . . There's too many  obstacles there in Boston to be able to overcome. . . . There are a lot of  things that are a disadvantage for a family there. I'm not going to specify it  right here, but I know that a lot of the Red Sox people know about it, and I  know everybody on our team knows about it."  </P> <P> After the initial tabloid-led uproar, Clemens tried to clarify his remarks,  claiming he had been talking about the Red Sox organization when he used the  word "Boston." He insisted he was referring to the facilities for players'  families at Fenway Park, the lack of a comfortable wives room, inadequate  parking and poor security in the stands during games.  </P> <P> But the local media wasn't buying.  </P> <P> Wrote one columnist: " . . . I'm sure there are better places for the Clemens'  kids to play in Katy (Texas) than mine have on the Boston Common. . . . Perhaps  Mrs. Clemens is dissatisfied with the spartan comforts of our public  transportation system. You know, when she rides the subway, as I'm sure she  does all the time."  </P> <P> Added another: "And why can't the Red Sox provide Mrs. Rocket with a cellular  phone? What happens say, when she has to run out of the park because little  Koby filled up his last diaper? . . . . "  </P> <P> "Those people wrote what they did because they wanted to get Roger," says  Clemens' agent, Randy Hendricks. "It's not like they didn't understand what he  had been trying to say. I think a number of them thought Roger was getting too  big for his britches and decided they needed to teach him a lesson.  </P> <P> "People talk about New York, but Boston's the worst place I've seen in 20 years  in this business. There's a strange combination of parochialism and  worldliness. It's not like I'm saying they're dummies, it's not like I'm saying  they're rubes, but . . . . "  </P> <P> In spite of the uproar, Clemens signed a three-year, $7.5-million contract with  the Red Sox in the spring. But the security he secured has not translated into  success. He is 11-8, with a 3.21 ERA and 150 strikeouts. Good numbers to be  sure, but not for the man projected to be the premier pitcher of his era.  </P> <P> Nor has the long-term commitment Clemens made to Boston squared everything with  the fans. They don't "lose their breath" at the mention of his name anymore,  and the romance has cooled.  </P> <P> So what about it, Roger? Roger? Roger?. . . .  </P> <P> That's another thing. Clemens isn't talking to the media this season, except on  the days he pitches, and only about the game. In a second television interview  six weeks after the first disaster, Clemens voiced anger at sports writers who  had brought his family into the initial controversy.  </P> <P> "I don't have a problem with someone writing or saying things about me,"  Clemens said, "but when they start writing about my wife or kids, someone's  gonna get hurt ..."  </P> <P> "I asked Roger about that statement," Hendricks says, "and he just kind of  winked at me and said, 'Maybe they (media people) need to think that for a  change.' It was almost as if to say, they always think they're running the  show. They think they're immune from pressure. But he's not gonna hurt anybody,  that's not his style."  </P> <P> Yes, western civilization has witnessed more mature relationships.  </P> <P> To what extent the off-season flap has affected Clemens' performance is  unclear.  </P> <P> "Roger is a very tough guy mentally," says Hendricks, "so I'd say he was hurt  by what went on, but not wounded. I think his feelings were: If that's what  they think of me, fine. If they don't want to try and understand after all the  things I've done up there, OK."  </P> <P> "I don't know all of what happened with the fans in Boston," says Charlie  Maiorana, Clemens' coach at Spring Hill High School in Houston. "But I do know  that if somebody verbally attacks his family, he's gonna take off on 'em. I  also know that Roger felt he had put everything on the line for Boston, and the  reaction really hurt him. He took it personally."  </P> <P> "What Roger said, he said from the heart," says teammate Mike Greenwell, "and  people took it the wrong way. It's affected him. It goes to show how fast fans  can turn on you. Say just one wrong thing and you're a bad guy. And Roger's a  great guy. He was just trying to make things better for the team and better for  the wives. And he did."  </P> <P> Clemens, as usual, worked hard in the off-season.  </P> <P> "We have three major-league pitchers who work out here at the high school,"  Maiorana says, "and they all have good work ethics. But Roger's is far beyond  anyone's. Sometimes I have to go tell him that's enough for today. Roger wants  to be the best pitcher in baseball."  </P> <P> Following the off-season, Clemens was pronounced fit and ready to resume firing  in spring training, but  </P> <P> "The thing I've noticed since the All-Star break last season is that there is a  difference in his velocity," says Red Sox catcher Rick Cerone. "This year he's  shown signs of getting back to where he was early last season, but he's still  not throwing as hard as he was.  </P> <P> "But those things happen because you throw so many pitches. You reach back to  get that 96-m.p.h heater and it's not always there. But he knows how to pitch,  and that's what keeps him in games. His fastball has been around 90, and he may  not think that's good, but to me 90 m.p.h is plenty good enough."  </P> <P> "He's throwing more breaking balls than you'd like to see, because his fastball  is still there," says Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman. "Some say it's down  to 91 or 92, but you're not going to throw 95 all the time."  </P></p>

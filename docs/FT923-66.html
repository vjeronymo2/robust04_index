			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y to outline restructuring plan OLYMPIA &amp; York, the ailing property developer, will today present the outline of a restructuring plan to creditors of its operations in the US. A feature of today's meeting will be the absence of the Reichmann family, who own O&amp;Y, or of the team handling restructuring negotiations for the Canadian parent company and the Canary Wharf project in London. The US subsidiaries, which have managed to avoid the bankruptcy protection granted last May to O&amp;Y's operations in Canada and the UK, have sought to distance themselves from the rest of the company. O&amp;Y is expected to ask the creditors to agree to postpone principal payments on its US buildings for the next five years and to pay interest only on those buildings which generate enough rental income to service their debts. This, in essence, is what the company has been doing since its problems surfaced earlier this year. Today's briefing, which will be held in one of O&amp;Y's buildings in downtown Manhattan, will be chaired by Mr John Zuccotti, a former deputy mayor of New York who is chief executive of the US arm. The meeting is being described as a preliminary which will be followed by discussions with individual groups of lenders. Each of O&amp;Y's two dozen or so buildings has its own group of bank lenders and/or bondholders. However, negotiations are complicated by the fact that, in some cases, loans to one building are backed by other properties. In addition, there are a number of unsecured lenders. O&amp;Y has equity partners in several of its US properties, including Mr Li Kashing, the Hong Kong tycoon and JMB, the Chicago-based property developer.</p>

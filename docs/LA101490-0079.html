			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TEEN ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF SERVICEMAN  </P> <P> A Compton teen-ager was arrested last week on suspicion of murder and attempted  murder in the shooting death of an Air Force enlisted man as the airman sat in  a car at a Torrance intersection with friends, police said.  </P> <P> Rickey Moore, 18, allegedly shot Daryl J. Webb, 20, of Compton on Hawthorne  Boulevard after Webb either glanced at Moore's girlfriend or made a comment to  her outside South Bay Bowl, police said.  </P> <P> Moore's arraignment in South Bay Municipal Court was delayed Wednesday until  Oct. 17. He is being held without bail.  </P> <P> Webb and three friends, who left the bowling alley shortly before midnight  because it was closing, were sitting at a stoplight near Hawthorne and Artesia  Boulevard when Moore and his girlfriend pulled up next to them. Moore, a member  of a Compton gang, allegedly flashed gang signs at the group and fired at them  with a .38-caliber revolver. Webb, who was stationed at Nellis Air Force Base  in Las Vegas, was the only person injured, according to police.  </P> <P> Although Webb's friends were not injured, the attempted murder charges against  Moore are the result of firing at them.  </P> <P> Police filed a complaint of accessory to murder against Moore's 17-year-old  girlfriend, whose name was not released because of her age. She is being held  at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey.  </P> <P> Police said they identified Moore after local television stations broadcast a  videotape of him taken by a remote camera outside the bowling alley.  Investigators received several anonymous telephone calls, two of which led to  the identification of Moore.  </P> <P> Moore was arrested Monday afternoon in Lynwood, and his girlfriend was arrested  later the same day in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

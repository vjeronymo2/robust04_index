			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Joao Ligio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The specific principles on national reconciliation  are still under discussion. The negotiators met only this  morning to look at a new version of the third document  consisting of 16 principles, of which about 60 per cent has been  dealt with. The principles cover administrative  decentralization, autonomy of provincial governments, the  national anthem, and the republic's symbols, immunity, and the  acquisition of diplomatic passports by National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] officials, as well as war  crimes and the pardoning of individual action during the course  of the war. All these issues have already been dealt with.    Tomorrow, the mediator will submit a new document to the two  sides. A plenary session will be held on 28 February, during  which UNITA's role in central and provincial governments, the  Constitution of the Republic, the news media, the status to be  accorded to Jonas Savimbi, the return of UNITA property, and  UNITA's role in economically strategic enterprises will be  discussed. Legal issues will continue to be raised with UNITA  demanding a more open debate on institutional structures. The  government only agrees to negotiate within the law, noting that  the Lusaka peace talks cannot interfere with national  sovereignty.    Meanwhile, Chief Beye [words indistinct] media coverage.  Over the past days threats were made about investigations into  information leaks. It has been reported that the UN secretary  general's special representative suggested that journalists  should be expelled. It seems that Chief Beye wants to raise the  flag of peace and therefore take Angolans by surprise. If that  is the case, than let it happen right away.</p>

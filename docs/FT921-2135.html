			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: French plan relaunch of second-tier market THE French stock market authorities are formulating plans to relaunch the Second Marche, or second-tier market, for companies too small or too young to be quoted on the main stock market. Mr Pierre Fleuriot, director-general of the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), and Mr Jean-Francois Theodore, president of the Societe des Bourses Francaises, yesterday announced the formation of a working party to identify ways of trying to revitalise the market. The Second Marche, which was launched in 1983 to offer a French counterpart to other junior markets such as the Unlisted Securities Market in the UK, now has 293 companies quoted on it. Nearly 400 companies have joined the market since its inception, with 30 firms 'graduating' to the main market and two - Canal Plus, the pay-TV group, and Cap Gemini Sogeti, the computer services company - joining the CAC 40 Index of France's larger companies. However, the Second Marche, like its counterpart in the UK, has been struggling since the stock market crash in the autumn of 1987. The flow of new issues has slowed, with just 11 new companies joining the market in 1991 compared with 90 in 1987. The volume of trading has also fallen from 64.4bn shares in 1984 to just 27.1bn last year. As a result, the COB and the SBF have decided the time has come to try to revive the market. Mr Fleuriot yesterday identified four key areas for the working party - which will include members of the COB and SBF - to examine. These include the marketing of the Second Marche, adapting the method of quotation to meet the needs of smaller companies and reviewing the role of intermediaries such as banks and brokers.</p>

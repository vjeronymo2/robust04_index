			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Smith suffers Trident setback over defence policy THE Labour leadership suffered a setback in its attempts to distance the party from some of its unpopular policies when delegates voted to scrap the Trident missile programme and support widespread nationalisation. The vote to decommission Trident prompted an immediate government response, underlining the sensitivity of the issue. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, said it showed that Labour was still 'wedded to the misty ideals' of the Campaign For Nuclear Disarmament. Officials close to Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the votes would have no impact on the development of party policy for the next general election. However, the defeats removed some of the gloss from Mr Smith's success earlier in the week in forcing through a partial democratisation of the process for selecting parliamentary candidates. The resolution calling for the scrapping of Trident was approved by a relatively narrow majority of 52.4 per cent to 40.6 per cent, suggesting that just over half of the party remains committed to uni-lateral nuclear disarmament. There was stronger support for a resolution calling for defence spending to be reduced to the average for European countries, which was passed by 79.9 per cent to 15.3 per cent. After the votes, the leadership said the resolutions would have no effect because its commitment to a defence review and multilateral disarmament was endorsed on Thursday by a resolution passed on a show of hands. Privately, Labour leaders also stressed their acceptance of Britain's need to retain the capability to fulfil its commitments to the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The leadership also shrugged off a resolution affirming clause four of the party's constitution, which calls for the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange. Mr Eric Messner, a veteran activist who said he learnt his socialism in the 1920s, said there was no public support for privatisation. He warned delegates: 'You won't get public support by watering down your policy. Let's keep the faith.' The resolution conflicts with the leadership view that accountability and control of industry can be achieved through a 'modern' interpretation of clause four relying on regulation rather than nationalisation. However, officials close to Mr John Smith, the party leader, said the resolution required no specific action from the leadership.</p>

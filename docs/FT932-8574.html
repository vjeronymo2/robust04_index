Landed best east Africans and coloury medium sorts were fully firm and often 3-5p dearer, particularly PD's. Plainer descriptions were irregularly easier. Ceylons met less demand at easier rates.

Quotations: quality 165p/kg, good medium 124p/kg, medium 110p/kg, low medium 87p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 167p for a Rwanda pf. 1.</p>

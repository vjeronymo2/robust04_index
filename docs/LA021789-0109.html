			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FDA CHALLENGES CARNATION'S DATA ON INFANT FORMULA  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration has asked Carnation Co. to submit new data to  substantiate the claims that its new infant formula is less likely to trigger  allergies after the agency found flaws in the company's original research.  </P> <P> The questions surrounding the Carnation product, called Good Start, has led the  FDA to request information from the makers of other formulas that also claim to  reduce the chances of allergic reaction to cow's milk.  </P> <P> Pediatricians have also voiced their concern about the formulas labeled  "hypo-allergenic." They say the products, which reduce, but do not eliminate  the potential for causing allergies, may mislead many mothers into believing  the formulas are allergy-free. The FDA has given Carnation 60 days to supply  new information regarding the allergy reduction claims of its Good Start  product. "We told Carnation, through their lawyer, that the studies to support  the hypo-allergenic claims don't pass muster," said FDA spokesman Emil Corwin.  </P> <P> Corwin said the Carnation studies claimed Good Start could alleviate such  symptoms as spitting up, runny noses and colic linked to milk allergy and  intolerance. "But it was not supported by some of the data in the study," he  said.  </P> <P> Carnation spokesman Dick Curd said: "We are now supplying greater detail on  what we have already given them and supplying additional results."  </P> <P> Besides Carnation, the FDA requested more detailed information on similar  products sold by Ross Laboratories, which makes Alimentum, and Bristol-Myers,  maker of Nutramigen.  </P> <P> The controversy comes only three months after Los Angeles-based Carnation, a  subsidiary of Nestle, launched Good Start -- for infants allergic to milk and  soybean-based formulas -- in a drive to win a share of the $1.6 billion that  Americans spend annually on infant nutrition products.  </P> <P> Good Start is made from whey, which is a component of milk. A sister product,  Good Nature, is designed for infants who have begun to eat solid foods.  </P> <P> Carnation, which estimates 40,000 babies use Good Start, says it has received  six medical reports so far of adverse reactions by infants who were fed Good  Start. The company said that in each of the six cases, the infant had a severe  milk allergy or other physical reaction.  </P> <P> Beginning in April, Good Start packages will point out that the product offers  "reduced potential for allergic reaction. No formula, including ours, is  nonallergenic." The company will also warn mothers not to use Good Start if  their infants have suffered from anaphylactic shock or other severe reaction  triggered by another formula.  </P> <P> Hypo-allergenic formulas are unsuitable for the 1% of infants who are allergic  to cow's milk, say pediatricians. "Mothers should recognize that this is not  allergy free," said Birt Harvey, president-elect of the American Academy of  Pediatrics. "That's our concern. If the infant is truly allergic to cow milk,  those severe allergic reactions could occur just the same with these  hypo-allergenic formulas."  </P> <P> The academy has updated its members on the subject in the February issue of its  newsletter. "There is no evidence to support the use of (hypo-allergenic)  formulas for the treatment of colic, sleeplessness and irritability," the  newsletter said.  </P> <P> Last year, pediatricians opposed Carnation efforts to market and advertise the  product directly to mothers, a move the academy said would undermine breast  feeding. Carnation later agreed to drop its name from such ads after meeting  with academy officials.  </P></p>

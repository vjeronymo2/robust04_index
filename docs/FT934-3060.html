			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Power, real costs of gas and pool prices (1) Sir, May I be allowed to moderate your editorial comment ('Breaking the power duopoly', December 7) that coal-fired power stations 'have higher running costs than nuclear or gas-fired stations'. Once a gas-fired plant has been built and 15-year gas purchase contracts have been entered into on a take-or-pay basis, the avoidable running costs of a gas station may well be less, particularly where a coal station has been forced off the base-load duty for which it was designed. The electricity consumer, however, will undoubtedly pay for the complete costs of building and running of the gas-fired station, which, as your editorial implies, simply adds to the 'massive overcapacity' in the industry. Moreover, the real costs of nuclear are still shrouded in mystery and provide grounds for much debate. The running costs of at least some of the old Magnox stations may well be higher than those of some coal-fired stations, unless we all accept that long-term contracts (currently unsigned) between two state-owned industries (Nuclear Electric and British Nuclear Fuels) accurately reflect the underlying cost structure. Your editorial shows your awareness of the complexity of the power generation issues: it would be a pity if your comment about running costs was accepted without qualification.

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Observer: Skin graft Analysts in Germany are sensing the need to develop thick skins. No sooner had the stock market absorbed the result of last week's narrow election victory by chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition, than a Deutsche Bank analysts' team in Dusseldorf recommended a sell for German shares. They suggested the government was too weak and the political climate was moving leftwards. This was too much for the bank's bosses in Frankfurt. They took the highly unusual step of distancing themselves from the views of the Dusseldorf analysts, saying they did not reflect the bank's opinions. Down in Munich, another analyst, from Bayerische Vereinsbank, has received a taste of corporate spleen from Computer 2000, the German computer dealer. It took exception to a study it thought too short-term in outlook and publicly castigated the conclusions of 'a young analyst'. What's youth got to do with it?</p>

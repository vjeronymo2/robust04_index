			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 10 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. State  Department has acknowledged that the permanent members of the  U.N. Security Council [UNSC] have discussed adopting a statement  encouraging North Korea to accept nuclear inspections before  sanctions are imposed against the communist country.    Department spokesman Mike McCurry made the admission when  pressed to comment on reports that adoption of a statement  urging Pyongyang again to permit outside nuclear inspections has  been discussed by the council's permanent members. McCurry did  not elaborate on whether the Security Council was moving to  adopt the statement before the nuclear issue is referred to it  or after.    Asked about the possible form of sanctions, McCurry said  there has been no specific discussion since the issue has yet to  be brought up formally. He said there were only informal  meetings among UNSC permanent members to review the present  situation and work out an agreement on the best possible means  of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.    As to speculation that China might exercise its veto power  when the Security Council considers sanctions against North  Korea, McCurry said Beijing has not revealed its official  position on sanctions.</p>

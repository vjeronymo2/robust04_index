			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Growing pessimism on pound CURRENCY dealers yesterday took a pessimistic view about the immediate future for sterling after the UK unexpectedly cut base rates by 1 percentage point to 6 per cent, writes James Blitz. The pound fell more than 3 pfennigs against the D-Mark in the morning, dropping through an important technical support level of DM2.4350 in the wake of the Bank of England's move. The currency bottomed out at DM2.4200 before closing at DM2.4250, almost 3 pfennigs down on the day. Its loss against the dollar was mitigated by the US currency's weakness, but the pound ended in London at Dollars 1.5380, more than 2 cents off on the day. In New York it closed at Dollars 1.5445. Dealers said there had been heavy selling of sterling by both banks and institutions, with few operators coming into the market to buy the currency back. There were signs that investment funds were not completely short of sterling, and that selling potential remained. The view that the pound may now test DM2.40 - and perhaps the historic low of DM2.3693 set on October 5 last year - seemed to be widely held in the London market. Mr Mark Austin, an economist at Midland Global Markets, said there was already a strong expectation of another cut in rates before or at the March Budget. 'Yesterday's move has changed people's perceptions about UK economic policy and we will see sterling lower from here,' he added. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, commented that the rate cut had actually raised concern about the UK economy. 'There is still no real evidence that the UK economy is recovering,' he said. However, the bearishness about the pound was also due to changing perceptions about the Bundesbank's intentions on short-term rates. Until the beginning of this week, there had been speculation that the Bundesbank might ease policy at its council meeting on February 4. But difficulties over the public sector wage talks in Germany has raised fears that the Bundesbank may not ease policy until February 18. The rise in the inflation rate in the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg by 1.2 per cent in December - slightly worse than the market had anticipated - added to the bearishness over German policy. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, compounded the gloom by saying that an increase in inflation would prevent a Bundesbank rate cut. In spite of these worries, the dollar gained nearly  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark to DM1.5770. The French franc firmed to FFr3.382 per D-Mark after a previous close of FFr3.385. In New York the US unit receded to DM1.5712. However, the sight of three-month French francs at 12 1/8 per cent yesterday led one dealer to claim that tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism were bubbling below the surface.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PRIMARY ISSUE: NOT THE CANDIDATES, BUT GOVERNMENT BY PLEBISCITE  </P> <P> Here it is, finally -- the last weekend before the California primary. By now,  voters should be aware of the candidates for governor and their programs.  Right? So, class, pencils out. It's time for a pop quiz:  </P> <P> Match the statements below with the Democratic or Republican candidate for  governor who made them -- A) Dianne Feinstein; B) John K. Van de Kamp; C) Pete  Wilson:  </P> <P> 1) "I've always said education would be my first priority as governor."  </P> <P> 2) "(Education will be) a visible and active priority in my administration."  </P> <P> 3) "We will bring great and lasting change to California's educational  environment."  </P> <P> Pencils down, please. The correct answers are: 1,B; 2,A; 3,C.  </P> <P> This exercise illustrates how difficult it is to differentiate among the  candidates' stands on major issues. Democratic Party opponents Feinstein and  Van de Kamp and Republican Wilson are all pro-education, pro-environment,  pro-abortion rights (to one degree or another). They've all refused to take the  "no-new-taxes" pledge.  </P> <P> The message is clear. The direction of state policy probably won't differ  dramatically, whoever wins. Other decisions on Tuesday's ballot will have a  greater impact on the state's political and economic future.  </P> <P> Voters will face 17 ballot propositions; they will decide on policies ranging  from amending the Gann state spending limit to increasing fines for violating  the state's Chiropractic Act.  </P> <P> Continuing the state's "ballot box budgeting," Californians will vote on about  $22.6 billion in state spending; $18.5 billion of that would fund  transportation projects that would be triggered by the passage of Propositions  108 and 111. The rest is largely bonding authority -- which is not subject to  the Gann limit -- for other growth areas such as housing, prisons and school  construction.  </P> <P> That presents a great irony. Direct democracy has turned California elections  into enormous town meetings. And the chief executive of the most populous state  in the union seems little more than the administrator of policies set by  California's real governors -- the small number of people and groups (including  governors and legislators themselves) who qualify initiatives for the ballot  and the voters who determine their fate.  </P> <P> Four proposals on Tuesday's ballot may chart the political and economic course  of the state. They are Propositions 111 and 112, placed on the ballot by the  Legislature, and Propositions 118 and 119, voter-qualified initiatives that  would change the way legislative and congressional districts are drawn after  each decennial census.  </P> <P> The power of the electorate over state policy is clearly shown in the impact  that voter action on Proposition 111 will have on the state budget process.  </P> <P> Proposition 111's provision to amend the state expenditure limit provides a  major test of the public's willingness to give back to their elected  representatives greater control over government spending. It will allow the  governor more flexibility in budgeting -- something George Deukmejian complains  he has been denied by "laws, mandates and court orders that have tied our hands  and threaten the fiscal health of the state."  </P> <P> Proposition 111's provision for an increase in the state gas tax is being  viewed nationwide as a bellwether of public opinion.  </P> <P> Roam the halls of California's state Capitol these days. It is like being in  the eye of a hurricane. The state faces a projected $3.6-billion deficit, yet  there is little movement toward solving the escalating crisis. Government is in  a state of suspended animation. "Politicians," one legislative insider  predicted, "will wait until after the election to gauge the psychology of the  voters, to see how far they can go."  </P> <P> If 111 passes, the word will go forth all the way to Washington -- where  President George Bush and Congress, like their nervous counterparts in  Sacramento, eagerly await a sign -- that the post-Proposition 13 era has truly  ended and people are once again willing to be taxed -- some -- to improve the  quality of their life.  </P> <P> If 111 fails, politicians may once again duck and run. Democrats, in  particular, will have to face hard choices on spending cuts. Regardless of  111's fate, Deukmejian has ruled out a general tax increase to fund  underbudgeted health and welfare programs -- all areas of concern for  traditional Democratic constituencies.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp has vowed not to balance the budget on the backs of "the poor, the  blind and disabled." Feinstein at first agreed with Deukmejian's position that  all state spending -- including cost-of-living adjustments for recipients of  state social-services programs -- should be placed "on the table." She quickly  backtracked -- this is a Democratic primary, after all.  </P> <P> If Proposition 111 fails, whoever governs may not have a choice.  </P> <P> There is a second legislative constitutional amendment on the ballot that can  have a significant impact. Born out of public indignation over the FBI Capitol  sting and its political fallout, Proposition 112 is the Legislature's  long-overdue response to the perception that Sacramento is a "swamp" corrupted  by special-interest money. It would provide for the implementation of a  comprehensive code of ethics for state elected officials -- a necessary first  step toward restoring public confidence in a system gone sour.  </P> <P> It also provides for the creation of an independent "California citizens  compensation commission" with the authority to set salaries of legislators and  other state officers (current law allows the Legislature to raise its own  salary -- but not more than 5% a year).  </P> <P> Proposition 112 is not, as opponents argue, a legislative pay raise disguised  as ethics reform. But it does place the question of adequate compensation for  government officials squarely on the table. And that can set the stage for a  healthy discourse on how Californians view their representatives and the worth  of the legislative process. What kind of Legislature do we want? How should it  function? What are we willing to pay for it?  </P> <P> The debate over what the Legislature will look like is also central to  Propositions 118 and 119. Both address fundamental political change.  </P> <P> Reapportionment, say the initiative's opponents in their ubiquitous television  spots, is really about power. They are right. Both proposals would favor  Republicans by stripping the majority party of its control over the political  and demographic makeup of California's Legislature and congressional  delegation. Both would also change the governor's role.  </P> <P> Republicans rallied around Pete Wilson because, under the current  reapportionment system, they knew they needed the strongest possible candidate  to keep the governor's seat. In redistricting negotiations, a Republican  governor provides leverage against a Democratic legislative majority.  </P> <P> On the Democratic side, the powerful Waxman-Berman political organization  anointed Feinstein their candidate when it looked like she'd be the stronger  choice against Wilson in November. A Democratic victory could shut Republicans  out of redistricting as Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown and legislative Democrats  did in 1982.  </P> <P> Ironically, if the voters pass either initiative, all this slick strategizing  may be moot. Under Proposition 118, for a reapportionment plan to take effect,  the voters will have the final say. And under Proposition 119, the governor and  the Legislature will be cut almost completely out of the process.  </P> <P> The complex issues facing voters on the June ballot are just the tip of the  iceberg. Thirty-eight initiatives, running the gamut from more auto-insurance  reform to pest eradication, are currently making the rounds for the November  ballot.  </P> <P> With California beleaguered by "government by plebiscite," why are seemingly  rational individuals running around the state spewing proposals and press  releases, attacking each other and spending millions of dollars to win a  governorship that continues to atrophy?  </P> <P> To illustrate how ludicrous the process has become, think about this: Even if  Van de Kamp, who trails in the polls, doesn't make it to the finals, he could  end up having a greater impact on state policy than the ultimate winner. Why?  </P> <P> If Van de Kamp should lose Tuesday's Democratic primary, but any or all of his  three major initiatives -- on environment, government ethics and crime -- make  it to the November ballot and pass, the next governor may take office hamstrung  by policies that he or she had no hand in formulating -- and may not even have  supported. (The same could hold true if Proposition 115, Wilson's crime  initiative, passes Tuesday and Van de Kamp is the victor in November.)  </P> <P> The state's chief executive could be in the bizarre position of administering  programs whose author he or she defeated.  </P> <P> Look carefully at what's happening in the trend-setting state of California. If  you think its politics supply any semblance of representative democracy, I have  a bridge I'd like to sell you.  </P></p>

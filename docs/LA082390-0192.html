			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KID STUFF: ROOTIN', TOOTIN' ROMP;  </P> <P> 'PECOS BILL SHOW' BRINGS TALL TALES TO LIFE IN ANAHEIM  </P> <P> If your kids can be noisier than buzz saws and rowdier than a pack of cowhands,  tonight's their night to shine.  </P> <P> 'Long about sundown, that rootin', tootin' cowboy Pecos Bill will mosey into  Anaheim's Pearson Park to present "The Pecos Bill Show," a romp through  American folklore that brings youngsters face to face with a barrelful of  colorful characters. Geared for preschoolers on up, the audience-participation  show completes the park's "Just for Kids" series with a 7:30 p.m. performance  in the park amphitheater.  </P> <P> "The Pecos Bill Show," presented by three members of the Imagination Company, a  Los Angeles-based children's theater troupe, brings to life tall tales of the  Old West in a series of short scenes. During the 40-minute show, audiences meet  naturalist Johnny Appleseed and see Paul Bunyan match lumberjack skills with a  city slicker, and Annie Oakely take on Frank Butler in a pea-shooting contest.  To keep things hopping, Pecos lassoes audience volunteers who, aided by simple  props and sound effects, are transformed into a whiring buzz saw, a couple of  cowhands and even a shootin' match target.  </P> <P> Like other Imagination Company shows, the success of "Pecos Bill" relies more  on the active imaginations of children than it does on fancy props and  costumes, said co-founder Tom Provenzano.  </P> <P> "We expect children to fill in a lot of the blanks, and they always do it  beautifully," said Provenzano, who formed the company in 1984 with actor-writer  Teresa Love. "While there are a lot of good things about elaborately staged  children's theater, this show brings the kids into a whole different kind of  creative energy."  </P> <P> Imagination Company may not be the most widely recognized children's group in  the state, but it is among the busiest, Provenzano said. In the past seven  years, the troupe, which ranges in size from 5 to 25 actors, has staged over  3,000 performances primarily in Southern California schools. The group recently  added a Northern California office and will soon offer shows in Washington,  Oregon and Utah.  </P> <P> As the group's artistic director, Love has created nearly 20 original plays  geared for students in preschool through high school. In addition to "Pecos  Bill," there are tributes to American leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr.,  George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Last year, the troupe premiered its  first bilingual show, "Celebracion de Mexico," and in 1991 will salute the  Chinese New Year with "Gung Hay Fat Choy, in the Year of the Goat." At all  school performances, teachers receive study guides that suggest a variety of  pre- and post-performance classroom activities.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Provenzano doesn't see this as an educational group.  </P> <P> "Our focus is entertainment, with the understanding that everything in our  shows is based on historical figures or classical literature. It's meant to be  fun, but if we all learn something along the way, that's wonderful, too."  </P> <P> What: "The Pecos Bill Show," presented by the Imagination Company.  </P> <P> When: Thursday, Aug. 23, at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Where: Pearson Park Amphitheatre, on Lemon Street between Lincoln and Sycamore  in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Whereabouts: Riverside (91) Freeway to Harbor Boulevard, south on Harbor, east  on Sycamore, south on Lemon.  </P> <P> Wherewithal: Adults, $2; children 3 to 12 and seniors, $1.

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Government probes 'black market' in milk sales The government, dairy industry and farmers' leaders called yesterday for a crackdown on an emerging black market in milk sales. The Intervention Board, the government department that polices Common Agricultural Policy milk quotas in the UK, is investigating allegations that farmers are illegally selling milk to small processors. Under European Union regulations, all milk sold by farmers must be offset against their individual quota limit - selling it without declaring it is illegal. Demand for quota has risen in the wake of the deregulation of the dairy industry which helped push up prices to farmers and encouraged them to produce more milk. European milk quotas, however, prevent British farmers from meeting more than 85 per cent of domestic needs. Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said farmers were understandably frustrated about the EU quota constraints but they would be 'wrong and foolish' to break the rules. He said: 'They'd find themselves in very great difficulty at a time when we're rightly adding to the drive on fraud in the CAP. Any suggestions that was beginning to happen in the UK would be very damaging.' The intervention board said more than half the 30 tip-offs to its fraud hotline, set up on November 9, had alleged milk fraud. Milk Marque, the dairy farmers' co-operative that controls more than 65 per cent of supplies in England and Wales, said 'a handful' of its members were being investigated for alleged fraud. Mr Neil MacFarlane, manager for the Midlands and north Wales, said: 'It's not a massive problem, but it gets emotions running high when people are seen to be cheating. It's another potential fraud and it could become large-scale.' Farmers face large penalties for producing milk without a quota. They could be levied 29p a litre by the Intervention Board and face an unlimited fine and up to two years in prison if the case goes to the criminal courts. Milk quotas are traded between farmers. However, the cost of buying or leasing the extra quota a farmer needs to cover increased output has soared. Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said quotas caused difficulties but there was 'no excuse for black marketeering'. Milk Marque urged the intervention board to 'stamp on it'. Breaches were fairly obvious, Mr MacFarlane said. 'It's very difficult to hide a 16 or 18-tonne tanker going on to your farm.'</p>

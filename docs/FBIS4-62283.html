			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and Russia  had talks here recently on the loggers, nuclear and other  pending issues but failed reach any substantial accord on key  matters, a diplomatic source here said on Saturday. The meeting  took place between visiting North Korean Vice Foreign Minister  Yi In-kyu and his Russian counterpart, Vice Minister Aleksandr  Panov, on May 12-13.    On the loggers issue, the source said, Yi reiterated the  Pyongyang stand that North Korean law, too, should be applied to  their loggers in Siberia because he argued they are not simple  foreigners but workers engaged in a specific duty agreed on  between the two countries.    Vice Minister Panov was said to have rejected the North  Korean demand, stressing that all foreigners staying in Russia  are subject to human rights protection under Russian law  regardless of the purpose of their stay in Russia.    As they failed to iron out their difference, the two  officials decided to seek a compromise agreement during the  meeting set to take place in Pyongyang shortly to discuss the  question of concluding a new logging agreement.    Also at the meeting, Yi complained South Korea tries to  induce some of their loggers in Russia to defect to South Korea,  asking Russia to foil the scheme. Panov rejected the North  Korean argument, telling them to produce the evidences, if any,  of such scheme, the source said.    On the nuclear question, the Russian vice minister advised  North Korea to accept international inspection of their nuclear  facilities, the source said. He also urged Yi to see to it that  his country accept a meeting of eight countries Russia had  proposed to discuss the nuclear issue.    In reaction, the North Korean said that his country's policy  is to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue and that they  would affirmative study the idea of eight countries meeting once  the idea takes a concrete shape.    In the economic area, the two sides agreed to take a set of  steps to reinvigorate their hitherto sluggish economic  cooperation.    The measures they agreed included the promotion of  joint-venture schemes and industrial partnership in the far east  area of Russia, and staging of economy-related meetings often.    The North Korean vice minister further expressed concern  about South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's visit to  Moscow last April.    Vice Minister Panov said Yi's visit was part of military  exchanges between two neighboring countries, the source said.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Pricing of World Bank's sterling issue provides controversy STERLING shifted nearer to centre stage in the international bond markets yesterday, benefiting from currency nervousness elsewhere in Europe. The terms of the World Bank's first sterling issue for nearly two years, a Pounds 200m six-year exercise priced to yield 20 basis points over gilts, provided most of the day's controversy. Although the World Bank is a rare issuer in sterling, and a triple-A rated name, traders claimed that Baring Brothers, the lead manager, had been, at best, naive in its pricing tactics. Critics pointed out that the gilt over which they were priced is much closer to five years than six years, and that investors would do better buying existing World Bank bonds in the secondary market. Barings acknowledged that the bond was expensive but insisted that the pricing was transparently and unashamedly pitched tightly, for what it described as the best credit in the market other than the UK government. Barings also pointed out that remarks made by the French prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, about vetoing the GATT accord after the syndicate broke in early afternoon hit Europe's bond markets, including sterling. Barings said the bonds held their spread of 20 basis points over gilts throughout and closed the day at 18, while other banks said the spread had widened to around 24 to 25 basis points for a period. The World Bank swapped the proceeds swapped into floating rate D-Marks. The Pounds 185m five-year issue for Cardiff Automobile Receivables is the second car loan-backed issue from that vehicle, note traders. One of its attractions is the clear short final maturity: issues of this type normally amortise at each coupon date. Goldman Sachs did well to put it together at speed, say traders, although they add it also looks expensive compared to bonds in the secondary market. Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais was able to increase its Kidder Peabody-led 10-year collared floater to Dollars 150m from Dollars 100m, to the surprise of some other bankers who feel that this particular market niche is not particularly attractive in current market conditions. Fans of the structure argue, however, that the underlying reasons for its use - a wish for a yield in dollars coupled with uncertainty about the direction of yields - are still relevant. The issue was said to have benefited not only from the quality of the name but from switching out of existing issues by other borrowers. SNCF swapped the proceeds into fixed-rate French francs. The European Coal &amp; Steel Community's DM217m five-year issue was described as looking expensive. In equity warrants, the four year issues by Matsushita Electric Works and Nishimatsu Corporation emerged at Dollars 300m and Dollars 150m respectively, through Yamaichi International. In line with current trends for higher pricing on these instruments, both pay a coupon of 2 3/4 per cent.</p>

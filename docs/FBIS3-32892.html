Garcia] </F>   [Text] Havana, 4 Feb (PL) -- Representatives of Cuban  immigrant organizations are interested in holding talks with the  Cuban Government to review links between both sides without  discussing matters related to the country's internal situation.    The Cuban-Americans have told PRENSA LATINA that whatever  happens in Cuba only concerns Cubans who live there and that  they would like to talk, preferably, about normalizing the  relations between Cuba and the Cuban community abroad.    Subjects such as immigrations, communications, family  reunification and aid, the need for cultural exchange, and ways  to facilitate the lifting of the blockade could be the main  points discussed during the meeting, which has created great  expectations in the United States, where more than 1 million  Cubans live.    Alicia Torres, a Cuban-American who arrived in the United  States when she was four and today heads the Cuban-American  Committee in Washington, has said it is time to discuss certain  aspects that could contribute to normalizing the links between  certain moderate political groups and authorities.    Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina announced the dialogue at  the end of 1993 in New York. The meeting is expected to take  place during the second half of 1994.    The Cuban Government has not yet decided the date or the  list  of participants in the meeting in which, according to Torres,  all sectors willing to participate in a respectful dialogue  should participate.    The Cuban Parliament has rejected, however, the  participation  of groups of immigrants supposedly interested in talking with  the authorities but which have the support of the CIA.    A statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Commission has  said  Cuba "has never closed the possibility of reaching agreements  with Cuban immigrants and has been talking with groups that  oppose the Cuban political ideas, as long as those groups are  not linked to the CIA or to positions that favor the blockade  and aggression. [no closing quotation mark as received]    Foreign Minister Robaina said some time ago that individuals  linked to Miami-based terrorist organizations or those who want  to give away or sell the country (Cuba) will be excluded from  the talks.    Robaina said the Cuban Government is willing to hold talks  and establish fluent and normal relations with those segments of  the community that maintain a respectful position and will not  estrange themselves from their homeland.    Coincidentally, Andres Romero, president of the Organization  of Cuban-Americans for Dignity [Organization Cubanos-Americanos  por la Dignidad] has agreed that representatives from terrorist  groups should not be invited to the meeting, adding that his  organization rejects any attitude of confrontation or violence  that could lead to a bloodshed.    Extreme-right groups should not be invited to the meeting,  because in Miami they oppose, in various ways, assistance to  Cuba, even if it consists of medicines or powdered milk for  children, he has said.    We are accused of being communists, which we are not... we  simply act as decent Cubans who want to help. They, however,  distort the truth, saying that our shipments are sent to the  government, when they are really for hospitals, schools, and  nursing homes, something which has already been confirmed.    Romero, one of the organizers of the fleet that on two  occasions has brought humanitarian aid to Cuba from Key West,  has said that during the meeting neither side should try to  impose their ideas on the other, and he stressed the importance  of reviewing the subject of immigration.    Regarding a similar dialogue held in 1978, during which  Torres was the youngest participant, she said "there have been  some advancements on the challenges we had at that time.  Obviously, new subjects will emerge, as times have changed  since then."    She recalled that under current circumstances there are more  complex aspects, such as the economic situation in Cuba and the  illegal departure from the country of Cuban citizens who receive  the U.S. Government's protection when they arrive in U.S. waters.    Both Torres and Romero have agreed that whatever happens in  Cuba only concerns Cubans who live on the island and that the  Cuban community abroad has no right to decide what should be  done.    It is a different situation, Torres said, when Cuban  immigrants want to help their families, keep in touch with them,  or return to their country of origin, among other things.    Meanwhile, Romero has said no one abroad has a right to  impose changes in Cuba and that any proposal in that regard  should be made respectful of the island's sovereignty.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Political worries remove the sparkle from Manila - But support for equities remains The Philippine stock market has eased substantially from the all-time peaks it hit early in January, following on from its sparkling performance in 1993. While optimism over economic recovery has given it some support in recent weeks, the close in the composite index yesterday, down 2.17 at 3,003.43, leaves it with a decline of 9 per cent since the start of the year. In 1993 the index soared by more than 150 per cent; and, according to many analysts, worries over the political environment could still derail the nascent recovery. Yet the performance of equities accelerated in the last quarter of 1993, influenced by the influx of foreign funds into Asian markets in general. By the end of 1993, market capitalisation had soared to 956bn pesos (Dollars 34bn), an increase of 182 per cent from the previous year. Tremors on the political front, caused by bickerings over the leadership of the ruling coalition, and proposed changes in the constitution, were followed later by popular protest over a package of price increases: in petroleum products, power rates and transport fares. Mr Fidel Ramos, the president, had to reverse the increases to stave off labour strikes and street demonstrations. Meetings are now being held with various sectors to come up with new government revenue schemes that will not entail price adjustments. All of this has not been lost on investors. After turnover averaged some 3bn pesos a day in early January, it has fallen to 1.3bn pesos a day at the country's two main exchanges, Manila and Makati. Most domestic analysts are unperturbed, calculating that because of expected faster economic growth - forecasts put it at 4.5 per cent this year, after 2.3 per cent in 1993 - equities should turn in similar gains this year. Forecasts suggest that the composite index could rise to between 4,000 to 4,500 in the first half; there are corporate earnings growth expectations of between 40 and 50 per cent in 1994. After hectic sessions in late-December and early-January, trading in recent weeks has become conspicuously selective, with interest concentrated on market leaders. Current favourites include PLDT, the telecommunications group, which closed yesterday off 5 pesos at 2,135 pesos, San Miguel, the beer and food group, down 5 pesos at 219 pesos, Meralco, the power utility, 2.50 pesos easier at 455 pesos, Ayala, the property-based conglomerate, down 1.50 pesos at 33.50 pesos, and its subsidiary Ayala Land, up 0.50 pesos at 33.50 pesos, Philippine National Bank, off 5 pesos at 655 pesos, and Benpres, the telecommunications company. Most brokers are advising investors to take a long term view and to avoid speculative issues. Some analysts comment that food shares may have the best earnings potential, because of the high level of disposable income that is spent by households on food. Others point to property and construction services stocks, which should benefit from the economic recovery. Overall economic growth this year is expected to be bolstered by increased infrastructure spending by the government and accelerated inflows of foreign investments. Domestic interest rates remain high - between 15 to 20 per cent  -compared to levels in global capital markets, but they have fallen substantially from historic highs seen in 1991.</p>

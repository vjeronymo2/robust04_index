			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: NEW WAY TO ARRANGE MARRIAGES  </P> <P> I signed a contract with a house painter the other day. It stipulated when he  would start the job and what services he would provide. If either of us became  dissatisfied with the arrangement, we would dissolve the relationship and I  would pay him for his time and efforts.  </P> <P> If we had sealed the bargain with a kiss in the presence of a minister, a  three-piece orchestra and 50 pounds of shrimp cocktail, it would have  constituted a prenuptial agreement.  </P> <P> I've always had a strange feeling about dividing the assets of a marriage  before the vows are spoken. It's a lot like lining up the paramedics at the  bottom of a ski slope before you get on the chair lift. Not only does it set  you up for failure, but it has all the romance of having a parking ticket  validated.  </P> <P> What it really comes down to is insecurity on the part of the richer of the  two, who isn't sure whether a mate loves him or her for him- or herself or for  an accompanying portfolio.  </P> <P> Most of us come from simpler times where we married younger and didn't have a  pot to cook in. All we had was potential, and that wouldn't have paid for Arnie  Becker's tie on "L.A. Law."  </P> <P> We tend to divvy things up in this country at funerals and divorces (which may  be redundant). Like scavengers, we pick through the remains of a relationship  that we feel should be bequeathed to us. We fight over boats and photo albums,  children and sports cars that may or may not have some meaning to us. Sometimes  it evolves into a war where the one who ends up with the most in the treasure  storehouse . . . wins.  </P> <P> I wonder if anyone "wins" in a divorce. How do you divide the struggle that a  marriage takes to keep it afloat when things are tough? How do you parcel out  the pain, or does one get all of it? Is there any love left from the good times  to divide equally, or did the lawyers take it all? And the dignity that should  be yours to keep, even in a divorce. Who got that? The press and the tabloids?  And what are riches? Are they just 727s, stock holdings, casinos and hotels?  </P> <P> Since there is so much divorce in this country, we tend to glamorize it by  turning it into a board game. It's a question of how much your investment in a  marriage is going to pay off. There is a price on everything.  </P> <P> Marriage, at best, is a crap shoot. We never know who's going to change, fool  around, turn mean or cheap, become weird, withdraw or turn into a bore. But if  you try to anticipate all these pitfalls by putting a price tag on affection  and trust, you don't have a marriage. You have a business arrangement.  </P></p>

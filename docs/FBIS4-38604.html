			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Arseniy Mironov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 31 May -- "Russia, the United States, and  the other nuclear powers must recognize that it is in their  common interests to fight the proliferation of nuclear weapons,"  Sam Nunn, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee,  said at a news conference here today. At the request of  ITAR-TASS, he commented upon reports in the British media that  the possibility of the special services of the Russian  Federation, the United States, and Great Britain cooperating on  collecting information on attempts by certain countries to  create their own nuclear weapons is being discussed at the  diplomatic level.    S. Nunn stressed that ideas on this kind of cooperation had  been put forward by Senator Warren, by experts of the U.S.  Senate Armed Services Committee, and by himself a few years ago.  The senator said: "It is a tragic paradox that now that  confrontation between the nuclear powers is a thing of the past,  our countries are defenseless in the face of a nuclear threat  from terrorist groups." The report that the special services  have begun to hold talks on cooperating in this sphere is "good  news," Senator Nunn noted.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVABLE FEASTS: SCHMOOZING OVER CHEESE AND PASTA'S BOUNTY  </P> <P> There I was, sampling a pretty snappy pasta pomodoro at Cheese and Pasta in  Santa Monica when all of a sudden I felt as if I were standing in a shop in  Antwerp, circa 1943. Owner Jim Deely, a former cook in the diplomatic corps,  was telling a customer about his precious deliveries from the La Brea Bakery.  "The breads are very tough to get," he was saying. "You have to have a  relationship, if you know what I mean." I almost looked in my billfold for a  fougasse ration card.  </P> <P> But even if you arrive too late to claim one of those elusive loaves, which are  available Wednesday through Saturday, there's no real sense of scarcity here.  Bounty abounds in the big case of cheeses, the fridge filled with fresh pastas  and the great bowls and platters of cooked food. And there's no problem with  shipments -- everything but the bread is prepared on the premises.  </P> <P> Even without bread on which to spread it, Cheese and Pasta's dense, rich,  smooth chicken liver pate laced with sour cream is worth seeking out. And minus  sandwich possibilities, the dill cucumber salad is still delicious.  </P> <P> Cheese and Pasta serves many of the '80s standards one finds in -- how else to  say it? -- yuppie take-out shops. The rather dull-looking curried chicken salad  is not as gorgeous as what you find in other shops but actually turns out to  taste lush and wonderful. Jamaican chicken, moist breasts rubbed with a paste  of ginger, garlic and pepper, is also excellent.  </P> <P> But while the lemon linguine seafood pasta looks inviting -- strewn as it is  with cherry tomatoes, tricolored peppers, and clam shells lining the bowl -- it  tastes oily and is filled with those itsy-bitsy shrimp that are better off left  in the sea.  </P> <P> Taking home some of Cheese and Pasta's fresh black squid-ink linguine to see if  it had a flavor of the deep, I found it contained a definite, if subtle, squid  taste -- the gustatory equivalent of putting a seashell to the ear.  </P> <P> On the terrestrial front, Cheese and Pasta offers 17 different three-course  picnics to go. They range in price, per person, from $8.95 for a slice of  tomato basil quiche, salad and dessert to poached salmon, potato salad, green  beans with pesto and dessert at $16.95. Still, I'd rather go the a la carte  route.  </P> <P> Picnic portions are small and, at least in the meals I tasted, not nearly as  good as food I chose in the shop. The consistency of the custard in the tomato  basil quiche, for instance, tasted like a weak moussaka, and the crust was like  leather left out in the rain. The crunchy green beans were covered with a mere  thimbleful of pesto.  </P> <P> And once, when I ordered the calamari salad supper, someone substituted an  extra apricot chicken by mistake. The chicken, by the way, arrived with a  pallid apricot sauce, not "spicy" as the menu had described. And the  accompanying Indonesian rice was not to be found; an ordinary broccoli salad  was tucked in instead. For dessert, fudge brownies were moist and satisfying,  the creme caramel grainy.  </P> <P> You're welcome to taste before you buy -- and affable owner Deely likes to  schmooze about food. "You know why I dreamed up the Babcock peaches stuffed  with mascarpone?" he asked. "Someone needed finger food for a funeral."  </P> <P> While I wouldn't say everything's to die for, I would consider getting on a  ration line for that curried chicken salad or that chicken liver pate. With or  without the La Brea Bakery bread.  </P> <P>  Cheese and Pasta, 1415 Montana Ave., Santa Monica. (213) 451-1753 or (213)  394-2131.

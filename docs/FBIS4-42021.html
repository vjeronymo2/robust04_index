			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] Leonid Kuchma, a former prime minister who runs for  presidency, described the results of the first round of  elections as a triumph of the economy stabilization course and  his own success.    He said at a news conference in Kiev that quite a few people  had voted for him even though he had no access to speak of to  state-owned mass media. IF Note: According to the Central  Election Commission [CEC], in the first round 9,944,474 people,  or 37.72 percent, voted for Leonid Kravchuk and 8,244,844 (31,27  pct) for Leonid Kuchma. They are followed by Aleksandr Moroz  (3,437,816, or 13.04 pct), Vladimir Lanovoy (2,455,830, or 9.32  pct), Valeriy Babich (630,392, or 2.39 pct), Ivan Plyushch  (341,173, or 1.29 pct) and Petr Talanchuk (142,996, or 0.54  pct). The CEC Chairman Ivan Yemets officially announced Tuesday  that runoff elections would be held in which the voters would  have a choice between Kravchuk and Kuchma. The exact date will  be announced on 30 June. It is expected to be 10 July.    Kuchma thought that the large support given him, Moroz and  Lanovoy showed that the people wanted change.    He advocated evolutionary reform of the economy and  expressed  his willingness to cooperate with leading economists, in  particular Vladimir Lanovoy and Viktor Pinzenik.    He confirmed his view that the CIS had to be a common  economic space and emphasized, however, that he objected to  Ukraine's entry of the ruble zone and to a military alliance in  the CIS framework. He made it clear that he wanted only an  economic union.    Kuchma said that he had found during his election campaign  there was no problem of Crimea but Crimea did not trust the Kiev  authorities.    He said that if he is elected he would do his best to work  constructively with parliament and never engage in a tug-of-war  for power.    In a protest he filed with the Central Election Commission  and the Supreme Soviet Presidium Kuchma said that the  state-owned mass media had promoted only the case of Leonid  Kravchuk in the whole month of June 1994.    In particular, even on the election day they urged people to  vote for him. This was a flagrant violation of electoral  legislation.    The supporters of parliament Chairman Aleksandr Moroz will  vote for Kuchma in the second round of elections and those who  voted for Vasiliy Lanovoy in the first round, for Kravchuk, said  Viktor Pinzenik, chairman of the Reform Support Fund. He told  INTERFAX that numerous voters would not report to the polling  stations at all in the second round.    For his part, parliamentary Legislation and Court and Legal  System Reform Committee Chairman Sergey Sobolev thought that the  supporters of both Moroz and Lanovoy would vote for Kravchuk  while Vladimir Grinyov, co-chairman of the Inter-Regional Reform  Bloc, believed that every fourth supporter of Lanovoy and three  out of every four supporters of Moroz would vote for Kuchma. He  assumed that in the second round the turnout would be much lower.    Anton Buteyko, head of the president's foreign policy  service, thought that the citizens who had voted for Moroz and  Lanovoy in the first round would vote for the man who had been  president.    Sergey Dovgan, chairman of the Peasants Party, thought that  100 percent of Moroz's supporters would vote for Kuchma while  Lanovoy's electorate would split down the middle. IF Note: The  runoff election will be won by the candidate who wins more than  his rival provided that more votes are cast for than against  him. In the first round of presidential elections the  difference between Kravchuk and Kuchma was 6.5 percent.</p>

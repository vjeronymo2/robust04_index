That is the conclusion of a report  prepared by the Electronic Industries Association of Japan  (EIAJ; chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto), which looked at the  relationship between conditions in the Japanese semiconductor  market and market shares of foreign-made semiconductors in  Japan. Copies of the report have been distributed to U.S.  Government offices and U.S. manufacturers.    With statistics on the Japanese market share of foreign-made  semiconductors in 1993 expected to be announced soon, and with  intergovernmental talks expected to begin shortly, the  association, through the report, is seeking the understanding of  the U.S. industry of Japanese market conditions and is urging  U.S. industry to increase its own efforts.    The report has five parts, and runs to more than 60 pages in  English. So far, parts one and two have been distributed, and  the remainder of the report will be issued by the end of next  week.    The association said it had taken about half a year to  prepare. Copies are being sent to the Semiconductor Industry  Association (SIA), manufacturers affiliated with the SIA, U.S.  Government offices, research organizations, and news media  organizations in the United States.    The report presents the trend of market share held by  Japanese and foreign semiconductors in the consumer product and  in industrial product areas from 1990 up to the third quarter of  1993. It claims that in that period the market share of foreign  semiconductors grew from 12.8 percent to 16.7 percent of the  total semiconductor market in the industrial product area and  from 2.9 percent to 5.5 percent in the consumer product area.    But the breakdown of products bought in the second and third  quarters of 1993 shows that among foreign semiconductors,  integrated circuits for bipolar-type digital-processing, which  account for only 5 percent of the total Japanese market, held  the largest share. These circuits are used mostly as logic  elements in computers. On the other hand, the foreign share of  the less-integrated, discrete semiconductor devices, which  account for more than 20 percent of the total Japanese market,  was only 6.2 percent.    The report notes that while the consumer semiconductor  market  accounts for less than 5 percent of the total U.S. semiconductor  market, it represents about 40 percent of the total Japanese  market. The report therefore suggests that foreign  semiconductors can win a bigger share by putting the emphasis on  sales of semiconductors in this area -- primarily by increasing  sales of discrete devices.    As an illustration of the openness of the Japanese market,  the report also points out that instances of foreign  semiconductor makers cooperating with Japanese finished-product  makers from the design-in stage jumped six-fold in the six years  between 1986 and 1992.</p>

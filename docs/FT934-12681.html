			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Mexican reforms cut poverty rate FOUR years of free-market reforms in Mexico have helped lift more than 1m Mexicans out of poverty, a UN-sponsored study has found, AP reports from Mexico City. The drop in the poverty rate - reversing a long trend - comes as the US Congress debates whether Mexico's living standards are rising sufficiently for it to join in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The study, conducted by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Mexican government, found 13.6m Mexicans lived in 'extreme poverty' in 1992, about 16.2 per cent of the population. That is an 8.7 per cent drop from 1989's total of 14.9m people, or 18.9 per cent of the population. The fall came despite a growth in Mexico's population; between 1984 and 1989 the poorest segment of the population grew by 6.3 per cent annually, said Mr Pedro Sainz, director of the study. 'More Mexicans than ever have improved their ability to feed themselves and meet the basic necessities for their well-being,' the study concluded. Mr Carlos M Jarque, head of the Mexican government's National Statistic Institute, said the results were extremely encouraging. President Carlos Salinas has sold off more than 900 state enterprises since taking office in 1988 and mounted a successful assault on inflation. He has vowed to lift Mexico into the ranks of the developed world through Nafta, which would link his country with Canada and the US in a bloc of 362m consumers.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Bypassing the system No wonder I am stressed. It is the price I am paying for going interactive, as part of an experiment being conducted by MIT. I thought it would be fun, and that interactivity would push Hawks &amp; Handsaws towards the cutting edge of mediaworld - utilising, as it does, advances in computers and telephony. And so it has. My screen glows day and night. Readers are talking back in growing numbers. They appear on my screen with not a moment's warning. I'll be typing away quietly when the screen suddenly fizzes and there, right in front of me, is somebody talking back. Hectoring me in real time. Berating and abusing me. I can't just run away, or pretend that I'm invisible. I have to stand my ground. But it is all so indiscriminate. Anyone can get through, any Tom, Dick or Heidi. Last Monday was a nightmare of interactivity - a constant stream of tele-callers angered by H &amp; H's protest at the wickedness of a bypass scheme near Bath which is desecrating a famous beauty spot, Solsbury Hill. This is a place of water-meadows, badger setts, tranquility and history. H &amp; H, last Saturday, jettisoned balance and objectivity. Stuff them, it thought. It called a spade a spade. It talked of road-building mania on a completely crazy scale, as well as madness among ministers and decadence in the government. As a result, my screen glowed phosphorescently as callers got through to me interactively. Their faces were scarlet, their language intemperate. If they could have reached through the screen I am sure they would have killed me. The first face to appear was that of the chairman - he did not give his name  -of an outfit which he described as a big-league construction company, though not, as it happened, one of those involved in the rape of Solsbury Hill. He wore a brown suit and a carnation, which wilted as he spoke. 'What are you?' he demanded. 'A communist? A hippie? One of those media nancy-boys? Have you any idea, you self-satisfied twerp, what damage you can cause with your sentimental gibbering? A bypass scheme like Solsbury Hill stands for progress and jobs, for growth and prosperity. For getting Britain ready for the 21st century. Taking our place in Europe. It stands for our children's future. Our children's children's future. You're a malcontent and a sniveller. You don't stand for anything. Don't believe in anything. You're an aesthete. A worm. A completely negative person. God, you are rotten.' No sooner had he disappeared from my screen than he was replaced by a mandarin from the highest level imaginable of the Ministry of Transport. Sir Robin something something. Droll, yet extremely dangerous. He said: 'Rather impressionistic, your piece on Solsbury Hill. Of course you have an agenda. I acknowledge that entirely. But I wonder if you realise how wounding your stance can be. You may not have seen, Michael, a statement from the secretary of state which we promulgated two months ago, covering many of the points of such concern to you. John MacGregor - I quote - today announced a radical prioritisation of the roads programme. It will get essential schemes built faster and remove schemes no longer environmentally acceptable or not needed at present. 'This review, said MacGregor, will speed up delivery of the key improvements needed to make journeys run more smoothly. And it will minimise blight, damage and disruption for local communities and the environment. As you know, Michael, 90 per cent of all journeys in Britain are by road. A substantial bypass programme of 91 schemes, 16 of which are designated Priority 1, is designed, fundamentally, to get heavy traffic out of villages and towns, thus improving the quality of life for residents and visitors alike. We are also keen not to encourage commuting by road into urban centres. 'I realise that at 720 words Hawks &amp; Handsaws can only skim across the surface of things, like an intoxicated whippoorwill. That is its attraction. I myself am a fan, steadfast in devotion. All I am keen to do is to fill in, as it were, a few of the substantive issues that impinge upon Solsbury Hill and this unfortunate but vital bypass. 'I've enjoyed our chat enormously. Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas, as Virgil used to say. Arrivederci, dear.'</p>

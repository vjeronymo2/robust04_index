			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Brussels firm on aid terms THE ex-Soviet republics face an increasing hard currency financial gap which could rise to between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 25bn next year, and will probably need western aid to supplement International Monetary Fund credits, an EC Commissioner said yesterday. But Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC economic affairs commissioner, confirmed yesterday's decision by EC finance ministers to let the IMF take the lead, admit Russia and the three bigger members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) next month, and set the conditions for stabilising their econom ies. EC ministers also refused to soften their legal terms for the Community's Ecu1.25bn (Pounds 880m) pending food credit to the CIS. They agreed that CIS borrowers must agree to submit to court action in the event of default on repayment. If Russia - which has already received an EC-backed Ecu500m bank credit to buy food and medical supplies - continued to insist on its 'sovereign immunity' from court action, the Community loan would go ahead to CIS republics like Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrghystan, which had agreed to waive this right. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the French Treasury director who has led Western negotiations on CIS official debt, told EC ministers that Ukraine, Uzbekhistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia now appeared to have agreed to join other CIS states in shouldering responsibility for past Soviet debt (as of October 28, 1991). Settlement of the responsibility for this debt, which the Commission says totalled Dollars 68bn by end-1991, is another EC precondition for new lending to the CIS. EC ministers decided to await a green light from the IMF before trying to mobilise any extra macro-economic aid for the CIS, despite warnings from some in the Commission, notably Mr Frans Andriessen, the external affairs commissioner, that IMF assistance might be too little and too late to prevent further economic and political instability within the CIS. However Mr Christophersen said extra aid would be needed by 1993.</p>

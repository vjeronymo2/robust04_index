			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 12 SAPA -- International  mediators began arriving in Johannesburg on Tuesday [12 April]  to help resolve the constitutional deadlock between the African  National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], amid  reports that the government would also become a party to the  mediation process.    Former British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington was the  first of the seven foreign mediators to arrive on Tuesday, but  declined to comment on prospects for the mediation. He said he  and ex-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger felt honoured to  have been invited to mediate.    The other mediators invited are Mr Justice H K Bhagwati of  India, Mr Justice A Leon Higginbotham of the United States of  America, Prof Paul Kevenhorster of Germany, Mr Justice Antonio  la Pergola of Italy and Prof Jean Antonie Laponce of Canada.    The terms of reference for the mediation process will be  determined once they have all arrived.    Meanwhile, the government who until now has been lukewarm  about the mediation process, fearing it could reopen a range of  already-settled constitutional issues, will join the mediation  process.    ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa told Transitional  Executive Council members on Tuesday although it was originally  intended only to involve the ANC and the IFP, negotiators at  Friday's leader's summit at Skukuza in the Kruger National Park  had decided the government should become a party to the  mediation.    He however warned against IFP expectations that the  elections  might be postponed. "The IFP seems to be getting into the  mediation process in the hope that the process will result in  the date of elections being postponed.    "The election date is sacrosanct, not even the mediation  process can tamper with it," Mr Ramaphosa added.    ANC President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday said he was  confident  the mediation could resolve the deadlock over the IFP's  participation in the election as well as the role of Zulu King  Goodwill Zwelithini under a new constitution.    Speaking in Johannesburg, Mr Mandela said the mediation  process was an "important development" which raised the  possibility of solving the problem "of some of those who are  outside the process". "They (the mediators) have a very  difficult job indeed" after the "lack of success in the meeting  last Friday".    Mr Mandela said he would make "special recommendations" to  the mediators "so that their efforts can as far as possible be  successful".    Should mediation fail, talks would continue with the parties  involved. "Dialogue is our important weapon," he told reporters.    Meanwhile, Constitutional Development Deputy Minister Fanus  Schoeman said on Tuesday the mediation should revolve around  guaranteeing a free election as there was no time to renegotiate  the interim constitution.    He said the government had doubts about the draft mediation  guidelines to resolve the deadlock. According to the guidelines,  the interim constitution would have to be virtually  renegotiated, according to Mr Schoeman. But there was little  time for this.    He said that specific parts of the guidelines should rather  be used to bring the IFP into the constitutional process by  obtaining the party's permission for a free election in kwaZulu.    The IFP could still get involved in constitutional  negotiations after the elections, he said.</p>

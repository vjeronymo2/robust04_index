			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Cash supply figures boost for Clarke A sharp rise in the purchasing managers' index and newly published money supply figures point to the continuing health of the UK recovery after a raft of sluggish economic statistics in recent weeks. The news should cheer Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, as he prepares for tomorrow's monthly monetary meeting with Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Figures released by the Bank yesterday show that M0, the narrowest measure of the money supply, grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent in February, for an annual rate of 5.5 per cent, up from 5.3 per cent in January. The rise was ahead of market expect-ations. This jump was partly caused by a sharp rise in the erratic component of M0, banks' deposits at the Bank of England. Notes and coins, the main component of M0, grew by a more modest 0.5 per cent in February (also seasonally adjusted), for a 12 month growth rate of 5.6 per cent, down from 5.7 per cent in January. The government's monitoring range for M0 is 0 per cent to 4 per cent, but the measure has been outside this band for some time. M0's annualised rate of growth over the three months to February was 9.3 per cent. However, the government has argued that fast M0 growth has been caused by the fall in interest rates. The opportunity cost of holding cash - instead of putting it in the bank and earning interest - has fallen and therefore people's willingness to hold cash has risen. In technical jargon, the velocity of money has fallen (it circulates less quickly). Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said that, adjusted for the Treasury's measure of velocity, M0 was within its monitoring range. Previous interest rate cuts occurred, he said, when M0 was with-in its adjusted monitoring range. The Purchasing Managers Index, released today, indicates a significant increase of activity in February. The index, compiled by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, rose to 55.5 per cent in February, its highest level since last April. The index is based on a weighted survey of variables, such as measures of output and new orders. Any level above 50 per cent represents an increase over the previous month. January's index, which was 49.1, pointed to a new-year lull in activity. The institute said that output and new orders were particularly strong in February, reflecting 'a general improvement in economic conditions throughout all regions and manufacturing sectors during the month'.</p>

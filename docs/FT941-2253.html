			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commitment to reform Sir, Graham Allen MP (Letters, March 18) is absolutely right in calling for wide-ranging reform of Parliament. The silly confrontational style in the chamber itself, especially at question time, is now pure pantomime for the benefit of the media. This, coupled with the modern MP's desire to join the executive rather than to scrutinise it, is why Parliament, though much harder working, is much less effective. The only useful work is done in select committees, but this has been impeded by the petulant 'non-co-operation' policy of opposition leader, Mr John Smith. However, a start on reform was agreed by all parties in the Jopling report just prior to the last election. Subsequently, the Labour 'establishment' has gone cold on this. Despite the wishes of its more sensible backbenchers, the front bench remains terrorised by a small leftwing clique opposed to any change. Labour should put this right before embarking on 'a new constitution for a new century'. Anthony Grant, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

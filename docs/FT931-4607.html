			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown rethinks expansion HILLSDOWN Holdings' results bore the brunt of the group's earlier mistakes made when it expanded rapidly through acquisitions. Pre-tax profits dipped and a Pounds 92.3m provision was taken below the line. The group now plans a pause in such expansion for at least 12 months while it concentrates on sorting out its existing operations. It will also close or sell about 30 businesses. Sales from continuing operations rose 6 per cent but total sales were down 6.1 per cent to Pounds 4.37bn. Operating profits fell 20 per cent to Pounds 184.9m, though profits from continuing businesses fell 12.2 per cent to Pounds 185.6m. Profits included Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 10.6m) from fixed asset sales. Operating profit margins fell as recession-hit consumers traded down. A reduction in the interest charge from Pounds 44.9m to Pounds 30.8m reflected the rights issue in November 1991. The tax charge rose from 20.5 per cent to 25.9 per cent as unutilised tax losses ran out. The tax rate is expected to rise to about 30 per cent in 1993. The group is also facing an advance corporation tax problem but hopes to avoid paying any irrecoverable ACT this year. Minorities fell from Pounds 25m to Pounds 20.3m, reflecting lower profits in Canada and at Strong &amp; Fisher. With the extra shares in issue, earnings per share fell from 21p to 13.6p. An unchanged final dividend of 6.6p gives a maintained 8.8p total. Food processing operating profits fell 10 per cent to Pounds 123.4m, with mixed results from the range of activities. The fresh meat and bacon division suffered a 60 per cent profit fall to Pounds 12.8m as lower volumes hit the commodity end of the business. Poultry and egg profits rose 3.8 per cent to Pounds 27.3m. In non-food activities, furniture profits were ahead from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 14.8m. Profits from housebuilding property and specialist activities fell 59 per cent to Pounds 11.6m. Pre-tax profits of Strong &amp; Fisher (Holdings), the leather and by-products group 70.3 per cent owned by Hillsdown, were below expectations at Pounds 2.23m after exceptional debits of Pounds 562,000. The previous accounting period covered 18 months when pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.43m after an exceptional debit of Pounds 4.55m. Sales were Pounds 83.6m (Pounds 114.6m). There was a tax credit of Pounds 491,000 from the release of an unused provision. Fully diluted earnings per share were 1.05p (0.54p). The annual dividend is unchanged at 1p.</p>

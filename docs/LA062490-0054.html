			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TURNING DOWN TAP  </P> <P> The photo of the fountain outside the San Diego County Administration Center,  published in The Times June 19, apparently was taken before the Board of  Supervisors directed that ornamental fountains at all county government  buildings be shut down. As California enters its fourth year of drought, the  county is turning down the tap on water use at all of its facilities.  </P> <P> ROBERT A.

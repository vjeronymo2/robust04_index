			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CANDIDATE OPPOSES TENT JAIL PROPOSAL  </P> <P> State attorney general candidate Arlo Smith on Wednesday said he disapproves of  a proposal to punish minor drug offenders in Ventura County by jailing them in  tents.  </P> <P> "We don't need to put first-time users in a tent city," said Smith, San  Francisco's district attorney. "We need better and more meaningful treatment  programs that will change their behavior."  </P> <P> Last month, Ventura County Sheriff John V. Gillespie and Dist. Atty. Michael D.  Bradbury proposed jailing recreational drug users in tents on a military base  as part of an overall plan to crack down on the demand for illegal drugs.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, inmates would be assigned to work on the base or to other  cleanup projects, plus mandatory substance-abuse classes.  </P> <P> Smith said he favors drug education and counseling, but he questions  incarcerating those accused of possessing or using drugs for the first time.  </P> <P> The debate over how to curb drug abuse has spilled into the Democratic primary  campaign for attorney general between Smith and his opponent, Los Angeles Dist.  Atty. Ira Reiner.  </P> <P> Reiner said he wants to eliminate the state program to divert first-time  offenders to drug-abuse classes rather than sending them to jail. It is  imperative, Reiner said, to issue stiff penalties for first-time offenders if  America is going to win the war on drugs.  </P> <P> "We did not lose this war overnight and we won't win it overnight either,"  Smith said. "Reiner said that only 20% in these treatment programs get  something out of it, so it isn't worthwhile. My view is if we can save 20%,  that is better than losing all of them by putting them in jail."  </P> <P> Smith made his comments on a campaign swing through Ventura County Wednesday.  His schedule included a speech at Ventura College and a reception sponsored by  Democrats United, a local political action group, to raise money to build a  county Democratic headquarters. KENNETH R.

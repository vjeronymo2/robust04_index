			<p>Heavy   Casualties in Groznyy   <F P=102> LD1406124094 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1045  GMT 14 Jun 94 </F>  <F P=103> LD1406124094 </F> <F P=104>  Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 14 Jun -- Speaking on behalf of the Chechen  government of popular trust, its leader Yaragi Mamodayev today  expressed his condolences to compatriots over the tragic events  in Groznyy. Commenting on the latest developments to an  ITAR-TASS correspondent, he said: "This bloodshed shows that the  process of self-annihilation of the Chechen people, against  which our government has been warning everyone for a whole year,  is exacerbating." Yaragi Mamodayev cited as evidence of this  the fact that forces which, until quite recently, could in  effect have been described as allies, for one reason or another  clashed in Groznyy on 13 June.    According to Yaragi Mamodayev, more people have been killed  in Chechnya since the first bloody conflict in June last year  than in the open war in former Yugoslavia. The number of  casualties in yesterday's tragedy was also several times higher  than official figures suggest.    It is precisely because each day and each hour of the  confrontation is claiming more human lives that our government  once again urges the present Chechen leadership to seek  reconciliation, not just in order to ensure peace for our  compatriots, but for the sake of the very future of the Chechen  people, Yaragi Mamodayev stressed.</p>

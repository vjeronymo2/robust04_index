			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the 15 June Romanian press review] </F>   [Excerpts] Bucharest ROMPRES, 15/6/1994 -- The need for a  balance in the Romanian society, marked these days by extensive  union protests and the celebration of four years since the  miners' descent to Bucharest on 14 June are the major themes  covered by the leading press put out on Wednesday, 15 June.    The protest launched at the beginning of this week in  Bucharest by three major trade union blocs, even if ruled by a  mostly trade-unionist and commemorative character, have turned  into a protest against the current leadership.    Amid street protests, the unilateral initiative of the  opposition National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD]  to launch procedures to suspend Romania's President Ion Iliescu  from his office is one more element to fuel tension in the  political life, according to the press put out today.    Daily CURIERUL NATIONAL considers that the PNTCD's  initiative  is not only "a political lesson," but also and especially "a  lesson of inflexibility and radicalism." The daily remarks that  the history of the past four years shows, among other things,  that radicalism and inflexibility "have had no political impact  on the electorate, but rather on the contrary." Examining the  potential consequences of the PNTCD's initiative, the cited  daily estimates that by this "a definite end was put to the  opposition--leadership dialogue," as it "encouraged the  conservatory group within the ruling party of Social Democracy  Party of Romania [PDSR] to assert that the opposition is an  enemy to fight with" and opened prospects for the ruling party  to consolidate ties with its current allies. Moreover, the  daily considers that all these would have as potential  consequence a speedy access of the National Romanian Unity Party  [PUNR] to ruling, for under the newly created circumstances,  this party "seems an ideal partner in governing."    Daily DIMINEATA writes that "the initiative launched by  PNTCD  leader Corneliu Coposu is in fact his own epitaph." The daily  notes that it is not a serious fact that the PNTCD leader  imagined that he could find two thirds of the parliamentarians  "to embrace his aberration," and that "by this he sets himself  in the service of our country's enemies, who are now seeing  themselves with their lands and enterprises returned as their  property rights."    Several dailies publish and comment on the communique issued  by Romania's presidency in which the accusations brought to  Romania's number one [President Ion Iliescu] are viewed as  "ungrounded." [passage omitted]    Government daily VOCEA ROMANIEI publishes views of several  parliamentarians on the initiative launched by the PNTCD leader,  which they view as "a hit below the belt on democracy," an "at  least hazardous action," or "a bluff."    The dailies also inform that at yesterday's meeting of the  opposition Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] leaders and  leaders of the Democratic Party [PD] a conclusion was reached to  stop the procedure for President Iliescu's suspension from  office and to invite the president to face Parliament and  clarify the disputed aspects. This step is viewed by the  editorialist of daily CRONICA ROMANA as "wise" or as "the most  logical and democratic alternative under the given  circumstances." On the other hand, the opposition is furthering  its radical efforts on the much disputed issue of the draft bill  on nationalized houses, daily ADEVARUL informing its readers  that it is possible for the opposition to totally withdraw from  Parliament, according to an announcement made yesterday by  Gyorgy Frunda, senator of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in  Romania [UDMR].    Under the headline "Union Protests at European Standards,"  government's daily VOCEA ROMANIEI extensively comments on the  protests launched yesterday in Bucharest. The daily remarks the  observance of public order, the civilized articulation of the  various claims, mostly economic ones, and the openness for  dialogue. Daily CRONICA ROMANA welcomes the fact that no  violence was used by demonstrators yesterday. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Economics Ministry has two major limits in its  work this year -- and the 8 to 10 percent level of monthly  inflation by the end of the year, and the 80 percent limit to  the fall in industrial production, the Economics Minister,  Aleksandr Shokhin, told the State Duma at Tuesday's hearings on  budget estimates. His ministry, he said, has already worked out  a program for selective support for industries and a mechanism  for mobilizing private investment under government guarantees to  help support a number of industries, such as aircraft-building.    With reference to the budget estimates the deputy premier  said that the evaluations of the Economics Ministry are in line  with the indexes stipulated in the budget. According to  Shokhin, the main task is to create strict boundaries for the  use of budgetary funds in accordance with the planned goals.    With reference to the unification of Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems Shokhin said that a formula for such  unification has not been defined yet, and therefore the final  documents are not likely to be signed in the near future.</p>

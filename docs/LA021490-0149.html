			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> STUDENTS, ANGERED BY MOYNIHAN REMARK, SEIZE VASSAR BUILDING  </P> <P> Vassar College students, angry over an alleged racial remark by Sen. Daniel  Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), today took over the administration building to  protest a perceived pattern of racial intolerance on campus.  </P> <P> About 300 students were in the protest, including about 75 inside the  administration building housing the offices of President Frances Ferguson.  </P> <P> The protesters called for a boycott of classes. They also called for the school  to hire a rabbi and provide more facilities for handicapped students.  </P> <P> The takeover followed accusations Tuesday by a black local government official  that Moynihan used a racial comment to try to intimidate her at a campus  reception Jan. 29. Folami Gray, a Jamaican who is executive director of the  Dutchess County Youth Bureau, said Moynihan flushed with anger and insulted her  when she disagreed with his contention that America is a model of ethnic  cooperation.  </P> <P> "He responded to me by saying I can pack my bags and return to where I came  from," Gray said.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Moynihan said the senator does not recall making the remark.  </P> <P> Students were demanding that Moynihan be stripped of the prestigious Eleanor  Roosevelt Chair, which was set up in the spirit of the former First Lady to  bring to Vassar individuals who have made a difference advancing the field of  civil rights and other disciplines.  </P></p>

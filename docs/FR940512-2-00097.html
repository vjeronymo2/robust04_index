			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. The Synthetic GICs will not be offered on a pooled basis; in other words, a separate custodial Account will be established for each Plan that enters into a Synthetic GIC with Hartford Life and the assets in that Account will be managed separately from any assets subject to a Synthetic GIC with another Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Hartford Life's guarantee as to principal and interest under a Synthetic GIC will come into play on certain specified dates, namely, the ``Scheduled Account Termination Date'' and any ``Scheduled Account Distribution Date(s)'' provided for prior to the Scheduled Account Termination Date. On those dates, as described in greater detail below (see reps. 15 and 16, below), the Plan will be entitled to distributions from the Account of the ``Adjusted Book Value'' of contributions previously made to the Account. (Specific amounts will be distributed on the Scheduled Account Distribution Date(s), if any, and the balance of the Account's Adjusted Book Value will be distributed on the Scheduled Account Termination Date, at which time the Synthetic GIC will terminate.) Adjusted Book Value is defined as the net asset balance of the Account derived from contributions plus interest at a specified ``Guaranteed Rate of Interest'' determined by mutual agreement between Hartford Life and the Plan, less prior withdrawals. (The Guaranteed Rate of Interest that Hartford Life will be willing to offer under a particular Synthetic GIC will be based on yields on securities of various durations currently available in the marketplace at the time the Synthetic GIC is executed.) In other words, Hartford Life will guarantee that on the Scheduled Account Distribution Date(s) (if any) and on the Scheduled Account Termination Date, distributions will be made to the Plan in amounts at least equal to contributions previously made to the Account, plus interest at the Guaranteed Rate of Interest, with appropriate adjustments for withdrawals (i.e., Scheduled Account Distributions, and Benefit Sensitivity Advances as described in rep. 22, below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The applicants represent that the Guaranteed Rate of Interest for a particular Synthetic GIC will be established by arm's-length negotiation between the Plan and Hartford Life in advance of entering into the contract, and will be set forth in writing in the Synthetic GIC instrument. Once established, the Guaranteed Rate of Interest will not be modified for the term of the agreement. The considerations that will be taken into account in the negotiation process will be essentially the same as those that affect guaranteed interest rates offered under conventional GICs. Under its Synthetic GIC, Hartford Life will be willing to offer a Guaranteed Rate of Interest that takes into account the rate of return it believes it will be able to achieve in managing the assets in the Account, based on currently available investments that are consistent with the investment guidelines imposed by the Plan, and with allowance for Hartford Life's quarterly management fees (see rep. 24, below). The applicants further represent that they and the Plans will be aware of the rates that other companies are offering for similar products. Hartford Life represents that this, together with the Plans' ability to negotiate the investment guidelines (and thus the level of risk) applicable to the Account, will avoid any realistic potential for abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. HIMCO will acknowledge in writing that it will be a fiduciary of each Plan and will be subject to the Act's fiduciary standards in managing the assets in each such Plan's Account. The general investment objectives of the Account will be current income with stability of principal. The agreement governing each Synthetic GIC will instruct HIMCO to manage the Account to achieve a total return over the holding period to maturity which is sufficient to produce the Synthetic GIC's Guaranteed Rate of Interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Each Synthetic GIC will provide investment guidelines for achieving these investment objectives. While there will be some flexibility in the investment guidelines to allow each Synthetic GIC portfolio to be customized to meet the unique needs of the particular Plan, the guidelines will essentially call for HIMCO to apply the same investment techniques that Hartford Life and other life insurance companies use in investing their own general account assets so as to meet guaranteed benefit obligations under life insurance and annuity contracts. A central feature of these techniques is the selection of a portfolio of securities matching contractual obligations as to timing and amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shim'on Sheves, director general of the </F> Prime Minister's Office, by Dalya Shehori; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Shehori] People say you tried to fashion the  prime minister's bureau after the White House team model.    [Sheves] I would not call it "the White House team model,"  but I have definitely been trying to create a structure that  will fit the direct election of the prime minister and the modus  operandi of a prime minister elected in such elections. I have  learned a lot from my meetings, talks, and friendships with  people in the White House and the State Department. Once a year  I meet U.S. administration officials, and next month I will be  meeting the President's advisers and State Department officials.  What I am particularly interested in learning from them is how  to implement the platform the President presented in the  election campaign.    [Shehori] Some structures have not been successful, such as  the follow-up team which collapsed.    [Sheves] Not only did it not collapse, but it became  stronger and its standing with the government ministries is  steadfast. It consists of two branches: One follows up on the  prime minister's decisions, which means working with the  ministries on preeminent issues, such as monitoring the  budgetary expenditures of each ministry. This work is done by  one person, who once a month submits a report to the prime  minister on the activities of all the ministries. A second team  monitors how budgets are spent on interministerial activities.  All in all we are talking about four employees. The second  branch deals with the implementation of administrative decisions  and the removal of red tape on issues such as road paving,  construction, housing, land marketing, and the use of budgets in  the Arab, Bedouin, and Druze sectors. There is yet another  team, the national projects team headed by Yehezqel Har- Melekh,  which deals with the transfer of industrial plants from the  center of the country to development areas, the reclassification  of settlement areas, and localized treatment of problematic  areas.    [Shehori] Is your goal to make the Prime Minister's Office a  super ministry?    [Sheves] I have never talked about a super ministry, but  about an office liaising between all the government ministries.  One of my sorriest conclusions is that the government  ministries are a confederation of offices which require  coordination on almost every subject.    [Shehori] Do you enjoy the full cooperation of all the  ministries?    [Sheves] Most of them. From the Finance Ministry I only get  partial cooperation.    [Shehori] Why?    [Sheves] Because the finance minister and I have different  personalities and we have different views about many issues.    [Shehori] If there is one common denominator to the  departure of several officials from the prime minister's bureau,  this seems to be their frustration over the compartmentalization  and the lack of access to sources of information.    [Sheves] Give me one example.    [Shehori] Elyaqim Rubinstein, who was not let in on the Oslo  process.    [Sheves] So what? He was not the only one who did not know.  Many cabinet ministers did not know either. Rabin and Peres  wanted only a minimum number of people to know the details so  that the negotiations could end successfully. I think it was  the right decision.    Gad Ben-Ari did a good job and for the most part people were  satisfied with it. After two years he decided to move to  another job -- head of the Jewish Agency delegation in the  United States -- which suited him and his family better. Eli  Rubinstein sees his future in the legal field and decided to  pursue a purely legal career as the legal adviser of the defense  establishment, but at the same time he continues to head the  delegation to the talks with Jordan and is doing an excellent  political job. Jacques Neriya reached the conclusion that it  would be best for him, both financially and in terms of  promoting his personal career, if he became the head of the  Histadrut labor federation's international affairs department.  His was one of the most successful appointments in this office  in the last two years.    [Shehori] Are there plans to fill the job left vacant by  Hayim Asad as strategic adviser to the prime minister?    [Sheves] No. He had also been supposed to head the national  security team, but this did not come about. He never dealt with  this issue. His is the only appointment I feel was a failure.  Hayim Asad was not the right man for the job, neither in terms  of his qualifications nor on the personal level.    [Shehori] You have had confrontations with Ministers Ya'aqov  Tzur, Avraham "Beiga" Shohat, and Binyamin "Fu'ad" Ben-Eli'ezer.    [Sheves] I have had no confrontations with Tzur and Fu'ad.  Tzur promised to appoint a friend of ours, Bentzi Weiner, as  director general of the Agriculture Ministry but he did not keep  his promise. Tzur does not deny that he made such a promise,  and I am no longer angry with him. I got angry in the way  friends do, but our dispute ended in September 1992. We work  closely together.    With Fu'ad I have had two professional, not personal,  arguments. One was two years ago over the issue of highways and  junctions and it all ended well, in a friendly and  matter-of-fact manner. Our second argument was over the fact  that I submitted a serious, authoritative, responsible, and  learned study about the rise in the price of apartments in  Israel in the past six months. He did not appreciate this fact  very much, and I understand him. At the same time, there is  cooperation between us and together we worked out the draft  resolution submitted to the cabinet. As for Beiga Shohat, the  issue runs much deeper. I have a serious argument with him  about priorities. I greatly appreciate the macro achievements  in the Israeli economy. The problem is with the micro-strategic  issues, such as tackling the problem of housing in a timely and  firm manner.    [Shehori] Did you expect the prime minister to appoint you  as a minister when Ramon quit?    [Sheves] I did not expect it and I do not think he could.    [Shehori] You had expectations in the political sphere, but  in the end you have been left out of it.    [Sheves] I have not been neutralized at all in the political  sphere, the prime minister includes me in everything. I do not  play a functional role in the negotiations because I am not a  member of any delegation. I have never wanted to be a member or  head of any delegation. I know I am not qualified for such a  job because I have no experience in this field and this is a  very professional area. However, I have assisted and I continue  to assist on many issues in the political sphere.    [Shehori] What are your aspirations?    [Sheves] I will not run in the primaries, I have no plans to  be a politician, I do not want to be either a member of the  Knesset or a cabinet minister. I want to serve Rabin as  director general of the Prime Minister's Office and to be  successful in my job. I will take it from here; I do not plan  anything in advance. I never planned to be the director general  of the Prime Minister's Office.</p>

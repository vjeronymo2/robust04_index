			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (10): Boom has given way to a new caution - Adrian Furnham analyses some noticeable trends in management and business training in the 1990s FOR ALL the impact of recession, training budgets remain large. Companies and public sector organisations buy in (or have in-house) training departments, centres and even country castles to run training courses for their staff. Courses cover all sorts of topics: induction to the organisation, specific job-related or 'people' skills (assertiveness, negotiation) and culture-change developmental workshops aimed at middle or senior management. But economic downturns mean that training budgets look easy targets for cuts; products and technical innovations mean training has to respond to different needs; demographic changes in the internal (employees) and external (purchasing) customers mean that programmes soon become redundant. Many training departments also suffer a poor image. They are seen as a backwater of personnel itself; a refuge for the incompetent. There are some noticeable trends in management and business training in the 1990s The 1980s boom, with its inevitable heroes and fads, has given way to a new caution. Different themes have begun to emerge which are likely to endure. Though not all apparent in all organisations, at least seven themes may be remarked. Learning not Training: Training is about acquiring specific skills; learning is more concerned with general principles. Training is for the here-and-how: company-specific; highly practical, even pragmatic. Learning has less immediate application but is designed to be more useful in various contexts. Companies have preferred training because it is believed to be more cost effective. Many firms do not believe that their task is to provide a rather general university-based education. That, they argue, is a luxury which managers can buy for themselves, but more and more companies see benefit in the well-educated manager; the intelligent generalist. Because there is nothing as practical as good theory they send their people off to acquire an MBA, or on longer developmental courses. The opportunity for learning (as opposed to training) may actually help staff retention in these firms, and might even encourage better applicants. Some companies approach business schools to teach their own client-derived syllabus, but taught and approved by the university. So the manager gets organisation-approved education plus a degree. A less provincial, chauvinistic, ethnocentric perspective: We now have a global market, an international work-force and multi-national products. Management has had to take this into consideration. Cosy 'we-they' stories, case histories from local companies and a homogeneous work-force are things of the past. All managers need a wider perspective - not just pan-European, but the global market. Hence the focus on cultural differences, and comprehensive briefings on how companies in other countries do things. The 'little Englander' trainer, like the vulgar American consultant, faces extinction. Euro-sceptics are not welcome in the training centre. All managers are being encouraged to be multi-lingual and comfortable in cross-cultural communication. Competency-led training: - Despite the vagueness of the concept of competency, many organisations have been forced to think through exactly which skills, abilities and traits they require of their managers. Having done this they are frequently much more focused on what sort of training is needed. In the past, trainers provided what was thought appropriate - or, more prosaically, what they could offer. Now they are being required to integrate the training programme into the company's overall competence-led training or human resource strategy. Courses which do not fit may be jettisoned. Others may have to be created to meet the needs of the proposed strategy. In this sense training follows strategy, although competencies are often defined so vaguely that the trainers can easily adapt what they have to satisfy their clients in the board room. Team building rather than leadership: If the 1980s was the 'me' decade and the 1990s is the 'we' decade, how is this reflected in management training? Nearly everyone works in groups; business success is, we are told, dependent not on individual but on teams. It really is true that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Heterogeneous teams - those with overall ability but whose members each have different skills, preferences and approaches that complement each other, do best. Just as people may have to be trained to become leaders, they may also have to be trained to be followers. Training programmes now focus on how to build, sustain and manage a team; how to assess your favourite and most comfortable role when operating a team; how to select individuals with a team in mind, and how to be a better team member. Virtual-reality training: Trainers have always worried about the 'generalisability' of training - that is, whether what you learn on courses in comfortable hotels or cosy training centres actually gets applied, let alone remembered, in the real work setting. The more realistic or similar the training environment to the work environment, the less, by definition, is there a problem of generalisation. Airlines spend on simulators. Trainers, too, are now considering training in situ - on the shop floor, in the executive office or in the sales room. Though this may cause some inconvenience or even danger to customer or equipment, it is thought worth it. Shadowing - observing someone on the job, is becoming more popular and, supposedly, a useful teaching aid. (This development may be bad news for hotels making money from chalk-and-talk seminars.) Using managers as trainers: It is not only because of the expense of staffing a permanent training department, or calling in egotistical consultants, that there is a trend for managers to become trainers themselves. People rightly expect that in some circumstances managers can act as trainers, because they are the ones with the most relevant knowledge. Most managers have the time and the skill to become explicit trainers rather than simply people to be imitated. They can do a very useful job. Some organisations have attempted to re-define job titles to reflect this. (Thus supervisors may become 'coaches'; and managers 'the support staff.' Using subordinate feedback: Most managers are used to being appraised by their superiors, and occasionally by their peers. Trainers, on the other hand, are used to being rated by their course attenders. Many organisations are even considering using subordinate ratings, not only as useful feedback technique in training, but also a possible source of data for staff appraisals. More and more trainers now are using upward or 'bottom-up' feedback compared to the more traditional downward appraisal. But pity the middle aged, middle-brow, middle manager who, as part of his training, has to learn business French; go on outdoor training courses to be a good team member; is called a marketing coach; and is rated on his performance by a youth just out of a 'new' university business school.

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / People: Drake: putting BR Telecoms back on track The appointment of John Drake as chief executive of British Rail Telecommunications marks another attempt by BR to get the privatisation of its telecom subsidiary back on track. BR has been looking to spin off BRT for some time as a potential competitor to BT and Mercury in the UK's long-distance telecoms market. But the previous chief executive, Peter Borer, left abruptly in October after reported clashes with Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, over the sell-off plans. Borer had been attempting to promote a management buy-out of BRT, but the necessary private-sector backing for the venture does not appear to have been forthcoming. Drake, 42, will have to take BRT back to the drawing board. As the managing director of GEC Marconi Transport Systems, he knows something of the business. But he will need to move quickly. The government wants to sell off BRT late next year. Before then, responsibility for rail signalling safety passes from BR to Railtrack, which will be free to employ other private-sector suppliers besides BRT.</p>

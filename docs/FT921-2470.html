			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farming groups seek safety in numbers - A merger that will create the country's biggest agricultural co-operative INCREASING competition in agriculture has just wrought the largest ever consolidation of farmer co-operatives in the US. Farmland Industries, the Kansas City-based co-operative that ranks 143rd on the Fortune 500 list of industrial companies, and Union Equity, based in Enid, Oklahoma, the biggest US grain co-operative, have agreed on a merger. This would result in the largest agricultural co-operative in the US, surpassing Agway in DeWitt, New York. The combined assets of Farmland and Union Equity exceed Dollars 1.7bn. But even at this size, Farmland will face some significant risks in re-entering the grain trade. The US world market share in grains has been shrinking steadily in recent years, with American maize exports at the lowest point in 15 years and wheat exports at the lowest in nine, according to grain market analyst Mr Daniel Basse, research director of AgResource in Chicago. While the US has claimed a big slice of exports to the former Soviet Union - which it has won largely through government credits  - it has lost significant market share in other grain importing countries. Decreasing exports have exerted such pressure on the US grain industry in recent years that it has suffered a shake down, with numerous companies consolidating or going out of business. Union Equity, which exports more than half its members' production, has not escaped unscathed, losing some Dollars 20m since 1989. In addition, it has had difficulty in earning profits on its grain storage elevators. While these once were used by the US government to store grain stocks, a change of policy by Washington on storage has left excess capacity in elevators. Union Equity had to close seven of its 17 terminal elevators in 1990 and attempted, but failed, to sell other elevators last year. Some in the grain trade suggest that Union Equity needs a cash infusion and they wonder if Farmland will have the deep pockets required to keep it afloat. Under the proposed deal, which is expected to be approved in June, Farmland would purchase the assets of Union Equity. Terms of the sale have not been disclosed. The merger does, however, have considerable potential benefits for both partners. Farmland, a manufacturing and food marketing co-operative with 1,820 members in 19 states, makes fertiliser, feed, batteries, tyres, agricultural chemicals, animal care and petroleum products, as well as pork, bacon and sausages for consumers. Last year, it earned Dollars 50.2m on sales of Dollars 3.6bn. Although its recent diversification efforts have largely been meat-related, Farmland wants to step back into the grain business to secure supplies for its value-added food and feed products. Its previous experience in the grain industry was with the acquisition in the 1970s of Far-Mar-Co, a grain marketer with large storage facilities. But as the economy soured in the early 1980s and losses accumulated, Farmland was forced to sell Far-Mar-Co in 1984. The buyer was Union Equity. Union Equity, with 480 members in nine central and south-western states, is a top buyer and exporter of hard red winter wheat and grain sorghum, or milo. Union Equity moved during the last decade to broaden its commodity base, adding some maize, soyabeans and other grains. Last year, it had sales of Dollars 1.1bn and is expected to have sales this year of Dollars 1.7bn, according to Farmland officials. Union Equity's spokesman, Mr Jim Erickson, said that the co-operative has wanted to become more involved in food processing and value-added products using grains and that Farmland offered that opportunity. Since 1990 it has already moved in the value-adding direction with the purchase of a part ownership in the Kansas City-based grain processing firm, Cereal Foods. Many in American farming circles believe that they must move into more value-added products to reduce their vulnerabilities in the volatile commodities markets and to raise their profit possibilities. The two co-operatives say that a merger will serve the interests of their memberships, which have a considerable overlap. They had in fact discussed a merger in 1990, but talks were interrupted by Farmland, which decided to embark on a restructuring of its field sales and marketing and its financial structure before pursuing the consolidation. 'The transaction is completely compatible with our two organisations' mutual strategic goal of furthering our members'interest in value-added food system marketing activities,' said Mr William Allen, president of Union Equity and Mr HD Cleberg, president of Farmland, in a joint statement.</p>

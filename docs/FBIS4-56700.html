			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alberto Pepe Leira] </F>   [Text] Montevideo, 6 May (EFE) -- Uruguay today implemented  preventive diplomatic action against the possible unilateral  intervention by the United States in Haiti which, in the opinion  of Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu, would aggravate an  already very serious situation in Haiti.    During a news conference for foreign journalists, Abreu  stated that his country opposes any type of unilateral action in  Haiti, and has called for rapid action by the OAS for an  in-depth study of the crisis being experienced by the Caribbean  nation.    The meeting that has been called for today in Washington by  the Permanent Council of the OAS, at the petition of Uruguay, is  the first concrete action to be carried out after reports were  disseminated in the U.S. press regarding a possible unilateral  U.S. military action.    Asked about the international community's possible lateness  in acting against the problem that arose after the coup d'etat  against constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is  currently in exile in the United States, Abreu stated that  Uruguay backs the Governor's Island Agreements that were signed  in 1993, and does not want the situation to deteriorate.    OAS actions will be based on the latest reports and  proposals  made by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, whose  members will once again visit Haiti to determine the seriousness  of the deterioration of individual rights.    The Commission will visit the island between 16 and 20 May,  and its members will meet with Haitian personalities and  citizens.    The foreign minister stated that his country is promoting  the  "political receptiveness to beginning to work more profoundly  for a diplomacy that attempts to prevent a unilateral armed  action, which would cause a deterioration in the situation and  would favor no one."    "Uruguay is a jealous defender of nonintervention, and is  willing to work for and support all leads toward a solution,"  the foreign minister stressed.    Abreu acknowledged that up to the present time there has  been  no success, but he insisted that "armed unilateral intervention  is not the solution."    The foreign minister reported that he has the support of  Brazil, Chile, and Bolivia after rapid telephone conversations  with his colleagues and with the Mexican Embassy to evaluate the  matter and to prevent a possible unilateral armed intervention.    "Our country will support every lead toward a solution that  is undertaken within the bounds of international law and by  competent organizations," the minister said.    The Uruguayan foreign minister summed up his position by  indicating that in view of the seriousness of the Haitian crisis  it is urgent that it be "discussed within an atmosphere of  preventive diplomacy."    "Uruguay does not support individual action, but does  support  multilateral action," he stressed.    Uruguayan diplomacy indicates that the reactivation of and  new dimensions for the OAS will be a fundamental step in  resolving the Haitian crisis.    "The principles of nonintervention and self-determination  are  not negotiable," the foreign minister insisted, in explaining  how the work to promote "preventive diplomacy" will be carried  out.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Right wing leads 1922 race MR BOB DUNN, MP for Dartford, is being tipped to win the election for the vice-chairmanship of the backbench 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs - a move that would dash government hopes of diluting rightwing influence on the influential body. Mr Dunn is one of 13 candidates from the right or centre-right of the party who will be supported by the rightwing 92 group in elections to the 1922's executive. These will almost certainly take place on November 25 - a week into the new parliamentary session. In last year's election the 92 group was highly successful at securing its candidates both on the 1922 committee and the chairmanships of other Tory backbench committees. This was widely seen as reflecting a pronounced shift to the right in the parliamentary party as a result of last year's general election when several rightwingers were elected to parliament for the first time. Other MPs on the 92 group's 'slate' for the 1922 executive include Mr David Evans, the outspoken MP for Welwyn Hatfield, Sir Rhodes Boyson (Brent North), Mr John Townend (Bridlington) and Sir George Gardiner (Reigate). Those on the slate who are already on the executive have meanwhile been targeted for replacement by MPs loyal to Mr John Major, the prime minister. These loyalists believe their presence in prominent positions could undermine government efforts to build party unity.</p>

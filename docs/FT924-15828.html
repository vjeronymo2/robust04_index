			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Ten advice 'shops' to open next year TEN pilot 'one-stop shops' will be set up next year to co-ordinate advice to businesses, Baroness Denton, minister responsible for small businesses, announced yesterday. The 10 will be the first of a national network of 200 to be set up over the next few years. So many organisations offered services to business that the owner or manager did not know where to start, Baroness Denton said at an Anglo-German Chambers of Commerce conference in Bonn. She explained that the 'one-stop shops' were intended to provide access to every service a business needs through one centre and to bring under one umbrella the agencies that provide help to businesses. 'The greatest need of many firms is for high quality and timely business information, expert advice and improved business skills,' she said.

They need to know where to go, or whom to phone, and to be confident they will hit the right target first time.'</p>

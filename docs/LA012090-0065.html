			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PAUL NEWMAN GIVES $50,000 FOR HOUSING  </P> <P> Actor Paul Newman's success in selling salad dressings and spaghetti sauces is  benefiting, to the tune of $50,000, a nonprofit organization that plans to  build low-income housing in San Diego and Tijuana.  </P> <P> Newman's food company, Newman's Own, has donated $275,000 to Habitat for  Humanity International, earmarking $50,000 of that to go toward the Jimmy  Carter Work Project, to be conducted by the organization's San Diego division.  </P> <P> The project hopes to build 100 houses in Tijuana and seven in Southeast San  Diego during the week of June 17-23, project director Jeff Snider said.  </P> <P> The houses will be sold at cost, with interest-free 15- to 20-year mortgages,  to low-income families. The future homeowners will typically invest hundreds of  hours in construction work to build their houses, as well as those of others,  and promise to pay back about $30,000 in construction costs.  </P> <P> "We would like to make the issue of affordable housing a matter of conscience,"  Snider said. "This is a one-week event intended to bring attention to the need  for affordable housing."  </P> <P> The project will cost $2 million, Snider said, and the $50,000 "goes a long way  towards that goal." Half of the money has been raised.  </P> <P> About 2,000 volunteers will be needed for the project, to build houses, act as  support and provide meals and temporary housing for workers, Snider said.  </P> <P> This is the fifth time Newman has donated to Habitat for Humanity, an  organization with 445 projects in the United States and 81 projects in 27 other  countries. All profits of Newman's Own are given to charities. Last year, the  company gave $7 million to more than 300 charities worldwide.  </P> <P> Habitat for Humanity in San Diego may be reached at (619) 233-7551.  </P></p>

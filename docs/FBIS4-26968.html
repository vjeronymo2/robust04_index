			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung and Connie Law] </F>   [Text] Governor Chris Patten will today make a last-ditch  bid to persuade two wavering independent legislators to support  his electoral proposals to fend off the threat posed by the  Liberal Party's watered-down reform plan. The votes of Marvin  Cheung Kin-tung and Timothy Ha Wing-ho might decide the fate of  Mr Patten's two-year battle for greater democracy in the  territory. Neither could be reached last night.    Some Legislative Council [Legco] members admitted that the  battle between Mr Patten's proposal and the Liberal Party  package which seeks to bring electoral changes more in line with  the Basic Law, had become a "neck-and-neck" race. They say the  margin would be in the range of "one or two votes."    The chances of the Liberal Party holding sway in Legco  tomorrow took a sharp turn for the better yesterday, when seven  pro-China legislators indicated they had changed their earlier  position and would lend their support to the watered-down  proposals.    The seven are Tam Yiu-chung, Chim Pui-chung, Philip Wong Yu-  hong, Peggy Lam Pei Yu-dja, Alfred Tso Shiu-wai, Dr Tang  Siu-tong, and David Li Kwok-po.    A senior mainland official said last night: "The choice is  clear: the Liberal Party proposal is better than Patten's.  There are now two proposals on the table. We are in effect  supporting Patten's if we do not support the Liberal Party's."    The official said Beijing would spell out clearly that  support for the Liberal Party alternative did not mean that its  political structure would survive after 1997. Beijing, however,  has not put pressure on pro-China legislators to support the  package, the official said. "The chances of success for the  Liberal Party proposal is now 50/50. There might be some  accidental factors at the debate. We can't say which proposal  will win... After all, I do believe that Patten will have his  ways to get his proposals passed," he said.    A senior official said last night the government still  believed that its proposal would win a majority in Legco.    The vote, however, hinges on the independents. With 15 votes  from its members and the seven of pro-China colleagues, the  Liberal Party needs eight more from independents to impose its  package.    Three independents, Eric Li Ka-cheung, Elsie Tu, and Roger  Luk Koon-ho, said they would support the Liberal Party  amendments. It is believed those in favour of the amendments  include Samuel Wong Ping-wai, Simon Ip Sik-on, Vincent Cheng  Hoi-chuen and Martin Barrow.    The Liberal Party pressed Mr Patten to instruct the three  officials who sit in Legco not to cast their votes. But in a  statement issued after Mr Patten's meeting with three Liberal  Party leaders, a government spokesman said Mr Patten had made it  clear that the three ex-officio members would vote in support of  the government proposal. Mr Patten said it would be wrong to  make artificial distinctions between councillors in the way  suggested by the Liberal Party. "Every member of the council  has the right to vote and every vote is of equal weight."    The spokesman pointed to the fact that apart from the three  official members there were another 18 appointed members. Eight  of these appointed members are also members of the Liberal Party.</p>

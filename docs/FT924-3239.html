			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / BR freight customers unite to protest at price rises A LOBBY GROUP representing British Rail's freight customers yesterday warned that price increases imposed by BR were in danger of driving 2m tonnes of freight a year - equivalent to 80,000 truckloads - on to the roads. The newly formed Freight on Rail group said BR's price rises conflicted with environmental goals and the government's policy of encouraging road freight to switch to rail. Freight on Rail, claiming the support of more than 150 companies including BR freight customers, rail wagon manufacturers and other railway equipment suppliers, said BR was seeking to increase freight rates by 80 per cent to 120 per cent. Customers had decided to switch 700,000 tonnes of bulk freight such as cement and oil to road, the group said, adding that a total of 2m tonnes of freight a year was in jeopardy. About 90 per cent of conventional container traffic could also switch to road, it claimed. Mr Mike Harvey, general manager of CAIB UK, a wagon-leasing group, said the price rises appeared aimed at reducing BR's freight operations to a profitable core in readiness for privatisation. He and other Freight on Rail members feared that lower freight flows would mean higher costs because overheads would have to be shared. 'We are getting to the stage where you no longer have a critical mass, and when that critical mass is not there you no longer have a railfreight industry,' Mr Harvey said. BR's Trainload Freight subsidiary said it had increased prices only for traffic which otherwise had no viable future on the railway. 'We are under a government remit which requires us to operate commercially,' it said. 'We cannot keep traffic which does not make a positive financial return.' Continental train operators using Britain's railway tracks after January 1 will pay the same rates as those already agreed for Channel tunnel traffic, the Department of Transport announced yesterday. However, the deal will be short-lived because it will be superseded by a radically different track charging regime due to take effect with rail privatisation in April 1994. It will affect little traffic before then because the Channel tunnel is not due to open until December next year. The only access to Britain for Continental trains will be by the daily SNCF (French railways) train ferry from Dover to Dunkirk. The charges were published yesterday in response to an EC directive requiring member nations to open their tracks to international passenger and freight trains from January 1.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Toby Helm, Valerie Elliott: "Beckett Loses Out </F> to `Dream Ticket'"]    [Text] Support for Margaret Beckett's bid to win the Labour  deputy leadership appeared to be crumbling among MPs last night  -- increasing the chances that a Tony Blair and John Prescott  "dream ticket" will lead the party into the next election.    Mrs Beckett's recent attempts to court the Labour Left by  suggesting that all union laws may need to be swept away and  that the water industry might be re-nationalised under her  leadership appear to have damaged her standing with moderate  Labour MPs.    Some have also been angered at Mrs Beckett's attempts to  portray herself as the candidate who represents "continuity"  from John Smith. They point out that she failed to offer the  late Labour leader unequivocal support in last October's  conference battle over one member, one vote.    Last night several MPs including women, who had previously  either nominated Mrs Beckett for the deputy job or had declined  to name a preferred candidate, were said to have moved towards  Mr Prescott.    One of those who had been undecided, Kate Hoey, MP for  Vauxhall, said: "I think I will be voting for John Prescott  because, although he is not the warmest person to deal with, he  is consistent. I feel no guilt that I will not be voting for  another woman."    A female colleague said: "I think Margaret has been arrogant  in saying she is better than all the other candidates and she is  the one who knows the party far better than everyone else. She  has done herself no good."    Supporters of Mr Prescott said that enough of those who had  nominated Mrs Beckett had now changed their minds to give him a  lead among MPs.    Yesterday all the leadership candidates addressed a  conference of the health union Unison in Scarborough.    Labour is ahead of the Scottish Nationalists by only two per  cent in the by-election in Mr Smith's former seat of Monklands  East, according to a survey. The poll for the Glasgow-based  SUNDAY MAIL puts Labour on 45 per cent.</p>

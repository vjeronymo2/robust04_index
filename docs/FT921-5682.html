			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Aeroports de Paris slips to FFr381m AEROPORTS de Paris, the company that operates 14 Paris airports including Charles de Gaulle and Orly, sustained a slight fall in net profits to FFr381m (Dollars 68.03m) in 1991 from FFr410m in 1990. Mr Bernard Lathere, chairman, said that Aeroports de Paris, like other travel companies, was hit by the instability in the travel market last year. The number of passengers going through Orly and Charles de Gaulle, the two largest Paris airports, fell by 3.3 per cent. Orly attracted 23.3m passengers and Charles de Gaulle 22m. The level of freight business was also depressed by just over 2 per cent to 853,000 tonnes and the volume of mail fell by 5.8 per cent to 59,000 tonnes. Turnover, according to Mr Lathere, should have risen by about 5 per cent to FFr5.3bn in 1991. Aeroports de Paris, which also has interests in property, plans to raise its investment to FFr3.2bn in 1992 representing an increase of 76 per cent over last year.</p>

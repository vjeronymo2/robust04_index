			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): TUC rules on NHS union row - Recruitment dispute decision may rouse government anger THE TRADES Union Congress is likely to face criticism from the government after a TUC committee advised the FDA Civil Service union against recruiting senior managers in the health service. The committee said it saw no reason why other unions - including Nalgo, the public-services union, which complained about the FDA's recruitment intentions - should accept requests from their members to transfer to the FDA. The incident is politically sensitive because the government plans to legislate to weaken the TUC's adjudication role in inter-union disputes by giving individuals a legal right to join the union of their choice. Both the FDA and Nalgo claimed victory after the report of the disputes committee, which said it was unable to accept Nalgo's contention that the FDA should be instructed not to recruit any NHS managers. Previously the FDA's membership had been restricted to the Civil Service and Nalgo said it would be moving into its sphere of influence by recruiting NHS managers. However, the committee said the introduction of a further union into the NHS would not be helpful. It hoped the FDA would reconsider its decision. The dispute occurred after a group among 800 general managers, some of them Nalgo members, approached the FDA for membership. The FDA says the managers were attracted by its offer of services to people on individual contracts. Mr Keith Sonnet, Nalgo assistant general secretary, said his union was concerned that recruitment among the 800 would provide the FDA with a foothold in the NHS to recruit among 9,000 other managers. The FDA always denied that was its intention. The disputes committee said the FDA should cease recruitment if the government restored the collective bargaining agreements that were withdrawn in 1986. The TUC would make no official comment yesterday. One union leader said the decision showed that the disputes committee contributed towards sound industrial relations. The London region of the TGWU general union is holding an inquiry into alleged ballot rigging in elections for the Ford regional automotive committee. An inquiry into alleged ballot rigging in elections for the TGWU construction trade group is also expected soon.</p>

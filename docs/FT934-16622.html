			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (6): More changes ahead - The retail industry RETAIL distribution in the UK has undergone two big processes of change in the past two decades. In the 1990s, it may undergo a third. Retailers have led the way in centralising and contracting out distribution, and have done much to make that the norm across many different industries. The process began in the 1970s, when supermarkets started using their growing financial muscle to wrest control of the supply chain away from suppliers and manufacturers. They established their own warehouses which suppliers were instructed to deliver to, instead of direct to the stores. The impetus for the move was the development of larger and larger supermarkets. Food retailers realised they had to maximise selling space and cut down storage space in their shops in order to compete. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the situation changed again as retailers began consolidating networks of small local warehouses into a handful of much larger warehouses. Technology also advanced rapidly, with computer systems linked to scanning technology giving retailers much greater information about customers' buying patterns, and allowing them to control the supply chain much more closely. As retailers began to pour money into expanding their superstore chains, however, they started to cut down their investment in distribution, increasingly contracting out that function - and the associated investment - to third party specialists. At first, that was largely at the level of vehicle fleet hire, but eventually third-party contractors began to provide everything from transport and personnel to warehousing. By the beginning of the 1990s, retail distribution in the UK was highly centralised. The Institute of Grocery Distribution found that an average of 83 per cent of goods were distributed centrally by retail multiples in 1991. Tesco had reached 97 per cent; Argyll, owner of Safeway, 93.5 per cent; and J Sainsbury 92 per cent. At the same time, the average level of contracted-out distribution has reached about 50 per cent. Dr John Fernie, of Dundee Business School, editor of the International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, has conducted a recent survey of third-party distribution and says Tesco contracts out 55 per cent of its distribution; Safeway 35 per cent; Sainsbury 60 per cent; and Asda about 70 per cent. The fruits of these changes are evident from a survey by the Institute of Logistics and Distribution Management which showed that UK retailers have cut spending on distribution from 12.3 per cent of total costs in 1983 to 4.7 per cent in 1992. That makes their distribution costs considerably cheaper than those for many retail chains in continental Europe, and is one reasons why they achieve higher operating margins than overseas counterparts. But in the 1990s, a third change may be on the way. Industry experts say the buzzwords are 'efficient customer response'. The principal aim in distribution is now to reduce the amount of stock held at all points along the supply chain, to try to move ever closer to the ideal, whereby goods are whisked onto the supermarket shelves almost as soon as they come off the production lines. Mr Ian Canadine, director-general of the Institute of Logistics, says retailers have previously tried to shift as much as possible of the stockholding and associated costs onto suppliers. Now, however, they are realising that those costs will eventually be passed back to them in the form of higher prices for products, and they would do better to examine how to reduce costs along the whole supply chain, to everyone's mutual benefit. To achieve that requires greater co-operation between retailers and suppliers. Ideally, suppliers need to receive Epos (electronic point of sale) information to allow them to plan their production according to genuine sales data rather than retailers' forecasts. To achieve the greatest efficiency, however, suppliers need to receive information from all their main customers. Perhaps the most important 1990s buzzword, therefore, is 'partnershipping'. Mr Jim Young, business director at PA Consulting Group, who has headed several retail distribution projects, says the benefits of partnershipping can be considerable. One project where a retailer was encouraged to co-operate with suppliers resulted in a 30 per cent reduction in stockholding, from six weeks to four weeks. The sticking points, he says, include the traditionally combative relationship between retailers and suppliers, and nervousness among retailers about revealing Epos information. 'The biggest question is how you split the benefit down between the manufacturer and the supplier,' he adds. Closer relationships are developing, however. Asda, the UK's fourth-largest superstore operator, is leading the way in sharing Epos information with suppliers. If the tendency spreads, retailers' warehouses may be used less for storage and more as trans-shipment centres. If that happens, Dr Fernie speculates that retailers could find their heavy investment in large distribution centres in the 1980s has left them with bigger facilities than they need in the 1990s. Another important trend in the industry is for expertise developed in the food retailing sector to be transferred into the non-food area, which has been slower to adopt centralised distribution. 'What all the sophisticated composite distributors are looking at now is non-food,' says Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman of Hays, the business services group. The process is already starting. Laura Ashley, the UK fashion and furnishings group, has brought in Federal Express Business Logistics on a 10-year contract worth at least Pounds 150m. Its mission is to sort out a somewhat labyrinthine distribution system, halve the value of stock in the supply chain to Pounds 30m, and cut logistics costs by up to 12.5 per cent. Finally, an important challenge to distribution specialists is the increasing internationalisation of retailing. The pace of cross-border expansion, mergers and acquisitions has quickened in the past year, and the advent of the single European market is likely to accelerate the trend for supermarkets to join European buying groups. As retailers expand beyond their national borders, demand will increase for distribution and logistics specialists with European, and even global, reach.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Iraqi Kurds to stage election IRAQ'S Kurds vote tomorrow in an election conducted in a carnival atmosphere but condemned by the regime of President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad and by Turkey and Iran, the two neighbouring states with large Kurdish populations. The election is another attempt by the Kurds to assert the right to a free and independent state and comes in the wake of the severe setback they suffered when Baghdad partially crushed their spontaneous uprising in the wake of the Gulf war. The poll has been organised by the Kurdistan Front, a coalition of seven parties which has administered the region following the creation by allied forces of 'safe havens'. Although party allegiance is based partly on loyalties forged during decades of hardship, disruption and war, an important new issue has emerged: whether Iraqi Kurdistan should break entirely from Iraq. Mr Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), is seeking a mandate for autonomy within Iraq. But Mr Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), supports 'self-determination' for the region.</p>

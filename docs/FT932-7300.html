			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Bill from Ulster bombs put at Pounds 22m THE FOUR powerful car bombs detonated in Northern Ireland since last Thursday will cost the taxpayer an estimated Pounds 22m in compensation, estimates from the Northern Ireland Office indicated yesterday. The first bomb last Thursday, which contained 1,000lbs of home-made explosive, exploded near the headquarters of the Ulster Unionist party in Belfast, causing damage estimated at Pounds 6.5m. A 1,000lb bomb exploded in the centre of Portadown in County Armagh on Saturday morning, causing Pounds 8m damage. On Sunday, a 300lb bomb caused Pounds 2.5m damage to the Drumkeen hotel in Belfast, and was followed in the evening by another 1,000lb bomb in the town of Magherafelt in south Londonderry, which devastated its commercial centre and caused Pounds 5m damage. Speaking in Londonderry yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, said: 'We have been through a hard period of four days. There may be more to come; I cannot guarantee that there will not. What I can guarantee is that the IRA are not going to succeed.' The new bombing campaign has been met with calls from unionist leaders for a return of internment of IRA suspects. Mr John Taylor, an Ulster Unionist MP, said the security situation in the province was 'deteriorating' and called on Sir Patrick to introduce internment and identity cards. Mr Sammy Wilson, an official of the Democratic Unionist party warned at the weekend that 'many sincere young men' from the Protestant community will take the law into their own hands if the security forces do not crack down on IRA suspects. Sir Patrick was conferring with police and Army chiefs in the province yesterday, but it is unlikely that he will be rushed into action. When internment was first used in the 1970s it provoked a violent backlash from the nationalist community, and was generally considered a political blunder. Today Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, are meeting in Dublin in the latest of Anglo-Irish conference meetings. The main item on the agenda will be how to get the province's political parties back around the negotiating table to discuss a new political framework for Northern Ireland.</p>

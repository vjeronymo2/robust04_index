			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Observer: From little acorns grow Here is one for Gardener's Question time. How do you ensure that a small press release from an unknown firm of Shropshire seed merchants - highlighting the shortage of British acorns - can grow into a healthy Euro-scare story from which cuttings can happily be taken only a few weeks after first blossom? The press release, designed to drum up business for the company, caught Fleet Street's imagination because it drew attention to a little known UK Forestry Commission regulation based on an EC directive. Anyone establishing a plantation of young trees for forestry purposes can only use acorns from one of 42 registered oak 'stands' in the UK. As a result of this year's poor crop, demand will have to be met by importing foreign acorns from countries such as Poland. The regulation - in force for well over a decade - only applies when UK government grants for planting oak trees are concerned. There is nothing to stop any private individual or land-owner from collecting acorns and growing oak for their own use. However, let's not spoil a good story. Having started with 'Euro-meddlers try to fell our oaks' and 'British acorns not good enough says Brussels', by yesterday the Independent on Sunday and the Sunday Express were both blaming the UK acorns' problems on Adolf Hitler. The Brussels directive is said to be based on a German Forest Race law drafted when Hitler was in power. The Forestry Commission believes the current row is a nonsense - a view shared by Bryan Cassidy, the Tory MEP who drew Observer's attention to the affair. British oaks were wiped out in the ice age and most of the oaks in Britain today have come from the continent. So much for the Daily Express' view that German or French oak is 'about as tough as Stork margarine'.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Baltics struggle to muster a credible defence: Russia's army left little when it departed, except poorly trained conscripts and a Soviet military ethic of dubious value When the Russian army left the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, it took every piece of useful military hardware which was not nailed down. To complete the job, much of what was nailed down was ruined: the vandalism was so petty that even barracks toilets had concrete poured into the plumbing to make them unusable. As a result, the Baltic states, poor and poorly organised, have little effective defence against their heavyweight neighbour. The three countries have only small arms, a few thousand barely trained conscripts, a greater number of enthusiastic but amateur home guards and some ex-Soviet professional soldiers of varying honesty. What is worse, neither Estonia, Latvia nor Lithuania has any money to improve matters. There is no doubt that if the Russians decided to re-invade tomorrow, they would face little effective resistance. Small wonder then that the Baltic states are looking to the west for help. The objective of all three is full membership of Nato in the shortest possible order, but most Baltic military commanders and politicians are realistic enough to know that remains a long term ambition. Nato would be reluctant to commit itself to the defence of areas a long way forward of its main bases, and is also sensitive to Russian concerns. The idea that the Baltic states could become a forward base from which Nato power could threaten Moscow plays into the hands of Russian hardliners. Nato is probably also unwilling to incorporate countries which cannot pay for their own defence. 'Nato membership is a matter of responsibilities as well as rights,' said Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, recently. 'We have no objection in principle to expanding Nato membership, but potential members must be able to make a contribution.' While they work towards full membership, all three countries are desperately seeking diplomatic and military ties which pull them into the western sphere and out of Russia's orbit. All have signed up for Nato's Partnership for Peace initiative, which offers co-operation and joint exercises; they have also agreed to form a Baltic battalion which would be available for UN peacekeeping operations. The working language of the battalion will be English, and the troops will be trained by Scandinavian and British soldiers. Political visits, such as that by Mr Rifkind last week, are another important signal which the Balts wish to use to strengthen their position. The Baltic defence strategy currently is to raise the political price of any Russian interference. If the Baltic states' profile is sufficiently high in the west, a colonially-minded Russian leadership might decide that pressure on the states was not worth the candle. If that strategy is to work, however, the Baltic states will have to reform their armed forces sufficiently to work with the west. That is no small task because equipment and properly working barracks are not all they lack. Since their previous defence forces were the ex-Soviet army, they have no indigenous military structures. Those regular officers who are available served with Soviet forces. Many of them still cleave to Soviet military doctrines and do not wish to learn Nato-style methods. Some are also corrupt. These concerns have led Estonia to appoint a retired US Army colonel and Estonian emigre, Aleksander Einseln, as armed forces commander on a salary of Dollars 700 a month. 'We have to build a professional armed force under civilian rule,' said Gen Einseln last week. 'When I first took this job on (last year) I thought it would take two years, but I was too optimistic. It would have been better to start from scratch, because then we wouldn't have had to get rid of all the old Soviet habits.' Gen Einseln, who says he has 'no plans to invade Russia before the year 3000' is also finding it hard to bridge the cultural gap with his ex-Soviet colleagues. 'I come from a place where the norm is to tell the truth. Here the norm is to lie.' Latvia and Lithuania have even further to go in reforming their armed forces, not least because many senior officers do not accept the need to move to western ways. Besides reform, the Balts must also hang together if they are to secure western assistance. The states have little in common save geography and compete for export markets for many of their products. The rivalry runs deep: Mr Rifkind signed co-operation agreements in all three states last week, and observers in each country were keen to know how their memorandum differed from the others. Deep down, army commanders may know they need to co-operate and offer each other security guarantees, but there is little political drive to do so. The most immediate aim for all three states, however, is to construct credible defence forces. In that they are being realistic: the assistance they are asking from Nato members is mostly training, rather than heavy weapons which they could not use effectively. Yet the legacy of 50 years of Soviet occupation is heavy, and has seeped into every corner of life. In one example which stands as a metaphor, military airfields, and the surrounding water tables, have been contaminated with aviation fuel. During Soviet rule Russian pilots, reluctant to train in aircraft they considered unsafe, falsified their flight logs. Unfortunately, this left them with an embarrassing amount of unused fuel, so before the regular tanker deliveries arrived they drained the excess into nearby fields. It is going to take the Baltic states a long time to clean up the mess.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 6 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata reiterated Friday that Justice Minister Shigeto  Nagano's remarks concerning Japan's role in World War II were  "inappropriate" and said he regrets that they were made.  Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, Hata, who is on a  tour of four European nations, said, "the remarks of Justice  Minister Nagano were not appropriate. I frankly regret... I  telephoned and reprimanded Justice Minister Nagano."    "Justice Minister Nagano said his remarks were inappropriate  and he would retract them. He said his remarks hurt the  sentiments of many people and repents," Hata said.    "I appointed him (as justice minister) because he is a man  of  noble character and has a sense of balance. I would like to  accept his withdrawal of the remarks and apology seriously," he  said.    Asked whether he will dismiss Nagano from the post, Hata  said, "I will avoid referring to resignation at this point.  (The government) is conveying the real intention (of Nagano) to  various countries and I hope (they) will understand," he said.    Nagano said in a newspaper interview published Wednesday  that  Japan's role in the war was not aggression and the Nanjing  massacre was a "fabrication." His remarks triggered an angry  response from a number of Asian countries and he retracted them  at a news conference Friday.</p>

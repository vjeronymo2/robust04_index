Control of Emission of Organic Compounds, section 2132. Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Control of Vehicle Refueling Emissions at Gasoline Dispensing Facilities, and section 6523. Fee Schedule Listing), as a revision to the Louisiana SIP for ozone. On November 10, 1992, Louisiana submitted a SIP revision request to the EPA to satisfy the requirement of section 182(b)(3) of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. This SIP revision requires owners and operators of gasoline dispensing facilities to install and operate Stage II vapor recovery equipment in the Louisiana ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse. This revision applies to the Louisiana parishes of Ascension, East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Iberville, Livingston, and Pointe Coupee. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule will be effective May 24, 1994, unless notice is received by April 25, 1994, that adverse or critical comments will be submitted.

The EPA issued technical guidance in November 1991 and enforcement guidance in December 1991 to meet this requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition, on April 16, 1992, the EPA published the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990'' (General Preamble) (57 FR 13498). The guidance documents and the General Preamble interpret the Stage II statutory requirement and indicate what the EPA believes a State submittal needs to include to meet that requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These two documents are entitled ``Technical Guidance_Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Control of Vehicle Refueling Emissions at Gasoline Dispensing Facilities'' (EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;91&hyph;022) and ``Enforcement Guidance for Stage II Vehicle Refueling Control Programs.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA has designated the Baton Rouge and Lake Charles areas as ozone nonattainment in the State of Louisiana. The Baton Rouge nonattainment area is classified as serious and contains the following six parishes: Ascension,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Iberville, Livingston, and Pointe Coupee. The Lake Charles ozone nonattainment area is classified as marginal and therefore is not required to implement a Stage II program. The designations for ozone were published in the FR on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992, and have been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.300 through 81.437. Under section 182(b)(3) of the CAAA, Louisiana was required to submit Stage II vapor recovery rules for the Baton Rouge nonattainment area by November 15, 1992. On November 10, 1992, Governor Edwin W. Edwards submitted to the EPA, Stage II vapor recovery rules and a SIP Supplement dated November 15, 1992, which were adopted by the State on November 10, 1992, and were published in the Louisiana Register on November 20, 1992. By today's action, the EPA is approving this submittal. The EPA has reviewed the State submittal against the statutory requirements and for consistency with EPA guidance. A summary of the EPA's analysis is provided below. In addition, a more detailed analysis of the State submittal is contained in a TSD, dated September 24, 1993, which is available from the EPA Region 6 Office, listed above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Vogel struggles to revive Prolific PROLIFIC has turned the corner after a difficult run. In January 1988, its parent, the privately-owned Provincial Insurance Group, decided to demerge its unit trusts and life and pensions products, leaving Prolific partly owned by its management and partly by Provincial's shareholders. After a year, Prolific felt that it needed additional capital and underwent a time-consuming and distracting public auction to find a new parent. In November 1989 it was bought by Hafnia, the second largest Danish insurance company. During this time, one of the key fund managers left for personal reasons. Although performance was good in 1988, and reasonable in 1989, 1990 was a bad year. Michael Vogel, who was promoted to managing director of Prolific Asset management in 1990, had the task of restoring Prolific's image and performance. One of his first steps was to stop running both the sizeable funds on his own and to concentrate on High Income, Prolific's bell-wether fund. Prolific's entire asset management division, including the unit trust group, was reorganised along geographical rather than product lines. There was also some discussion among managers over whether the group should stick to its traditional investment approach. Typically, Prolific invests in small to medium sized companies with market capitalisations from Pounds 100m to Pounds 800m. Vogel sees a number of advantages: 'They have got over the first hurdles which small companies usually face, the management is usually stronger and broader, they have generally got good bank financing if they have needed it, but they are not into problems of scale.' After the 1987 stock market crash, these types of companies went out of favour as investors flocked to the safety of blue chips. Performance suffered, all the more so because Prolific likes to take bold positions and hold them across a number of funds. Vogel says: 'We like to concentrate portfolios - even the biggest funds may have the top 20 stocks making up some 60 per cent of the fund. We like to get very close to the management of those businesses, and if necessary we will sit with substantial holdings, even if they are likely to go through relative periods of underperformance.' Prolific's managers felt they had the right approach, and stuck with it. Eventually the tide began to turn and a number of funds have improved over the last year. The upturn is steady rather than spectacular: of the 11 funds launched before 1991, five are above average for their sectors over the three years to December 1, and six below. Over one year, seven are above average and four below. The strongest performers in 1991 were High Income, North America and Technology and Europe. The weakest were Special Situations and Convertible &amp; Gilts. Vogel admits to being pleasantly surprised by the revival in High Income's performance over the last year. Its income record - and that of the extra income fund, too - is good, with an 18 per cent annual net return for the last five years. This year, says Vogel, it will be a struggle, but the dividend payment will increase again. The main difference between the High and Extra Income funds is that Extra Income makes four payments of dividends to unitholders a year and holds more convertibles to support a higher yield. Extra's performance has also improved, although it has not done as well as High Income. In North America, the fund tends to invest in smaller companies than in the UK. Performance follows the US major-minor company cycle, which turned with a vengeance in smaller companies' favour at the end of 1990. American Income's record is less impressive, although it improved in 1991. There is a problem finding enough high yielding equities to keep up a good yield (4 per cent, double the US market), so nearly 25 per cent of the fund has been invested in convertibles, which have underperformed. Technology is Prolific's riskiest fund, as about 80 per cent is invested in US high-tech stocks. Performance jumps around quite dramatically, but this year, the fund is Prolific's strongest performer, in the top five of International funds. In November, the European trust was split into two: a new European Income trust (Pounds 21m) and European Growth (Pounds 16.5m). Providing income and growth in Europe is even harder than it is in the US, and it was felt it was counter-productive to try to do both. Nevertheless, the former European Growth and Income trust has had an excellent 1991, which manager Caroline Morrison attributes to taking the view in March that Germany was going to slow down, and France looked better, as well as getting the stock selection right. Unfortunately, it is not so good elsewhere. Special Situations is in the bottom 25 per cent of its sector over one and three years. Although it rode out the early part of the recession, it was over-invested in US dollar earners such as Hanson, Siebe and BTR during 1990. Because it is one of the most concentrated portfolios, the underperformance of big holdings has a considerable effect on the rest of the fund. It is also quite heavily invested (50 per cent) in smaller companies, capitalised below Pounds 700m, which have been out of favour until recently. Manager John Thornton is convinced that some of the larger holdings like Hanson will come right again and that the cycle has turned in favour of smaller stocks. Prolific's convertible and gilt fund, the biggest in the market, performed well enough until a couple of years ago when it suffered from its comparatively high exposure to convertibles - only 5 per cent of the fund is in gilts. It then sunk under the weight of poor quality paper coming on to the market in rights issues. Vogel does not intend to alter the mix, and says 'we are sweating it out'. Prolific also launched two trusts in 1991 - Blue Chip and Recovery. The latter is run by Thornton and Vogel, who spent a couple of years working for David Tucker, M&amp;G's recovery fund manager. The message which often emerges from an unit trust group is that steps have been taken to improve performance, but that it is too early to say whether they have worked. At Prolific, the message is that steps have been taken, and they seem to be working.

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sharp turnround at Graystone GRAYSTONE, the engineering components group formerly known as Ptarmigan Holdings, announced a turnround from losses of Pounds 736,000 to profits of Pounds 200,000 pre-tax for the year to June 30. Turnover advanced to Pounds 9.92m (Pounds 3.26m) with some Pounds 7.3m coming from acquisitions. Mr Dick Richardson, chairman, said the recommended Pounds 32.8m offer for British Syphon was expected to be declared unconditional on November 15. The pre-tax result was after a Pounds 763,000 provision for losses on operations to be discontinued, and increased interest charges of Pounds 517,000 (Pounds 247,000). However, there was a Pounds 935,000 profit on early redemption of loan stock. Earnings per share were 0.57p (5.07p losses). Mr Richardson said dividend payments would be resumed as soon as was practicable. Meanwhile, Graystone has agreed to provide a fuller description of its accounting policies on goodwill in its 1993 accounts and listing particulars circulated this week, following discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the accounts watchdog. The change came after the panel ruled that Graystone had not adequately disclosed in its 1992 accounts the reasons for an accounting change to capitalise and amortise goodwill over its estimated useful economic life. The accounts were qualified in relation to goodwill by auditors Ernst &amp; Young.</p>

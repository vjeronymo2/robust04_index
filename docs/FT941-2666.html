			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Doubt cast on book-pricing pact Booksellers will be warned next month by a leading publisher that the net book agreement, which governs the price of most books, may be unsustainable. Mr Eddie Bell, executive chairman of HarperCollins, the publishing arm of the Murdoch media empire, will issue the warning at the annual conference of the Booksellers Association in Jersey. The NBA is a voluntary agreement by publishers to sell books at the recommended price. Opponents say the lack of discounts cuts the number of books sold. Supporters stress the association's role in sustaining a wide range of titles and independent bookshops. Mr Bell, who published Lady Thatcher's autobiography, The Downing Street Years, emphasised yesterday that he supported the agreement and that HarperCollins would not abandon it unilaterally. But he feared it was becoming unsustainable because of 'the massive pressure' from the growing influence of book and warehouse clubs, which are not bound by the NBA. In November, the Office of Fair Trading launched a review of the NBA to see whether it still acted in the public interest. Reed Elsevier is the only publisher to have published all its books outside the NBA.</p>

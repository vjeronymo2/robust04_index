			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index regains 3,100 towards the close - Market report The reappearance of the Federal Reserve in the currency markets brought a hurried scramble for stock in the UK equity market towards the close of yesterday's trading session. The Footsie 3,100 mark was recaptured for the second time in volatile trading which also inspired a strong list of individual company features. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,104.4, a net gain of 23.1. The Footsie had cleared 3,106 at midsession as British government bonds responded favourably to the better performance overnight in US bonds and the dollar. But the rise of 25.3 on the Footsie was cut back sharply when news of a 2.6 per cent gain in US home sales for October weakened the dollar. The Fed's renewed support for the US currency came late in the London trading day and triggered a swift response. UK strategists expressed satisfaction last night with the Fed's evident determination to support the dollar, but said that the market will focus closely today on the US October payroll statistics. These are expected to show a sharp increase and could thus renew the threat to the dollar, and to European bond and equity markets. The Dow Industrial Average also turned round in UK trading hours to show a gain of around 15 points in early deals. The market was active from the opening of business, with Elf-Aquitaine selling its near 10 per cent stake in Enterprise Oil as it bought a stake in Renault, the French car manufacturer, whose partial privatisation got under way yesterday. The 50.7m-share Enterprise stake, double-counted on the Seaq network as BZW and Cazenove passed the shares on, boosted the day's volume total, which received a further lift when a Swiss-based fund management group purchased a stake in Northern Foods; without these deals, the day's trading volume would have remained unexciting. The day's final Seaq turnover total of 683m shares compared with 558.7m on Wednesday. About 52 per cent of the day's business was done in non-Footsie stocks, somewhat below recent averages. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, taking in a range of second line stocks which pay less heed to currency markets, added 8.8 at 3,530.8. The stock market continued to assess prospects for domestic interest rates in the wake of this week's inflation report from the Bank of England. Fears of an immediate rise in base rates have subsided, but the market has not changed its perception that base rates will move higher around the turn of the year. The UK Treasury's panel of independent economic forecasters yesterday called for a neutral budget from the chancellor of the exchequer in a few weeks time, but some members believed that further rate rises would ne necessary 'in due course'. Dollar stocks headed the rebound in the market. Oil shares were particularly strong, still responding to the good trading results announced from the sector leaders. The Enterprise Oil deal inspired activity among the second line issues. Pharmaceuticals also stood out well, although Boots failed to find favour in spite of a successful performance in the US by its anti-arthritis drug. Among the interest rate-related issues, store groups showed up firmly, with market traders hoping that the all-important Christmas selling period would not be blighted by any upward move in domestic interest rates. The market sounded more confident than for some weeks, with some analysts convinced that the US Federal Reserve would continue to support the US dollar successfully over the period of the US mid-term elections. Stability in currencies would offer the opportunity for UK equities to stage a year-end rally.</p>

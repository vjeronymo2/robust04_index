			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Bermuda sunbathes as Lloyd's shivers: The colony's reinsurers are gaining from London's turmoil For years, the tiny British colony of Bermuda has played a specialised role in world insurance, as the tax-haven home of more than 1,300 'captive insurers', insurance subsidiaries formed to insure the risks of their industrial and commercial parent companies. Now, it is taking advantage of the turmoil at Lloyd's and in the London market to turn itself into a much more rounded reinsurance centre. Since the mid-1980s a new breed of independent companies, backed by European and US capital, have been formed in Bermuda to insure specialised commercial insurance and reinsurance risks. Their growth has been impressive. Centre Re, the biggest of the companies, in which Switzerland's Zurich holds a majority stake, expects to have doubled its revenues to Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 990m), when it reports its figures for 1992, its fourth full year of operation. The revenues of three of the biggest companies amounted to more than Dollars 2bn in 1992, just less than a sixth of the estimated Dollars 13bn in gross premiums earned by Lloyd's in the same year. And the profitability of each of the companies has produced a mood of optimism, which contrasts sharply with the gloom in the London market, where news of losses and closures has virtually become a daily occurrence in recent weeks. In the past six months investors have raised or announced plans to raise more than Dollars 1.5bn for Bermudan-based companies. ACE, one of two companies which specialises in insuring large - mainly US - corporations against legal awards - recently announced an initial public offering in New York designed to generate more than Dollars 500m. Centre Re has announced that it is to establish a New York-based subsidiary, again raising the capital through an initial public offering. Two new companies, Mid Ocean and TOPS have been formed backed by a further Dollars 535m in new capital. American International Group, one of the world's most profitable insurers, also has plans to launch new Bermudan subsidiaries later this year. Many of these developments have initially brought comfort to the Lloyd's market. Bermudan companies provide important reinsurance capacity for London. Bermudan-based insurers frequently talk about their market 'complementing' the London market. Centre Re, for example, agreed at the end of last year to back a multi-million pound reinsurance scheme, which will allow Lloyd's Names to obtain stop-loss, or personal, reinsurance. Centre Re also provides dozens of financial reinsurance policies - called 'time and distance' policies - which allow Lloyd's syndicates to manage their reserves more flexibly. Another new company, Underwriters Capital (Merrett), has been formed exclusively to provide reinsurance for the nine syndicates that the Merrett agency manages at Lloyd's, indirectly increasing their capital base. However, in other respects developments on the island present a challenge to the leaders of Lloyd's and the entire London market. Some business formerly underwritten in London has already been lost. Mr Brian O'Hara, president and chief executive of XL Insurance, which like ACE also insures US liability business, says, for example, it is now winning some contracts that in the past would have been placed in London. Oil companies have set up TOPS Insurance in Bermuda to insure catastrophe risks for North Sea oil rigs, because they were unable to buy the cover in London. The deal 'has major implications for London,' says Mr Doyle Stephens, chief executive of OIL insurance, one of Bermuda's longest established mutual companies, which manages TOPS. 'Maybe we were depending on Lloyd's too greatly.' Brokers are now much more likely to visit Bermuda. 'As the market has got more difficult we've seen more broker inquiries in the last year-and-a-half than we have ever seen before,' says Mr Stephens. And once lost by London, business is unlikely to be won back quickly. Centre Re underwrites contracts that stretch over a number of years and reimburses premiums if losses turn out to be lower than expected. Mr Michael Palm, executive vice-president of Centre Re, says a big aim of his company is to 'introduce stability to insurance costs, taking out the year-to-year volatility'. Bermudan companies can build up tax-free reserves and companies operate with much lower expenses than many of their competitors. In particular the Bermudan companies are able to avoid the very high so-called 'frictional' costs, which are typical of a market - such as London  -in which dozens of relatively small insurers and brokers combine to insure and reinsure large risks. They tend to conduct a small number of high-value transactions, transferring huge blocks of risk on to their own books in exchange for multi-million dollar premiums. Centre Re earned an average of Dollars 25m for each of its 175 transactions currently on its books. 'The common element in all our business is a lot of premium per transaction,' says Mr O'Hara. The Bermudan companies employ more highly skilled professionals - such as actuaries - than their equivalents in London, which should allow them to improve their underwriting performance. Nearly a third of Centre Re's 30 or so professional staff are actuaries, whom the group deploys as underwriters. 'We don't believe in the kind of subjective underwriting where you simply guess what the range of losses will be,' says Mr Palm. Because the Bermudan companies generally dominate their market sectors, they have been able to avoid the rate competition which has been suicidal for many companies and syndicates in London. Mr O'Hara of XL says: 'Liability insurers in the past have shot themselves in the knee or even higher.' More importantly, Bermudan companies are not exposed to the same old pollution and asbestosis liabilities, stretching back to policies underwritten in the 1940s and 1950s, that are bedevilling both the London market and insurers worldwide. For investors attracted by the prospects of increasing reinsurance rates, but worried by the industry's legacies from the past, Bermuda looms as an attractive option. Certainly Mr David Saul, the Bermudan finance minister, is relishing the prospect of more insurance business, joking 'Bad news for Lloyd's has been good news for us'.  ----------------------------------------------                 PREMIUM INCOME        (FOR SELECTED BERMUDAN INSURERS)  ---------------------------------------------- Company                                 Income  ---------------------------------------------- ACE                           Dollars 325.4m XL                            Dollars 286.1m* Centre Re                       Dollars 1.5bn**  ---------------------------------------------- * to November 30 1992  ---------------------------------------------- ** Estimate including Dollars 400m in revenues from 'time  and distance' reinsurance policies earned by the CentreLine subsidiary and other revenues from fin ancial reinsurance.  ---------------------------------------------- Source:  Bermuda Insurance Update and estimates  ----------------------------------------------</p>

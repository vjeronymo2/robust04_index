He replaces Eugene F.  Giaquinto, who was placed on a leave of absence last month following news  reports that the FBI suspects him of funneling company money to a reputed East  Coast Mafia boss.  </P> <P> The company's announcement Thursday did not mention Giaquinto. Harold M. Haas,  MCA vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer, said Giaquinto  remains on a paid leave of absence. He noted that Blattner will not assume the  pay-television part of Giaquinto's prior duties as head of the home video  division.  </P> <P> Sidney Jay Sheinberg, MCA president and chief operating officer, had announced  Dec. 15 that Giaquinto had "been placed on a leave of absence and relieved of  all MCA responsibilities, pending further investigation."  </P> <P> Blattner had been vice president and general manager of the RCA/Columbia entity  since 1982 and previously had held the same titles at Columbia Pictures home  entertainment division since 1981.  </P> <P> W. Patrick Campbell, meanwhile, has been named president of RCA/Columbia  Pictures Worldwide Home Video. He will remain headquartered in New York. AL  DELUGACH  </P></p>

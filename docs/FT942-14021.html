			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Minister rejects IMF's gloomy growth forecast Mr Juro Saito, Japan's deputy finance minister, yesterday rejected International Monetary Fund forecasts that his country's economy would register the lowest growth rate of any of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. The IMF announced this week that it expected Japan's economy would grow only 0.7 per cent during 1994. But Mr Saito insisted the government's target of 2.4 per cent during the fiscal year ending March 31 was attainable. 'The economy has become brighter and is unlikely to fall further,' he said. His claims follow meetings with regional finance bureau chiefs who said there were signs of recovery throughout Japan. The country has been suffering the longest and deepest recession since the Second World War. However, Mr Saito's comments were made as data cast doubt on a consumer-led recovery. Japan's household spending for February registered its first fall in four months, according to the Management and Co-ordination Agency. Mr Peter Morgan, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Japan, said the 0.5 per cent year-on-year fall in household spending, while weaker than expected, followed an unexpectedly strong January when it increased 2.7 per cent. 'Consumer spending remains, on average, on an upward curve, and the first quarter this year will have been stronger than the last quarter during 1993,' he said. However, Mr Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said yesterday that the Japanese economy remained in the doldrums. He warned that continuing political uncertainty, increases in public utility rates, and the yen's appreciation against the dollar all threatened a recovery. Mr Morgan agreed: 'The major risk to the economy is a renewed rise of the yen.' The chances of a manufacturing-led recovery remain bleak. Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of Nissan, the automotive group, and outgoing chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said yesterday that domestic vehicle sales were unlikely to recover from the current slump until next year.

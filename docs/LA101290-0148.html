			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 25 OF 100 LARGEST CONGREGATIONS ARE IN CALIFORNIA, SURVEY SHOWS  </P> <P> The survey ranking Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa as the nation's third-largest  Protestant church by Sunday attendance also found that 25 of the top 100 are in  California, a state better known for secular pleasures than old-time religion.  </P> <P> The California churches, 20 of which are in Southern California, generally  teach a literal Bible, are theologically and socially conservative, focus on  the family, have a dynamic pastor and are not aligned with a mainline  denomination.  </P> <P> On an average Sunday, 12,000 attend Calvary Chapel, according to the survey by  the International Mega-Church Research Center in Bolivar, Mo. Affiliated  churches in Riverside, Downey, San Diego, West Covina, Albuquerque, N.M., and  Jacksonville, Ore., also rank in the top two-thirds of the list.  </P> <P> "They are one of the best-kept secrets on the West Coast," John N. Vaughan, who  heads the research center at Southwest Baptist University, said about the  Calvary churches.  </P> <P> Vaughan has tracked the largest congregations for several years. He noted that  another Orange County church is one of the fastest growing, Saddleback Valley  Community Church in Mission Viejo, a Southern Baptist church pastored by the  Rev. Rick Warren. Vaughan said it went from 1,710 churchgoers in 1987 to 3,055  in 1988, and to 4,000 last year, placing it in a tie for 62nd place on the  list.  </P> <P> Ranked No. 1 nationally is First Baptist Church of Hammond, Ind., with 20,000  churchgoers. Second-ranked with 14,605 churchgoers is Willow Creek Community  Church in South Barrington, Ill. The Rev. Jerry Falwell's Thomas Road Baptist  Church in Lynchburg, Va., with 11,000 in attendance, ranked fourth. Texas was  the second-highest state with 14 churches on the list.  </P> <P> Polls have shown that church affiliation is relatively low in California  compared to other states. However, church experts say that means relatively  large numbers of people, often willing to drive long distances, are potential  converts for evangelistic, multi-activity churches.  </P> <P> "California has a growing population, and a large church is like a stronghold  for reinforcing values when there are assaults on the family," Vaughan said.  </P> <P> Vaughan's ratings will appear in "The Almanac of the Christian World," to be  published late this month by Tyndale House, Wheaton, Ill.  </P> <P> The success of many of the "super churches" is linked to the popularity of the  pastor, said Eddie Gibbs, a professor at Pasadena's Fuller Theological  Seminary. "In a large, mobile society, people are attracted to the brightest  star on the horizon," Gibbs said.  </P> <P> Vaughan acknowledged that his attendance figures for First Baptist Church of  Hammond, Ind., are much older than figures for the other churches. But  evangelical leaders generally agree that it has the biggest Sunday attendance  in the nation.  </P> <P> The evangelical magazine Christianity Today recently reported that its pastor,  the Rev. Jack Hyles, has been the target of published charges of moral laxity,  doctrinal heresy and financial impropriety. Hyles dismissed the charges as  unworthy of response two years ago and has since declined to be interviewed on  the subject.  </P> <P> The nondenominational Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, pastored for nearly  22 years by the Rev. John MacArthur, ranks ninth with 8,000 churchgoers. "We  give authoritative answers (from the Bible) to questions of the heart (and) we  work with families, including classes in marriage and child-raising," MacArthur  said in accounting for the drawing power of the San Fernando Valley church.  </P> <P> Some Roman Catholic parishes in large archdioceses might make the list, but few  Catholic officials keep those statistics, Vaughan said. "They can tell you how  many members and baptisms they have, but not how many attend weekend Masses,"  he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BIGGEST PROTESTANT CHURCHES  </P> <P> The 10 biggest Protestant churches in America, ranked by average Sunday  attendance:  </P> <P> 1.

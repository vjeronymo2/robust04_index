			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (12): Casualties of the state farms - The shake-up in agriculture THE COLLECTIVISATION of Bulgarian farming 45 years ago was a catastrophe. The first stages of de-collectivisation carry the risk of a similar dislocation - albeit without the coercion and violence which accompanied the communists' destruction of private and peasant system of farming. The slaughter of thousands of animals is perhaps the most tangible sign of the confusion which has followed the dismantling of state co-operatives by government-appointed liquidation committees. 'Animals were given to peasants who did not have land to keep them on,' says Mr Georgy Tanev, who became minister of agriculture earlier this year. 'In addition, the committees were run by people with no experience of agriculture who sold off co-operatives' fodder before returning the animals.' The result was the slaughter of 1.9m sheep, 460,000 pigs and 235,000 heads of cattle in 1992 alone, he says. The drop in the number of animals has had a knock-on effect on the food processing industries. 'We're running well below capacity because our supply of milk is about one third of what it was two years ago,' says Mr Peycho Zagorski, manager of the Topalitza dairy in Karlovo, a small town in the Valley of the Roses in central Bulgaria. Production can begin only at midday, he says. Before that the dairy's trucks travel up to 100km to pick up milk from around 50 collection points. 'Around 90 per cent of the milk now comes from private farmers but they cannot meet the demand. Hardly any of them have more than 15 cows.' Between the Balkan and Sredna Gora mountain ranges, the break-up of state co-operatives has led to subsistence farming on small plots of land, divided by stakes and rows of stones. Unlike the previous 50 years, the fields are hives of activity. People work their newly returned land at weekends and late into the evening. But the level of technology - horse-drawn carts, spades and wooden ploughs - is a throwback to the pre-industrial age. Meanwhile, the oversize machines of the communist era lie unused in abandoned collective farms. 'Farmers don't have the machines they can work with. Russian tractors can't even turn around on the size of the plots which are being given back to people,' says Mr Stewart Campbell, head of an EC-financed Phare project which has pledged Ecu 50m to help agricultural reform since 1990. Nevertheless, Mr Campbell believes the best way forward is to press ahead with land restitution as provided for in the 1991 land law. This gives former owners and their heirs the right to reclaim up to 30 hectares of farmland. 'Once people receive their land with the full titles, a land market will emerge. Consolidation into more economically viable units should then take place,' he says. However, land restitution has been slower than anticipated. By mid-April only 13.3 per cent of arable land had been returned to owners within its final borders, admits the Ministry of Agriculture. 'Part of the problem is that we don't have good records. The communists destroyed land registers and any reference to private property,' says Mr Evgeniy Matinchev, the deputy prime minister. But restitution has also become a sensitive political issue. The government, which relies on the support of the socialist party to stay in power, is under pressure to stem the decline in production caused by the break-up of collective farms. 'We need to find other ways of managing the land before it is handed over. We do not want to divide up all the large farms, especially those with long-maturity crops such as vineyards and orchards. Redistributing the land in its original borders would destroy these,' says Mr Matinchev. While adamant that restitution remains a priority, Mr Tanev believes one solution is the encouragement of private co-operatives. 'We need people to work together to plant, produce and look after the animals,' the agriculture minister says. 'Private co-operatives bear little resemblance to those we had under the communist system. Members are free to make their own decisions, like shareholders in a company.' But Bulgaria's main opposition party, the Union of Democratic Forces, an anti-communist alliance, disagrees. 'These co-operatives will slow down and even stop real restitution,' says Mr Vlado Stoentchev, the UDF mayor of Velingrad, a small town 130km from Sofia. 'People are being manipulated into forming a copy of the former structures without being given the chance to explore the alternatives,' he says. 'It's vital for land to be privatised, then the owners can decide for themselves. That is why this municipality is leading a war against moves to re-form co-operatives.'</p>

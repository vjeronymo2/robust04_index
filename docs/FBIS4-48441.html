			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] As preparations are in top gear for the election of  delegates to the proposed national constitutional conference at  ward level on Monday [23 May], calls have heightened for the  boycott of the conference. THE VANGUARD and THE GUARDIAN report  that the boycott call by a pressure group, the National  Democratic Coalition, NADECO, appears to be catching attention,  especially in the western part of the country. THE VANGUARD  says NADECO members have agreed to withdraw from the polls. The  NATIONAL CONCORD says Anang people in Akwa Ibom State and some  key democrats in Ogun State have indicated their intention to  boycott the gathering. The TIMES says as preparations for  Monday polls continue, prominent musical actors have declared  support for calls on government to shelve the conference.</p>

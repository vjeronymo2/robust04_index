			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Observer: McKinsey's man On the subject of sleuthing, try tackling McKinsey, the publicity-shy management consulting firm, about its new top dog. Partners of the firm have just picked Rajat Gupta, 45, as their new primus inter pares. He has declined to talk to journalists, and the firm released only the barest cv. Indian-born but a long-standing US citizen, Gupta attended Harvard, ran McKinsey's Scandinavian offices for a while in the mid-1980s and has been head of the Chicago operation since 1989. What big assignments has he led? Don't even bother asking. Mind you, reading the runes makes Gupta look an interesting choice. Names more commonly mentioned for the job had been Don Waite - head of the bigger New York office - and non-US consultants like Herbert Henzler, in charge of the German operation. But McKinsey increasingly looks for its income outside the US, and the choice of Gupta hints at continuing that trend. Provided he survives re-election every three years, he could be around a long time.</p>

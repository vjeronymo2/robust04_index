			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- Russian presidential spokesman  Vyacheslav Kostikov called on the citizens of North Ossetia and  Ingushetia to resist provocations aimed at thwarting the process  of conflict settlement in the region.    In a statement issued on Monday, Kostikov said that  extremists have lately stepped up their activity in the war zone  in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. Violence against civilians,  hostage taking and killings continue in the region. There have  been attempts to involve Russian soldiers and officers carrying  out a peace-keeping mission in the region to involve in the war.    "Especially inadmissible are the facts when representatives  of the local administrations become organisers of and  participants in acts of violence. Russian authorities will not  tolerate glaring violations of human rights and law in the zone  of the state of emergency," Kostikov said.    Calling on the people of North Ossetia and Ingushetia to  resist provocations of extremists seeking to derail the peace  process in the region, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stresses  that law enforcement bodies in the war zone have all necessary  rights and means to stamp out extremism and protect the  civilians, Kostikov said.</p>

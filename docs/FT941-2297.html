			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Pension scheme compromise wins support Proposals aimed at ensuring that occupational pension schemes will not have to sell equities and buy bonds to meet suggested rules on solvency have won tentative support from the government. Actuaries had warned that large-scale withdrawals from equities would have severely depressed the market. However, the proposals may require legislation allowing pension scheme trustees to give members less than their actual accrued benefits if a scheme is wound up. The proposals broadly follow recommendations from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. Mr Peter Tompkins, partner at consulting actuaries Lane, Clark and Peacock, said: 'What lawyers have drawn attention to is that there will be cases where pension schemes are a bit short.' But he added that the pensions industry believes a 'watertight' solvency standard would be far too expensive for employers to bear and would discourage them from offering final-salary schemes. The proposals, to be sent today to employer groups such as the Confederation of British Industry, relate to so-called minimum solvency standards proposed by the government's Pension Law Review Committee. That committee, chaired by Professor Roy Goode, proposed that schemes be required to have almost enough assets so that each member could receive cash to buy out their accrued benefits. However, the deferred annuity contracts, which would be used to secure pension rights in such circumstances, are linked to yields on government gilts, while the average scheme has about 80 per cent of its assets in equities. Because gilts have historically yielded less than equities, pension funds would have to sell equities and employers would have to top up their cash position to allow the funds to buy gilts. Only then could the fund be sure of having enough assets to secure benefits in the event of wind-up. The CBI and parts of the pension fund industry have objected to the minimum solvency proposals since they were made last September, arguing that they would create an additional burden on employers. But the actuarial profession has proposed a new way of calculating minimum solvency. For younger scheme members, actuaries could compute cash equivalent values assuming investment in equities, and gradually shift towards gilt yields as employees aged. The government is suggesting that pension schemes have at least five years to phase in the solvency rules after an omnibus pension reform bill is passed, probably next year or in 1996. The government is also prepared to allow schemes which fall short of the 90 per cent of minimum solvency to have a longer period in which to add assets to their fund. The government is considering whether it should set the standards by which actuaries will calculate minimum solvency or whether it should leave it to scheme actuaries.</p>

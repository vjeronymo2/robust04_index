			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview in the column "One-on-One" with Col. Johan </F> Burger, chief of Negotiation Strategy in the South African  Police Force's Community Relations Department, by Andriette  Stofberg: "Col. Johan Burger Is Not Afraid To Speak His Mind:  Police Force Must Be Demilitarized Soon"; place and date not  given]    [Text] "Today we bravely say things which would have been  unthinkable a few years ago. I believe that it is to our  advantage that this has become possible."    Colonel Johan Burger does not seem like such a "liberal"  police man. Sitting behind his desk in Pretoria, he looks just  like any other very ordinary policeman.    It is only that this chief of negotiation strategy within  the  Community Relations Department has quietly acquired a reputation  within and outside the police force as someone who is not afraid  to say things which used to be better left unsaid.    When in 1971, as a very young policeman, he was hunting  terrorists far away in the Caprivi strip, he did not have too  much to say. He did not even ask questions. Besides, like so  many other policemen there, he did not even know who or what  SWAPO [South-West African People's Organization] was.    "We did not receive any political training. We were not  politically aware. We were only taught that we were there to  shoot terrorists. We did not know what they stood for. We only  knew that they were in the process of causing some kind of drama  or other."    Then came the disturbances of 1976. The small seed, which  would lead to his starting to ask questions, was sowed. He was a  member of the riot squads. "I imagined myself in the shoes of  the black men, and wondered how I would have felt if Afrikaans  had been forced upon me."    In 1982, when he was riding around in Owambo "with a Casspir  and a gun," he started asking questions in earnest.    About such things as why the police force had moved so far  away from its traditional role of a doctrine of "search and take  into custody," after having so successfully made the military  "search and destroy" doctrine of a semimilitary organization its  own.    One of the results of these questions was a Master of  Strategic Studies dissertation last year at UNISA [University of  South Africa] about the role of the police in counterinsurgency  in Namibia.    He believes that it is necessary for the police force to  become demilitarized as soon as possible and that it must once  again become a civilian police force. The military character of  the police force has developed over many years--first through  participation in two world wars and then in the  counterinsurgency war along the border.    "I believe that we should have withdrawn sooner as the  struggle became more military in character. Of course, the  police force has a role to play in counterinsurgency actions.  But there comes a point when the involvement of the military  becomes so great that they should play the primary role. Then  the police force must stand back."    "What has happened in our country is that instead of the  police force standing back, we joined. Sometimes we were more  soldiers than the soldiers themselves."    "This inherently created problems for us. Take a policeman  who had returned from the border and had to come to police the  townships, can you imagine what his approach was? After all, he  had been conditioned like a soldier."    "Now we must change our own approach to our own culture. And  this is hard to accept for many policemen--given the pride we  have in our history. However, the question remains: was it good  for us to have become militarily involved to such an extent? Is  this the right kind of background to have for normal policing  work?"    "We have been trained like a semimilitary organization. In  addition to the fact that South Africa has never had a culture  of human rights in its constitution or in any other laws, we did  not have this in the police force either. We are the product of  our own society."    "Now that society is changing, we must recognize that we  must  do the same thing. We are already in the process of implementing  major changes. An international team of experts is helping us to  adjust our training, with a particular emphasis on the new  community policing approach, and also because we need a better  under standing of negotiating tactics to defuse situations--that  the guys should not be so quick to turn to violence."    Like any other people in the country, policemen must find  their bearings within the changes which are taking place in the  national and other arenas.    As part of his job, Col. Burger has developed a consequence  leap model which he uses in informational sessions to try to  explain to policemen all over the country how the national  negotiations affect the Police force.    "It says to the guys on the other side of the negotiation  process that there will stil be a South Africa, there will still  be a police force, there will still be a structure, there will  still be laws. Things will just look a little different. You  have to make a psychological leap to that point from where you  are now. Then things will not seem so confusing to you and you  will large ly lose your fear of the future."    "Of course, you will still be uncertain because nobody can  see into the future. But you have to realize that it will be  incredibly difficult for you, if not impossible, to be  physically a policeman in the new South Africa if  psychologically you have remained behind in the old South  Africa."    He talks about the major confidence crisis which exists  between the police and primarily the black community.    "Take such factors as the so-called apartheid heritage.  Nobody argues about it anymore: apartheid had certain negative  consequences and the police force was not untouched by them. We  have had a certain power approach within the police force. I do  not mean all policemen, but in many cases policemen did not have  any interest in the community, especially not the black  community."    "We simply used the approach that this is what the law said,  the law was rigidly enforced and we did not tolerate any  opposition. Good relations were not important to us. What was  important was to enforce the law as it stood."    "Opposition to this also hardened the policemen's  disposition. Later on, we no longer had any sympathy for the  victims of cer tain laws--however unfair they may have  been--because for us it was a question of doing a job that had  to be done."    The hardening of feelings on both sides between the  community  and the police force led to alienation. After February 1990,  however, the police began to realize that they had to reach out  to heal the alienation.    "But this goes together with the legitimacy of the  government. As long as we do not have a legitimate government,  the police force cannot be legitimate."    "Legitimacy is defined by the whole population of a nation.  The police force is currently not legitimate because today's  government, of which we are an extension, only represents part  of the population. If the body is dead, there is no way an arm  can be alive."    "We are trying, through the community policing approach, to  achieve a greater degree of acceptance. But this is only  secondary. All these positive things will not mean a thing until  the government itself, the primary source, has achieved  legitimacy."</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY CANCELS MARTIN AUTOPSY; FUNERAL FRIDAY;  </P> <P> CRASH: CANCELLATION MAY HINDER OFFICIALS IN DETERMINING WHETHER ADDITIONAL  CHARGES SHOULD BE FILED AGAINST DRIVER OF PICKUP TRUCK.  </P> <P> An autopsy on former New York Yankee manager Billy Martin was canceled Tuesday  at his family's request, and a prosecutor said the decision could make it  harder to press charges against the driver of the truck in which Martin died.  </P> <P> The Broome County sheriff's department reported slow progress in investigating  the Christmas night accident that killed Martin, 61, and injured the driver,  Martin's long-time friend, William Reedy of Detroit. Sheriff Anthony Ruffo said  it would be another day or two before the alcohol level in Reedy's blood was  confirmed through laboratory tests.  </P> <P> Reedy was charged Christmas night with a misdemeanor driving-while-intoxicated  charge and faces a fine of up to $1,000 and a year in jail.  </P> <P> "In the observation of the deputy, the driver had been drinking to the point  where he was intoxicated," Ruffo said. "We have to get the results of the blood  test."  </P> <P> Ruffo added that Reedy voluntarily took the blood-alcohol test.  </P> <P> Broome County District Attorney Gerald Mollen said he hoped to persuade Coroner  Patrick Ruddy to conduct an autopsy despite the family's wishes in order to  pinpoint the exact cause of Martin's death.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping that's not the final decision, to tell you the truth," Mollen said.  "It's unusual that a coroner would not have an autopsy conducted when cause of  death may be a legal question."  </P> <P> But Ruddy said an autopsy on Martin's body would reveal little that an external  examination did not.  </P> <P> "He died, basically, of a fractured neck," Ruddy said. "The chest X-ray was  reasonably intact, belly was normal, blood count was normal. It's all in the  neck area."  </P> <P> Mollen said it would be "days, at least" before he decides whether or not to  charge Reedy with anything more serious than driving while intoxicated. He said  a grand jury would convene next week and one would be in session continuously  and could take up the case as soon as the investigation was complete.  </P> <P> Further charges could still be brought against Reedy even if an autopsy was not  conducted, Mollen said.  </P> <P> But the absence of an autopsy report could make it difficult for prosecutors to  prove in court the exact cause of death should additional charges be filed  against Reedy.  </P> <P> A viewing for Martin will be Thursday at the Frank Campbell Funeral Home in New  York. Services will be Friday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  </P> <P> Authorities say the pickup skidded off an icy road early Monday evening in  front of Martin's 148-acre farm near Binghamton, located about 150 miles  northwest of New York City.  </P> <P> Reedy, owner of Reedy's Bar near Detroit's Tiger Stadium, suffered a broken hip  and possible broken ribs in the accident. He was listed in fair condition  Tuesday at the Upstate Medical Center Hospital in Syracuse, where he was  transferred after the crash.  </P> <P> Authorities said the two men were not wearing seat belts.  </P> <P> CHRONOLOGY  </P> <P> A look at the managerial career of Billy Martin, who died Monday night in a car  crash:  </P> <P> Oct. 11, 1968 -- Named manager of the Minnesota Twins.  </P> <P> Oct. 13, 1969 -- Fired as Twin manager after leading club to American League  West championship.  </P> <P> Oct. 2, 1970 -- Named manager of the Detroit Tigers.  </P> <P> Aug. 31, 1973 -- Suspended for three days for telling pitchers to throw  spitballs.  </P> <P> Sept. 2, 1973 -- Fired as Tiger manager after leading club to 1972 AL East  title.  </P> <P> Sept. 8, 1973 -- Named manager of the Texas Rangers.  </P> <P> July 16, 1974 -- Suspended for three days and fined for a pair of brush-back  incidents against the Milwaukee Brewers.  </P> <P> Oct. 24, 1974 -- Named AL manager of the year after leading Rangers to  second-place finish.  </P> <P> July 21, 1975 -- Fired as Ranger manager.  </P> <P> Aug. 2, 1975 -- Named manager of the New York Yankees for the first time.  </P> <P> Oct. 28, 1976 -- Named AL manager of the year after leading Yankees to their  first pennant in 12 years.  </P> <P> May 14, 1977 -- Fined $2,500 for remarks directed at Yankee owner George  Steinbrenner.  </P> <P> June 18, 1977 -- Involved in dugout altercation in Boston with slugger Reggie  Jackson.  </P> <P> Oct. 18, 1977 -- Leads Yankees to first world championship in 15 years, as they  beat the Dodgers in sixth and final World Series game.  </P> <P> July 24, 1978 -- One day after making the "One's a born liar, the other's  convicted" comment about Jackson and Steinbrenner, Martin resigns as Yankee  manager.  </P> <P> July 29, 1978 -- Yankees announce that Martin will return to Yankees as manager  in 1980.  </P> <P> June 18, 1979 -- Returns as manager of the Yankees for the second time,  replacing Bob Lemon.  </P> <P> Oct. 29, 1979 -- Fired as Yankee manager.  </P> <P> Feb. 22, 1980 -- Named manager of the Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> Nov. 20, 1980 -- Named AL manager of the year by after leading A's to  second-place finish.  </P> <P> June 1, 1981 -- Suspended by the AL for one week after bumping umpire Terry  Cooney.  </P> <P> Nov. 12, 1981 -- Named AL manager of the year for the fourth time after leading  A's to AL West title.  </P> <P> Sept. 8, 1982 -- Fined, along with Fred Stanley and Detroit manager Sparky  Anderson, for a controversy involving Rickey Henderson's attempt to break Lou  Brock's single-season stolen base record.  </P> <P> Oct. 20, 1982 -- Fired as A's manager.  </P> <P> Jan. 11, 1983 -- Named Yankee manager for the third time, replacing Clyde King.  </P> <P> April 30, 1983 -- Suspended for three games for kicking dirt on umpire Drew  Coble.  </P> <P> Sept. 29, 1983 -- Sued in Philadelphia federal court by umpire Dale Ford for  calling Ford a "stone liar" after Ford ejected him from a game in Chicago on  July 31.

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NASCAR IS STILL ALL IN FAMILY;  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING: BILL FRANCE, WHO BUILT STOCK CAR CIRCUIT AND RULED WITH IRON  FIST, HAS SEEN HIS FAMILY VENTURE REACH NEW HEIGHTS WITH HIS SON BILL JR. AT  THE HELM.  </P> <P> Big Bill France was a flamboyant, dynamic -- some said tyrannical -- promoter  who founded NASCAR, the world's foremost stock car racing organization, in 1947  and ran it as a family business for 25 years.  </P> <P> Stock car racing grew out of the ruts left by bootleggers running white  lightning through the winding back roads of the Carolinas. France brought it  out of the woods and onto speedways in Southern towns -- Darlington, S.C.;  Charlotte, N.C.; Daytona Beach, Fla., and, later, Talladega, Ala.  </P> <P> The Stars and Bars of the Confederacy were part and parcel of the sport. Grits  were on every menu and if a driver didn't have a drawl dripping with Dixie, he  was immediately recognized as a furriner.  </P> <P> France, in essence, created a sport and held it hostage.  </P> <P> When he decided it was time to step aside in 1972, he looked across the  breakfast table and tabbed his son, Bill Jr., then 39, to carry on.  </P> <P> Junior has run the show for 17 years, and his accomplishments are nearly as  apparent as his father's. NASCAR has 30,000 members, 112 tracks, of which 84 --  such as Ascot Park, Saugus Speedway and Orange Show Speedway -- run weekly  shows, and 11 different racing series. The Winston Cup, an $18-million series  for steel-bodied, American-made sedans, is the crown jewel.  </P> <P> And Bill France makes the decisions, just as always. Only now it's not Big  Bill. It's Bill Jr.  </P> <P> Their style of leadership is as different as their stature. When he was running  things, Big Bill was 6-foot-5, outgoing and a man who made decisions at a  moment's notice, often out on the race track. There was never the slightest  question who was in charge. Junior is five inches shorter, quiet and given more  to sitting around a conference table, listening to a consensus before making up  his mind.  </P> <P> "My father had more to do personally because he didn't have many people around  him," Bill Jr. said during a recent visit here. "When he started out, it was  mostly Dad and Pat Parcell, just the two of them doing it all. Later, he had  Bill Gazaway and Lin Kuchler, but he never had a large staff.  </P> <P> "As for myself, I believe, without a doubt, that I have as strong a staff as  there is in motorsports. I depend on them for input, but I operate on my own  consensus. That is, when there are three of us discussing an issue, each of the  others has a vote, but I have three."  </P> <P> France's most trusted lieutenants are his younger brother, Jimmy, the executive  vice president; Les Richter, former president of Riverside International  Raceway, who runs the Winston Cup series; Jim Hunter, a former newspaperman who  administrates the burgeoning organization, particularly the popular Winston  Racing Series for weekly tracks; Jim Foster, another one-time sportswriter who  markets the show; and Dick Beaty, the series director who sees that the rules  are followed.  </P> <P> Junior was groomed for his job, if not from birth, at least from the day Big  Bill promoted his first NASCAR race on the sand at Daytona Beach in 1948. Young  Bill swept out the office that day. Later, he did just about everything there  was to do around a race track -- flagman, scorer, steward, promoter, even a  driver for a few races and six years as vice president before moving into his  father's chair.  </P> <P> For the first few years, he was thought to be little more than a puppet for his  father, who maintained his office in NASCAR headquarters on Bill France  Boulevard in Daytona Beach as president and chairman of the board of  International Speedway Corp., which owned the Daytona and Talladega tracks.  </P> <P> "He was down the hall and he'd been through it all, so I'd be kind of stupid if  I didn't bring him in and get his views, what with his experience and  background," was as far as Junior would go in answering his critics.  </P> <P> When Bill Sr. was asked about the arrangement several years ago, he said: "I  don't look over his shoulder. He knows I'm available for consultation and  sometimes he asks for it. Sometimes he doesn't."  </P> <P> One time he was not consulted was when the Darlington track, stock car racing's  original superspeedway, was put on the market. Junior closed the deal on it  before his father was aware of the negotiations.  </P> <P> The elder France, 79, is virtually retired today, occasionally making the trip  from his home in Ormond Beach to his old office, mostly to chat with old  acquaintances.  </P> <P> Richard Petty, whose remarkable career as a driver has spanned both France  administrations, defines their differences:  </P> <P> "Senior was the kind of cat you could talk to until you was blue in the face  and he'd do what he'd figured on doing all along. Now Junior will listen, and  you get the idea he's considering what you're saying, but he makes up his mind  all by himself."  </P> <P> The differences between father and son are reflected in the direction stock car  racing has taken during their stewardships. It has grown from a rural, regional  sport under Big Bill into a nationally accepted, cosmopolitan sport under Bill  Jr.  </P> <P> At the time of the transition, NASCAR was still experiencing growing pains,  struggling against the trappings of its Down South atmosphere.  </P> <P> "We have made tremendous strides in the past 10 years," France Jr. said. "With  the help of R.J. Reynolds (Tobacco Co.), which came in and showed the corporate  world that their products didn't have to be automotive-related to become  involved, and television, which showcased our kind of racing to the general  public, we became accepted nationally."  </P> <P> In the last several years, Winston Cup racing has moved into such diverse areas  as Watkins Glen, N.Y., Sonoma, Calif., and Phoenix, all to immediate  acceptance.  </P> <P> "They had been holding Indy car races at Phoenix for 35 years and we went in  there last year after Riverside closed and had the largest crowd in the track's  history," France said. "And last June, when PIR (Phoenix International Raceway)  opened its advance ticket sales for the Nov. 5 race, they sold more tickets on  that weekend than the Formula One race drew for a race that was going on at the  same time.  </P> <P> "I'm fully confident that if we went to places like Road America (in Elkhart  Lake, Wis.) or Portland, we'd be dynamite. We have a national complexion now.  Part of that is reflected in the hometowns of our drivers. They're not all from  the South, like they were for a long time."  </P> <P> In 1972, for instance, seven out of 10 drivers came from the Carolinas, and the  rest from other Southern states. Now look at where they come from:  </P> <P>  -- Chemung, N.Y. Geoff Bodine will drive next season for the quintessential  good ol' boy, Junior Johnson, of Ingle Hollow, N.C.  </P> <P>  -- Greenfield, Wis. Alan Kulwicki is the defending champion in Sunday's  Autoworks 500 at Phoenix.  </P> <P>  -- Batesville, Ark. Mark Martin was the winner two weeks ago at Rockingham,  N.C.  </P> <P>  -- Ontario, Calif. Joe Ruttman is a former United States Auto Club champion.  </P> <P>  -- Fitchburg, Mass. Ken Bouchard was 1988 Winston Cup rookie of the year.  </P> <P>  -- Fenton, Mo. Ken Schrader and Rusty Wallace, the Winston Cup points leader,  both are from Fenton.  </P> <P> The younger France was fortunate in arriving at the presidency of NASCAR about  the same time that Ralph Seagraves of R.J. Reynolds brought the Winston program  into stock car racing.  </P> <P> "We have an ideal relationship," France said. "They are involved in promoting  stock car racing and raising the financial rewards, but they do not try to tell  us how to run the sport. Maybe the most important thing they've done is showing  the rest of the consumer market that motor racing was a good vehicle for  promoting their products. Before RJR, everything was automotive-related."  </P> <P> Major sponsors for top teams now come from all facets of the business world.  For instance, there are beers, coffee, headache powder, soft drinks, cooking  oil, soaps, film, food, and even products and services targeted for the women's  market, figure salons and panty hose.  </P> <P> NASCAR, and France personally, have been criticized, especially by the Southern  press, for what was perceived to be Winston overkill.  </P> <P> First, it was when the name of NASCAR's premier series was changed from Grand  National to Winston Cup.  </P> <P> "I volunteered to do that myself," France said. "I felt that with the kind of  money they were spending, they deserved to have the series named after them. It  was not their idea at all, and I had to pressure to make the change."  </P> <P> R.J. Reynolds, which started out in 1971 with a $100,000 bonus fund in the name  of Winston, will distribute $2.5 million in driver point-fund money this year.  Of that, $1 million will go to the champion.  </P> <P> "One important thing about the point fund is that it forces all the top drivers  to drive in all the races if they want to take part in the big bonuses at the  end of the season," France said. "There was a time when only half a dozen  drivers ran the full schedule, and a lot of the name drivers picked and chose  their spots. This way, every track is guaranteed the top drivers, and the  battle for the points championship stimulates interest all season long."  </P> <P> This year, with only two races remaining, Sunday's at Phoenix and the closer  Nov. 19 at Atlanta, three drivers remain in close contention for the $1-million  prize -- Wallace, Martin and Dale Earnhardt, the defending champion from  Mooresville, N.C.  </P> <P> The series name change was made in 1986, but it met with such resistance in the  South that Robert Griggs, publisher of Grand National Scene, did not change the  name to Winston Cup Scene until this year.  </P> <P> "Change doesn't come easy back home," France said. "When we decided to run at  Sears Point for the summer race that Riverside used to have, the Southeastern  press jumped all over me about what a bad show it was going to be on the road  course there.  </P> <P> "That was before the race. After it was over, and they'd seen a great show, it  was amazing how quickly I went from a chump on Thursday to a smart guy on  Monday."  </P> <P> Second, was when the Winston, an $800,000 race for winners only from the  previous season, was announced. The winner receives $200,000, but the race does  not count in season standings.  </P> <P> "The Winston is like baseball's All-Star game or professional football's Pro  Bowl," France said. "It's a special event. Most all sports have something  similar. Charlotte (Motor Speedway) has done an excellent job of running it.  And the drivers like it."  </P> <P> What would happen if RJR pulled its Winston brand out of racing, or if tobacco  sponsorships were legislated against, as they are in England and some provinces  in Australia?  </P> <P> "I think we could replace them," France said. "At least I would hope we could.  I certainly hope we never have to."  </P> <P> As a hedge against that happening, NASCAR has retained the Grand National name.  It is now the name of their No. 2 series, for late model sportsman cars.  </P> <P> The manner in which the two Frances have handled ticklish situations has been  determined as much by social change as their difference in style.  </P> <P> For instance, when the drivers threatened to organize a union, Big Bill  suspended the ringleaders, Curtis Turner and Tim Flock, from NASCAR for four  years.  </P> <P> France's word became law the day in 1949 when Glenn Dunaway's car owner sued  NASCAR after France disqualified the winning car for having an illegal chassis.  The claim was that NASCAR had no right to make such a decision after the race  was run. France won the case and no one challenged him after that.  </P> <P> Even major factories felt his wrath. Whenever France determined that one  manufacturer was getting an advantage, he changed the rules. In 1965, Chrysler  pulled out of NASCAR when France virtually outlawed the 426-cubic inch Hemi  engine in an attempt to make Ford and General Motors cars more competitive.  </P> <P> That ruling kept Richard Petty, the sport's most popular figure, on the  sidelines for most of the year. Petty turned to drag racing to pass the time.  </P> <P> In the summer of 1969, France opened Alabama International Raceway in  Talladega, which was longer, steeper and faster than any superspeedway ever  built. When the leading drivers tested it, they claimed it was too dangerous,  that the searing speeds would shred tires and cause accidents. A loose-knit  organization called the Professional Drivers Assn., headed by Petty, petitioned  France to postpone the race.  </P> <P> France refused, claiming that too many tickets had already been sold. When the  drivers continued to balk, France himself, then 59 but an old-time beach racer,  climbed into a race car and lapped the high-banked track at 176 m.p.h.  </P> <P> The leading drivers were amazed, but refused to budge from their stand. France  reacted in his usual dictatorial manner. He rounded up a bunch of stock car  drivers from lesser series, put up a big purse and, to further incense the  regular drivers, invited spectators in free.  </P> <P> Richard Brickhouse won the race and was never heard from again. The regular  drivers were back in their cars the next time NASCAR went to Talladega.  </P> <P> Big Bill not only proved his point, he broke the potential power of the PDA.  </P> <P> "Junior could never get away with that kind of action today," said Ned Jarrett,  a former Grand National champion driver who is now a TV commentator. "We're in  a litigious world and a suspension like he gave Turner would bring lawsuits  today from every angle.  </P> <P> "If the Tim Richmond case occurred 20 years ago, France would have barred him  by edict and that would have been the end of it. But Junior had to move  cautiously and make sure he was on safe grounds."  </P> <P> The Richmond case, with its allegations of drug use, might have been the  touchiest situation in young France's tenure.  </P> <P> Rumors circulated for several years that Richmond was using drugs. The  situation came to a head at Watkins Glen in 1987, when a number of drivers  protested Richmond's behavior on and off the track.  </P> <P> NASCAR responded by announcing a drug policy for 1988, under which drivers, or  any other members of the organization, could be tested "based on reasonable  suspicion." Richmond was the first, and so far, only person tested.  </P> <P> When Richmond was suspended shortly before the Daytona 500, after it was  announced that he tested positive, he demanded a second test, claiming he used  only over-the-counter medicine. The second test proved him right, but he still  refused to turn over his medical files to NASCAR, in accordance with their  rules, and filed a $20-million suit for defamation of character, which was  later settled out of court.  </P> <P> Said France: "I don't want to go into the details of the Richmond case because  he's gone (Richmond died last August in West Palm Beach, Fla., of AIDS), but  our approach was, and still is, that if we have somebody who uses drugs, we  don't want him on the race track. Our idea is not to ban that person for life,  but only to keep him off the track until he gets clean. We are not trying to be  punitive. Our concern is for the safety of others, the same as it would be in  the case of airplane pilots.  </P> <P> "Driver reaction to the drug policy has been good. We do not plan to have  random testing. We believe in the reasonable-suspicion approach. We sent Dick  Beaty to drug school to learn how to recognize a potential problem, especially  in the garage area. So far, there have been no rumbles at all. We don't think  we have a problem."  </P> <P> Looking five years down the road, France foresees teams and drivers running for  more prize money, continual strong support from sponsors, both old and new, and  more growth from television.  </P> <P> He does not, however, see any radical changes.  </P> <P> "Our philosophy is one of controlled growth," he said. "We do not want to grow  so big that we can't keep our arms wrapped around what we have, if you know  what I mean. We don't want to grow so fast that we get out of hand."  </P> <P> Two possible areas of growth are the adoption of Japanese cars for Winston Cup  racing and the expansion of the series into new markets -- or in the case of  Southern California, a return to an old market.  </P> <P> Foreign cars have been forbidden in the past because rules call for  steel-bodied cars built in the United States. However, Nissans are now built in  Tennessee, Toyotas in Kentucky, Hondas in Ohio, Mazdas in Michigan and  Mitsubishis in Illinois.  </P> <P> "I think it would be interesting if one of the Japanese cars qualified," France  said. "Personally, I would welcome them, but first they would have to meet our  size and engine regulations. We run only rocker-arm type engines, so would not  allow the double overhead cams. And all ours are normally aspirated, so there  could be no turbocharging.  </P> <P> "And they would have to conform to the size and silhouette of the cars we are  running. There are no Chryslers running now because their cars are too small.  If we let them in, all the Ford and General Motors people would demand that  they run their smaller cars, too, and we don't want to be a series for compact  cars.  </P> <P> "The size of passenger cars has been coming down, and we have come down with  them, but our desire since 1974 has been to run what the manufacturers call  their intermediate car. And we want fenders to cover the wheels. That's a must  to keep them stock-appearing."  </P> <P> This year's Winston Cup series included 29 races, starting in February with the  Daytona 500 and ending Nov. 19 in Atlanta.  </P> <P> "We could expand to one or two more if we found the right places," France said.  "That would be about the limit because we have to be concerned with the race  team expenses. I sure would like to see one again in Southern California. We  miss Riverside very much."  </P> <P> NASCAR had as many as 60 Grand National races in 1964, but France sees no  return to such an ambitious schedule.  </P> <P> "Most of those races were on short tracks in the Southeast and didn't demand  all the travel we have today," he said.  </P> <P> "Increased costs is the biggest problem facing racing, just like it is  everywhere in society.  </P> <P> "Costs are going up for everything, but the biggest jump is in personnel,  particularly for drivers and engine men. There's not much NASCAR can do about  that. We can't tell owners what to pay their race drivers. Nor should we. That  takes care of itself in supply and demand economics.  </P> <P> "If you can call it a fault, we probably have more good teams than we need.  I'll explain what I mean. For all 40 teams in the Daytona 500 to come to the  final turn of the final lap within a second of each other, someone would win  and someone would finish 40th. For that kind of a finish, it would cost the  same amount to run 40th as it cost the guy who won.  </P> <P> "That means that most of the 40 owners would bust their butts to get an edge  for the next race, meaning spending more money. But if some of the teams had  lower expectations, with lesser budgets, they'd still finish 40th or better. In  other words, it should be possible to have a good racing team on a low budget.  </P> <P> "Drivers like James Hylton, Elmo Langley, Cecil Gordon and Buddy Arrington did  it for years. Today, more and more affluent owners want winning teams, have  money or sponsorship, and run up the cost. It's the same in any business, but I  hate to hear teams continually complaining about not being able to meet the  costs.  </P> <P> "If we could guarantee that the worst you could do was break even, we'd have a  thousand cars lined up. I'd even own one myself. But that's not the way the  world works."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Stock car racing hit the sports scene shortly after World War II was over and  it hit hardest in the Deep South, where Bill France took it off the hard-packed  sand of Daytona Beach and the backwoods of the Carolinas and put it on race  tracks. His son, Bill Jr., now presides over NASCAR, stock car's sanctioning  body, which has long since become a major league operation.  </P></p>

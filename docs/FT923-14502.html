			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Asda in annual loss after Pounds 451m charge ASDA, the Leeds-based grocery chain, yesterday made an exceptional charge of Pounds 451.6m as it announced its annual results. The huge exceptional charge - combined with a 31 per cent reduction in operating profits to Pounds 180m - resulted in a Pounds 364.8m pre-tax loss, compared with a Pounds 168.3m profit the year before. The write-downs at the UK's fourth biggest grocery chain had been well trailed and Asda's share price barely flinched yesterday, closing down 1/2 p at 29 1/2 p. Mr Archie Norman, who took over as chief executive six months ago, said: 'We were determined to restore credibility to the balance sheet and to move forward from a prudent and realistic base.' Asda wrote off Pounds 318.9m on its property and fixed assets. The company said it had adopted a highly prudent policy of revaluing its superstores on an open-market basis rather than at original cost, as is the practice at most other grocery chains. Asda also swallowed exceptional charges of Pounds 72.8m at Asda and Pounds 29.7m at its Allied Maples furnishings subsidiary relating to rationalisation of those businesses. A further write-off of Pounds 30.2m resulted from central distribution start-up costs and last year's financial restructuring. Asda's group turnover grew marginally from Pounds 4.47bn to Pounds 4.53bn in the year to May 2. Sales at Asda's 200 superstores were 4 per cent higher at Pounds 4.31bn but its operating profits slid 26 per cent to Pounds 185.6m as a result of higher operating costs and promotional spending and a tightening of margins. Losses per share amounted to 18.41p (earnings of 8.66p) and Asda announced a final dividend of 0.85p - as indicated at the time of last year's emergency Pounds 357m rights issue - making a total payout of 2.1p (4.8p). The company hinted however at a future cut in dividend; warning that any payout would have to be covered twice by earnings. During the year, Asda said, sales volumes were 'marginally positive' but after stripping out food inflation of 4 per cent to 5 per cent they showed significant slippage. Mr Norman said: 'Following the election there was a recovery in confidence and spending. But in the last two to three weeks that seems to have slowed up a little bit.'

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Observer: Welsh squabbles What a way to run a water board] Welsh Water, which has been frightening its smaller privatised rival, South Wales Electricity, by taking a hostile 15 per cent stake and making nasty noises, has sprung an embarrassing leak. Welsh Water is expected to announce soon a co-operation deal with Manweb whereby it shares some of Manweb's depots in north Wales. It makes sound commercial sense and Welsh Water says in a leaked briefing note that it is disappointed that much larger savings remain unexplored in south Wales. Unfortunately, Welsh Water mistakenly faxed a draft of the proposed press release to South Wales Electricity, which indignantly ripostes that it has always been happy to co-operate on such deals. The problem is that Welsh Water has never suggested it.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, governor of the </F> National Bank of Yugoslavia, by Dimitrije Boarov; place and date  not given: "The Governor of the Hard Dinar"]    [Text] Following the surprisingly good start of the  anti-inflation operation, Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, who headed  the team of experts that drafted the Program for Reconstruction  of the Monetary System and Economic Recovery, was last week  easily elected governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia [NBJ]  in the Yugoslav Assembly (in both houses on 1 and 2 March). We  talked on that occasion with Dr. Avramovic about the broader  "systemic" issues related to the Yugoslav economy's  transition.    [Boarov] Mr. Avramovic, in a short time more people have  rallied around your superdinar than all the political parties  together can command. Are we looking at a widespread "hunger for  stability," or did the old inflationary model collapse by  itself, so that the superdinar was "fated to succeed"?    [Avramovic] I do not know whether there is a difference  between those two views. During the first week the desire to  finally arrive at a stable currency was mixed with great  anxiety. People were saying -- this is fine, but are they able  to negotiate a turnaround? After a week, people began to believe  that something good had been undertaken, although there was  still fear.    To be honest, I personally had become convinced that there  was absolutely no other solution. In the end, we had only one  choice: the choice between distribution of the remaining foreign  exchange reserves and a new currency. The first solution would  have only been a band-aid, while the latter offered a chance of  radical remedy. The desire for stability is, of course, immense,  because people have become frightened. In recent weeks,  hyperinflation has seemed like profound social disintegration of  a very serious kind.    [Boarov] Even though real reconstruction of our system is  only beginning, do you accept the argument that it is now  evident in our country that real transition from a state economy  to a market economy begins with a sound currency and the view is  wrong that it should come only at the end of the reform?    [Avramovic] A sound currency was an absolute precondition  for  anything else. I do not believe that we could have had even a  nonmarket economy under the inflationary flood. It would have  meant, for example, taking food from the farmers by force, which  is what befell Russia in the 1920's. An extreme policy was not  one of the choices.    However, it is not easy to answer the question of what our  market economy will look like in its further development. If I  were making the decisions about that, I would say that the  economy has to function according to very traditional  principles. And that means: sound money, performance of  contractual obligations, no price controls (except for pure  monopolies), total equality of the private, government, and  cooperative sectors, and so on. For me, those are categories  which must be beyond political discussion.    Only the future can show whether such a system would be  predominantly a system of private ownership or not. The  Socialist Party would probably want the volume of government  intervention to be very broad, and some people would want  something else. Perhaps a consensus could be arrived at  concerning a significant role of the government in the economy,  because it has not been proven that the private sector is  inherently superior.    What must not be allowed is for the government to be  involved  in setting prices, establishing rebates.... Nor can it be  juggling interest rates; that is, it can influence them only up  to the level to which a central bank normally influences the  banking system. But here again there is a limit.    [Boarov] Let us turn to the occasion of our meeting. How do  you perceive the election as governor? Some interpret this as a  concentration of responsibility for the possible failure of the  superdinar, while others welcome this as a logical move.    [Avramovic] I hesitated to accept the post of governor. That  was an open secret. I thought the main thing was to draft the  program, because I am not an administrator. I do not like  administrative responsibilities. However, I would not like to  see the whole thing go to ruin.    Whether I can carry out that program better than someone  else  is a question others have answered. In any case, the argument  that all the responsibility is now being thrust on me is not  realistic. I do not think it is a question of that. No one can  thrust everything on one person. There will always be such  attempts if it all goes crazy. But I personally have no fear in  this regard, although everything is possible. The main reason  why I hesitated is that I am not the commander type, and we are  talking about the system of the NBJ, which amounts to two  Russian divisions--10,000 people.    Nevertheless, I believe that I now have a chance to do what  I  think should be done in the way that I think it must be done. I  am, of course, referring to what is in the jurisdiction of the  NBJ. Within the limits of what can be done, and I have a precise  opinion of what it can do and what it must not do, but also what  it must do.    The central bank cannot solve our tax problem, for example.  Nor can it directly change a number of other things. But a firm  dinar can do wonders in various sectors. That I have seen.    [Boarov] There are already debates about the hard dinar in  connection with the so-called stimulation of production. Is this  a contradiction in your program; after all, market demand is  usually primed with "soft money"?    [Avramovic] Well, that is the most interesting question. In  economic policy, the ideal is by instinct and skill to succeed  in finding the "point of equilibrium" among the levels of wages,  the foreign exchange rate, the price of credit, and the cost of  government. Those are the four price blocks, and an economy is  always some price or cost which has to be set properly, and  everything hangs on that. A sound currency is the condition for  that success. Germany, Japan, and Korea have demonstrated that.    The foundation in all these examples was an absolutely firm  fiscal policy. Incidentally, the Germans also had a firm  monetary policy, but for decades the Japanese had a policy of a  low price of credit, but they had a budget which was treated  like Almighty God. It is not a question of any particular  belt-tightening, the Japanese have been borrowing a great deal  for the government on the domestic money market, but confidence  in the yen was immense. You thus had a fantastic situation, you  dropped the parity from 360 yen to the dollar to 100 yen to the  dollar, and your credits were cheap. Loose money is a substitute  for mistakes in setting basic prices.    If you have a firm fiscal situation and a sound currency,  then your possibilities in the field of social services are  immense. Germany has proven that with its social welfare system.  The great tragedy is that now they are tearing it down. Schmidt  was a leftist, but a very serious man. He is not my ideal, but  perhaps he resolved that contradiction among a hard currency,  good social welfare, and a favorable market.    Our situation is additionally burdened, after the  catastrophe, by the problem that unfortunately it is very easy  to move from stability into a new inflation. As soon as you have  a more lasting stability, you need not be so orthodox. But at  the outset, you must.    [Boarov] You spoke about setting basic prices in some  equilibrium. There are those who believe that it is very  dangerous when the government touches those basic prices, and  especially that basic basic price--the price of money.  Particularly because Yugoslavia does not have built-in  "controllers" of economic policy, by which I mean the money  market, the market for capital, and other financial markets.    [Avramovic] That is a key issue. For example, we will not  solve the problem of financing our public services until they  become economic units with a foreseeable profit of 10 to 12  percent, which in turn would make it possible for them to go to  the market for capital.    And what are the basic preconditions for setting up our  financial markets? One is a firm currency, and another is  resolving the issue of old foreign exchange savings. The latter  is important not only from the humanitarian standpoint, but  would be evidence that this government pays its obligations  after all the mistakes that have been made. Savings depositors  are aware how much the government can realistically pay at  present, that it cannot pay much. But some arrangement must be  devised to show that the government wants to discharge that debt.    When those preconditions are met, you have an ideal position  for the finance minister. First, issue a bond for two years or  three at 10- percent interest. And when the price of that bond  jumps to 110, 120, then you are on the move, all doors are open  to you, then you can conduct a policy of low interest rates  without forcing things.    Unless we foul up in the next three or four months, we can  arrive at a good foundation. At the same time, we should not  forget that a blockade is a blockade. Money, however, "does not  smell," and if you have a reputation of absolute solidarity, if  the value of the dinar stands unwaveringly, and if you have an  interest rate 2 or 3 points higher than neighboring states, and  your wages are at the African level, capital will come.    [Boarov] You talk about solidarity, and it occurs to me to  ask about the first "adjustment of the projection" of monetary  policy which calls for issuing 1 billion dinars in the first  quarter. That is, twice or three times as much as was planned at  the outset. Were you consulted about that?    [Avramovic] No, I was not told about that adjustment. But I  will simply tell you that I do not believe in any monetary  projections. I think it is a disaster to project monetary policy  in advance, and the IMF has been spreading that disaster. All  those projections are based on assumptions about the rate of  circulation of the money. From Friedman on down there is no  expert who has invented a reliable method of guessing the rate  of circulation of the money.    There are a fantastic number of variables. We have been  "turning over" the social product of the FRY with 60 million  German marks [DM], while two years ago we did it with DM2.2  billion. To be sure, the economy almost died because of the rate  of circulation.    Before those monetary models were invented, the policy of  the  central banks, the Bank of England, for example, was to work  with small foreign exchange reserves. Every noontime, the board  of the central bank meets in London and decides what to do for  the next three days about the movement of gold prices and  commodity prices. After all, this is not the budget, which  requires annual planning. It is disastrous to equate the budget,  which has fixed obligations, with note-issue policy, which is  not a fixed thing. At the same level of money, depending on the  conditions, you can do twice as much at certain points as at  some other points.    I hope, for instance, that if we really restore confidence  in  the currency, we will have breathing room of one billion or two.  For me, those numbers do not in and of themselves mean anything  (I am speaking in rough terms, they do, of course, have  significance for someone). But look at the American case: After  all the disastrous mistakes of economic policy for 30 years,  half of the dollars issued are sitting in foreign accounts,  which means that the United States has two central banks. One is  the Federal Reserve, and the other central bank consists of all  the central banks in the world. It is much the same with  Germany, whose currency comprises a fourth of world reserves. In  such a situation, those countries have a dual financier. And  what kind of "projections" are we talking about here? We are  not, of course, either the United States or Germany, but if the  world gains confidence that this country's leadership is not  going to play with the money, that is, with the value of the  currency, that is sufficient.    We are not in a situation to be overly orthodox, because of  employment of the labor force. Our immense plus is that it is  objectively so cheap. So if we do not manage to stabilize the  budget as well, at the same time achieving a high rate of  growth, in spite of the sanctions, we will have to turn the  country over to the Germans and the Koreans. They will stabilize  it.    [Boarov] Since the initiation of your program, there have  been malicious comments to the effect that everything has become  cheap except the government. Is our economy capable of  supporting the planned 52-percent share of government  expenditure in the social product?    [Avramovic] You know, I do not like those percentages and do  not use them. None of us knows what the social product of  Yugoslavia is today. There is no figure on that in the first  eight pages of the program. Nothing is known with confidence. We  only know that those miserly $5 billion ($2.6 billion for the  first six months) are the absolute minimum we could set for  government expenditure. You cannot pay lower wages, lower  pensions, you cannot pay the army more miserably than we are  paying now. How the army is getting by with those $600-700  million, believe me, I fail to understand. Even if there are  more policemen here or there, it is all being paid for cheaply.  Our solution, our key, lies in reconstruction of the tax system.    In the fiscal system we have now, there is an obstacle  which,  if I might so put it, I have not worked out intellectually. It  is, after all, terribly illogical. The taxation of business  firms in our country is not based on income, but on the firm's  costs. Indeed mostly on the costs of labor, which in our country  is a factor that exists in abundance. And because labor is the  cheapest factor, instead of maximizing the use of labor, you  multiply the price of labor by two because of taxes. So it is  obvious, then, that there are problems; it is just not clear to  me how this came about at all, because what is income to the  worker is a cost to the firm.    When wages are discussed, the battle is therefore not waged  over those 35 dinars, because it is not 35, but 200 dinars. Much  the same is true of cadastre income, which is really estimated  at a low level, but it cannot be taxed in advance either. After  all, when business firms and farmers begin to borrow money from  the banks to pay their taxes, we are returning once again to  inflationary financing. This must be changed, the tax cannot be  paid out of goods that have been produced, but out of goods that  have been sold. Business firms are still not paying taxes out of  profit, but are borrowing in order to pay them.    [Boarov] I am going back to the question of how to augment  this unclear social product.    [Avramovic] And I go back to that equilibrium of basic  prices. If we find the point, the plateau, the brake (fren)  between the price of labor, the price of credit, the price of  government, the price of public services, and if we solve the  problem of old foreign exchange savings, and if production does  not start up under those conditions, then I do not know when it  will. Even with the blockade. After all, our domestic needs are  immense.    Just one example--we have a million and a half automobiles.  Half of them are worthless. That is a market to keep Zastava  going for several years. And so on. Automobile production is a  very important thing. Germany almost won World War II on the  rise of the automobile industry. That industry has skilled  workers, it has 1,500 engineers, that is not something to  discard. People who talk about going back to a pastoral economy  do not know what they are talking about.    There is exaggeration in these outcries that the government  should stimulate production. Do they mean that it should be  buying goods? Before we advocate that the government should be  ordering products to be produced, presumably there is something  else that can be done with which your paper will surely agree.    [Boarov] You talk about the space on the domestic market.  What are your views on certain issues of a strategic nature,  which, it is true, are not on the agenda at the moment? I am  referring to tariff protection of the domestic market and  foreign economic strategy (East and West).    [Avramovic] As for our export policy, my view is real  simple:  Trade with the Devil himself if it pays.    There are no ideological issues about going out into the  world. The main thing is whether you are cheap and do you have  adequate quality.    On the import side, I favor protection. Not protection which  will turn you into a sick man, not protection that would drive  inputs of imported supplies for the economy way up, but  protection. Of course, if something in the country cannot yield  a profit of 10-15 percent, then it cannot be financed, there is  no point in protecting it.    In principle, if you have a good exchange rate and  utilization of capacity, you can look at only two prices--the  rate of foreign exchange and cost. If you have a hard stable  currency, if you have cheap manpower, and even then you cannot  produce--then get lost!</p>

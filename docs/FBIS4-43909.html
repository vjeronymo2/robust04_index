			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Because of opposition opinions within  the coalition, it has become questionable whether the  constitutional reform that has been prepared in years of work  will actually be passed before the Bundestag election. This  became clear on Tuesday [21 June], following the coalition  meeting chaired by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The second and third  reading of a reform package to amend the Basic Law was scheduled  for next Thursday in the Berlin Reichstag.    As has been learned, there are disagreements between the  Christian Democratic Union /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and  the Free Democratic Party [FDP] in particular about the  expansion of powers for the laender. There is also disagreement  about the acceptance of minority protection and equal rights for  married and unmarried couples as well as the current form of  animal protection. On the other hand, there is no dispute about  including the protection for handicapped people in the  constitution.    According to CDU/CSU circles, the FDP is calling for an  entire package of measures and opposes adopting those individual  points that are not disputed between the coalition parties.  This makes the situation difficult, the CDU/CSU group leaders  said. From the CSU, it was heard that under these circumstances  it might become difficult to achieve a decision at the Berlin  Bundestag session next week. The strengthening of the laenders'  rights, which they want, might be postponed to the next  legislative period.</p>

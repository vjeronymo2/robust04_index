			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Gadaffi woos tourists and foreign investors LIBYA'S leader, Colonel Muammar Gadaffi, has suggested that Libya should encourage mass tourism to the country, where it is now banned, make the Libyan dinar convertible and attract new foreign investment. The suggestions, made in a televised weekend speech, are unlikely to be translated immediately into practical steps. But they represent further advocacy by Col Gadaffi of moves to liberalise Libya's state-dominated economy. The remarks also appear to indicate the Libyan leader's concern over the political isolation and harmful economic effects caused by United Nations sanctions against Libya. These were imposed in April 1992 after Tripoli refused to hand over for trial in the west two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland. The UN last month renewed the sanctions, which include a flights embargo, while the US threatened to tighten them, perhaps to include a ban on oil sales. During the speech Col Gadaffi said Libya should consider creating a law providing guarantees for foreign capital investment. Foreign companies should be invited to invest in tourism. 'Tourism produces a very big income,' he said. 'Libya had a ban on tourism. However, Libya is very, very rich in tourist attractions.' He also said the country should 'put on the agenda' making the Libyan dinar fully convertible, but warned that 'this could only be done when there was adequate production, otherwise it would be catastrophic'. These proposals follow Col Gadaffi's suggestion in February that the government should reduce its role in Libya's economy and his criticism of the way public finances were being handled. Late last year he also urged accelerated privatisation of key parts of the economy. The calls for economic liberalisation - which must be debated by the People's Congress - come as UN sanctions appear to be biting hard. The Libyan government complained last week that the sanctions had cost more than 800 Libyan lives and billions of dollars in revenues. A statement said 691 people had died in road accidents on their way to airports in neighbouring countries, while 150 died because of delays in medical care created by the blockade. The government said sanctions had cost Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.4bn) in lost exports and in losses to the country's livestock caused by shortages of imported vaccines. Libyan Arab Airlines, the state carrier, had also lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Arab attempts to broker a solution to the Lockerbie impasse continue, led by Egypt, the Arab League and countries of the Arab Maghreb Union, but there are no signs of a breakthrough. Col Gadaffi has sought to align himself more closely with his Arab neighbours, speaking recently of the threat posed by Islamic fundamentalism to the region - a concern felt more acutely in Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt than in Libya. Last week he said fundamentalists were 'heretics' who should be 'killed and liquidated just like a dog, without trials'.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Ford blames price variation on currencies FORD of Europe said yesterday it was an 'almost impossible task' to harmonise new car prices across the European Community 'in a market which, itself, is neither stable nor harmonised'. Currency fluctuations were frustrating attempts to bring prices more into line across Europe. It was 'not reasonable to expect manufacturers to make instant price changes, possibly as great as 30 per cent, purely because of exchange rate movements,' said the company. Ford's outspoken criticism of the European Commission's move to create greater 'price transparency' in the car market, came as Brussels prepared for the first time to publish comparative pan-European car price lists. Under the terms of an agreement made with the Commission last year carmakers are due to publish price lists twice a year following fierce complaints in particular from consumer organisations in Brussels and in the UK, which insist that the persistent wide divergence in European car prices have breached EC regulations. Ford admitted yesterday that some of its prices for an identical model varied by up to 30 per cent between markets, but it blamed the divergence on the strength of the D-Mark and the weakness of the Italian lira. The price differences for Ford models between most markets were within the 12 and 18 per cent EC guidelines, said the company, but the price of a Fiesta small car, for example, was 30 per cent higher in Germany than in Italy (at May 1 exchange rates). For all of its four main model ranges the highest prices were in Germany and the lowest in Italy with UK prices in the middle of the range.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULING BLOCKING COAL-FIRED PLANT STANDS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE STATE HIGH COURT REJECTS PLEAS OF DOZENS OF OBJECTORS TO THE  DECISION THAT PREVENTED OPERATION OF THE NEARLY COMPLETED FACILITY IN HANFORD.  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court, rejecting pleas from dozens of developers,  municipalities and financial institutions, on Monday let stand a far-reaching  appellate decision that blocked operation of a nearly completed $70-million  coal-burning power plant in Hanford.  </P> <P> The justices, in a brief order, refused to hear a challenge to a ruling last  June by a state Court of Appeal in Fresno that critics said could bring costly  new delays and uncertainty to building projects throughout California.  </P> <P> The appeal court held that the Hanford City Council, in preparing an  environmental impact report on the project, had failed to adequately consider  its effect on air quality throughout the region and to fully weigh less harmful  alternatives.  </P> <P> The appellate ruling sparked a flood of protests from critics who said that  because the court's environmental requirements were so strict, governmental  agencies would be forced to investigate even clearly unfeasible alternatives  and allow belated, time-consuming court challenges to city and county general  plans.  </P> <P> The state high court, by recent count, had received letters from more than 60  agencies and institutions -- an unusually high number for a court case --  joining the project's builder in seeking review of the ruling. The broad range  of organizations filing letters included the California Chamber of Commerce;  the University of California Board of Regents; Southern California Edison Co.;  Los Angeles and San Francisco; Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment banking  firm; and the Walt Disney Co., the developer of proposed theme parks in Long  Beach and Anaheim.  </P> <P> The justices' refusal to review the issue makes the appeal court ruling binding  on trial courts throughout the state.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for backers of the Hanford project said further efforts would be  made in the trial court to come up with a plan that will meet environmental  concerns and allow completion and operation of the facility.  </P> <P> Christopher W. Garrett of San Diego, attorney for the builder, expressed  disappointment and said the appellate ruling would have "an enormous impact on  the way public agencies grant permits to various residential, commercial and  industrial projects."  </P> <P> E. Clement Shute Jr., a San Francisco lawyer representing opponents of the  project, hailed the high court's action as a display of judicial independence.  "This shows the court realizes the Legislature enacted far-reaching  environmental statutes and that its job is to interpret them as broadly as it  can," Shute said.  </P> <P> The case arose over the proposed construction of a coal-fired cogeneration  plant by GWF Power Systems Inc. to simultaneously provide steam and electricity  to the Armstrong Tire Co. and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.  </P> <P> The tire company was on the verge of closing its plant, with the threatened  loss of 600 jobs, but agreed to remain open when the cogeneration plant -- a  less costly source of energy -- was proposed.  </P> <P> Farm and environmental groups strongly opposed the project, saying it would  significantly increase air pollution, causing further damage to crops, and  reduce ground water levels. But the city's environmental impact report  concluded that the project would have no significant adverse effect, and the  plant was approved.  </P> <P> Opponents brought suit challenging the adequacy of the city's report, but a  Kings County Superior Court in 1988 rejected their contentions, upholding the  city's analysis.  </P> <P> But the Court of Appeal, in a 3-0 ruling, held that the city had failed to  obtain sufficient information to make an informed decision about whether to  approve the project.  </P> <P> The appeal court held that the city had improperly failed to study the  cumulative effect of the project on air quality along with scores of other  developments -- including more than 100 other cogeneration plants -- planned in  the San Joaquin Valley air basin.  </P></p>

However, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries compiled test results  showing that at the present time there is no such worry about  Japan's young reactors. It is thought that a reactor vessel will  be damaged by the weakening of the vessel walls as the reactor  gets older, and in the U.S. there is the argument that such  damage is linked to the age of the reactor.    When a reactor vessel is used for a long time, it is known  that the materials weaken because of the vessel's exposure to  the neutrons resulting from the nuclear fission within. If the  emergency reactor core cooling unit goes into operation in an  old pressurized water reactor, there is the danger of the vessel  cracking because of the sudden temperature change. Although that  sort of brittleness breakdown has never yet occurred, there are  indications that the danger of breakdown increases when the  deterioration of the vessel due to its age is added to poor  conditions such as the presence of small cracks.    Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Takasago Laboratory (Takasago  City, Hyogo Prefecture) produced simulation test materials that  behave the same as actual reactor vessel materials with respect  to the force applied to the vessel because of cooling, the  deterioration of the vessel materials due to neutron  irradiation, and the existence of cracks. The researchers then  verified what happens during cooling under a variety of  temperature conditions.    The results of the tests showed that, even in a reactor  vessel that has been used for 40 years, the destructive force  resulting from thermal shock would not exceed the strength of  the materials. The laboratory's judgment is that that will not  occur in Japan's reactors, which have been in operation for as  long as 20 years.    The tests, which have been carried out at Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries' Takasago Laboratory since 1983, were commissioned by  the Electrical Power Facilities Technology Inspection  Association, a non-profit corporation that is an auxiliary  corporation of MITI.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Mortgage lenders defend checks on solicitors MORTGAGE LENDERS yesterday defended the imposition of new controls on solicitors that are intended to try to stem the rise in mortgage fraud. The controls are part of a concerted move supported by the Council of Mortgage Lenders - but they have produced a storm of complaints to the Law Society, the solicitors' governing body. Solicitors are particularly angry about terms announced by Abbey National this week. From September, solicitors and licensed conveyancers handling Abbey National mortgage work will have to agree to give the bank the right to inspect case files and monitor the way work is carried out. If they do not agree to the terms they will be struck off its panel of approved conveyancers. Mr Andrew Lockley, head of the Law Society's legal practice directorate, said solicitors were concerned about client confidentiality and a condition requiring them to guarantee identities of mortgage borrowers. Abbey National said yesterday that it had had a favourable response to its letter, sent to 16,000 solicitors. 'Mortgage fraud is not a massive problem, but there has been a spate of cases recently,' it said. 'What we are seeking from solicitors is really only a safety net which formalises existing arrangements.' Woolwich, the third-largest building society, announced plans yesterday to follow Abbey National by writing to solicitors on its panel telling them they must be prepared to hand over some details about customers. Nationwide, the second-largest society, has not yet decided on which course to follow. Mr Lockley said the Law Society was concerned about a letter sent this week by Mr Christopher Jowett, group solicitor for Halifax, the largest society. It warned members of its conveyancing panel that if the profession caps compensation payments to financial institutions for fraud by rogue solicitors, Halifax may impose a levy and more rigorous criteria for membership of its conveyancing panel. The profession is considering capping the compensation payments as part of proposals to meet a big increase in fraud claims. Solicitors already face a special levy of Pounds 1,000 each this autumn to top up the Law Society's compensation fund by Pounds 30m. Halifax denied that it was attempting to put pressure on solicitors not to cap the compensation fund. It said solicitors stole more than Pounds 1m from the society last year; if the level of compensation fund protection was limited, the society would have to take other steps to protect itself and limit its losses. The exact level of mortgage fraud in England and Wales is not known. Last year a study by Liverpool University said police forces were investigating more than 1,000 cases involving Pounds 500m. The Metropolitan Police has estimated the present level of mortgage fraud at more than Pounds 1bn. Last year, Mr Michael Learmonth, a solicitor from Mill Hill, north London, was convicted of defrauding 19 building societies and banks out of Pounds 3.79m.</p>

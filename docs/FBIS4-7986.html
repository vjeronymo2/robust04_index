			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by S. Jovanovska: "Snail-Like Steps of the White </F> House"]    [Text] "Do we have diplomatic relations with Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] or not?"  "Who is the U.S. secretary of state, Stephanopoulos or  Christopher?" "Who is shaping U.S. policy toward this  republic?" "Whose interests is President Clinton protecting?"  These are almost unavoidable questions at present briefings in  the State Department, threatening to make our small country a  big subject for discussion. The whole U.S. press has numbered  the "Macedonian question" as one of the weak points of President  Clinton, even the pro-Democratic THE WASHINGTON POST, which  could not keep quiet about the inexplicable -- and by U.S.  standards timid -- attitude of the leader of a superpower, who  had the courage to threaten China, North Korea, Japan, and the  European Community, while he always has to feel the "pulse" of  the Greek lobby whenever Macedonia is mentioned!    Until what point will the establishment of diplomatic  relations between Macedonia and the United States go at a  "snail's pace" and why did the United States allow itself to be  at the tail end of all those who long ago normalized their  relations with this state? These are dilemmas in which our  republic is most interested, particularly after the appointment  two days ago of Victor Comras as chief of the U.S. liaison  office, because whichever way we try to understand and interpret  it, it still is not an embassy, and it still is not a diplomatic  penetration. Although it is difficult to find answers from this  distance, judging by what various official and non-official  sources say, there is a conflict of interests (political)  between the State Department and the White House, due to which,  as Comras himself stated, the decision on full diplomatic  relations is yet to come.    In order to confirm this claim, it is worthwhile making a  small recapitulation. Namely, as a result of synchronized  recognition by the EEC countries and of stronger pressures by  the State Department for recognition and the establishment of  diplomatic relations with Macedonia, on 9 February the White  House announced its decision to approach this action, naming a  number of conditions which were positively met in President Kiro  Gligorov's reply. Soon Secretary of State Warren Christopher  conveyed an unequivocal message saying that "the United States  is interested in maintaining the integrity and stability of  Macedonia," explicitly stating that any possible attempts at its  destabilization would be met with U.S. countermeasures. In the  meantime, Victor Comras was appointed future ambassador to  Macedonia. However, nobody knew until yesterday when he would  come, and on what position. After all, it seems that the March  meeting with the Greek priests and influential Greek Americans,  one of whom is a big financier of the Democratic Party and the  other an adviser of the President himself, who is doing his best  to "conceal the traces" of the "Whitewater" affair, was fatal.  The outcome is known -- as Senator Frank McKloskey stated  publicly, and the White House implemented it tactfully, the  United States froze the establishment of diplomatic relations  with Macedonia, appointing Matthew Niemitz as special envoy, who  was designated to find a solution for the dispute with Greece,  something that cannot be solved for two whole years.    Apparently, the new formula of Clinton and Stephanopoulos is  to link the establishment of diplomatic relations with the  negotiations -- with the aim of keeping the question permanently  open, and to avoid the inconvenient pressures from the one or  the other side, even from the inside, from the State Department,  which is still on the "Macedonian line," assessing the  prolongation as a great danger for the stability of the region.  However, despite the great influence of the Greek lobby  (particularly its money and votes), it is difficult to  understand that a destructive policy, as is the Greek in this  case, can deserve the support of a country which is pledging for  democracy and peace, which is subordinating its foreign policy  to the state, national, and generally accepted interests.  Moreover, all the U.S. efforts to protect Macedonia from the  spreading war are undermined by Greece with its embargo and  other actions.    The visit of Shalikashvili to Macedonia was obviously the  axis of the "equilibrium" which should keep balance between the  non- establishment of diplomatic relations and the determination  to maintain the statehood of Macedonia, and at the same time it  represents an indirect reply to the revealed Greek plans for the  creation of a security zone in Macedonia under some more  convenient circumstances. However, Macedonia is no more  satisfied with indirect support and "slow recognition,"  especially because it is evident that the "slow pace" is  misinterpreted and misused, turned back on the United States as  a boomerang, if it really means what it publicly states and if  there are no other reasons for the tactics.    For now, the arguments that President Clinton is making  cautious diplomatic moves with the aim of maintaining peace are  very strong, as well as that U.S.-Macedonian relations are  moving upwards, which becomes more evident if we remember his  firm stance when he entered the White House more than a year  ago. In a way, the statement of spokesman McCurry is another  confirmation, according to whom "a number of steps should be  taken" -- not stating exactly until when and how many.  Nonetheless, the disposition in the United States and the  growing critics of Clinton's "Macedonian policy" can speed the  pace, because with such an internal conflict, with such critics  in the press, and with such a freedom-loving public opinion, it  is becoming hard to endure.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Business failures drop by 18% The number of companies and business partnerships becoming insolvent fell by 18 per cent in 1993 from 27,150 to 22,116, providing further evidence of economic recovery, Richard Lapper writes. Figures produced by the Austintel Information Group show that the number of receiverships fell by 37 per cent to 2,900, while the number of voluntary liquidations fell by 14 per cent from 13,000 to under 11,150. Austintel obtains its information by attending London High Court and District Registry Court hearings, as well as by maintaining contact with all courts with bankruptcy jurisdiction in England and Wales. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, reported last week that the number of business failures had fallen for the first time since 1988, with the biggest falls in London, Wales and the east Midlands.</p>

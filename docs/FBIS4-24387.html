			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- The "PEOPLE'S DAILY"  [RENMIN RIBAO], China's leading national newspaper, in an  editorial today stressed once again that it is necessary to  severely crack down upon the crime of smuggling.    The Chinese Supreme People's Court made public Sunday [29  May] two serious cases of smuggling at Rushan City in east  China's Shandong Province and at Zhuhai City in south China's  Guangdong Province, respectively. Four principals in the two  cigarette-smuggling cases, including one government official and  three frontier police officers, were executed Sunday morning.    The crimes were committed by smugglers in cahoots with  officers of law enforcement bodies. They carried out their  criminal activities under armed escort and protection from some  local officials. "This shows that smuggling activities are  rampant," the editorial said.    Noting that the criminals in the two cases have all been  severely punished, the newspaper said that "this demonstrates  the firm determination of the central authorities in the  struggle against corruption.    "Anyone violating the law, no matter who, where and in which  department he is, will be punished in accordance with the law."    The editorial pointed out that smuggling is an illegal  economic activity that can severely disrupt the domestic market,  the nation's industry, international trade, the economic order  and the general confidence of society. It has a specially  corrosive effect on cadres. Therefore, it added, the crime of  smuggling is not only an economic problem but also a political  problem.    The editorial said that experience has shown that smuggling  is a growing problem in certain places despite the central  government's repeated orders banning smuggling. It is precisely  because some local officials and officers of law enforcement  bodies have been involved in such criminal activities, that some  local officials have taken the attitude that they can run their  localities as their own fiefdoms, and that corruption has become  rampant in some local government departments and law-enforcement  bodies.    A few localities and departments have put their own  interests  above the national interests, the newspaper said.    The editorial also pointed out that it is a mere pretext for  smuggling activities when some people argue that in the process  of developing a socialist market economy a blind eye should be  turned to smuggling. It stressed that in order to develop a  socialist market economy it is necessary to establish a strict  and complete legal system, and severely crack down on smuggling  activities.</p>

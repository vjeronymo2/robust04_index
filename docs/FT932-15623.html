			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Motoring: When all the choices are good THE conversation goes something like this. Him: 'What have you been driving recently?' Me: 'The new Rover 600, several Mitsubishi Galants and some Peugeot 306s.' Him: 'What were they like?' Me: 'Very good cars indeed. Quiet, quick, refined and enjoyable to drive.' Him: 'But that's what you said about the Ford Mondeo, Vauxhall Corsa and Citroen Xantia you drove a few weeks earlier.' Me: 'That's right. They were all very good cars, too.' The time has come to face the truth. The really bad new car no longer exists. On second thoughts, let me qualify that. The really bad west European or Far Eastern car no longer exists. For all I know, some really dreadful machines may still be made in the depths of what used to be the Soviet Union, or the Indian sub-continent, or the vast republic of China. I do not know because I have not tried them. But it is a racing certainty that any new car you buy will offer safe, reliable and comfortable transport. If these three qualities are your only criteria, you have absolutely no need to spend more than, say, Pounds 18,000 on a motor car. Half that will still buy you more than adequate standards of safety, reliability and comfort. You can have power steering on a Pounds 9,000 car; even automatic transmission, too, if you settle for a Malaysian Proton. And Pounds 18,000, at the most, will buy a car that has everything needed to make a demanding motorist content. Only if you feel compelled to drive a large and / or prestigious car do you need to spend more. Of course, objectivity is the last thing to govern many car purchases or choices of company car. Look at all those high-slung, knobbly-tyred 4 x 4s that spend their lives on urban and suburban tarmac. And the turbo-charged sports coupes driven sedately from home to shops and the golf club. At the moment, though, I will deal with new cars at below this level because I have driven quite a few of them recently. I have praised Ford's Mondeo, the Citroen Xantia and Vauxhall's (Opel) Corsa already. They are not flawless. The Mondeo lacks rear seat space and you feel road bumps more as you go up-range and the tyres get fatter. To my taste, the two-litre was under-geared. The least-powerful version of the elegant and beautifully-suspended Xantia also was geared low enough to be a bit buzzy at 80 mph (128 kmh) on an autoroute. And the fastest Corsa, the 16-valve 1.6i, was a great drive on smooth roads but I felt every single cobblestone on Spanish pavements. None of these flaws is serious, and none affects the general excellence of the cars concerned. Much the same can be said of three other new models I sampled last month: the Rover 600, Mitsubishi Galant and Peugeot 306. There are nine Rover 600s, ranging from a two-litre 620i at Pounds 13,995 to a 2.3-litre 623GSi at Pounds 21,995. It is no secret that, mechanically, they differ hardly at all from the new Honda Accord built at Swindon, Wiltshire. This has been exported for several months and goes on sale in Britain soon after the Rovers reach the showrooms on April 20. Rover has made many cosmetic changes to the front and back ends. The interior is in the tradition of a 1960s' Rover when the marque was the natural choice of country solicitors and bank managers. The name, one feels, is still among Rover's greatest assets. My favourite was the 623 GSi automatic. At 90 mph (145 kmh), and 4,000 rpm, the Honda engine - also made in Britain - could barely be heard over the soft rush of wind, The transmission was ultra-smooth; it even kicked down without a jerk into low at 35 mph (56 kmh). Build quality of all the 600s I tried was first class. The seats are body-hugging and neither too firm nor too yielding. Although the suspension allows quite a lot of vertical wheel movement to take the sting out of rough roads, the ride is well damped and the Rovers hardly roll on corners. Rover is pitching the 600s against the BMW 3-Series. Clearly, the Honda Accord will be a rival if company fleet managers can be convinced a Honda really is British. So will the poshest two-litre Mondeo Ghias and the latest Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra on mainland Europe). There are 21 variants of the Mitsubishi Galant, which is priced from Pounds 12,750 to Pounds 20,299 and looks unnervingly like the Renault Safrane. The entry model is an 1800 saloon. The flagship is a five-door hatchback (Mitsubishi calls it a coupe) with a 2.5-litre, multi-valve V6, four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering and a finger-light, five-speed gearbox. The 2.5-litre 4WD, 4WS performed brilliantly on near-deserted roads in the region around Arcachon in France, showing unbreakable grip when accelerating and cornering. Again my favourite was a front-wheel driven V6, two-litre automatic with a degree of passive rear-wheel steer. The transmission, available on all Galants except the 4WD, 4WS coupe, has electronic control with 'fuzzy logic.' Don't ask me how it works. What it does is sense a driver's mood and contrive to be in the right ratio all the time. Last, but not least, the Peugeot 306, Coventry-built alongside the larger Peugeot 405. Although it uses the same mechanicals as the Citroen ZX, it feels different. For ride quality and general refinement, the 306 is even better than the ZX, probably because it is a little heavier and reflects another two years of development. Peugeot sees as its closest rival the Vauxhall (Opel) Astra, although the 306 lacks the Astra's optional driver-side airbag. It is a little bigger overall, and considerably roomier than, the 205 and replaces the 309, which was a stretched version of the 205.</p>

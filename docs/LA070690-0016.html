			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Like a Rolling Stone: Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman will record his first  solo album in nine years when the Stones wind up their current world tour. The  album is planned for release in March. Fellow Stones Mick Jagger, Keith  Richards and Charlie Watts have all had outside projects in recent years that  were met with no more than moderate popularity. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

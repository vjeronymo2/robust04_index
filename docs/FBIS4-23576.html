			<p>BFN     [Text] An official spokesman of the 12 political  organizations of the Somali Salvation Alliance [SSA] has said  the conference which should have been held on 4 June by the  country's 16 political organizations was delayed because the  Somali National Alliance [SNA], which had agreed to take part,  backed out. The official said the SNA's rejection was  communicated to the SSA by Ambassador Lansana Kouyate, acting  special UN envoy to Somalia, and that the UN Operation in  Somalia [UNOSOM] should therefore clarify to the Somali people  and the world who is responsible for the conference's delay.    The spokesman continued that the SSA members are ready to  participate in the conference, as previously agreed, so as to do  something about the existing problems in the country. The SSA  spokesman also said that a delay in holding the conference could  entail a bleak future for the Somali people. However the 12  organizations are not ready be associated with those advocating  the delay. The 12 organizations, he said, have always shown  their readiness to contribute toward resolving the affairs of  Somalia which have been unresolved for four years. In  conclusion, the official reiterated how UNOSOM bears  responsibility for pinpointing those causing the delay.</p>

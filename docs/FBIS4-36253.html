			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wadi' Kirulus] </F>   [Text] For years the government has turned a blind eye to  the political and social activities of the Muslim Brotherhood,  despite being outlawed since 1954. But during the past few  weeks, there have been increasing signs of a strain in the  Brotherhood's relationship with the government.    The first sign was an anti-government demonstration, in  protest at the death in police custody of a lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani, staged by members of the  Brotherhood-controlled Bar Association and which police  dispersed immediately. Thirty-six lawyers were arrested.    A few days later, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, a prominent  Islamic scholar, was instructed by security authorities not to  deliver a sermon during prayers marking 'Id al-Adha at the  Mustafa Mahmud mosque in Muhandisin. Al-Ghazali was later  received by Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, in what was viewed  as a conciliatory gesture.    Around the same time, 84-year-old Shaykh Hamid Abu-al-Nasr,  the supreme guide of the Brotherhood, was summoned for  questioning by prosecution authorities after leaflets bearing  his name were seized during the 'Id prayers. The ailing Shaykh  did not comply and the order was subsequently cancelled.    On Monday, Al-Alfi announced that "a group of Brotherhood  members have been arrested for anti-state activity." The  newspaper AL- SHA'B, mouthpiece of the Islamist-oriented Labour  Party, put their number at eight and said their arrest was "part  of the escalating government campaign against the Brotherhood."  The eight, who include Ibrahim Sharaf, the private secretary of  the supreme guide, were remanded in custody for 15 days, the  newspaper said.    Mustafa Mashhur, a deputy of the supreme guide, told  AL-AHRAM  WEEKLY he was surprised by the government's actions because "we  are exercising all our activities, whether in the People's  Assembly or in professional syndicates or teachers' cubs, within  the framework of the constitution and under the umbrella of the  law." He said the Brotherhood has not been involved in any act  of violence since it resurfaced during the 1970s. "We even  condemned such acts," he said.    The reason for the clampdown, Mashhur said, could be the  anti- government slogans shouted by lawyers during their  demonstration. But Mashhur denied that those lawyers were  Brotherhood members.    Another reason, Mashhur said, could be the government's  intention to deny the Brotherhood the right to establish a  political party. "They think that if we have an Islamic party,  the Copts will demand a party of their own and this will lead to  civil strife. But this is not true."    Despite the latest arrests, the Brotherhood is carrying on  with its normal activities and "will not be involved in any  escalation, even if the government steps up its measures,"  Mashhur said.    'Isam al-'Aryan, secretary-general of the Doctors Union and  a leading member of the Brotherhood, said he was not worried by  the latest arrests because "this is a pattern to which previous  governments resorted on previous occasions." The reason for the  clampdown, he said, could be a government attempt to bar the  Brotherhood from the national dialogue or from parliamentary  elections scheduled for next year.    Muhammad Salim al-'Awwa, a lawyer described as a  representative of the moderate Islamic trend, said he was  surprised by recent events because the Brotherhood has  distributed leaflets for years and they were never confiscated  and the supreme guide was never summoned for questioning. He  described the government's actions as a "political and religious  mistake" because the Brotherhood is a "strong political and  religious supporter of the constitutional system."    Political analyst Muhammad Sid-Ahmad believes the motive  behind the government clampdown is to exclude the Brotherhood  from the national dialogue. "There are two reasons for this.  First, the government is not prepared to recognise it to  prevent the emergence of an Islamic party, then a Christian  party etc. The second reason is the government's wish to  maintain the legitimacy of the dialogue" by excluding illegal  organisations, he said. But Sid-Ahmad believes the Brotherhood  will be indirectly represented at the dialogue via Ibrahim  Shukri, leader of the Labour Party.    Another political analyst, Tagammu [National Progressive  Unionist Grouping] secretary-general Rif'at al-Sa'id, who keeps  a close watch on the Islamist movement, said the government has  tolerated the Brotherhood for years because it considered it  harmless but was waking up to its "danger".    "There is no moderation in the Islamist current. The  Brotherhood is an extremist organisation that calls for the  establishment of an Islamic state. The violent history of the  Brotherhood speaks for itself," al-Sa'id added.    The Brotherhood instigated the lawyers' demonstration to  cover up for "severe financial malpractices" by the Bar  Association's Council, he continued. The demonstration as well  as televised statements by repentant terrorist 'Adil  'Abd-al-Baqi, implicating the Brotherhood in acts of terrorism,  made the government wake up to the "danger" of the Brotherhood,  he commented.    Asked if the Brotherhood was expected to retaliate for the  government clampdown, Al-Sa'id replied negatively. "On the  contrary, they will kneel down in order to be accepted."</p>

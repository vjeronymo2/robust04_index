			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiza Kowalska and Robert Krasowski: </F> "President's Conditions; Walesa Wants National Security  Council"]    [Text] The president is ready to meet Pawlak and  Kwasniewski, but, in return, he wants the coalition to withdraw  Rosati's candidacy, and he also wants a speedy establishment of  a National Security Council [RBN]. The coalition fears that the  RBN will strengthen the president's powers to an undesirable  extent.    "The president is open to proposals for a meeting with the  coalition's leaders," stated Andrzej Drzycimski, the Belweder's  spokesman, after a Walesa-Oleksy meeting during which the Sejm  speaker tried to persuade the president to meet Prime Minister  Pawlak and Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leader of the Democratic  Left Alliance [SLD].    But Drzycimski also suggested that such a meeting may take  place only after the coalition meets two conditions.    The first would be the coalition's official decision to give  up trying to force Dariusz Rosati's candidacy for the post of  finance minister and deputy prime minister. The president  assured Oleksy yesterday that his decision to reject Rosati's  candidacy is irreversible.    Second, the Belweder is demanding an acceleration of work on  the establishment of the RBN.    "It does not make sense to establish spur-of-the-moment and  extraconstitutional agencies" is the way Drzycimski commented on  the idea of a Walesa-Kwasniewski-Pawlak meeting. "But the RBN  and, until it is established, the National Defense Committee  [KOK] could be such a constitutional forum."    "I want to believe that what Minister Drzycimski says has  nothing to do with what Mr. President thinks," Jerzy  Szmajdzinski of the SLD told ZYCIE WARSZAWY. "After all,  completely different issues are discussed during KOK's sessions."    The purpose of the trilateral meeting suggested by the SLD  is  to resolve the political stalemate caused by the rejection of  Rosati's candidacy. The SLD fears that a withdrawal of Rosati  and the submission of a new candidate will not solve the problem  because there are no guarantees that the president will not  apply a veto a second time.    Drzycimski said yesterday that, before an official  announcement of a new candidate, the coalition should present it  to the Belweder. The president's spokesman admits that there is  no constitutional requirement for the government to consult the  president over candidates for governmental posts. "But, if one  wants the candidate to be approved...," Drzycimski said.    Both parties to the meeting denied that the name of a new  SLD  candidate was mentioned during the talks.    It is still not known when the Walesa-Pawlak-Kwasniewski  meeting could take place. Drzycimski stated that it was not  possible up to now because Kwasniewski has been abroad. But  Oleksy stated that the SLD leader is returning on Friday, and it  is possible that the meeting will take place that day.    Oleksy said after the meeting that he was trying to persuade  the president to sign the budget law and the electoral law to  gmina [small administrative units] councils soon. But the  president said he has not yet made a final decision on these  issues.    --A decision to establish the RBN was made on the initiative  of the Belweder during the most recent KOK session, in November  1993. The RBN was supposed to be the supreme state agency in the  area of the country's defense system and security. The  government would have to execute the RBN's decisions, whereas  the RBN's composition would be the same as that of KOK--among  other things, it would include the president; the prime  minister; Sejm and Senate speakers; chiefs of the Defense  Ministry, the Internal Affairs Ministry, the Foreign Ministry,  and the Finance Ministry; and the chief of the President's  Office. The coalition has initially agreed to the establishment  of the RBN, and Sejm Speaker Oleksy even promised speedy  legislative proceedings. But once specific items relative to  the RBN were presented, the coalition refused to support the  idea any longer. According to the coalition's representatives,  the RBN's composition would cause an imbalance in the legal  status guaranteed by the Constitution because a majority of the  RBN's members would be associated with the Belweder camp. The  Belweder in turn thinks that the RBN idea limits presidential  powers, and that is why the coalition leaders, who are already  making plans to assume the presidency, want to prevent its  establishment.</p>

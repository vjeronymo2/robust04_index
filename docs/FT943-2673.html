			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (6): Get started with a Pep - Tax planning / The annual maximum may not seem much, but a married couple could have sheltered Pounds 110,400 by now Tax planning for the very wealthy is far broader in scope than for those with more modest means. Although all the basic tax-planning steps of maximising personal allowances and using tax-efficient investments still apply, wealthier investors will find it worthwhile to engage in other tax-efficient devices, such as setting up a trust or taking advice about offshore investments. Tax-efficient investments If you already have a stockbroker managing a discretionary portfolio, he is likely, as a matter of course, to protect the portfolio against capital gains and income tax through the use of a personal equity plan (Pep), into which an annual maximum of Pounds 9,000 (Pounds 6,000 into a general plan and Pounds 3,000 into a single company Pep) can be invested annually. This may not seem a large amount, but a married couple who have made use of Peps since they first came into existence in 1987 (and who had already used up their 1994-95 tax-year allowance), would have sheltered Pounds 110,400 by now. More exotic and riskier tax-efficient investments include the new Enterprise Investment Scheme (see page 16 of this survey) and enterprise zones. The latter give tax relief on most of the cost of an investment in designated commercial property, and on the interest on borrowings to fund the investment. It is, in principle, a 10-year investment; and, since it is potentially risky, anyone considering the investment should take professional advice. CGT and IHT planning Everyone has an annual capital gains tax exemption of Pounds 5,800, which can be used up by 'bed-and-breakfasting' shares - by selling them one day and buying them back the next - or by realising gains in the same year as losses. It is also possible to delay paying CGT by reinvesting the gain in shares in an unquoted trading company. There are other CGT mitigation measures available to those who own their own business but, since this is a complicated area, it is best to consult your tax adviser. For many people wanting to protect their wealth from inheritance tax, the use of a trust will be essential. A trust is a legal arrangement between the person providing the funds (the settlor) and the person holding them (the trustee) for a beneficiary. If you want to pass money on to your adult children, an interest-in-possession trust, confines tax made on capital gains in the trust to be taxed at 25 per cent, rather than 40 per cent. The tax on income will be at your children's rate of tax, rather than your own; and, provided you survive 7 years after drafting making the trust, it can reduce an inheritance tax bill from 40 per cent to nothing. Trusts can also be used to protect money against the unexpected. If the trust has been drawn up correctly and the trustees chosen wisely, your money will be managed in accordance with your wishes, even if you fall prey to mental illness, and after your death will prevent your wealth being eaten up by avaricious relatives or future creditors. Those worried that a future government might put up direct taxes or reduce a rapidly-diminishing set of loopholes, can use existing legislation to set up a trust. Caroline Garnham, tax and trusts specialist at the City firm of Simmons &amp; Simmons, says: 'The existing taxation of wealth is not riddled with loopholes; it merely happens to be exceedingly generous. Under a Labour government, this will undoubtedly stop. A trust is an extremely convenient way of passing wealth to the next generation now, and so taking advantage of the existing tax rules without losing control over the investment and management decisions.' Traditionally, any prospect of a Labour government has sent millions of pounds offshore, to avoid the reimposition of exchange controls. This process, even if the funds are held in trust, according to Garnham, is only tax-efficient for those who are non-UK domiciled but UK resident. Otherwise, the funds remain chargeable to income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax if either the settlor or their family can benefit from it during the settlor's lifetime. However, the offshore trust can be used as a tax-efficient way of passing money on to beneficiaries. As with an onshore trust, there is no CGT to pay on death; but in an offshore trust, tax on subsequent capital gains will be deferred until a capital payment is made to a beneficiary. Does tax mitigation, using trusts, always involve benefiting others at your expense or waiting until after your death before it becomes tax-effective? Not necessarily, says Garnham. 'But in most cases if you want to have your cake and eat it, the scheme will be based on flaws in the legislation, of which there are now precious few.' You can set up an offshore structure to defer CGT future gains during your lifetime, but 'these schemes are highly complex. They are only really appropriate for those prepared to fight if needs be,' warns Garnham.</p>

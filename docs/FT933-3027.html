			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / St Louis bank cuts interest rates THE Southwest Bank of St Louis, which in the past has acted as a bellwether for bank lending rates in the US, yesterday cut its prime rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.75 per cent, its first cut since July 1992, writes Richard Waters in New York. Most other banks failed to follow suit, and several of the biggest commercial banks said they had no intention of cutting their prime rates. However, after two years in which US banks have rebuilt their lending margins, the move seemed an early sign that these are likely to come under pressure soon. The Southwest Bank of St Louis said its cut reflected a weakening of the US economy. Higher taxes in this summer's budget are also likely to weaken small businesses, said Mr Drew Bauer, chairman. Lending margins grew from just over 4 per cent in 1990 to 4.5 per cent last year, partly as a result of the large gap then between short-term and long-term interest rates. The improving financial health of the US banking industry prompted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to announce yesterday it would shed half the 6,600 jobs in its liquidation division by the end of 1996. Only 34 banks have failed so far this year, compared with 122 in 1992. The agency takes over failed banks and repays depositors.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / De Klerk sets March 17 for referendum on reforms: S African president seeks mandate to scrap apartheid SOUTH AFRICA'S whites will vote on March 17 to decide whether to replace apartheid with a negotiated new constitution. The referendum will determine the future of political reform and of the country's president, Mr FW de Klerk. 'I have to know that those who gave me a mandate in the first place are still standing by me,' Mr de Klerk said in a televised address as he announced the date of the poll and the referendum question. Voters will be asked: 'Do you support continuation of the reform process which the state president began on 2nd February, 1990, and which is aimed at a new constitution through negotiation?' The president made clear the referendum would be the last chance for whites to stop the process of reform; no further poll would be held to ratify a negotiated constitution. The prospect of such a poll had become a point of contention between Pretoria and the African National Congress. The white supremacist Conservative party was meeting last night to decide whether to boycott the poll, on the grounds that its leaders were not consulted in drawing up the question and because the government has refused to count votes by constituency, a method favouring the party. Conservative supporters would be expected to vote 'no' in the poll, because their party opposes negotiated power-sharing with blacks. But the vote will also pit the personality of the charismatic and shrewd Mr de Klerk against that of the dour Mr Andries Treurnicht, the Conservative leader. A Conservative boycott would represent a tacit defeat, and would substantially reduce the party's influence over white politics. Recent opinion polls have shown that Mr de Klerk commands majority support among whites, and the only other large white party, the liberal Democratic party, has given him its backing. Daily newspapers have declared their support for Mr de Klerk, and the state broadcasting media is likely to favour the ruling National party, with its campaign of 'vote Nationalist or vote war'. Mr de Klerk has said he and his government will resign if he loses the vote. Mr de Klerk said yesterday he expected a 'yes' vote from those who wanted a constitution which would 'eliminate discrimination on the basis of race and offer all South Africans democratic participation: but also a constitution which will offer adequate security in respect of the maintenance of important values, which will be able to protect certain vested rights and which will prevent any abuse of power effectively'. Mr de Klerk said his National party would seek ways to protect white rights in a new constitution through power-sharing and guarantees of property rights. The ANC yesterday detailed its proposals for a multiracial interim government, which contained reassurances for whites frightened of majority black rule. Mr Thabo Mbeki, a senior ANC leader, said he believed an agreement could be reached by April on an interim government. The ANC envisages an interim government council formed from the 19 parties and groups attending the talks, known as the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). The council would supervise the security forces and other key government departments which would temporarily remain under their present ministers. A separate, neutral electoral commission would be set up. Universal suffrage elections for a constituent assembly, based on proportional representation, should be held within six months of the council being set up and the assembly should finish its work within nine months. The constituent assembly would act as an interim parliament.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Losses halved at Seafield HALVED pre-tax losses of Pounds 11.1m, compared with Pounds 22.4m, were announced by Seafield, the Dublin-based transport, warehousing and property group, for 1992. The loss was mainly attributable to a write-down in property values of Pounds 6.6m and Pounds 1.9m of realised losses on the sale of properties. Exceptional losses last time amounted to Pounds 19.5m. Mr Brian Chilver, chairman, said the property division had been slimmed down and over the past three months the group had been involved in negotiations for a restructuring. Turnover improved to Pounds 45.2m (Pounds 22.8m). Interest charges fell to Pounds 4.96m (Pounds 5.39m) as property disposals allowed the group to repay Pounds 17.8m of borrowings. Losses per share were cut to 15.4p (31.9p).</p>

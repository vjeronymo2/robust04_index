			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UN plans for W Sahara 'in jeopardy' UNITED NATIONS plans to bring peace to the former Spanish colony of the Western Sahara are 'in serious jeopardy', according to a report to the US Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. The report, prepared by Mr George Pickart, staff member of the committee, claims the UN Mission for Referendum in Western Sahara (Minurso), which is supposed to oversee a referendum on the future of the territory in the autumn, is suffering from the 'lack of political support from the UN hierarchy in New York'. This, it says, is demonstrated by 'the UN's repeated refusal to provide even limited logistical support to the military observers in the field' and its refusal to respond politically to reports of ceasefire violations. This has 'undermined Minurso's credibility' with both protagonists - Morocco and the Polisario Front. This problem 'has been compounded by the government of Morocco's unwillingness to co-operate with Minurso's operations'. Polisario, which at first chose to co-operate fully with Minurso has, in the past two months, been increasingly unwilling to co-operate. Allegations of irregularities in the mangement of Minurso's budget procedures are further compounding an already difficult situation. The report, being debated by the committee yesterday, argues that the Moroccan authorities had delayed delivery of crucial supplies of communications and sanitation equipment to Minurso.</p>

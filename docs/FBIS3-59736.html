			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Mitsui Toatsu Chemical Co., Ltd. has developed a new  type of semiconductor package using metal/polyimide/copper  plating, entering the market with a product called the MQP  (metal quad package). Its structure consists of bonding a double  layer FPC (flexible printed circuit board) to a copper board  which has good heat dissipation characteristics without using  glue. The leads are formed by etching copper foil. A prototype  has been developed in the form of an LCC (leadless chip carrier)  with leads bending inward, to eliminate concern over mounting on  printed circuit boards. Printek, an associated printed wiring  board manufacturing company headquartered in Atsugi, Kanagawa,  has set up trial production of 20,000-30,000 pieces per month,  and has begun to ship samples. Since internal wiring can be  easily performed, applications are also expected to be found in  MCM (multichip module) applications. Beginning in FY94,  production could shift upward to 200,000 or more pieces per  month.    The prototype package is 10mm square, and the width of  conductive leads which have been copper-plate etched, is  75&mgr;m.  Spacing between leads is 100&mgr;m. Although the [acta] lead  pitch  is 0.2mm, Mitsui Toatsu plans to reduce this to 50/50&mgr;m,  0.1mm  pitch in the future, which will be optimum for mounting ASICs  (application specific ICs). ASICs and CPUs require packages  having high pin counts, and the amount of power consumed is  large, so dissipating the heat generated by the chip has been a  problem. Until now, there has been no low-cost, highly  functional package material available.    The MQP developed by Mitsui Toatsu uses a design in which an  adhesive polyimide layer is situated between copper foil and  copper plate; the leads are identical to TAB (tape automated  bonding), and copper foil is etched. it can be shaped like an  LCC in which the chip is bent, so ordinary mounting processes  can be used. The package can even accommodate 2-3W high power  chips.    Like the FPC, internal wiring can be performed, and multiple  layers (up to four) can be achieved. For these reasons, the  package is also expected to find a large future market for MCM  applications.    At present Mitsui Toatsu has set up experimental facilities  at an associated company called Printek, and is producing  20,000-30,000 pieces per month. Samples are already being  shipped. At the mass production stage, there is likely to be a  significant reduction in cost compared to the ceramic-type LCC,  and the company would like to begin commercial production as  early as FY94, at 200,000-300,000 pieces per month.</p>

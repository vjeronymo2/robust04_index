			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> MARCHERS PROTEST IMMIGRATION TIDE  </P> <P> More than 200 people, many with candles in hand, marched through the streets of  downtown San Diego Sunday in a symbolic rebuff of what many view as a rising  anti-immigrant sentiment throughout Southern California. The candlelight walk  was also designed as a counterpoint to the ongoing Light Up the Border  protests, in which U.S. motorists here shine their headlights toward Mexico as  an act of protest against illegal immigration. Meanwhile, in the  Calexico-Mexicali border area, demonstrators planned a separate candlelight  march Sunday in honor of victims of violence along the U.S.-Mexico frontier.  </P></p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / MPs seek probe into all aspects of safety in tankers A POLITICAL row has broken out over the terms of the government's inquiry into the Braer tanker disaster off Shetland. As gales prevented salvage teams from boarding the vessel to see how much of the tanker's cargo of 84,000 tonnes of crude oil remained in its tanks, MPs and maritime unions called for the inquiry to be broadened to cover all aspects of tanker safety. Mr Brian Orrell, assistant general secretary of Numast, the shipping officers union, said the government was 'skirting round the real issue'. The union would like to see the inquiry broadened to cover the 'horrendous decline in safety at sea'. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said his department's Marine Accident Investigation Branch would investigate six areas: the causes of the accident; the action taken to prevent it; the action taken after the event; the seaworthiness of the vessel; the competence of the crew; and the safety of navigation. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environmental protection spokesman, described the inquiry - which is to start immediately - as 'totally inadequate.' The Braer's operator, B&amp;H group, said last night a salvage barge was being prepared to remove the remaining oil from the tanker. It is expected to arrive off Shetland on Sunday. The Braer, which ran aground at Garths Ness in Quendale Bay at the southern end of Shetland on Tuesday, has not broken up. But bad weather, expected to continue for at least two days, forced a reduction in flights to spray chemical dispersants on the oil leaking from the tanker. Deep oil slicks run for about 5 to 6 miles both north and south from the tanker. The slicks are about 50 metres wide and are being pushed against the shore by strong westerly winds. A thin film of oil, described as a rainbow sheen, runs for 14 miles on the west side of the island and reaches the entrance of Clift Sound and the south end of Burra island, bringing it within a few miles of salmon farms, one of the sectors of the Shetland economy most threatened by the spill. Shetland Islands Council revealed that it had drawn up a contingency plan to evacuate residents from the area close to the wreck if atmospheric pollution were to pose a threat to health, but it said that so far there was no danger to health. It refused to give details of the plan, which could involve moving several hundred people. By yesterday, some 235 dead birds had been found in the area since the tanker ran aground and 45 live birds had been rescued. Privately, the emergency co-ordination team acknowledged that the pollution could have been much worse. The slick is relatively small, most of the oil is light and 30 per cent of it is thought to be evaporating. Mr George Sutherland, director of marine operations for Shetland Island Council, said: 'If anything is good about this incident it is the wind direction.' Lord Caithness, the shipping minister, who has been in Shetland since Wednesday, said he was worried that exaggerated reports about the disaster would damage the prospects of the Shetland salmon farming and fishing industries, even though they had not been affected.

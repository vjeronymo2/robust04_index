			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Prestwick seeks Pounds 4.5m Prestwick Holdings, the Scottish printed circuit board maker, is to raise Pounds 4.5m through a 4-for-5 rights issue of 20.1m shares at 24p each. It is also selling Electroconnect, its electronic design subsidiary, to its management for Pounds 1.65m. Prestwick lost Pounds 3.9m in the year to July 31 1993 and a further Pounds 1.95m in the first six months of the current year. In January Mr Archie Coulson of Postern, the corporate rescue specialist, took over as executive chairman. He said yesterday Prestwick was now trading profitably. It would incur a pre-tax loss of not more than Pounds 1.23m in the current year. Operating profit for continuing operations would be not less than Pounds 765,000, compared with a loss of Pounds 96,000 in the first half.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: American General pins hopes for Unitrin bid on shareholders American General, the US insurance and consumer finance group, yesterday indicated that it did not plan to intensify its Dollars 2.6bn battle for control of Unitrin, a smaller financial group, but was hoping pressure from that company's shareholders would lead to a quick deal. The Texas-based company's bid, first made to Unitrin's board in early July and revealed on Tuesday, has been rejected by the Unitrin board. A takeover would add to American General's home-sales force, which specialises in selling insurance and other financial products to mostly blue-collar households in the US. Mr Harold Hook, American General's chairman and chief executive, said the announcement had been made to encourage Unitrin's shareholders to put pressure on the company to accept a deal. 'If the shareholders don't bring the pressure, we probably wouldn't bring a siege approach,' he said. 'This isn't the opening shot in a long war.' An important part of American General's campaign involves the 17 per cent of Unitrin's shares held by Mr Henry Singleton, who until earlier this year was the company's chairman. Mr Singleton, 78, was instrumental in building up Unitrin and is believed to retain considerable influence. A successful American General bid would throw into question three large equity stakes in US companies held by Unitrin, worth around Dollars 1bn. These are a 28 per cent interest in Litton Industries, the defence electronics company; 28 per cent of Western Atlas, an oil services company spun off by Litton earlier this year; and 43 per cent of Curtiss-Wright, an aerospace components maker. American General said it believes that Unitrin, with shareholders' funds of Dollars 2bn, has Dollars 1.4bn too much capital. If successful in the bid, it would be likely to sell the assets.</p>

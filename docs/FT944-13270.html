			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Mint canvasses views on Pounds 2 coin A Pounds 2 coin and a smaller, lighter and re-shaped 50p coin could be in circulation in less than three years if the public wants them. The Royal Mint yesterday launched a consultation programme on a Pounds 2 coin and changes to the 50p coin. More than 1,000 organisations representing the main handlers of coins, such as banks, the retailing and vending industry and special interest groups for the blind and elderly, have been invited to comment on several options. Opinions are being sought on the possibility of withdrawing the 50p and 2p coins. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, asked the Royal Mint in May to conduct the review. The Mint has produced sample coins to gauge public reaction. The idea of a streamlined 50p coin arose after the introduction of smaller and lighter 5p and 10p coins. In the consultation document, which sets out arguments for and against a Pounds 2 coin, two alternatives for the new denomination are introduced. The Mint is considering either a bi-metal or single metal coin. Either version would be bigger than the Pounds 1 coin, but thinner and lighter. Options for the 50p coin are a smaller version of the seven-sided coin, a smaller, rounded coin, or retaining the coin in its present form. Mr Roger Holmes, chief executive of the Royal Mint, said: 'The 50p coin is simply the heaviest coin in Europe and uses the most metal. But we are not making any proposals about it or the Pounds 2 coin as such. We are just looking to see what the public wants.' The consultation period will run to the end of the year, and a decision is not expected until next spring. If a change were decided on, new coins would be in circulation by 1997.</p>

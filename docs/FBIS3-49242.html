			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 on 7 January carries in its  regular 14-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in  the Republic. Reception is fair to poor.    The studio announcer introduces the block of fighting  reports  with a warning to the citizens of Sarajevo "to observe strictly  all the measures in line with the general alarm, as the chetniks  have been shelling the city heavily since early morning."    Reporting from Olovo, Velid Djindo says that "last night was  marked by loud explosions of shells fired from the heavy  artillery of the [Serbs and Croatian Defense Council -- HVO]  occupying forces. Olovo was fiercely shelled just after  midnight, but fortunately that attack as well as the bestial  ones this morning passed without human casualties."    The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 3d Corps reports that "following  the report by Croatia Radio Television about the fighters of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army having massacred 74 civilians in  Krizancevo Selo, the members of the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] British Battalion yesterday visited this area. In  front of the BBC and Reuter cameras, everyone could see that the  graves contained bodies, not massacred, of the HVO fighters  killed in the latest Ustasha offensive on the Vitez front."    In his report from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "it was a  very dramatic night. The Serb aggressor shelled the defense  positions heavily, also activated his sabotage groups, and used  his aircraft intensively for the transportation of men and  equipment. At about 2100 last night, an enemy  reconnaissance-sabotage group tried to break through our lines  in Lipovac. The defenders responded quickly, however, and  forced the enemy saboteurs to pull back. This was followed by  barrages of 82-mm and 120-mm mortars fired from enemy  positions." He says that "last night was one of the busiest  ones along the air corridor. In groups of two and three the  enemy transport helicopters kept flying back and forth from  (Razljevo) to Pelagicevo between 1800 and 2200. At about 2200  one enemy aircraft turned from the usual  Bijeljina-Brcko-Pelagicevo direction and flew from Lopari to  Srebrenik. According to further information, the aggressor's  helicopter then headed toward Maglaj."    Describing the situation in Maglaj, Hajrudin Sermic says  that  "yesterday evening was extremely hard for the citizens of the  town. Maglaj was exposed to pounding by the heaviest artillery  and tanks, while the drunk chetniks helped along by [HVO  commander] Lozancic's fighters fired dum-dum and incendiary  ammunition from antiaircraft machine guns and guns." He says  that "last night the chetniks again made fools of the Security  Council and NATO. One of the aggressor's helicopters infiltrated  the group of transport planes airdropping aid to the population  and carried out its combat mission unhindered."    Izudin Durakovic reports from the Gracanica front that "all  night the chetnik forces fired at the defense lines and  residential areas in the zone of responsibility of the Gracanica  Operative Group. On the Doboj front, the chetniks from Lipac  and Radici used 82-mm and 120-mm mortars against (Sanicvisi) and  Klopotnica, while from (Prenja) they fired with a 155-mm  howitzer at Velika Brijesnica." He says that "since 0400 this  morning the chetniks have been pounding the defense lines on the  Gracanica front." During the night, he adds, "the aggressor  carried out an intensive regrouping of his forces. Three  truckloads of men arrived in (Palezica) from Doboj and another  four in Stipovac. Their helicopters were also flying along the  Bosansko Petrovo Selo-(Kagmus)-(Boljenic) route, and along the  (Hrtova)-Rosulje-Vijenac route."</p>

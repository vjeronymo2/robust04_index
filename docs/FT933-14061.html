			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Clinton sees loans for poor areas PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday proposed giving US community financial institutions Dollars 382m (Pounds 254.6m) in seed money over four years, to encourage lending in devastated inner cities and poor rural areas, Reuter reports from Washington. 'Millions of Americans in low- and moderate-income neighbourhoods have no bank where they can cash a cheque, borrow money to buy a home, or get a small loan to start a business or keep one going,' the White House said. Under the proposal, Mr Clinton would try to meet his 1992 campaign pledge of creating a network of 100 community development banks and financial institutions. The Dollars 382m in seed money would stimulate private lending in many rural and urban communities starved of affordable credit, capital and basic banking services. Also, his plan would require regulators to reduce paperwork at banks, in return for an increase in lending to low-income borrowers.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Rivers watchdog seeks costs from Greenpeace THE NATIONAL Rivers Authority is seeking Pounds 100,000 in costs from Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, which has decided to drop a High Court action against the authority. Greenpeace claimed that the rivers watchdog had not fulfilled its responsibilities to control pollution in the case of the Albright &amp; Wilson chemicals plant on the Cumbrian coast. The company was fined after Greenpeace initiated court action alleging it had allowed polluting materials above the permitted limits to escape into the Irish Sea. Greenpeace had been given leave to take the authority to the High Court, but in a letter to the authority it said it was now satisfied that proceedings did not need to be continued. Lord Crickhowell, chairman of the authority, said yesterday he would not agree to the proceedings being stopped without full payment of costs arising from the 'costly and groundless' case. This is the first time in the UK that an organisation has tried to claim costs from a 'green' lobbying group. Lord Crickhowell said the proceedings were 'ill-conceived and totally unjustified'.</p>

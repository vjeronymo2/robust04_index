			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Japanese make prompt pledge on Haiti Japan, the world's largest aid donor, yesterday said it was ready in principle to offer 'appropriate co-ordination' to help democracy emerge in Haiti. The assistance Japan has in mind was unspecified. But the speed at which the offer came, from Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, contrasts starkly with Tokyo's once slow response to fast moving events on the international stage. Only last weekend, it dispatched, with a minimum of hand-wringing, 470 soldiers to help Rwandan refugees in Zaire and neighbouring countries. The Rwandan mission won praise yesterday from a visiting Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, who welcomed Japan's approach for permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council. Mr Kono greeted the last-minute peace accord between the US team and Haiti's military regime as important progress towards restoring legitimate government and a democratic system there. The form of Japanese aid will depend on what the United Nations asks it to do, added Mr Kunihiko Saito, the vice foreign minister, and Japan's most senior diplomat.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raul Llanos Samaniego] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas State, 24 Jun --  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, presidential candidate for the  Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), has unveiled to  southeastern businessmen his economic program for the 1994-2000  period. The fundamental premises of his plan are respect for  monetary and fiscal discipline, greater deregulation, war on  corruption, definition of the state functions, and greater  Mexican incorporation into the world economy. That program, he  said, will allow us to grow at a 6 percent rate in 1996 and  generate from 800,000 to 1 million jobs a year, which is why  public and private investment will be raised to 25 percent of  GDP.    In attending the Eighth Southeastern Business Forum,  Cardenas  Solorzano explained that his program will be made up of three  complementary and concurrent phases: the orderly transfer of the  management of the economy, an emergency plan to restore growth  and create jobs, and, lastly, sustained growth, social  development, and protection of the environment.    The candidate explained that during the first phase of its  implementation, from September 1994 to June 1995, a package of  measures will be created to maintain the stability of the  exchange rate, encourage investment flow, and reevaluate the  Mexican Government's ties with its foreign partners,  international organizations, and the banking and commercial  entities of the countries with which greater economic exchange  exists.    At the same time, Cardenas Solorzano explained that a  government economic team will be set up with people of great  technical capacities and recognized integrity and  professionalism, "who have not joined the economic team that  designed and implemented the current government's degrading  economic policy."    During the second phase, he said, an emergency plan would be  implemented to regain growth and create jobs, which would be in  effect for two years and require resources close to 16 billion  new pesos.    Speaking to approximately 500 businessmen from Mexico's  southeastern region, he noted that within this context public  investment will receive a selective, orderly, and soundly  financed boost, as this investment will serve as the initiator  of economic reactivation owing to the stimulus it will give to  local and foreign investments.    During the meeting, Cardenas Solorzano indicated that the  emergency public investment plan will target the following  priority areas: improving and expanding the road network;  repairing, equipping, and expanding railroads and ports;  increasing the capacity to generate energy and refine oil; and  building and repairing schools, hospitals, housing, and urban  services.    After describing his economic program as "viable, realistic,  and responsible," the PRD candidate mentioned the sources from  which the required investment would be financed: savings  stemming from the elimination of squandered resources, waste,  unnecessary bureaucracy, and chiefly from the war in the federal  administration [as published], from which he expects to obtain  3.2 billion news pesos.    Similarly, the financing would come from utilizing the rest  of the Contingency Fund resources that would make it possible to  obtain 1.2 billion pesos and a careful handling of the debt,  sources which he expects will generate 10.6 billion new pesos,  equivalent to 1 percent of the GDP.    "The greater payment of interests would be compensated with  taxes, as a result of a higher level of economic activity and,  therefore, of tax collecting," he said.    Within his emergency plan, Cardenas Solorzano indicated that  a new credit policy would be established and for this purpose,  funds with preferential rates would be channeled to the micro,  small, and medium businesses. He also proposed fiscal  incentives for businesses, through actions that will lower the  cost of production capital, such as accelerated depreciation  formulas, lifting import controls on capital goods, and reducing  tariffs on work, farm, and construction vehicles.    The third part of the plan, he added, entails launching an  economic growth program with equality. It will include an  industrial policy, a policy for rural areas, fiscal, political,  and social policies, promotion of education, a policy for income  distribution, and an ecological policy.    The meeting is being attended by businessmen from the  country's southeastern states, who hope to hear the presidential  candidates of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], the  National Action Party [PAN], and the PRD explain their economic  proposals to fight poverty and develop not only this region, but  the entire country. Nevertheless, PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo  said he would not attend the meeting. The same situation holds  true for Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe, who had been scheduled to  participate the first day of the meeting. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas  was the only one to present his economic plan. PAN candidate  Diego Fernandez de Cevallos limited himself to presenting a  number of diverse measures to economically stimulate this  geographic area.    Speaking to the businessmen, Cardenas stressed that the  basic  premise of this program is economic democracy, in other words,  "production areas goals, which are defined on the basis of the  interests of the majority of the underprivileged Mexicans and on  economic decisions in which producers, workers, citizens, and  government leaders are involved."    He proposed a change in the economic strategy, indicating  that his plan "does not mean returning to the past, limiting the  role of private enterprise, returning to the state enterprises  that have already been sold, erecting barricades to foreign  trade, or closing ourselves to foreign investments." It means,  he added, making economic decisions democratically and placing  at the top of all economic priorities, the struggle against  neglect and injustice, the fight against poverty, and the  eradication of ignorance.    In his economic program, outlined in more than 30 pages,  Cardenas Solorzano highlighted its four basic tenets. First, he  said the state must not replace private enterprise nor become  the absolute director of the economy, "that is why all possible  investment opportunities will be opened to private enterprise,  but with the state supplementing these efforts in the areas  where it is essential."    Second, he said there must be constant economic deregulation  to remove the bureaucratic obstacles that hinder production  activities, conditions of equality in market competition must be  created, and monopolies must be fought.    His program stresses monetary and fiscal discipline in  addition to waging an all-out war against corruption in the  government, the business sector, unions, and other production  and service sectors.    The last point of his program is to further promote Mexico's  participation in the world economy while simultaneously seeking  a diversification of markets through a realistic strategy of  intensifying trade with select countries and regions.    Cuauhtemoc Cardenas also devoted some time to answering  questions of businessmen attending the meeting. There was a  total of 13 questions, and Cardenas did not have enough time to  answer all of them.    Asked about fiscal policy with regard to the states,  Cardenas  indicated that state and municipal governments should be given  more fiscal resources to improve their capacity to finance their  numerous programs.    He stressed that states currently contribute 15 percent of  all revenues while municipalities contribute 5 percent. "We  plan to recommend before a national fiscal convention, which  would be called for this purpose, that the municipalities triple  their contributions and the states double theirs, thereby  reducing the federal allotment from 80 percent to 55 percent,"  he noted.    Cardenas was criticized for his support for the  reinstatement  within constitutional Article 27 of the inalienable nature of  ejidos and communal lands as a means to protect the patrimony of  millions of peasants.    Answering a question on greater participation by the private  sector in significant areas, Cardenas reiterated: "The oil  industry and the generation of electricity should remain under  state control, which should make them more efficient and fight  corruption."    A rancher from the area voiced his concern over the invasion  of lands by local residents, and he asked Cardenas for his  position on land seizures. Cardenas stated that applying the  full weight of the law constitutes the only means of protecting  small landowners while ending backwardness in the countryside.  This statement won him a round of applause.    The last questions focused on his political history.  Cardenas said he had tried to democratize the party from within  but decided to resign from the political organization when he  saw this was an impossible task.    When the event ended, Bernardo Ardavia, president of the  Southeastern Business Investment and Development Council, was  asked to comment on the PRD presidential candidate's program.  He asserted that many points in the program seem to be a return  to the past, "especially when he talks of reforming Article 27.  We have already seen that the previous legal arrangement did  not bring development or investment to the rural areas in the  past 60 years."    Cardenas' position, according to Ardavia, "prompts concern  because it seems inconsistent. There were points that he did  not answer clearly. There were also interesting aspects, such  as the mechanisms proposed to protect small landowners. Well, I  believe his proposal is an array of grays, and each matter has  to be taken separately."</p>

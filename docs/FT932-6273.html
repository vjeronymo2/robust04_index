			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Pressure grows on peseta as election nears THE SPANISH peseta emerged bruised from foreign exchange markets yesterday, just two weeks after an 8 per cent devaluation and 10 days ahead of the hotly contested general election. The peseta dipped briefly below its new central rate against the D-Mark, as dealers took the view that the country's interest rates might be cut around the time of the June 6 election. The renewed market turbulence, following the third devaluation in under nine months, has raised fears that the final week of the campaign could see the currency come under serious attack. After closing in London on Wednesday night at Pta77.88 against the D-Mark, the peseta plunged to a low of Pta79.50, beyond its central rate of Pta79.11. The currency later recovered partially to close in London at Pta78.83. Yesterday's decline in the peseta coincided with signs that the conservative Partido Popular (PP), led by Mr Jose Maria Aznar, may be opening up a clear lead over the governing Socialist party led by the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez. Currency dealers have expressed fears that, if Mr Aznar is elected as prime minister, he may ease monetary policy to stimulate the Spanish economy. PP officials yesterday issued a statement underlining their commitment to the peseta's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. This helped lift the peseta back above its central rate. The Socialists also deny contemplating departure from the ERM as part of an effort to kick-start the economy. Spanish government officials yesterday accused dealers of undervaluing the currency, but analysts continued to believe that, for a new government to pull the economy out of its current recession quickly, rates will have to fall quickly. The Bank of Spain cut its benchmark intervention rate from 13 per cent to 11.5 per cent after the devaluation on May 13 and then by a further quarter point last week, to 11.25 per cent. But some economists were suggesting that rates might have to fall as low as 8 per cent to begin to have an effect on the economy. Opinion polls do not show the effect on public opinion of a televised debate last Monday night between Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar. However, the general perception is that Mr Aznar did very well in the debate. The next few days may see a big swing towards the PP, perhaps allowing it to form a minority government on its own and relieving it of political pressure to implement a hasty recovery programme.</p>

According to a plan announced by the Chinese Government  earlier this week, China is determined to wipe out abject  poverty by the year 2000, solving food and clothing shortages  for its now-remaining 80 million poverty-stricken citizens.    The ambitious plan is significant in the history both of the  Chinese people and mankind, for the rights to subsistence of  1.18 billion Chinese, which make up a quarter of the world  population, will soon have this fundamental human right secured.    Most of the 80 million people, about the same number as the  whole German population, live in remote mountain regions, rocky  regions, Loess plateau areas and remote deserts. Their lives  are disastrously affected by acute shortage of water and poor  public transport services, which make agricultural production  difficult, not to mention industrial development.    The per capita share of water in the poor areas is between a  16th and a 24th of the world's average. Electricity, education  and transport services are hardly available to most of the areas.    Compared with the poverty eased among about 45 million poor  people during the 1986-1992 period, the remaining poverty facing  80 million Chinese is much more difficult to wipe out than the  steps taken by China in 1978-1985.    The population of the poor decreased from about 200 million  in 1978 to 125 million in 1985, when China abolished the commune  system and introduced the household contract responsibility  system. The reform resulted in a sharp increase in grain output  and farmers' incomes.    During the eight-year poverty-reduction drive since 1986,  China earmarked about 30 billion yuan worth of grain, clothes  and other consumer goods for poverty alleviation, and allocated  about five billion yuan in aid or discount loans to help the  poor areas.    For the next seven years, in comparison, China should do at  least twice as much. It should help 11 million escape from  poverty each year during the coming seven years, while, on  average, only 6.4 million poor people did so each year in the  past seven, by getting enough food and clothes.    Despite the difficulty, China has many positive factors in  its fight against poverty, such as the growing government  investment, the priority given by the central and local  governments to social and economic development in the poor  areas, and support given by all walks of life and the  international organizations.    A recent government decision stipulates that when preparing  national and regional budgets, a set sum of money should be used  for poverty reduction by the central and local financial  departments.    To beef up the poverty reduction drive, the central  government also made a decision to increase its investment in  the "work for food program" by one billion yuan each year before  the end of this century, and also extend one billion yuan  discount loans to the poor areas.    The investment in the program would total four billion yuan  in 1994 and 1995, respectively.    China's opening of its developing inland areas, particularly  the border areas, has promoted local businesses and benefited  from their trade with their neighboring countries or other areas.    The booming Chinese economy also contributed greatly to  poverty alleviation, offering many jobs to surplus laborers in  the poor area.    About 10 million surplus farmers in China's most populous  Sichuan Province were employed last year by businesses in and  outside the province, who earned a total of 10 billion yuan.    Past practice shows that if a laborer from a poor rural  family is hired by a business, the money earned by the laborer  will enable the whole of his poor family to get enough food and  clothes.    In addition, the poor areas, which are rich in resources,  will earn much more money as China is reforming its commodity  circulation and pricing systems, including a gradual lifting of  its control over prices of raw materials and primary goods.    All these factors, together with other efforts, such as  making water, power, education, public health and transport  services available to the poor, will certainly ensure the  realization of the plan to wipe out abject poverty in China.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / VSEL in limited offer to Swans VSEL, the Barrow-in-Furness naval shipbuilder, has offered to take over the management of shipbuilding at its troubled Tyneside rival Swan Hunter, Daniel Green writes. VSEL, which in May won a competition against Swans to build a helicopter carrier for the Ministry of Defence, wants to manage Swans' work on three Type 23 Navy frigates. Mr Noel Davies, chief executive of VSEL, said: 'Under no circumstances are we interested in all of Swan Hunter. We are interested in certain assets and in the possibility of managing the completion of the three frigates.' Swans went into receivership in May after it lost the helicopter carrier contract. Price Waterhouse, the receiver, said yesterday that it would not yet accept an offer that did not mean the sale of all or 'a substantial part' of the yard. VSEL approached Price Waterhouse shortly after its appointment as receiver and had been hoping for a clear response by now. Details of other offers for all or part of Swans may be announced this morning at a creditors' meeting. Swans won the frigate contract in 1989 against bids from other naval shipyards including Cammell Laird, owned by VSEL. The contract should provide work until November next year and improves the prospects of the yard being sold as a going concern.</p>

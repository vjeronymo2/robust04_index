			<p>BFN     [Text] Taiwan police on Sunday [24 April] set foot on the  largest island in the Spratly Island chain for the first time in  ROC [Republic of China] history. Local media described the move  as an affirmation of the ROC's exclusive and complete control  over the island in the South China Sea.    More than 30 police officers from the National Police  Administration escorted the Council of Agriculture research  vessel to Taiping Island and then visited the ROC marines posted  there. This was the first time the National Police  Administration has sent officers to the island. It was part of  a wider plan to bring the Spratly further under ROC control.    The ROC is maintaining a radar station, meteorological  center, power plant, library, and marine activities center on  the island. Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, mainland China,  Malaysia, and Taiwan all claim part or all of the Spratlys. All  except Brunei have troops stationed on the islands.</p>

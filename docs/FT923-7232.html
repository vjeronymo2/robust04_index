			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Baillie Gifford appointed at Pacific Horizon Trust BAILLIE GIFFORD is now the investment manager of Pacific Horizon Investment Trust, after the trust's shareholders overwhelmingly supported the board at two extraordinary meetings yesterday. Victory for the board became certain on Monday when Jupiter Tyndall, the former manager, withdrew its proposals to reorganise the trust. Jupiter Tyndall did not propose its own resolutions yesterday. Nevertheless, Mr Garnet Harrison, chairman of Pacific Horizon, went to the trouble of proposing the Jupiter Tyndall motions himself  - and then voting against them. The resolutions were accordingly defeated overwhelmingly, with proxy votes of about 23.2m shares backing the board, and less than 200,000 supporting Jupiter Tyndall. The proposal to install Baillie Gifford as manager was opposed by only 0.004 per cent of shareholders. Baillie Gifford plans to widen the trust's portfolio to cover markets such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Mr Harrison said it was a pity that Jupiter Tyndall had not withdrawn its proposals at an earlier stage. But he added: 'We are delighted that shareholders have supported the board's proposals in such a conclusive way and that the long period of uncertainty has come to an end.' However, there are still some questions about the future of the trust. Jupiter Tyndall amassed a substantial stake in the process of blocking a bid by Martin Currie Pacific, and may yet agree to sell its holding to a predator.</p>

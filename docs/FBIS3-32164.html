			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Playing with Fire;" bolded passages as </F> published]    [Text] The secret Shining Path [SL] document which LA  REPUBLICA published on 25 January answers several questions  concerning the negotiations between Fujimori's administration  and the SL leadership in prison, and gives rise to other  questions.    This is why we chose to make it public as soon as we were  able to fully authenticate it through the anonymous sources that  conveyed it to us and the experts whom we consulted. Everyone  agreed it was either a document written by the SL leader himself  or a transcript of Abimael Guzman's [AG] report to the  leadership meeting of this subversive group at the Callao Naval  Base [the prison where they are being held].    In any case it was clearly our duty to make the document  public, given the mantle of silence that the government has cast  over negotiations in which the future of all Peruvians is at  stake and about which nothing is reported probably in keeping  with Fujimori's "do first, announce later" approach which has  greatly harmed our democracy in the past few years.    First, the document makes it clear that as far as AG is  concerned the required peace agreement does not imply a  demobilization and a surrendering of arms. AG sees the signing  of the peace agreement as a kind of armed truce, a  halt along a road which may last 10 or 15 years, after which --  "having strengthened its links with the masses" -- the SL would  resume its bloodbath.    Therefore, the agreement in question has nothing to do with  the quest for peace in Peru the way most Peruvians see it.  There is a reason for this: The fundamentalist leader -- and  probably the other SL leaders that follow him -- believe that  this armed gang has not been defeated either  militarily or ideologically.    This means the defeats the group has been experiencing since  1988 are mere setbacks in a long-term struggle. These setbacks  are serious and have led the SL to lose some ground -- as AG  himself admits by stating that the conditions essential for the  "victory of the popular struggle" are no longer present -- but  this cannot be looked upon as a defeat.    Let us make it clear that AG scornfully relegates the change  in what marxists call "favorable objective international  conditions" to the sixth place ("it is a necessary element but  not the main one," he adds), rating it well below the problems  created for the SL following the arrest of its top deity and  most of its leadership. In sum, displaying very little modesty,  the lack of a "proletarian leadership" which "will take some  time to resolve" (which tells us, by the way, that AG does not  consider his life sentence as definitive) is blamed for the  setback.    At the same time, AG's disdain for the performance of SL's  "hard" faction led by Feliciano [Oscar Ramirez Durand, top SL  leader in Ayacucho] clearly indicate a split in the terrorist  group and a lack of communication between the two factions. We  unable to do so, but it should be established whether this lack  of communication is circumstantial (some SL leaders are in  prison while others are free) or deliberate. In the latter case  we would be dealing with a splinter faction led by Feliciano  which has decided to pay no heed to Guzman's directives.    But AG views "Feliciano's faction" as  recoverable, as can be deduced from one of AG's  political conclusions which states that the "struggle between  two factions" should seek unity, adding that "one must work to  keep the scattering of forces to the bare minimum." The  document adds, however, that "we should be prepared for the  possibility that only a few of us will be left," and "those will  be the most tested ones." Once again, it is implied that defeat  is out of the question and that AG will play an active  role and exercising leadership from inside prison  (undoubtedly the government has created circumstances to make  this possible).    Finally, it should be noted that AG suggests "changing our  language," adding that diplomatic talks are underway  between the SL and the Armed Forces through the  government. Aside from his strong disdain for Fujimori's  administration (which he treats as a mere go-between), AG  continues to hang on to his long-standing obsession that it all  comes down to a clash between two military forces, disregarding  everything about the civilian institutional order that gets  caught in the middle. Paradoxically enough, this disregard for  the institutions is what the SL has in common with Fujimori's  administration.    This is an initial evaluation of the document, which  undoubtedly lends itself to further analysis. The important  point right now is to unveil the dangerous tactics of Fujimori's  administration implemented through the publication of AG's  letters and their obvious manipulation for electoral reasons  during the campaign for the referendum.    Various circles share the opinion that Fujimori's  administration is trying to bring about a peace agreement with  the SL without realizing that it is playing into the hands of  SL's top leader, who has been put back into circulation in a  very obvious effort to prove that he is still at the helm of the  subversive gang.    In other words, President Fujimori is laboring under the  pressure of his own promise that the SL will be defeated by 1995  and is beginning to feel that he is running out of time in his  quest for this trump card which can get him reelected. AG knows  this very well and he is trying to take the best possible  advantage of the president's haste.    The risks that this situation poses are obvious: A peace  agreement is already being discussed although armed actions have  not been suspended and nobody is talking about laying down arms,  thus a truce that will last a few years is being misrepresented  as real peace.    Furthermore, all the latest documents of the SL address the  need to "lay the foundation for the second congress" of the  subversive gang. This obviously implies that the SL will  continue to operate even if it has to do so under the until now  abhorred guise of a political party. Should this be the case  the "strengthening of the links with the masses" will simply  mean preparing them for the future uprising.    We believe the time has come for Fujimori's administration  to  explain to the country the status of its negotiations with the  SL leadership. It is obvious that it is not necessary to  disclose the details of these negotiations. The citizenry,  however, must understand the goals of these talks because this  SL document leaves the impression that -- perhaps involuntarily  -- the government is helping the man who has caused more deaths,  sorrow and destruction than anyone else in Peru, to achieve his  sinister objectives.</p>

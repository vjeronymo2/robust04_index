			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Colonia Konzern COLONIA KONZERN, the German financial services group, said the 'spectacular improvement' in earnings in last year's group net profit to DM109.5m (Dollars 68.4m) from DM40.1m in the previous 12 months was due to an improvement in insurance business, Reuter reports from Cologne. Mr Claas Kleyboldt, the chairman, said that Colonia Versicherung and Nordstern Allgemeine Versicherungs, the property insurance units, had resumed making profits on pure insurance business after a long period in the red. Gross underwriting profit at Colonia Versicherung was DM18m last year after a loss of DM180m in 1991. Non-insurance business was satisfactory and all units improved. The group will pay dividends of DM18 per bearer share and DM20 per preference share on the 1992 results.</p>

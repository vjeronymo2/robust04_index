A BAe spokesman said yesterday: "We have been talking to  them  for years about ways to enlarge the markets for products we have  in common" -- though he added that no announcement was expected  in the short term.    Given the decline in world defence markets and its own  financial difficulties of recent years, BAe has been involved in  a variety of collaboration attempts with rivals, though most of  them have so far failed to succeed.    Last year it attempted to bring off joint ventures for its  missiles division with France's Matra-Hachette and its regional  jet business with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation, both of which  collapsed. It also called off merger talks with Britain's GEC  [General Electric Company], and in an attempt to slim its  portfolio, BAe sold its corporate jets division and construction  arm, Ballast Needam, in 1993 and is now selling Rover to BMW for  800 million pounds.    A joint venture could strengthen Royal Ordnance, which is  still believed to be losing money despite rationalisation. BAe  bought the company from the government seven years ago to expand  its core defence division. Royal Ordnance makes small arms,  ammunition and guns for tanks such as Vickers' Challenger 2.    Jack Dromey, National Secretary of the Transport and General  Workers Union told last night's BBC Money Programme: "Within  Royal Ordnance, in presentations to the trade unions, the  company has made it clear that it is talking to European  companies -- Giat in particular--on a link-up and also on the  production of a European tank."</p>

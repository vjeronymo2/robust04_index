			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> CHILDREN WITH MATCHES BLAMED FOR HOME FIRE  </P> <P> Two 5-year-old children playing with matches Monday morning ignited a fire that  gutted a home in the 12900 block of Twintree Avenue, officials said. No one was  injured in the blaze, which caused an estimated $110,000 in damage to the  house.  </P> <P> Left homeless by the blaze were at least 5 people, including the youngsters  living in the home, Garden Grove Fire Department Battalion Chief Marvin  Schilling said.  </P> <P> The Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross was providing shelter for  the family, whose name Schilling said was not immediately available.  </P> <P> He said it was not known how the children escaped the burning home, which is  owned by Rosie Magvaleno.  </P> <P> The fire was reported at 8:50 a.m. and began in what Schilling described as a  "lean-to" that appeared to have been added to the house. Schilling said it was  not clear how many people actually lived in the home because several "cousins,  daughters and granddaughters" often visited.  </P> <P> The children were counseled by members of the Fire Department about the dangers  of playing with matches and fire, Schilling said.  </P> <P> He said the blaze caused an estimated $100,000 damage to the house, and $10,000  to contents.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Weirton Steel Corp. said it would go public to raise money for a $600-million  modernization project under a plan allowing workers at the nation's largest  employee-owned company to retain a majority stake. The West Virginia company  said it will apply for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange when it goes  public later this year, pending approval of the plan by employees. The  agreement between the company's management and the Independent Steelworkers  Union would reduce the 8,000 employees' profit sharing from 50% to 35% of the  company's after-tax income. The company's pension plan would not change.  </P></p>

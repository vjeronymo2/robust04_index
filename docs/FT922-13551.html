			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais doubles client risk provisions CREDIT Lyonnais, one of the largest French banks, yesterday reported a fall in annual net profits, from FFr3.71bn (Dollars 660m) in 1990 to FFr3.16bn, after doubling the client risk provisions to FFr9.5bn because of loan losses. The fall was disclosed on the same day that the the upper house in the French parliament ordered an inquiry into the bank. The inquiry follows a lobby last year by opposition politicians demanding a formal investigation into Credit Lyonnais' involvement with the ill-fated takeover of MGM-Pathe, the Hollywood movie studio, by Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian businessman whom Credit Lyonnais later ousted from MGM. Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman, said it was too early to comment on the inquiry. Mr Haberer led Credit Lyonnais' aggressive expansion into new areas of banking and different countries in the late 1980s. The findings of the senate inquiries are influential within French political and industrial circles, but do not have immediate legislative implications. Credit Lyonnais, which may have to make bigger provisions in 1992 because of its exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property group, raised its total provisions from FFr6.5bn to FFr9.6bn last year. Its client risk provisions - thought to include write-offs on loans to VEV, the troubled French textile group, and Hachette, the struggling publishing company, as well as on MGM and the companies headed by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, the UK publisher - rose from FFr4.2bn to FFr9.5bn. The increase in provisions, to the upper end of analysts' estimates, meant that net profits fell despite a healthy 13.5 per cent increase in net banking income, from FFr40.83bn to FFr46.33bn. Mr Haberer said the increase reflected the strong performance of Credit Lyonnais' retail banking networks in Europe, and its investment banking interests in the US. The fall in net profits meant earnings per share slipped from FFr110.6 to FFr90. However, the board proposed holding the dividend - for the third year in succession - at FFr34.5 a share. Mr Haberer said that, despite the increase in provisions and the general problems posed by the worldwide economic slowdown, he was encouraged by the progress of Credit Lyonnais' retail networks and by the increased contribution from its industrial investments. He said the group was determined to continue its policy of expanding its European network, and confirmed it was still in discussions over an investment in Germany's BfG, the troubled union bank belonging to the AMB insurance company.</p>

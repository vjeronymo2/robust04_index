			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MCGUIRE STRIKES OUT 20 CLEVELAND BATTERS FOR EL CAMINO REAL;  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL: SENIOR PERFECTS PITCHING MOTION AND DELIVERS A STYLISH  PERFORMANCE IN 7-2 WIN.  </P> <P> The way El Camino Real High left-hander Ryan McGuire tells it, before he made a  recent alteration in his delivery, his throwing motion wasn't exactly state of  the art.  </P> <P> In fact, it wasn't stately at all. McGuire, primarily a first baseman, says his  arm's range of motion was constricted.  </P> <P> "It's weird," said McGuire with a shake of the head. "Before this, I've been  pitching like an infielder throwing B. P. (batting practice)."  </P> <P> McGuire's delivery -- and performance -- was close to perfect Tuesday as the  senior struck out 20 to lead El Camino Real to a 7-2 Northwest Valley  Conference victory over host Cleveland.  </P> <P> That's right, 20. McGuire (6-foot-2, 190 pounds) threw a five-hitter, walked  one and struck out the side in the second through seventh innings, allowing  only a pair of tainted runs. In his last 16 innings, McGuire (2-0) has, count  'em, 38 strikeouts.  </P> <P> "Boy, Ryan did an excellent job," El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio said. "What  words do you use when a kid pitches like that?"  </P> <P> If you're the umpire, try stee-rike.  </P> <P> McGuire's steamrolling of Cleveland came close to the state record for  strikeouts in a seven-inning game. In 1973, Jim Peterson of La Habra Sonora  struck out 22 -- one batter reached base on a passed ball. Recent area highs in  a seven-inning game include 20 strikeouts by Bill Ronquillo of Royal in 1982  and 18 by Scott Radinsky of Simi Valley in 1986.  </P> <P> Things seemed normal enough when Cleveland leadoff hitter Brian Basowski  grounded out to second baseman Herman Merchan. But the next 20 outs were  recorded via McGuire's bulky left arm.  </P> <P> There were two shoulda-been outs that, because of defensive blackouts, were  never recorded. One ball fell in front of El Camino Real outfielder Jason Cohen  in the first, allowing Cleveland (2-4, 2-4 in league play) to take a 1-0 lead.  </P> <P> But after the Conquistadores (5-0-1, 5-0-1) scored twice in the fifth to take a  3-2 lead, then tacked on four more in the sixth, Cohen felt better.  </P> <P> "Maybe I did (McGuire) a favor," Cohen said with a grin. "He got to strike  another guy out."  </P> <P> Chris Castillo did McGuire a similar turn in right field. In the third,  Castillo dropped a liner by Pat Bryant for an error, allowing an unearned run.  McGuire again struck out the side.  </P> <P> McGuire admitted that the umpire's strike zone, which at times seemed about as  wide as the backstop, helped cut down on the walks. Entering the game, McGuire  has walked 16 in 14 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> "Who wouldn't like a strike zone like that?" McGuire said. "He gave me a couple  (of calls) that helped me out in tight situations."  </P> <P> In the bottom of the seventh, the El Camino Real bench was openly rooting for  McGuire to strike out the side to reach 20. In fact, when the first batter, Rob  Kosakoski, was ruled safe at first after narrowly beating out an 0-and-2 nubber  to third, nobody seemed to mind.  </P> <P> McGuire, who will attend UCLA next season, struck out the next three batters --  on 12 pitches.  </P> <P> McGuire, regarded more as a hitter, has opened some eyes. And reopened a few  minds.  </P> <P> "The plan, to be honest, was to recruit him as a first baseman and to maybe use  him some in relief," said UCLA baseball Coach Gary Adams, who witnessed  McGuire's 18-strikeout performance last week against Granada Hills. "But when a  kid is pitching like this, to put it bluntly, you have to keep an open mind."  </P> <P> Has McGuire ever been better?  </P> <P> "With 20 Ks," said catcher Bobby Kim, "it's the best I've ever seen in my  life."  </P></p>

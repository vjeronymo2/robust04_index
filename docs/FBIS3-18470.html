			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Gerhard </F> Seifried on 2 March; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Seifried] Do you see yourself as the hero of  Brussels?    [Kinkel] For God's sake, no. I did what was necessary and  right. I am a convinced European. It was absolutely clear that  we wanted the conclusion of the negotiations with the four EFTA  [European Free Trade Association] countries, which is why I made  a great effort and was able to make my contribution.    [Seifried] Still, it has been said that you played a crucial  role. Reports said that you took off your jacket and rushed  along hallways in shirtsleeves when the negotiations were on the  brink of failure.    [Kinkel] That is true. After very long hours of  negotiations, we had reached a stalemate yesterday morning and  it looked as if the talks were going to be suspended without  result. So it may be true that I can claim that I held the  talks together at that moment and pointed out to my colleagues  that, in the interest of Europe, we could not tolerate such a  situation. And at such a moment, the word that comes from a  larger country is probably of some significance, and, as we can  see now, things worked out all right.    [Seifried] Nevertheless, some criticism has come from the  ranks of the European Union [EU], and people claimed that you  made too many concessions to the membership applicants. Is  there a fear of a greater German bloc, maybe? Do you see such  fears?    [Kinkel] No, I do not see that. Do not forget, with 80  million people, Germany is now the largest country in the EU,  which means that we bear special responsibility. We have in no  way tried to push to the fore. We tried to be good mediators,  which we could do. Nevertheless, we always made it quite clear,  and that is what I said when I arrived in Brussels: We will not  exclude any country, and certainly not Austria, but will try  hard to achieve a positive result -- in the spirit of the  Edinburgh resolutions. Actually, I thought that all that was  quite normal. I have participated in heated sessions in  Brussels before. Afterwards, one has to say: [word indistinct]  what counts is the result -- and that does not look too bad for  Austria.    [Seifried] Why is Germany, of all countries, pressing so  hard for this enlargement?    [Kinkel] It is obvious. We are of the opinion that the EU  has to be a well-balanced organism. We have -- and I am not  criticizing the fact but only analyzing it -- a slight  overweight in the south. The Nordic countries must join. For us  it has always been absolutely clear that, as a result of  historic, linguistic, and cultural closeness and ties Austrian  membership is a matter of course.    [Seifried] What is going to happen with membership candidate  Norway?    [Kinkel] I predict that it will work out all right. We have  made intensive mediating efforts in this case, too. The issue  of agriculture has virtually been settled. The normative power  of facts [Die normative Kraft des Faktischen] will also lead to  a good negotiated settlement with Norway -- at least, that is  what I am hoping.</p>

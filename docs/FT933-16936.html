			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Arts: Gardiner's 'Marriage of Figaro' - Opera The cycle of Mozart's operas that John Eliot Gardiner is recording for Deutsche Grammophon is being derived from concerts which have become a welcome feature of summer on the South Bank. Idomeneo, La clemenza di Tito and Die Entfuhrung have appeared so far, Cos fan tutte is still to be released, and this week in the Queen Elizabeth Hall Gardiner is conducting two performances of Le nozze di Figaro. 'Concert performances' is a misnomer for these highly detailed presentations. 'Three-quarters staged' would be more accurate: the singers wear modern dress - white tie for the Count, a leather waistcoat for Figaro, evening dresses for the women - and play in front of a painted backdrop after Fragonard. There is a single chair, a wardrobe, but mercifully no wigs. The London concerts follow a European tour that has included full stagings in Lisbon and Paris and presumably all the business and the productions points are derived from those, though no stage director is credited in the programme. Given the self-imposed constraints it is an energetic evening, full of bustle and incident, with entrances spilling off the stage and into the auditorium. It is carefully gauged so that action does not intrude into the final recording, where the subtleties that sometimes seemed missing from the acting (in the ambiguities of the the final-act reconciliations most strikingly) would be able to emerge through the vocal lines. The spry, translucent textures of the English Baroque Soloists allow the light young voices of much of the cast to carry easily and expressively; the singers have been chosen carefully for their vocal flexibility and wit. With every appearance Bryn Terfel's Figaro seems to gain steadily in his emotional range, sense of timing and vocal assurance; Alison Hagley's Susanna, new to me, was a delight; one expected the graceful, idiomatic singing, and winning stage manner, not necessarily the nicely judged wit. There is a menacing, if slightly underplayed Count from Rodney Gilfry, elegant, calm Countess from Hillevi Martinpelto. Pamela Helen Stephen makes a gawky, nicely gauche Cherubino; Susan McCulloch (Marcellina), Carlos Feller (Bartolo), Francis Egerton (Basilio and Don Curzio) and Julian Clarkson (Antonio) flesh out the comedy without even descending into coarse acting, and Constanze Backes makes a great deal of Barbarina's aria. Most of all, though, it is Gardiner's evening; he invests every number with dramatic pace and point, pays the closest attention to rhythmic detail and watches and supports his singers like a ministering angel. It is always involving, always moving and finally joyously uplifting. The musical text is full, but Gardiner favours unconventional orderings of the items in Acts III and IV, decisions lucidly justified in the programme. The Countess's 'Dove sono' is brought forward in the third act, before the sextet, and hence clarifies the progression from tension through comedy to celebration; in the fourth the recitative that precedes Figaro's 'Aprite un po'' is interrupted by Susanna's 'Deh vieni', to give his outburst much more dramatic point. Traditionalists will be able to programme out the revisions when the CDs appear; the recording, though, promises to be very special. Queen Elizabeth Hall; sponsored by National Power. Further performance tonight</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Glushchenko, candidate of economic </F> sciences, RISI: "Two-Way Streets?"]    [Text] Beginning at the end of 1992 in the economics  press and in business and especially among financial circles of  Russia there has been an active polemic regarding access of  foreign capital to our country's banking system. And the  struggle between proponents and opponents of "intervention" in  the domestic money-credit market today has moved on to the  political plane and is raising havoc mainly in the corridors of  executive and legislative power, including presidential  structures. As we know, the next stage in the backroom battle  involved in the determination of the role and position of  foreign banks in Russia's financial system ended with a victory  for the "isolationists" in the form of Edict of the President of  the Russian Federation No. 1924 of 17 November 1993. There is no  doubt that on this protectionist normative act, which caused a  stormy reaction from the "internationalists," lies the stamp of  political conditions related to the election campaign underway  during this period, which certain domestic banking structures  were able to take advantage of. But the discussion is continuing  up to the present time.    More and more frequently voices are ringing out,  including at the highest level, from people who are in favor of  overriding or amending this presidential edict, which limited  for the period up to 1 January 1996 the activity of foreign  banks on the territory of the Russian Federation to operations  with legal entities and individuals who are nonresidents of the  Russian Federation. Perhaps even keeping in mind the fact that  we are striving to become more open to the outside world and  actively inviting foreign investors in (let us note that in  practically all international economic or financial forums, from  negotiations concerning entry into the GATT to backroom  conversations at the session of the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development in St. Petersburg, the theme of  "reciprocity" is present in one form or another), not a single  objective economist will give a simple answer to the question of  whether foreign banks are an evil or a good from the standpoint  of Russia's national interests.  <H5>  Internationalization As a General Tendency in the </H5> Development of the Modern System    Internationalization of the credit and banking sphere, which  is an objective consequence of the process of globalization of  capital and the expansion and deepening of international  economic relations, has become a most important factor in the  entire system of the world economy today. The most significant  role in foreign expansion of loan capital in the modern stage  belongs to the largest banks of the United States, Japan, and  the leading countries of Western Europe which, relying on their  stable domestic positions, have become powerful credit and  financial centers. Their activity is having an ever more  appreciable effect not only on the credit-monetary and currency  policy of developing countries but also on their overall  economic policy. In recent years leading transnational banks  (TNB) have been exerting an ever greater influence on the  domestic political processes of their host countries. Let us  recall that a most important factor in strengthening  international expansion of banks of the United States and other  developed countries during the 1970's and 1980's was the need  for comprehensive credit-financial service for industrial TNK's  [transnational corporations] which were busily expanding their  activity on a global scale during that period. During all these  years the rates of growth of revenues from the activity of  foreign branches outstripped the profit from operations in the  national market. Therefore even by the middle of the 1980's the  proportion of the profit of American TNB's from international  operations amounted to about 50 percent. As world practice  shows, the development of foreign expansion of TNB's usually  goes through three stages. Thus for the TNB's of the United  States up until the middle of the 1970's the attack on foreign  markets proceeded along the extensive path (quantitative  increase in the number of foreign branches, encompassing new  geographical zones), which corresponded to the period of  internationalization of capital "in breadth." For the five years  after that the prevailing tendency was internationalization of  capital "in depth," that is, intensive penetration of TNB's into  the national monetary-credit systems of the receiving countries  in order to cover clients and functions of local banks, which  was accompanied by an increase in the assets of the foreign  branches.    In parallel, operations of TNB subdivisions in world  financial centers have expanded and become more complicated. The  first half of the 1990's, in our view, is characterized by two  important tendencies in international banking: First, there is a  further liberalization of national banking legislation on the  plane of removing restrictions on the activity of foreign  institutions within the framework of processes of deepening  international economic integration on the global and regional  levels; second, there is a marked growth of the number of  takeovers and mergers in order to consolidate capital and  enlarge the leading national banks as a means of protection from  foreign competition and consolidation of their own international  positions.  <H5>  The Reality and the Prospects </H5>   As of November 1993 there were 1,932 commercial banks  registered on the territory of Russia, including 155 with the  participation of "nearby" foreign countries and 15 in which the  share of foreign participation exceeded 50 percent. In keeping  with the "Conditions for Opening Banks with the Participation of  Foreign Investments on the Territory of the Russian Federation,"  the maximum amount of foreign capital in the banking system of  Russia has been set at 12 percent. Actually at the end of 1993  it had not reached 8 percent of the total capital of banks  registered in our country.    Among the vigorously functioning institutions with foreign  capital one can include the International Moscow Bank (MMB). Of  its joint-stock capital, 60 percent belongs to five European  banks (of Austria, Germany, Finland, Italy, and France) and 40  percent--to three Russian banks. It began its activity in  October 1989, specializing mainly in operations in foreign  currency and gradually expanding the range of services it  offered. As of the beginning of 1994 in terms of assets (3.05  trillion rubles [R]) the MMB occupied fourth place on the list  of the largest commercial banks of Russia.    If one is to speak of banks with 100 percent foreign  capital,  one would have to single out the Austria bank, which in the  autumn of 1992 was the first to receive a license from the  Central Bank of the Russian Federation to open a branch in  Russia. Beginning at this time this bank has operated on our  market practically without competition from other foreign  credit-financial institutions, since banks with French, Swiss,  German, or American capital, which also had general licenses for  the right to conduct banking operations on the territory of  Russia, were occupied mainly with studying the market and  investing in their own real estate, and they were unable to  occupy real positions in the financial system of the Russian  Federation until the president's edict was published.    According to estimates of specialists from this bank, the  fears that the large Russian clients could switch their service  to foreign competitors, if they were given a general license and  the president's edict were overridden, are quite justified. But  if in the near future activity in Russia were to be developed by  such powerful and aggressive banks as Credit Lyonnaise, Societe  Generale, Credit Suisse, BNP-Dresdner Bank, Citibank, and Chase  Manhattan Bank, the outflow of solid clients from the Russian  banks could start to avalanche. To all that has been said it  should be added that several other large Western Banks today are  waiting for licenses from the Central Bank of the Russian  Federation, and about 100 "prospectors" with the rank of  representatives could wish to be transformed into branches as  soon as they can perceive any real advantage from such a step.  <H5>  Russian Banks Abroad </H5>   At the present time even for the largest Russian commercial  banks the existence of foreign structures outside the CIS is an  extremely rare phenomenon. At the level of branches there is  Inkombank in Cyprus and National Credit in the United States.  The latter has not really developed yet. Other banks must be  satisfied with a few representative offices at best. Actually as  of the beginning of the year only in Nicosia was there a  full-fledged functioning branch of Inkombank, which rendered its  clients a fairly broad spectrum of service: opening and keeping  of current, savings, deposit, and other accounts; making  settlements for export-import operations; insuring foreign  trade, credit, and deposit transactions; managing free monetary  funds; conducting operations on the money market and the capital  market; organizing marketing research of trade and financial  markets of the Mediterranean and Near Eastern regions. A  representative office of the Optimum Bank has also been opened  on Cyprus. (This zone in general is attracting the attention of  Russian Businessmen because of the offshore conditions and the  liberal legislation in effect there.) Inkombank also has  representative offices in Frankfurt-am-Main (Germany) and Geneva  (Switzerland). This same bank has an office of a legal  representative in New York. The Stolichnyy Bank maintains a  representative office in the Netherlands which it is planning to  transform into a branch.    After the signing of the edict on restricting the activity  of  foreign banks on the territory of Russia the process of foreign  "expansion" of Russian commercial banks began to falter. Taking  advantage of bureaucratic obstacles, our Western partners are  making Russia understand the principle of parity. Therefore,  although formally local registration does not impede this, they  are slowing up the consideration of documents for the  transformation of the Geneva representative office of Inkombank  into a branch and the creation of its subsidiary company in  Germany. For the same reason Menatep and Kredit-Moskva cannot  regulate similar problems in the United States and Optimum--in  Switzerland.    In our view, the West does not always react objectively  enough to the situation developing with respect to problems  surrounding transnationalization of Russia's banking. Taking  into account Russia's status as a "developing banking power"  (the oldest commercial banks are only six years old), we could  quite justifiably count on preferential conditions.  Unfortunately, legislation in certain countries prohibits  foreign banks that have been in existence for less than 10 years  from opening branches.    Let us emphasize that respectable banking circles value  their  reputation very much. This closed corporate caste is unwilling  to open its doors to newcomers. Unfortunately, in the West there  is the widespread conviction that organized crime has  significantly penetrated into Russian commercial structures,  including the banking sphere. And Russia as a whole is in the  category of countries with a high political risk for investments  and long-term business partnership.    Speaking of quotas and the prospects of foreign expansion,  one cannot forget about the existence in Russia of a network of  former Soviet foreign banks which after the severe crisis at the  end of 1991 were associated with the suspension of payments by  the Foreign Economics Bank and significantly stabilized their  position. Now more than 50 percent of their shares belong to the  Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the rest are  distributed among other banks. So in the future most powerful  commercial banks could break into Western Europe and other  regions by acquiring a controlling block of shares of these  financial structures which are still under the control of our  state. The advantage of these banks consists in that they are  known in international business circles, they have a stable  position in national markets of certain countries, and they have  highly skilled personnel and good technical supply.    In solving the problem of the entry of Russian commercial  banks into "more distant" foreign countries, an important role  will undoubtedly be played by the Central Bank of Russia, whose  leadership is frequently unjustifiably criticized because of its  lack of an active position in negotiations with central banks  and banking commissions of foreign countries regarding granting  our credit institutions a most-favored-nation status. In  parallel the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is  reproached because it "poorly" protects the interests of the  Russian commercial banks on the domestic market, granting  preferential, almost offshore conditions to foreign competitors.  Behind accusations of the Central Bank for "non-patriotism" one  can frequently see objective selfish interests of individual  Russian commercial banks which quite justifiably fear  competition from the transnational banks of the United States,  Western Europe, and Japan, which are considerably more powerful  financially and more experienced on the professional plane. In  this connection it should be emphasized that one of the main  tasks of the Central Bank is to stimulate the overall  effectiveness of the country's banking system, including through  healthy competition.  <H5>  `For' and `Against' </H5>   Most frequently people look for an answer to the question of  whether "to allow or not to allow" competitors from abroad into  our country along the paths of analysis of the consequences of  this kind of invasion for the Russian banking system and the  country's economy as a whole. And if one is to indicate the  extreme viewpoints, among the arguments "for" one can include  the following: Foreign banks would have to bring with them  century-old traditions, advanced technologies, high quality of  service, professionalism, many years of experience in operating  in developed monetary-credit markets of Western countries,  obedience to the law, and along with all this incentives for  healthy competition.    The arguments "against" are basically concentrated around  the  problem of "occupation" of the Russian market by financially  powerful foreign banks which will quickly take over the young  growth of national commercial banks and take key levers of  administration of the domestic economy into their hands.    Many Western experts are insistently recommending to the  Russian Government and the new parliament that they permit  foreign banks to freely conduct operations in Russia.    During a business meeting of Russian and American bankers  held in Washington in January 1994 the chairman of the  Export-Import Bank of the United States, K. Brodie, expressed  his negative attitude toward the restrictions introduced in  Russia on the activity of foreign banks. He was supported by  representatives of the Russian commercial bank Tokobank. On the  other hand, the leaders of the Association of Russian Bankers  and Inkombank advanced arguments in support of the president's  edict.    On the whole this kind of polar attitude toward the given  problem is typical of the banking environment in Russia. As a  poll conducted by the bulletin "Russian Economic Barometer"  showed, a negative attitude toward the idea of the presence of  foreign banks in the credit and stock markets of Russia on a par  with domestic ones was expressed by 55 percent of the  representatives of the boards of the leading banks of 32 regions  of Russia, 35 percent of the respondents were inclined to be  positive, and 10 percent were neutral. This same poll also  showed that large profitable banks with a permit for the capital  were more inclined to fear foreign competition. It is known that  such extremely large Russian banks as Most-Bank, Stolichnyy, and  Menatep have a negative attitude toward removing the  restrictions on the activity of foreign banks in the domestic  market. A more restrained position is held by the banks Imperial  and Rossiyskiy Kredit, whose leaders think that to close this  sphere off to foreign competition is unthinkable while control  and certain restrictions (but not as severe as are envisioned by  the president's edict) are necessary.    There are marked disagreements regarding this problem on the  high political Olympus of Russia. In civilized countries such  contradictions are resolved through the normal legislative  process and not "pirate" regulation of banking activity. It  should be noted that attempts to regulate the situation and  achieve a compromise have been made repeatedly. Let us recall  that at the end of the summer of 1993 at a conference with the  participation of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the  government, and representatives of the commercial banks it  seemed that mutual understanding had been reached. But soon  there appeared the notorious letter signed by the president of  the Russian Federation which presented amendments to the law on  banking activity. As a result "pro-Western" sympathies began to  be ascribed to the head of state on the grounds that he was  against having foreign banks end up with "less favorable legal  conditions than those of domestic banks." After the last  November edict the vector of criticism shifted in the opposite  direction.    The demand for protection of the national financial market  is  objectively justified, especially during the period of its  establishment, but complete isolation from foreign influence is  hardly reasonable. In this connection, in our view, the Central  Bank of Russia took a fairly weighed position of "restrained  liberalism" or "reasonable protectionism," with respect to  accepting foreign investments into the banking sphere of Russia.  This policy of "half-open doors" presupposes gradual access in  doses for those foreign banks that have a stable financial  position and an irreproachable business reputation. Recently in  one form or another the question of the need to amend the  president's edict has also been raised by members of the Cabinet  of Ministers who are leaders of the leading economic ministries.  During the time of the visit of the chairman of the state Duma  to the United States he also expressed the idea that the  presence of foreign banks in Russia is necessary for healthy  competition.    There is no doubt that there is another aspect to this  entire  story. If the presidential structures and the government as well  as the new parliament start to defend the interests of foreign  credit-financial institutions too zealously they could lose  support from a considerable part of Russian banking circles. If  they strike in the other direction and take too rigid a position  with respect to foreign bankers, many questions of trade and  economic cooperation with the West, the attraction of foreign  investments, regulation of foreign indebtedness, and Russia's  entry as a full-fledged member into the international economic  community could be appreciably aggravated.  <H5>  What To Do? </H5>   If the question of the need to attract foreign capital in  order to advance our economy today no longer evokes even  sluggish discussions (we are "for" and so far they are not very  eager toward us), the problem of forming an infrastructure for  their effective functioning should not cause such stormy  negative emotions on the part of politicians and financial  experts.    In the appendix to the message from the president of the  Russian Federation to the state Duma containing a list of draft  laws planned to be raised for discussion in 1994, No. 32 is the  number the legislative act, "On the Banking System of the  Russian Federation," which should determine the legal position  of foreign banks in our country. Apparently it will be necessary  to conduct serious hearings regarding this draft law so as to  find a compromise on this problem that is acceptable to all  parties. Otherwise the normative base of the most important  economic sphere in the country will remain a field where there  is play without rules, where lobbyists representing interests of  individual involved financial groups will always end up in  "fisticuffs."    And a last remark. A law "On Lobbying Activity in the  Russian  Federation," which was prepared long ago and was lost in the  archives of the last parliament, should be immediately included  on the list of legislative acts to be adopted this year.</p>

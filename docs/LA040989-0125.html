			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Return of billions of dollars in paid Medicare claims is being sought by the  Health and Human Services and Justice departments. A spokesman for HHS  Inspector General Richard P. Kusserow told the Washington Post that in many  cases the law clearly makes private insurance companies liable for payment of  patient claims for a number of employed persons over 65; but often the  companies failed to pay bills, leaving them to Medicare. Louis B. Hays, acting  administrator of Medicare, told the Post that underpayments over the last six  years by private insurance companies may total several billion dollars.  </P></p>

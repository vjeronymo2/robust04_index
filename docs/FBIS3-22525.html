In this daira located in the  wilaya of Bouira, 66 people suspected of being infected have  been hospitalized, and 46 cases have been confirmed.    According to health officials, a water-line break between  0900 and 1200 may have been responsible for the epidemic. The  rupture is believed to have allowed waste water to seep into  potable water conduits.    Dr. Ouahdi, head of the national program to combat  waterborne  diseases, says the epidemic could have been avoided if local  authorities had paid attention to warnings from daira health  officials.    These reports noted problems in the potable water system.  "Samples taken in various parts of the daira have shown the  absence of chlorine. This proves that the potable water was not  treated even [text missing] epidemic," our source said.    Readers are reminded that the same cause was cited as  responsible for a similar epidemic in Guelma (196 cases) and  Saida (104 cases) in July of last year. Tiaret reported 500  cases of typhoid fever in the second half of 1993. To avert a  pandemic, disease prevention officials in the Health Ministry  are working in two ways to address problems in contaminated  zones. The first line of action is long term and will involve  renovation of pipes and improvement of chemical and  bacteriological monitoring in the potable water treatment system.    The second, for immediate implementation, involves warning  people in areas affected by the epidemic to take special hygiene  precautions and augmenting chlorine levels in the water towers.    In the same context, the Health Ministry early this month  created "an antidiphtheria operational group" headed by  Professor Dif and consisting of the directors of various health  agencies (INSP [National Public Health Institute], Pasteur  Institute, ENAPHARM [National Pharmaceuticals Company], etc.).    By conducting regular briefings for the medical corps and  local authorities in areas affected by the epidemic, the  committee will promote wide dissemination of information about  this contagious airborne epidemic and means of prevention.  "There were some deaths when the epidemic first broke out,  because doctors did not recognize the disease," said Professor  Dif, director of the Health Ministry's prevention service.    The diphtheria epidemic seems to be almost completely under  control now, with only two active centers of contagion  presenting the risk of further infection: one at Tizi-Ouzou (87  cases and six deaths) and the other at Ghardaia (79 cases but no  deaths). In that connection, Professor Dif assures us that  vaccination coverage will be provided.    "We do not, of course, have vaccines in the industrial  quantities needed to conduct a nationwide vaccination campaign,  but we are in a position to treat the epidemic now under way,"  he said.</p>

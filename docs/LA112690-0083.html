			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOP CROP;  </P> <P> FARM SCHOOL, AN ALTERNATIVE LEARNING CENTER FOR CHILDREN AT UC IRVINE,  CULTIVATES THINKERS  </P> <P> Walking sticks in hand, one group of children set off on a recent morning to  explore the impact of the previous night's rainfall on the hills behind their  cottage classrooms. They came back covered by mud and thoroughly knowledgeable  about erosion.  </P> <P> Another cluster of children got real-life lessons in arithmetic and civic and  environmental responsibility as they sorted and counted a month's worth of  bottles, soda cans and cat food tins, then calculated how much money each bag  would net them at the neighborhood recycling center.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, two 10-year-olds drafted petitions to send to President Bush  opposing armed conflict in the Persian Gulf as chickens pecked for food near  the porch outside. For each signer, the children had a paper cup with a peace  symbol scrawled at the bottom.  </P> <P> It was a typical day at the Farm School, UC Irvine's experimental learning  center, which for two decades has provided an alternative to public elementary  schools for the children of faculty and graduate students, the community and  even top Orange County corporate leaders.  </P> <P> Started as a counterculture education laboratory by free-thinking UCI academics  in 1969, its supporters hail it as "one of the '60s experiments that worked."  </P> <P> It emphasizes individual instruction and the development of critical thinking  skills and seeks to foster a lifelong joy of learning as well as to develop  humane, globally conscious citizens. There are no report cards, and students,  who can attend through the equivalent of sixth grade, are grouped only as  "Littles," "Bigs" and "Uppers."  </P> <P> "I wouldn't trade it for any other school in the world," said Safi Qureshey, an  Irvine computer company president who pulled his son, Uns, out of a public  school several years ago when he discovered that rigid classroom rules and  schedules were frustrating the boy. Both Uns, now 11, and his brother, Zeshan,  9, are longtime Farm School students.  </P> <P> Situated at the edge of a growing University of California campus, Farm School  students often get a chance to question top scholars about current issues and  world events. The school, as its name suggests, also offers opportunities to  learn firsthand about raising animals, how wild creatures forage for food, and  how nature's forces work on the rolling coastal hills behind them.  </P> <P> For decades, Farm School students have been valuable subjects for university  students who plan careers in teaching or psychology, with the school serving as  a laboratory to explore teaching methods.  </P> <P> Yet the Farm School, one of the few remaining alternative schools in Orange  County, remains one of the best kept secrets in Orange County education, mainly  because it cannot accommodate more than 55 students in the three renovated  farmhand cottages that once formed the heart of the old Irvine Ranch.  </P> <P> Now, as the experimental school moves into its third decade, the future of this  brainchild of Michael Butler, UCI's powerful dean of undergraduate studies, is  unclear. It has not been included in the university's long-term plan. And there  is as yet no one on the horizon poised to take over the reins from Butler, who  has been director for 19 years.  </P> <P> Tuition has gone up to $470 a child -- about mid-range for the Irvine-Newport  Beach-Fountain Valley area -- mainly to improve pay and benefits for Farm  School's six teachers, who make far less than their counterparts in Orange  County public schools. Some scholarships are given.  </P> <P> For Lissa Forehan, a UCI graduate student with two sons at Farm School, and  Bajis M. Dodin, a professor at UC Riverside's graduate school of management  with two children at the school, it is a once-in-a-lifetime investment.  </P> <P> "It's tough, but education has always been a real priority," said Forehan, 32,  who is seeking a doctoral degree in psychology and has a part-time job at the  university. "I'm willing to do without a lot of material things."  </P> <P> Said Dodin, a Palestinian from Jordan: "I don't look at it from the money point  of view. . . . It's more important to start on the right foot with a strong  educational background. That gives them greater momentum later on in life."  </P> <P> It all started with a group of social science professors who were dissatisfied  with the caliber of students taking their university courses in the late 1960s.  It's not that the students weren't smart, Butler says. But many of them lacked  intellectual curiosity.  </P> <P> "I was teaching statistics, and some students just naturally engaged in the  systematic exploration of the mathematics involved," Butler said. "For the  rest, math simply fell out of the sky. . . . (It) was arbitrary, mysterious,  incoherent and dull -- a set of recipes someone else discovered."  </P> <P> Butler, anthropology professor Nick Colby and others decided to design an  alternative program in which "students would learn to be smarter, to think  better, and to be more humane," Butler said.  </P> <P> Farm School was launched with four students and a half-time teacher in a  ramshackle cottage that had once been a farmhand's home on the old Irvine  Ranch. At first, the students were mainly children of UCI faculty or graduate  students. "But it was always our intention to be more open, and we were very  soon," Butler said.  </P> <P> A key to the curriculum is class size. For example, there are only about half a  dozen "Bigs" -- children from about 8 to 10 years of age. (Farm School  instructors are careful not to knock public schools or their teachers, who have  the daunting task of educating 30 or more children in a classroom.)  </P> <P> Within the groupings, children work individually or in pairs with teachers in  math, reading, science, geography, art and other traditional subjects.  </P> <P> The way these subjects are taught is hardly traditional. There is no math text,  only a set of instructions and suggested exercises to get across fundamental  concepts with blocks, coins, compasses -- virtually any tactile learning tool.  Children learn at their own pace, and by the time they are "Uppers" -- ages 11  to 12 -- the pace is pretty fast.  </P> <P> But children who aren't ready to learn are not pushed. In the end, the desire  to learn like their friends and classmates seems to win out.  </P> <P> "My younger son is very intelligent but he wants to do his own thing," Qureshey  said. "For a long time, he would not learn his alphabet. Then he needed to get  some information for a class project. He asked his friend who could read. . . .  The friend said 'in books.'  </P> <P> "It was just like a switch that was turned on. He decided to learn the alphabet  so he could learn how to read. . . . If it was a conventional school, he would  have been punished."  </P> <P> A key measure of mastery in a subject is if a child can teach it to other  children. That, in turn, fosters friendships and loyalties that go beyond age,  ethnic background or economic status.  </P> <P> Even the youngest children are challenged to question and to think, not taught  what to think, said head teacher Karen Minns, a published poet and writer who  has taught at the school for eight years.  </P> <P> "We want them to know the world is not black and white most of the time . . .  that there is another side to things, and that everything has a bias."  </P> <P> Added longtime Farm School administrator Agnes Mason: "We say, 'Don't take our  word for it. It could be a lot of baloney.' "  </P> <P> Last year, one group's assignment was to feel -- not just read -- Ernest  Hemingway's "Old Man and the Sea" at home. Parents were asked to provide a  picnic lunch and drink, but not to interrupt their child's reading. The aim,  they were told, was to let the child experience the Old Man's solitude, his  hunger and thirst, and to feel his endurance strained as he battles the sea.  </P> <P> The core of the teaching technique is to build on what the children themselves  are interested in.  </P> <P> Farm School students don't get grades and transcripts they can bring with them  to a new school. About the only yardstick is a standardized test given at all  California schools. Butler said the Farm School children consistently score at  or above grade level on those tests.  </P> <P> The proof may be the welcome Farm School graduates are given at area junior  high schools.  </P> <P> "Some of our most prepared students come from the Farm School," said Mike  Buettell, a counselor at Rancho San Joaquin Intermediate School, where many of  the Irvine area graduates enter seventh grade. "I wish we had more of them."  </P></p>

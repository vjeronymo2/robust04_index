			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Private View: The woman who asked too many questions - Wangari Maathai has paid a heavy price for criticising the Kenyan government Asking questions can get a person into trouble. It has cost Wangari Maathai her marriage and her job; she has been besieged in her house, held in jail, and beaten unconscious by police on the streets of Nairobi. Professor Maathai is an environmental campaigner. In her country, Kenya, (as in many more liberal democracies) this can be a very political profession. For the moment, she is free to come and go. The latest charges against her, of seditious rumour, have been dropped. 'But I'm afraid of the government,' she said. 'I'm afraid of what they could do to me because I have not stopped doing what I was doing when they were harassing me. 'Fortunately, I've had a lot of international support,' she said, not mentioning a clutch of awards. 'Friends have appealed for my life. Every time I'm arrested my friends raise hell and they release me.' It was unfair to pretend she was still in danger now that the government of President Daniel arap Moi has stopped pursuing her. 'But anybody who has been assassinated has not been pre-warned. So I have to be careful.' A more unlikely-looking target for assassination it would be hard to imagine. What you see in the face of this 54-year-old woman is not the hard, hunted look of the political dissident but the smiling eyes and little pearly teeth of a schoolgirl. I asked her if being a woman had been some sort of protection. 'Well, I don't really know. Some people think that perhaps if I had been a man I would have been eliminated a long time ago. That's probably true. Also, perhaps, if I had been a man I would have been much more influential than I am,' she laughed. Formerly an associate professor of microanatomy at the University of Nairobi, Wangari Maathai says she is not politically ambitious. She once tried to stand for parliament but was disqualified, losing her academic post in the process. She demurred when women supporters urged her to oppose Moi in the presidential election two years ago. 'I'm not looking for power, I'm not trying to overthrow anybody,' she said. 'I'm just trying to raise issues and I think the system sees that.' How did you become such a troublemaker? Maathai laughed at the designation. 'I think it started as I was growing up,' she began, then paused, head tilted interrogatively. 'How did I really get myself into all this?' As the first African woman professor in the country, she was co-opted on to a national women's council in the early 1970s. There she discovered that there was 'a lot of misery in the rural areas, no water, no energy, no firewood, and a lot of malnutrition among children'. Such observations fell on a mind prepared. In 1960 the young Wangari Muta had been picked as one of 300 young Kenyans for a pre-independence scholarship programme set up in the US. She studied biology at Kansas and Pittsburgh, then microanatomy in Munich, Bavaria. 'The country I left was extremely green, the rivers were clean, there was plenty of food. I come back seven years later and there was a lot of deforestation in order to plant cash crops. There was a lot of soil erosion: you could see gullies, the silt in the rivers. 'So I started asking questions. That is how I eventually got into a confrontation with the politicians, because I started seeing the linkage between public policy and what was happening on the ground.' In 1977 she started a women's tree-planting movement called Green Belt, which was supported by government foresters and funded by private sponsors. Its success brought her to the attention of UN and other agencies when they set up shop in Nairobi. Trees led to environmental politics, and politics to clashes with Moi's government. Maathai has been hauled off for protesting about a planned skyscraper in Uhuru ('freedom') Park and demonstrating for the release of political prisoners. She has accused Moi of whipping up tribal hatred in order to divide the opposition and has appealed to foreign donors to withhold aid while there is administrative corruption. One victim of her activism was her marriage to Mwangi Maathai, a politician in the ruling Kanu party. They have three children, all now studying in the US. I asked her why he had sued for divorce. 'I think from his point of view I was a woman who was a little too, er . . . conspicuous for him. He was a politician and he wanted to be successful and I think I was a little bit overshadowing to him, and I didn't realise. 'Now today, if we were to start all over again, he would probably say I was an asset. He should have used me, actually, because I had the talents he needed for a political partner. But he tried to control it in a way that was a little difficult. 'Economically and socially I was independent. Emotionally I was very dependent on him. And I think that he felt like he needed . . . a woman. If you look independent and you can put your points across and you can stand your ground, unless you have a very understanding man, you can be a threat. And I think that's what I was. Only I was too young to understand.' Matters were made worse by the divorce process itself. Wangari says that her side of the case was ignored. The divorce became a public issue in which she was to be taught a lesson. When she accused the judge of being either corrupt or incompetent she was arrested and tried for contempt. Will you get married again? 'I dunno. I haven't met a man to marry me.' She laughed. What sort of man would you want this time? She found this hilarious. 'Maybe I should go back and marry the same old man. Yeah.' There was a note of real regret in her laugh. Other people must have asked questions of the system, I said, but would not risk going to jail for it. Why did you? 'I sometimes don't know the answer myself. But I say it was because I was educated in mission schools, mostly taught by nuns. I think they influenced my life; these are people who also had left their countries and were there believing in fairness, doing good.' Maathai grew up in Solai, north of Nakuru in the Rift Valley, and went to school in Nyeri where her family had come from. I asked: what about your parents? Did they ask questions? 'No. My parents were farmers, very simple farmers. My father was a mechanic, a squatter on a white settler's farm so he didn't ask questions.' Her father and the estate owner had been 'great friends', she said. Studying biology made her inquisitive, too. 'I have a mind that tends to ask why. I do get into a lot of trouble because I'm not satisfied with the reasons I'm given. If there are no trees, then why can't we plant them? I want to get to the root of the problem. That way of thinking made me get completely out of the academic circus.' Maathai said she won no popularity prizes for sticking her neck out. 'In the beginning a lot of people, and especially a lot of women, thought that I was just being troublesome because I was educated. The way they saw it was like I was showing off, like I was just trying to be snobbish. 'That bothered me in the beginning. But we have been able to show that it's OK to stand up and now the same people turn around and say it's OK. 'I wasn't being trained to sit down and enjoy my wealth and my comfort. So I have always studied to ask questions, and I have got into a lot of trouble. But I haven't learned to be quiet, yet.' She flashed a big smile. 'And I don't think I will learn, because I think people are silenced through fear.'</p>

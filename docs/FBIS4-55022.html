			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F> correspondent Magda Pospisilova; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Pospisilova] A number of opposition politicians  said this week that rumors about the postponement of the  elections scheduled to be held this autumn were not mere idle  talk. The interview you gave to last Monday's edition of NARODNA  OBRODA seems to have confirmed such rumors.    [Moravcik] This is definitely not the case. We have made a  decision. The parliament has approved the relevant  constitutional law and set the date of the elections and this is  binding for us. Therefore, nothing has happened.    [Pospisilova] It has been claimed that a pretext for  postponing the date of the election from autumn could be the  issue of the entry in the identity card testifying to  citizenship of the Slovak Republic. The fact is that this entry  is posing a problem. Regrettably the relevant authorities have  up to now done nothing to resolve the matter.    [Moravcik] It is really not true that nothing is being done  in this matter. When discussing the bill amending the existing  law on elections we also examined that problem. It can be  resolved technically. This is matter that the finance minister  will have to tackle so that the elections can take place without  a hitch.    [Pospisilova] Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for  a  Democratic Slovakia, said that the National Council was  experiencing a deep political and moral crisis and that he was  not certain whether it would last until the autumn elections.  What do you think? Will it last?    [Moravcik] The question is, who was it who caused this deep  moral crisis? It would be apt and very useful if former Prime  Minister Meciar examined his own conscience. I believe,  however, that what happened in connection with the vote of no  confidence in Vladimir Meciar resulted in the consolidation of  the parliament, making it capable of taking action -- although  problems naturally keep cropping up. We have, however, been  successful in overcoming these problems and have to do  everything possible to ensure that the plan we have set  ourselves concerning legislative tasks facing the government is  implemented. We must indeed be successful in this endeavor.    [Pospisilova] Your government survived the first stern  parliamentary test this week. The opposition failed to secure a  vote of no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac. One  can, however, hear voices that similar motions of no confidence  are being planned for the coming parliamentary meetings.    [Moravcik] This method should not become an accepted thing  in  our parliament. We have to express ourselves very critically on  the course of action chosen by the present opposition when, with  no justification whatsoever, it proposes such motions. On the  one hand we are wasting time, which is very precious. We are  wasting resources since deputies, who on the whole are well  paid, could do a more useful job and not have to listen to  fabricated arguments. [passage omitted]    [Pospisilova] You are therefore not afraid of this?    [Moravcik] Of course, we have a sufficient amount of  self-confidence because we feel that there is nothing that might  realistically threaten the government position of any member of  the present cabinet. [passage omitted]    [Pospisilova] Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmoegnerova  and  Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus have stressed repeatedly that the  abolition of the so-called old clearing account for payments  between the Czech and Slovak Republics could not come out of  meetings between experts and that a political decision is  needed. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has, however, let it  be known that in this matter he has nothing to discuss with you.  He said moreover that he is not certain whether the Slovak side  had a detailed knowledge of the given problem. What will be  your answer to him, Mr. Prime Minister?    [Moravcik] We have examined the payments agreement between  the Czech and Slovak republics, including the problem of the old  clearing account. We have also consulted foreign experts. It  has been shown that that agreement was a bad one; that it was  rather disadvantageous precisely for Slovakia, especially as far  as the old account was concerned. Since it is disadvantageous  for Slovakia it is on the whole natural that it is in our  interest to have it amended. Therefore, from this viewpoint, the  situation is on the whole unequivocal. I firmly believe that the  representatives of the Czech Republic will be accommodating  toward us in this matter. [passage omitted]    [Pospisilova] Vaclav Klaus wants to discuss with you the  issue concerning the border area at Kasarna. What is the  attitude of the Slovak Government in this case?    [Moravcik] Unchanged, so far. This means we see no reason  why there should be an exchange of territory in that locality.</p>

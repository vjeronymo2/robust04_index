			<p>CSO     [Text] After the various Yemeni political factions signed  the Pledge and Accord Document, which was arrived at as a means  of finding a way out of the burning political crisis in Yemen,  has the crisis now come to an end with the signing of this  document?    Has trust been established once again among the factions,  and  have both the incidental and basic disputes been settled? What  is the future of Yemen's situation in view of this document, and  how is it possible to put it into practice?    'UKAZ brought up these questions with some experts, and here  are their opinions.  <H5>  Dr. 'Abdallah al-Qabba', professor of political science at </H5> King Sa'ud University:  <H5>  Gaps in Document Threaten to Paralyze It </H5>   If we take a careful look at the population map, economic  situation, and political legacy of both parts of Yemen, we will  find that the atmosphere that led to the unification of the two  countries was, and still is, characterized by a type of  suspicion and mistrust. We would also find that the tribal  mentality, difference in political experience, and disagreement  in views are some of the factors that have prevented the  achievement of an ideal pattern of unity anticipated by the  Yemenis.    Due to lack of clarity, the fact that political leaders  resorted to delusions and wishful thinking, and refusal to  recognize reality, the Yemeni experiment was pregnant with a  host of contradictions and surprises, leaving the field wide  open for individual interpretations and an approach that is  unregulated, undisciplined, and does not involve political  practices that possess modern administrative and constitutional  frameworks.    Yemen's experience has been that of using assassination as a  means of expressing protest and lack of satisfaction during past  regimes, and the current ruling elite still deals with its  opponents and enemies in this fashion and with this mentality.  We often find expressions of this in the ethics of political  acts in Yemen as well as in the terms used by thinkers and  political parties.    Although Yemen's modern political history has already  witnessed many reconciliation agreements--in particular, those  which took place in Cairo, Tripoli, Kuwait, and Sudan--many  people interested in Yemeni affairs are still hoping for success  in the case of the Pledge and Accord Document which everyone  prays will solve the problems that still exist between the two  leadership groups that are fighting for power in Yemen.    Without entering into the details of the document, we hope  that Yemen's leaders will rise to the occasion of the events and  give priority to the factors of stability, and particularly that  wisdom triumph over personal interests and aspirations and that  disputes over trivialities not lead to a destructive civil war.    The Pledge and Accord Document is full of gaps and holes.  There is also fear that there will once again be a dispute  concerning interpretation of clauses dealing with local rule,  merging the armed forces, and the right of disposal of public  wealth and resources, and that this will lead to total paralysis  of this agreement and consequently a return to the sanctioning  of division and fragmentation of the country, as a prelude to a  situation that could be even more deadly for Yemen and its  people.  <H5>  Hassan al-Mudallal, Yemeni writer: </H5> <H5>  The Time-Bomb Agreement </H5>   The agreement that bears a promising and ambitious name is  called the "Pledge and Accord Document," and was made by the  parties who took part in the Political Forces Dialogue for  Building a Modern Yemeni State. It was an emergency rescue  action that can, at best, be effective during its first phase.  Although the agreement has created an atmosphere of optimism, it  is necessary to call attention to the time bombs contained  within it. These time bombs could cause matters to revert to  their previous state or even worse, particularly since some  people have already begun to speak of "victories."    It is clear that the agreement, in large part, constitutes a  response to the document of eighteen points drawn up by the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] during the beginning of the crisis.  This is something that has made it possible for some people to  talk about "victories," and something that has postponed, by a  few months, the matter of taking up issues that require the  establishment of an immediate mechanism for implementation, such  as the merging of the armed forces, the anchoring in place of  administrative decentralization, and the fear that a dispute  will erupt once again concerning this point--which, it appears,  was one of the basic reasons for the outbreak of the crisis.    Verbal duels took place between the leaders of the General  People's Congress [GPC] and the YSP just a few days after the  agreement was arrived at. This has not allowed Yemenis to feel  reassured and has impelled 'Abdallah al-Jifri, a member of the  National Dialogue Committee and the leader of the People's  Congress Party, to say that he does not believe that the parties  of the coalition will implement the Pledge and Accord Document  because it lacks a sound mechanism for implementation. He adds  that these parties do not trust each other, and that this makes  it difficult for them to implement the agreement. Some observers  point out that what is happening is a postponement of the big  explosion. Others believe that the Yemenis have chosen an  appropriate moment to make a detour in order to avoid falling  into the abyss of a civil war. Only a few believe that the  agreement constitutes a firm basis for putting an end to the  political crisis that is occurring in Yemen, particularly since  the two parties in the crisis, during the last few months, have  undertaken redoubled efforts to create ruptures in the fabric of  Yemen.    At this juncture, two things have to be pointed out. First  of  all, a large segment of the Yemenis consider that the agreement  recently arrived at is more important than the act of  unification itself. Secondly, stability is what is demanded  regionally and internationally, in addition to the fact that  stability is demanded by the Yemeni people who are very anxious  to preserve the unity and stability of their country from  destruction by contentious parties.  <H5>  Dr. Hasan Abu-Talib, head of the International Affairs Unit </H5> at AL-AHRAM's Strategic Studies Center:  <H5>  The Search for Mechanisms for Implementation </H5>   There are several contradictory trends taking place at the  same time in Yemen. Since the Document of Pledge [and Accord]  was arrived at on 18 January of this year, after a dialogue that  lasted four continuous months between all the political forces,  reaching [actual] agreement still is a matter that faces a  number of obstacles. They began with the problem of officially  signing the document--which was accomplished yesterday. However,  there is another problem, which is that of the appropriate  mechanism for the implementation of the clauses written in the  document, particularly since the political forces that  participated in its formulation have felt that it represents a  way out of the economic and political crisis that has been  devastating the country for about the last two years.    After reading the document, my first remark is that it is an  extremely comprehensive document. It will require tremendous  political effort, whether from the leglislative or the  procedural point of view, or even from the standpoint of making  a series of great decisions that will affect the general social,  political, and economic realms of the nation.    It is our belief that the fact that the agreement arrived at  represents a positive development. However, this positive aspect  faces a series of obstacles, as we have indicated. On the  negative side, there is a series of collapses that have been  taking place in various realms, both economic and  security-related. This is also happening in the sense that  Yemen's citizens have a profound feeling that there is a  deeply-rooted crisis and that there are a large number of  disputes between the political forces, both those participating  in the coalition and those not participating in this coalition.  <H5>  Dr. Siraj Zamzami, professor of political science at King </H5> 'Abd-al-'Aziz University:  <H5>  How Can We Deal With the Mountain of Contradictions? </H5>   It is difficult for anyone following the "thermometer" of  the  political temperature in Yemen to provide even an approximate  picture of the future prospects for Yemen after the signing of  the Pledge and Accord Document, and there are numerous reasons  why this is so. One reason is that there are areas of dispute  that go beyond what was mentioned in the text of the document.  This document, as such, could be considered to be an indicator  of the intensity of the sources of disharmony in the political  thought of the parties concerned, in spite of the sincerity of  feelings and the desire to proceed toward anchoring the  foundations of unity and non-fragmentation and not to fall back  into the traps of engaging in verbal hostility or taking up arms  against each other. If we take a cursory glance at the text of  the document, we find that there are 33 articles and about 180  paragraphs and semi-paragraphs. Some of the paragraphs, if they  are to be implemented, would require the services of an  integrated government apparatus. This alone is sufficient to  cause analysts to have the desire to decisively say that the  document will be tantamount to a temporary or competing  constitution. On the other hand, bringing up all the fears and  solutions and coming to agreement concerning them confirms what  was said by Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, member of the General  Committee of the GPC and head of the Political Bureau's  delegation in the National Dialogue Committee: "We are prepared  to accept anything in order to ensure the survival of our united  Yemeni nation." Perhaps the document's conclusion prophesies in  advance the role that must be played by all of the main forces  in the coalition or those who are outside the power structure:  "Implementation of this document, in accordance with what is  mentioned in it, would constitute a strong basis for reforming  our country's political and economic situation and would pull it  out of all of its crises. This will require a strong political  will which is united both in terms of word and deed in our  actions and activity, as well as keeping promises, being  sincere, and being committed....as long as our goal is that of  maintaining unity."    There is no doubt that marathon-like exhaustive efforts were  expended in order to formulate the Pledge and Accord Document in  such a way that it would please all of the parties participating  in the government. The parties signed it because they were not  prepared to take historical responsibility for causing the  agreement to fail. This is in spite of the fact that there are  many strong indicators that the situation in Yemen is becoming  increasingly complicated and causes one to have serious doubts  as to whether it is possible to implement the agreement because  of the huge mountains of debris that have been dumped onto the  crossroads of its paths in an attempt to obstruct it after it  was signed. This is because the military and security-related  problem, which the agreement began to deal with, could be solved  if the soldiers returned to their barracks and if responsibility  for taking care of internal security issues were once again put  into the hands of the authorities [normally] concerned with  them. But the fact is, apparently, that the crisis exists  because of the lack of bases for the existence of elements of  trust between the two pivots of the triangular pyramid. Mr.  Muhammad Basindwah, the minister of foreign affairs, has already  said: "Yemen is experiencing an undeclared break-up." Perhaps it  is experiencing a break-up inside its united leadership, not to  mention the traditional trend of the provinces to serve as  alternatives to the system of hereditary local power structures.  Perhaps the recently-held al-Mukalla conference provides an  indicator of these inclinations. But objectivity also obliges an  analyst to attempt to seize upon some of the merits of the  document and see in them, in case they are put into practice, a  better political future that will guarantee Yemen the stability  to turn the wheels of the slumping Yemeni economy and bring  trust back to the masses....who know that a united caravan is  better than one that is split up, especially if it goes in the  same wrong direction.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Chinese progress on Gatt CHINA's longstanding application to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) appears to be making headway after more than two years of delay - a development that may be linked to a possible go-ahead for Taiwan's application. At yesterday's opening session of a two-day meeting of the working party considering China's application, both the US and the EC welcomed the progress made in reforming the country's state-dominated economy, while arguing that China still had a long way to go before its trade regime complied with Gatt rules. China has recently pushed hard to reactivate negotiations on its 1986 request to rejoin. Talks have been stalled since 1989 and Beijing's crackdown on the pro-democracy movement and signs of a slowdown in economic reforms. A founding member, China left Gatt in 1950 after the Communist takeover; Taiwan was obliged to leave when China replaced it in the UN in 1971. Next month Gatt's governing council could well approve the establishment of a working party to consider Taiwan's membership application.</p>

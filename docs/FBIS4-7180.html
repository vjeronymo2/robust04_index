			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Japan's top opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) urged newly elected Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata on Wednesday [27 April] to give up his  premiership to take the blame for the current political chaos,  Diet officials said. LDP President Yohei Kono made the demand  in his meetings with House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi  and House of Councillors President Bunbei Hara, the officials  said.    Kono made the plea to the Diet leaders "as the chiefs of the  two chambers of the Diet that voted to confer the premiership"  to Hata in Monday's key parliamentary vote, they said. On  Monday the Diet voted to pick the successor to outgoing Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    The Diet chiefs told Kono they had already telephoned Hata,  asking him to speed up the process of forming a new cabinet, the  officials said. They told Hata his coalition government's  failure to form a new cabinet, if it is prolonged, would exert a  negative impact on the livelihood of the people, they said.    They quoted Hata as replying that he is ready to make utmost  efforts to speed up the cabinet formation.    The LDP intensified its pressure after the Hata  administration was thrown into chaos following the announcement  by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] that it  will pull out of the coalition following the creation of a new  parliamentary bloc in the lower chamber, excluding the SDP.    The SDP reacted sharply to the emergence of the new  130-legislator bloc, saying it was not consulted by its  coalition partners beforehand and that the abrupt move  represented a Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-led attempt to  push it to the sidelines of government.    The SDP's withdrawal, unless it is reversed, would strip the  Hata administration of its governing majority, rendering it as  Japan's first minority government since 1955.</p>

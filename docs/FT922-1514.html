			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Doubts cast over new trust hospitals MINISTERS have been warned that many of the self-governing trust hospitals due to come into operation next April may not be viable as separate units. The Commons was told by Mr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, last week that 150 hospitals and other services had applied to become third-wave trusts from next April - a greater number than in the first and second waves. Still more hospitals are considering becoming fourth-wave trusts in 1994. Mr Mawhinney said that demonstrated that more and more National Health Service staff were behind the government's health reforms. But the NHS Trust Federation, which represents the boards of trusts, has expressed concern to the Department of Health that many of the proposed third and fourth-wave trusts may have neither the managerial skills nor the strength in the NHS internal market to operate as successfully as the established self-governing hospitals. Trusts are run by their own managers and boards outside health authority control. Mr John Greetham, chairman of the federation and of St James's University Hospital Trust, Leeds, said the federation believed it would be sensible for third and fourth-wave trusts to consider merging with existing trusts. He identified two difficulties. The government requirement that hospitals should not undercut each other by cross-subsidising activities meant that even if smaller hospitals were strong in some clinical areas, they would find it difficult to achieve all-round viability as trusts. The second would be the fact that 'there is only a limited number of good managers in any industry or service'.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER SUPREME COURT'S ABORTION DECISION  </P> <P> From the wide range of opinions advanced by the Supreme Court on abortion, it  is obvious that its nine justices are not guided by basic law but are simply  voicing their separate prejudices -- echoing, for the most part, those of the  Presidents who appointed them.  </P> <P> Is this the way the law should be determined? Should the moral views of  Presidents, of legislators, of sects and our Puritan elders be imposed upon  all?  </P> <P> "Morality" seems to vary in direct proportion to wealth and how tight the thumb  screw of necessity is tightened. Our well-fed Reagans, Bushes, Ed Meeses, and  Orrin Hatches -- all males -- can well afford their exalted puritan postures.  They have it made. Would their attitudes change if they were teen-age tenement  girls, with only one dress fit for school, and that one getting too tight? Let  them be destitute, hungry, pregnant, and thinking of suicide, and we'll see.  </P> <P> The controversy will be settled, in the end, by the law of necessity. As the  pressures of population and pollution rise, the moral aristocrats will hear  them as the rattle of tumbrels. ELLIOT W. MICHENER  </P> <P> El Monte  </P></p>

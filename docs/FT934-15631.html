			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / People: NatWest chalks up academic forecaster Proof that the world of City economists is peopled not just by bright young things in their 20s comes with the move to financial markets of Geoffrey Dicks, right, a 46-year-old academic doyen of forecasting. Dicks, who has worked at London Business School for the past 17 years, takes over today as UK economist at NatWest Markets, the securities arm of National Westminster Bank. 'I thought my chances of entering the City had gone long ago,' says Dicks, who is currently the LBS's head of forecasting. He has previously worked as an economist at the Department of Employment, and as a school teacher. Dicks's chance to embark on a new career - with a 'significantly higher' salary - came a few weeks ago when NatWest's head of strategy, Bob Semple, called him out of the blue. Semple asked the business school guru whether he would be interested in taking over from Paul Neild, another golden oldie on the wrong side of 40, who had left NatWest unexpectedly for personal reasons. The new NatWest incumbent scorns suggestions he may be too old to adapt to the cut and thrust of the City. 'I am solidly unacademic,' he says. 'Also I'm an early morning person so I won't have any trouble with the early starts.' However, Dicks will probably have to reshape his lifestyle somewhat. At the LBS he has had the luxury of working at his home near Exeter every Friday, a practice he sadly reckons he will have to give up. At NatWest Dicks will join two other greybeards of the economics world; Robert Thomas is in charge of analysing bonds and currencies, and David Kern is chief economist of the UK banking side.</p>

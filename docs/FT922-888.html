			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (13): Hassle-free perks - Developments in leasing It has taken 11 years, but the British government's determined effort to tax the company-provided executive car out of existance is now bearing fruit. Very many UK companies are now thinking about offering managers cash instead. But, given that most executive cars are non-essential 'perks' provided as part of a package to attract the most suitable candidates for senior management jobs, companies know they must tread warily. While many companies would prefer to get out of the business of car provision entirely, they recognise they must offer alternatives which take the 'hassle factor' out of personal car ownership. This is where employee car leasing schemes come in. These schemes aim to give individual employees access to the economies of scale in car purchase, maintenance and administration more typically associated with fleet operation rather than individual ownership. So today, fleet managers are not just considering which method best suits their organisation when executive cars must be acquired, they are also having to deal with the complexities involved with 'cash for cars' schemes or whether they should support personal leasing plans. Mr Colin Grant-Wilson, managing director of Lease Plan, says that employee leasing, from the employee's point of view, is of particular relevance to people who have 'perk' company cars, have relatively high-cost company cars and who have to pay higher rates of marginal taxation. He suggests that personal leasing schemes would have been introduced very quickly if the UK had elected a Labour party government which then had implemented the personal tax changes promised before the recent general election. Because the Conservative party was re-elected, the immediate pressure for change has been eased slightly. 'Personal leasing will eventually be an important part of the company car scene. But it will take time. Not many companies are prepared to be pioneers,' suggests Mr Grant-Wilson. Those companies willing to push forward rapidly are offering support to leasing companies in various ways - such as deducting from salaries the employee's payment to the leasing company and acting as guarantor should an employee default on payments or leave the company. However, the Inland Revenue has yet to decide whether such an agreement is sufficiently at arm's length from the employee and that the car is not a company car by another name and therefore liable to company car tax. Because of grey areas such as this, Lease Plan is still some months away from finalising details of its own personal leasing schemes. Mr Grant-Wilson says that, when they arrive, the new programmes will allow companies wishing to move from a company car scheme to manage effectively the transition to an employee leasing arrangement. 'In this way, continuity of benefit levels will be maintained and employers deciding to discontinue or reduce their company car schemes will have the assurance that their employees have a viable alternative which will not expose them to the full economic risk of operating an individual car. As with a company scheme, Lease Plan would underwrite the residual value and maintenance budgets and so provide fixed-cost motoring for the individual.' There will still be some drawbacks. For example, leasing companies will have to recover their higher administrative costs, associated with handling a large number of individual customers. Charges would also have to reflect the fact that individuals are usually not such good credit risks as corporations. It is worth recalling that the 'perk' cars era started because companies in the 1960s and 1970s were looking for other ways to reward employees because high personal taxes made simple pay increases relatively unattractive. The government's counter-attack started in 1979 when it said it aimed to reduce the UK's personal tax rates but, to compensate, it also wanted to eliminate the provision of 'perks' being handed out in lieu of extra pay. The screw has now tightened to the extent that, according to Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt of Monks Partnership, the remuneration advisers, 10 to 15 per cent of UK companies will probably cease to provide executive cars and give managers cash instead. These typically will be the financial institution with a small number of highly-paid staff who all do low annual mileages or US-owned companies who dislike the UK company car system on principle. Another 25 per cent of companies will include a cash alternative among the choices offered to senior people, he suggests. There are other clear trends in the company car sector: the cars provided are generally getting smaller, companies are keeping them longer and there is a small but steady shift away from companies buying cars outright - still the most popular method of acquisition. Mr Vernon-Harcourt suggests that this trend has probably been accelerated by the recession and the lack of availability of funds. With the banks reluctant to stump up new loans, companies are prefering to use the financial facilities available to them for other things apart from cars. This year's budget again increased the amount of income tax which individuals must pay for the benefit of using a company car. The budget might also affect companies' acquisition policies because it raised from Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 12,000 the limit on the cost of cars above which capital allowances and tax relief for lease rental payments are restricted. This makes contract purchase schemes relatively less attractive because these were developed in response to demands from customers wanting to avoid the Pounds 8,000 rental write-off restrictions. Conversely, it should increase demand for contract hire because the entire contract hire rental on cars costing up to Pounds 12,000 - which covers the bulk of vehicles bought by fleets - can now be offset against pre-tax profits as an allowable business expense. This important change does not really have an impact on executive cars which cost more than Pounds 12,000. The Pounds 8,000 limit was fixed in 1973 when that sum would have bought an executive car. To have kept pace with inflation the chancellor would have had to lift the limit to Pounds 22,000. Contract purchase also continues to offer real benefits to those companies or organisations - such as banks and insurance companies - which have difficulty clawing back any VAT they pay. Under the terms of a contract purchase scheme, companies avoid paying VAT on the purchasing component (but not on the service and maintenance element). The primary disadvantage with contract purchase is that, as it has been developed from hire purchase, a deposit must be paid up front. Some companies use lease purchase - another name for hire purchase - when acquiring company cars. This method enables the vehicle to be bought for a nominal sum at the end of the contract period. In contrast, with finance leasing, the leasing company is the legal owner of the car and must bear all the operating risks. Also on offer as a method of acquisition is contract hire, which is a lease under which a contract hire company provides specific services in addition to finance and carries certain risks, mainly the risk associated with a car's residual value. Fleet management contracts remove from the fleet user the administrative burden of running company cars and keeps costs under tight control. But financing of cars is quite separate from their management - this might cause administration complications - and all the operating costs and residual value risks remain with the fleet user. The car leasing companies so far have been carefully tailoring their contracts to suit the demands of their customers within the constraints of a changing tax system. Those customers have been corporations. Now, like the company fleet manager, the leasing groups are having to re-think their position and consider how they might develop contracts to suit individuals as well.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Survey of Chicago - A Centre For Finance and Industry (8): First-world economy, third-world slums - Laurie Morse describes the other side of the US's most racially segregated city A SINGLE sniper-shot in October accomplished what decades of social benefaction could not. It galvanised the public against the crime and neglect that plagues the city's poor. The shot killed Dantrell Davis, a seven-year old boy, as he crossed, with his mother, the few yards between his public housing apartment and his ghetto school. The violence has forced the city to acknowledge the failure of its public housing system, and to address, however briefly, the evils bred by a system that for decades has dealt with its poor by warehousing them in dilapidated high-rise blocks and isolating them from the rest of the community. Chicago, like large cities around the globe, has its share of poverty and its attendant crime, homelessness and hopelessness. However, the magnificent wealth of the urban area, its natural resources, and its progressive business community form a foil to the city's grit; and the contrast, deepest at the city's core, strikes even a casual visitor. The starkest contrast is the geographic and economic separation between black and white citizens. Sociologists have measured the division, and report that Chicago is the most racially segregated city in the US. In his book American Apartheid, Doug Massey, professor of sociology at the University of Chicago, makes a compelling argument that segregation is the cause of urban poverty. The city is one of minorities. The 1990 census counted 2.7m city residents. Of these, 1.3m were white, 1.1m black, and slightly more than half a million of Hispanic origin. Despite growing political activism by black and Hispanic voters, Chicago's deeply ingrained separatism has been slow to change. Friction between these two minorities impedes progress, and the city's history of political patronage often short-circuits reform efforts. The two worlds that make Chicago - its first-world economy and its third-world slums - co-exist in extremes. Two of the worlds' most highly regarded private universities - Chicago and Northwestern - abut what is by a variety of measures the nation's worst public elementary and secondary education system. World-renowned private libraries and museums serve the city's elite, while the new central public library, a Dollars 144m pile of brick and mortar named after Chicago's first black mayor, Harold Washington, is starved of books and operates on a reduced schedule. From the windows of amenity-stuffed lakeshore condominiums, one can glimpse the high-rise blocks where Chicago's desperate poor are stacked in a decades-old public housing nightmare. And on the streets are an estimated 49,000 people who have no housing at all. Repeatedly, in conversations with the city's corporate and civic leaders, the costs of racial and economic divisions are counted in terms of lost human capital, poorly prepared workers, and quality-of-life issues like crime, drugs, and homelessness. A recent study by the SRI Center for Economic Competitiveness, of Menlo Park, California, and Data Resources, the economic forecasting firm, cites declining workforce quality as one factor eroding Illinois' global competitiveness. It said vital co-operation between industry, government and education, needed to tackle the problem, was lacking. Chicago's public school system is an example. Forty-six per cent of children entering its public high schools in 1986 failed to graduate with their class in 1990. The drop-out rate for boys topped 50 per cent, and for some minorities, particularly young Hispanic men, it approached 70 per cent. Achievement levels for children who stay in school are well below national averages. Only a quarter of the city's elementary students can read at their grade levels, and the statistics are equally dismal for mathematics preparation. This wasteland has not been ignored by the corporate community. Industry pours hundreds of thousands of dollars into school improvement programmes annually, and landmark school reform legislation, crafted by an unusual partnership of politicians and corporate leaders, was enacted in 1988. The reform was aimed at dismantling the school system's politically-charged central bureaucracy and putting control of the city's 560 schools in the hands of parents and local communities. Three years later, the experiment is foundering. Special interests divide the effort; the Dollars 2.5bn school budget continues to face annual crises; and the massive school bureacracy has clung to power, frustrating local school councils. The latest casualty of the struggle is the city schools superintendent, Mr Ted Kimbrough, who was hired to implement the school reform plan. In announcing that he will not renew his contract, Mr Kimbrough told the Chicago Tribune that he was defeated by politics. A veteran of political school wars in his previous post in California, he said: 'The difference in Chicago is the intensity of the politics. The magnitude of it, how it is part of the culture. . . It cripples everything.' Meanwhile, the city's corporate leaders, political elite, even its public school teachers, attend to a separate system, and send their children to private or suburban schools. Housing activist Mr Alexander Polikoff says the failure of Chicago's leadership successfully to address racial and economic divisions is not unique. In fact, he says, the city's wealth has enabled it to avoid crises like those seen in St Louis and Los Angeles. A private consortium of corporate trusts provided Dollars 2.5m to community groups this summer for a jobs programme, aimed at heading off tensions that followed the Los Angeles riots. Longer-range jobs programmes are under consideration in the private sector, and small but promising efforts to move poor families out of public housing are gaining praise. Since the shooting, Chicago's housing deputy, Mr Vincent Lane, has renewed his effort to use federal housing dollars earmarked for building renovation for construction of new, low-density housing outside the ghettos' borders. Even the violent street gangs that control the Cabrini-Green project where Dantrell Davis was killed have been jarred into calling a truce. However, their pact offers a challenge to Chicago's mayor. The peace, gang leaders say, will last only if jobs are provided, and robbing and drug-dealing become less essential for survival.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- POPULATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Area                      1980           1990       Change %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- City of Chicago      3,005,072      2,783,726           -7.4 Metro area (*MSA)    6,060,401      6,024,581           -0.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ETHNICITY: CHICAGO                           1990              %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- White                1,263,524           45.4 Black                1,087,711           39.1 American Indian/     Eskimo/Aleut         7,064            0.3 Asia/Pacific     islander           104,118           3.73 Other                  321,309           11.5 Hispanic origin**      545,852           19.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: 1990 Census - Housing and Population (America's Top Rated Cities, a statistical handbook: Universal Reference Publications).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: * MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area) covers Cook, DuPage and McHenry counties. ** People of Hispanic origin can be of any race.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

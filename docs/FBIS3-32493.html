			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 8  February.    Colombia's International Sugar and Molasses Marketing  Company  purchased the Urena Sugar Mill for 320 million bolivares. The  transaction was conducted at the Venezuelan Investment Fund  (FIV) offices. FIV President Nelson Rivera stated the  transaction was beneficial for the country because the  investment and expenditures incurred throughout the sale process  were recovered. (Caracas Venezolana de Television in Spanish  2350 GMT 27 Jan 94)    The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) has reported that, owing  to  a reduction in oil revenues, Venezuela's international reserves  dropped by $744 million last January and now total $11.912  billion. According to the BCV, another factor contributing to  the decline is the climate of mistrust that exists in the  financial market in the wake of the government's intervention in  Banco Latino. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2234 GMT 3 Feb 94)    Venezuela foreign debt bonds have been hurt by a decrease in  value of U.S. long-term bonds. The par bond fell one point to  70.75 due to U.S. 30-year bond sales. In addition, investors  have adopted a cautious stance as they are waiting to see what  specific measures President Rafael Caldera will take. (Caracas  EL NACIONAL in Spanish 4 Feb 94 p E-1)</p>

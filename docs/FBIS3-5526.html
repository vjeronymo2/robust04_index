			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the State  Law and Order Restoration Council, commander in chief of the  Defense Services and patron of the Union Solidarity and  Development Association [USDA], addressed trainees at the  opening ceremony of management course No. 1/94 for USDA  executives held in Union Hall, the Central Public Relations  Corps in Hmawbi at 0900 this morning. [passage omitted]    In his opening address, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said that today's  management course is being held for 404 USDA executives from  branches in states, divisions, districts, and townships  throughout the country. He expressed pleasure at meeting with  the trainees.    He said first he would like to explain why USDA branches are  being organized firmly and extensively throughout the country.  He said the main objective in forming this organization with the  people, including patriotic trainees, is to meet the need for  national unity which has declined and weakened throughout the  nation.    Reviewing the 1988 events [year of the uprising], he  recalled  that there were many factions among the various strata of  society and the youths. National unity was in a state of  disintegration and nationalism and patriotism were in decline.  There were some who tied the state flag to their legs while  some flew it upside down. There were also attacks against the  Defense Services which were defending the nation with their  lives and eventually there were attempts to cause the  disintegration of the Defense Services. These events almost  destroyed the national psyche and the way of thinking, and  national unity declined at an unprecedented rate.    Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said that this situation was most evident  when political parties were allowed to be formed and a total of  235 emerged in such a small country with everyone acting like  self-proclaimed rulers. Furthermore, despite measures taken to  bring about multiparty democracy step by step, some who could  not wait followed the path of armed struggle as a short-cut to  power. Instead of holding discussions patiently among ourselves  inside the country to find a solution, these persons deserted  the national convention, thought highly of foreign powers, and  approached them.    Continuing, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe noted that there are also  those in the country who oblige the wishes of foreign powers.  There are those who echo foreign claims about a lack of  democracy and human rights violations in Myanmar [Burma]. He  said these actions reflected the decline of national unity and a  lack of patriotism. Therefore, he said the USDA was formed  systematically with the objective to fill in the role of  strengthening national unity.    Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said acts of anarchy prevailed during the  events of 1988 and that the USDA was formed to prevent similar  events in the future and to promote the observance of law and  order among the general public. He said the long-term goal for  the trainees is the five aims of the organization  [nondisintegration of the Union; nondisintegration of national  unity; perpetuation of national sovereignty; promotion and  vitalization of national pride; and the emergence of a  prosperous, peaceful, and modern Union]. [passage omitted]    He said the five aims of the organization are not temporary  in nature, but will have an impact on the future and that these  aims will remain forever. There may be political and economic  changes in the future, but these aims are not likely to change.  These aims will remain constant and firm. [passage omitted]    Continuing, he said he would like to report to the trainees  about endeavors being undertaken by the state. He said he would  first like to explain an endeavor for national unity, that is,  the matter of armed organizations. He said these organizations,  which have existed for over 40 years since the achievement of  independence, have been undermining the country's economic and  social development and causing hardship among the general  public. However, he said it is believed that if national unity  is constructed, armed organizations will have an opportunity to  operate democratically and politically within the framework of  law. He said we have invited them in order to provide such an  opportunity.    He said because of this invitation, quite a number of these  organizations are working hand in hand with the state.  Organizations such as KNU [Karen National Union] have been  invited to the talks. Mons, Karenni, and Kayah have also been  invited. Some are still in the process of holding talks. The  invitation has been extended with goodwill because it is  believed that the bloodshed and fighting among our own brethren  that has been going on for over 40 years is not good and that  the time has come to enable the people who have been suffering  since independence to live in peace and prosperity. He said it  is known to the trainees how some organizations have responded  to the invitation and are beginning to cooperate.    Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said another outstanding endeavor today  is the convening of the National Convention. Therefore, there  are sectors dealing with the National Convention, the  reestablishment of national solidarity, and national  construction. National construction is related to national  solidarity and they are inseparable. He said while the endeavor  is being made to invite the armed organizations in the jungle,  the legal political parties inside the country were invited to  convene [at National Convention] in order to work for unity.  These organizations will consult on the emergence of the state  constitution.    He said the old constitution has ceased to operate. In order  to establish a new nation, a new constitution must be drafted  when the old one ceases to operate and the new one has not  emerged. He explained that the National Convention is currently  being held in accordance with the policy of reestablishing  national solidarity. He said the consultations at the convention  have been quite effective. At present, basic principles have  been laid down and work is being done on each chapter. He said  two outstanding political endeavors are being undertaken -- the  national convention to draft a new state constitution to  establish a new nation, and the invitation extended to armed  organizations for national solidarity and to enable them to work  peacefully and democratically. He said he had pointed out two  major points out of many political developments.    Speaking about the economic sector, he said the economic  system is being reformed in preparation for the nation that will  emerge in the future. He said, as is known to the trainees,  that a market- oriented economy is being established and the  people are being allowed to work according to their own physical  and mental abilities. He said at present unemployment is  declining as more enterprises which provide work are established  and people become more well-off. He said there is improvement  in production as well as in trade. He said economic measures  are being taken to suit the future nation which will be a  democratic nation.    Speaking about social development, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said  efforts are being made to develop villages and towns, construct  sports facilities to promote moral development, and to promote  the education and health sectors.    He said that SLORC is laying down a sound political and  economic foundation to ensure that the future nation that  emerges is peaceful, prosperous, and stable. He said,  meanwhile, efforts are being made for social and moral  development. He said the USDA will work hand in hand with the  SLORC in these endeavors. [passage omitted]</p>

On developments in Russia, Chernomyrdin confirmed for the  pope his government's intention to pursue reforms set in motion  and, after outlining the Russian position on Bosnia of  opposition to any international solution to hostilities based on  the use of force, the prime minister said crisis conditions in  ex-Yugoslavia must be managed "with peaceful methods."    A brief communique issued by the Holy See at the end of the  meeting, which ran to 50 minutes rather than the 30 minutes  scheduled, said, "During the audience, the prime minister  illustrated for the Holy Father the present situation of his  government on major problems in national and international life."    The pope, for his part, "expressed the wish Russia's  material  and spiritual progress with profound respect for the religious  freedom of all believers."    At the end of the talk, held in Russian, the pope and the  prime minister exchanged gifts of papal medallions and rosaries  and a painting of a Russian landscape.    Though the atmosphere prevailing was described as "very  cordial," Holy See observers noted that Chernomyrdin did not  invite John Paul to Moscow and recalled that an invitation was  not forthcoming from Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his  meeting with the pope on December 20, 1991.    The pontiff was, however, warmly invited to the Russian  capital by the Soviet president of the time, Mikhail Gorbachev,  who had two private audiences in the Vatican, in December 1989  and in November of the following year.    Chernomyrdin also met here with Vatican Secretary of State  Msgr Angelo Sodano and his foreign minister, Jean-Louis Tauran,  for a talk in which the two sides "reviewed some bilateral  problems between the Holy See and Russia and especially various  aspects of life in the Catholic community residing there," said  the communique released by the Vatican press office.</p>

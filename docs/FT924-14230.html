			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Travel: Hungary on course ONCE tourists took only old jeans and Beatles albums to Hungary. Now they are taking golf bags. Once the locals spent their weekends queuing for petrol. Now they queue to tee-off. Within two years the Hungarian Open could be established. That is the dream of a Hungarian-born golf fanatic who lives and plays most of his golf in the middle of the Pacific. He probably has to travel further from his home to his golf club than anyone in the world. Dezco Hafnal is president of the Hungarian Golf Association and the man behind Budapest Golf Park and Country Club, a Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.1m) project on the picturesque island of Szentendre, 35 kms north of Budapest. He spends six months there and the rest of the year in Honolulu, where he is a 12-handicap member of the Hawaii Golf Club. 'There has always been some kind of golf played in Hungary, usually by diplomats, ex-pats, service people and the high society, but now more locals and tourists are getting interested in the game,' said Hafnal. In 1956 Hafnal, the son of a Budapest hairdresser, moved to British Columbia in Canada where he became a member of the Uplands and Victoria golf clubs. He became involved in property projects in the US and Canada and saw the potential of building a golf course in his home country. His dream came true when the Szentendre course opened in 1988. Hafnal wants to bring a permanent teaching professional from Britain for the opening of the courses's back nine holes next year. It won't be me. The course is tight and has some idiosyncratic hazards which proved too much for my west European game. At the moment the longest hole is the 410-metre fifth and the shortest the 153 metre seventh. I came to grief on the fourth which has pepper fields down the right hand side of the fairway. I pushed one in there and found that I could not see the green - my eyes were watering too much. Green fees are Pounds 16 and membership Pounds 266. There are plenty of moderately-priced and comfortable guest-houses close to the course, as well as some excellent spa hotels. For luxury you could stay in the Grand Hotel Corvinus, which opened recently in Buda. You can play at Budapest Golf Club from April 1 to October 31. It has a friendly and cosmopolitan atmosphere and you can find yourself talking a good game in the clubhouse afterwards with almost anyone from the local paprika mogul to the bored wife of a hussar. There are two other golf courses in Hungary: a nine-hole course at Pecs, in the south, and an 18-holer at Buk. There is no reason why golf in Hungary cannot be a success, says Dr Gati of the Hungarian Golf Association. 'Russia has a golf course. So does Poland. Romania even has four or five courses. So does Czechoslovakia.' A new course near the famous German tourist attraction of Lake Balaton to the west of Budapest will shortly be under construction, and Hafnal has been approached by a German group to draw up plans for another complex. Once, most of Hungary was out of bounds. Now only parts of it are. For further information about golf in Hungary: contact Danube Travel in London: 071-493-0263.

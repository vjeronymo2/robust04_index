			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with State Council Premier Li Peng by </F> corrrespondent Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504) at Zhongnanhai;  date not given: "An Interview with Li Peng on Reform and  Opening up in 1994"]    [Text] Beijing, 2 Jan (XINHUA) -- On the eve of the end of  the old year and the beginning of the new, Premier Li Peng  granted this XINHUA correspondent an interview at Zhongnanhai in  which he looked ahead at the overall trend of reform and opening  up in 1994 and expressed full confidence in China's political  and economic development and its foreign relations.  <H5>  The Four Characteristics of 1993's Economic Development </H5>   [Zhou] How would you characterize China's economic  development in 1993?    [Li] It can be summed up in four main characteristics:    1. It continued its relatively rapid development rate. GNP  grew by 13 percent, something not often seen amid the present  world economic depression [xiao tiao 4682 2742].    2. As for reforms, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee erected the basic framework for the  construction of a socialist market economy system, thereby  providing the reform with a more specific target.    3. Opening to the outside world moved ahead on an  unprecedented scale and the utilization of foreign capital rose  to another peak. Direct investment by foreign businessmen topped  $20 billion, indicating a general optimism about the prospects  for the Chinese market.    4. There were some conspicuous contradictions and problems  in the process of development, but the party Central Committee  and State Council eased these contradictions and laid a  foundation for the healthy development of the national economy  by adopting the method of boosting macroregulation and control.  <H5>  Reforms Will Take Major Steps in 1994 </H5>   [Zhou] What will be the overall trend in China's economic  development in 1994?    [Li] The trend can be characterized in two phrases: 1)  Reform will take major steps; and 2) sustained, rapid, and  healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660]  economic development.    So-called "major steps" carry specific references. These  major steps will be reflected primarily in a modern corporate  system and in reforms in the financial, tax, monetary,  investment, and foreign trade systems -- all of them oriented  toward building a socialist market economic system.    The initial proposal from the State Council was a nine  economic growth rate for 1994, a little lower than last year,  because two consecutive years of high-speed economic growth will  have strained various sectors in the national economy, and the  "bottlenecks" -- such as we have in the transport and energy  sectors -- will have become more severe. In order to sustain  economic development, we need to maintain a more relaxed  environment [song kuan 2646 1401]. Compared with countries  around the world, a nine percent growth rate is still quite  fast. "Healthy" [jian kang 0256 1660] can be understood in many  different ways, but right now it means primarily structural  improvement and raising economic efficiency.  <H5>  Be Active and Cautious in Price Reforms </H5>   [Zhou] What moves are in store for price reforms in 1994,  and  how will they affect reforms in other areas?    [Li] This year's price reforms will go hand-in-hand with  several other reforms. The overall objective is to bring the  price system closer to market laws. In the last decade or so,  China has taken very great steps in price reforms and has  acquired rich experience. Most price adjustments have achieved  the desired results: Except for a few commodities vital to the  national economy and people's livelihood, prices for 90 percent  of all commodities are now market-regulated. Most of the  remaining commodities are in infrastructural industry, the  prices of which tend to be low to encourage their consumption,  thus hindering the development of these industries. Adjustments  are in order, but are also more difficult; for example, the  petroleum industry will never be able to develop without  adjustment, but any adjustment in petroleum prices inevitably  affects its products. So we need to adopt a very cautious and  gradual approach.    As markets in our country have yet to mature, markets are  suffering from their inherent spontaneity and blindness.  Therefore, at a suitable time there should be state  macroregulation and control to make sure that the people's  interests are protected.    In each of the significant reformist measures, we have taken  the endurance of the country, of enterprises, and of the people  into full consideration, and so we are upholding an orderly and  gradual approach. Too great a step inevitably will affect  company costs and people's livelihood.  <H5>  Lessons From the Grain Market Fluctuations </H5>   Earlier, grain prices fluctuated in some regions. The causes  were many. As the state had enough grain on hand and as state  grain sales departments functioned as the main channels, the  fluctuations leveled off gradually.    The grain market fluctuations should be viewed in this way:  On the one hand, sufficient grain reserves displayed the  state's macroregulatory and control power; on the other hand,  there is a lesson to be learned here, which is that in no way  can we grow complacent about, or can governments at any level  relinquish control over the problem of price, even at the best  of economic times.  <H3>  Reforms in the Monetary, Investment, Foreign Exchange, and  Foreign Trade Systems Reinforce Each Other </H3>   [Zhou] What are the connections between reforms in the  monetary and investment systems and those in the foreign  exchange and foreign trade systems?    [Li] Reforms in the monetary system will set in motion  reforms in the investment system. In the practice of the market  economy, this means that investment will be regulated and  controlled by the money market: The volume of investment  depends entirely on amounts of money. Meanwhile, industrial  policy will determine the direction of investment.    Adopting a unified exchange rate and a unitary, managed  floating exchange rate system based on market demand and supply  aids the effort to open up to the outside world, will promote  further growth in foreign economic cooperation and trade, and  will have a positive impact on China's efforts to integrate its  economy with the world economy.  <H3>  Financial and Tax Reforms Are in the Interests of Various  Circles </H3>   [Zhou] Can financial and tax reforms be implemented  smoothly,  in light of the fact that they may affect the local interests of  some regions and enterprises?    [Li] Financial and tax reforms consist mainly of unifying  tax  laws, a fair tax burden, and changing the contract system into a  tax-revenue sharing system. In all, enterprises do not have a  larger tax burden. The reform is an adjustment in the interest  pattern.    The key to the financial and tax reforms is a reasonable  taxation system compatible with the demands of a socialist  market economy system, and at the same time, in line with  international convention. The tax-revenue sharing system is  generally adopted in countries with a market economy. It  strengthens the state's financial macroregulatory and control  powers. However, most of the additional income for the central  government will be plowed back into the local authorities in  various forms. To take the endurance of localities and  enterprises into account, and to ensure the convergence of the  old tax system with the new, we will arrange for a transitional  period, during which the present interest pattern will remain as  it is. Only gradually will the central financial authorities  raise their proportion of revenues from the later-increased part  of taxes.  <H5>  The Market Economy Will Be a Unified Market </H5>   [Zhou] How do you see some of the potential differences in  view between the central and local authorities and between the  localities themselves, and the problem of imbalanced economic  development?    [Li] China is a unified country, and the socialist market  economy system we are going to develop will be a unified market.  Of course, there are bound to be differences in view between  China [as published] and localities, and development in  different regions is indeed not balanced.    The gap between the eastern and western regions has indeed  widened, but the western region is developing too. People's  living standards there are continuously rising. When we look  around the world, we can see that imbalanced development is a  universal law; all countries are subject to it. Moreover, the  party and the government have taken full notice of the gap  between the eastern and western regions, and are adopting  measures to solve it.    If the concern over the imbalanced development between  regions in China and the contradictions between local interests  triggered off by reforms are good-intentioned, we can understand  these kinds of concerns. If, however, there are people with  hostile intentions or hopes, who even assert that the imbalanced  development between the eastern and western parts inevitably  will "divide" China, banking on the appearance of internal  problems in China, then their wishes will never come true.  <H3>  Theoretical Foundations and Organizational Guarantee for  Modernization </H3>   [Zhou] In 1993, the world began to look at China with new  eyes. What do you think are the main reasons for this?    [Li] The fundamental reason was the enormous progress in  China's reform and opening up, and its economic construction  under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics.    A few years ago, amid the violent changes in Eastern Europe  and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, someone in the world  was spreading the theory of "China toppling." Facts have shown  that China not only has not toppled, but has grown stronger.  Now many economists, commentators, and even politicians around  the world are making far more optimistic estimates and  predictions than our own regarding China's economic power and  prospects. Despite their incongruence from the real situation,  in a way they reflect the world's recognition of China's  achievements.    Now, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's whole set of theories about  socialism with Chinese characteristics has taken full shape and  has demonstrated its enormous power in practice. Meanwhile, the  third- generation collective leadership, with Jiang Zemin as the  core, has been formed and is maturing. Thus, our modernization  effort is not only blessed with a theoretical foundation, but  with also an organizational guarantee. Today, we are more  confident than ever in China's future.    It should be pointed out, however, that once again there  are ill-intentioned people in the world spreading the theory of  the "China threat" in an attempt to sow discord between China  and its neighbors and to undermine the good relations between  China and the surrounding countries. From "China toppling" to  the "China threat" is a complete U-turn, and as such is  mystifying. Both these extremes reflect ignorance of the  realities of China. A strong and developing China will pose no  threat to any country; it will only contribute more to world  peace and development.  <H5>  China's Foreign Relations Will Further Expand in 1994 </H5>   [Zhou] How will China develop its diplomacy in the present  international situation?    [Li] With the coming of 1994, the world enters the third  year  since the Cold War. Generally speaking, there is an aspect in  the international situation which is easing up, and the world is  developing in the direction of multipolarization. On the other  hand, there are still many destabilizing factors in the world.  The two major themes -- peace and development -- have yet to be  resolved.    In the turbulent and unstable world, Asia -- and especially  East Asia -- has maintained relative stability and sustained  economic development. This is one important feature in the  current international situation. It can be foreseen that in the  new year East Asia will further strengthen its status and  influence in the world.    It also can be foreseen that China's international status  will rise further, its foreign relations further expanding.  Specifically, China's overall relations with European countries  are expected to see notable improvements. The meeting between  the Chinese and U.S. heads of state supplied a good opportunity.  It is possible to achieve new development in Sino-U.S.  relations. Facts have proved that there are wide-ranging common  interests between China and the Western countries, which are the  foundation for developing ties between them.  <H5>  Common Efforts at Peacefully Unifying the Motherland </H5>   [Zhou] What are your New Year expectations for Hong Kong,  Macao, and Taiwan compatriots and for overseas Chinese?    [Li] With the coming of 1994, the dates when Hong Kong and  Macao return to the motherland draw even closer. Whatever  happens, we will have the ability to restore sovereignty over  Hong Kong as scheduled, to uphold the principle of "one country,  two systems" and the Basic Law, and to maintain Hong Kong's  long-term prosperity and stability. The economies of Hong Kong  and Macao now are linked closely with that of the mainland. As  the mainland economy develops, the economies of Hong Kong and  Macao will grow increasingly prosperous.    Peaceful unification is the direction of the general trend  and is what people desire. Attempts at "two Chinas," one China,  one Taiwan" or "one country, two governments" run counter the  historical trend and go against the common wish and fundamental  interest of the Chinese people on both sides of the strait. We  hope the Taiwan authorities will place the great national cause  above all else and will do more practical things for the  reunification and prosperity of the motherland.    I believe all the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots  and all the overseas Chinese are descendants of the Chinese  race. A strong Chinese nation is our common wish. In the new  year we all should continue to work for this.</p>

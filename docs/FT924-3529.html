			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Tories surprised by secrecy tally THE PROCESS of British government is more secretive than the Conservative party thought - nearly four times so, to be more precise. That is one conclusion from the review of statutory restrictions on information disclosure being undertaken in accordance with an election pledge. The Tories promised to review the '80 or so' such restrictions. The harder they look, the more curbs they find. About 280 have been unearthed, and they are still counting. The review is to be one of the subjects of a government report on freedom-of-information issues to be published - probably in the form of a white paper - early next year.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Support agency for Tecs urged TRAINING and Enterprise Councils were urged yesterday by the government to form an umbrella body to deal with national providers of training. The 82 Tecs in England and Wales negotiate individually with training providers including retail chains and organisations such as the Construction Industry Training Board. Before Tecs were set up two years ago, such providers dealt with the National Providers Unit. Some have stopped providing training places because of the administrative difficulties of dealing with several Tecs.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> PEOPLE: CETUS' CHIEF QUITS AFTER FDA SPURNS KEY DRUG  </P> <P> Cetus Corp.'s outspoken president and chief executive, Robert A. Fildes,  resigned Thursday, less than a month after a Food and Drug Administration panel  recommended against approval of the company's crucial anti-cancer drug.  </P> <P> Chairman Ronald E. Cape, who relinquished the CEO title to Fildes in 1986, was  again named to the post, the Emeryville, Calif.-based biotechnology company  said in a statement. Also, Hollings C. Renton, chief operating officer, was  given the additional title of president. Cetus also said it was reducing its  work force by about 10% to cut costs, laying off about 100 of 950 people.  </P> <P> Neither Fildes nor Cape was available for comment Thursday. Renton declined to  elaborate on a company statement that said the resignation resulted from  "differing views regarding the company's priorities." He acknowledged that the  company is looking at strategic changes that would include forming more  marketing and research alliances with others in the industry.  </P> <P> However, some analysts said they believe that the delay in approval of  Proleukin interleukin-2 was a major factor. "As head of the company, (Fildes)  was ultimately responsible for overseeing the clinical strategy and oversight  of regulatory affairs," said David Webber, a New York based-analyst with Alex.  Brown &amp; Sons of Baltimore.  </P> <P> Cetus is one of the nation's oldest and best-known biotechnology companies, but  it has been hemorrhaging red ink since 1987. And, in the years when it was on  the plus side during the decade, it was barely profitable. It has focused much  of its attention recently on drugs to fight cancer and infectious disease.  </P> <P> U.S. approval of interleukin-2 is "pivotal to getting Cetus to profitability,"  said analyst Margaret B. McGeorge of San Francisco-based Sutro &amp; Co.  Although everyone knew that making the case for approval of interleukin-2 would  be a challenge, many thought Cetus' presentation was nevertheless a  "disappointment," she said.  </P> <P> Cetus' drug has been approved for the treatment of kidney cancer only in  Denmark and the Netherlands. The FDA panel recommended that the company conduct  further studies to more specifically identify which patients would benefit from  the highly toxic drug, which has serious side effects -- such as massive fluid  retention -- that can lead to temporary heart or kidney failure.  </P> <P> Cetus' data showed that kidney tumors shrank to about half their normal size in  about 15% of patients treated with the drug. In about 4% of the patients, the  tumors disappeared altogether. But most of the treated patients showed no  effect from treatment, and many suffered side effects. About 4% died of  complications from the drug.  </P> <P> Analyst Robert Kupor of New York-based Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. agreed that  the FDA panel's decision hurt Fildes. And "his highly intemperate comments"  accusing the FDA of bias against the company didn't help his case, Kupor said.  However, he added, "his position was probably imperiled considerably before  that because of the overall condition of the company, which the CEO must take  responsibility for."  </P> <P> Kupor said Fildes, a London-born research scientist who had held posts at other  pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, was brought in, in 1982, to turn Cetus  around at a time when it had a "dreadful reputation for slowness and  unproductivity." It was inevitable that Fildes would leave after 8 years of  little improvement, he added.  </P></p>

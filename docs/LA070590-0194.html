			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 400 TREATED FOR HEAT ILLNESS AT NEW KIDS SHOW  </P> <P> About 400 children were treated for heat exhaustion and hyperventilation after  waiting for hours in the sun to see the group the New Kids on the Block.  </P> <P> About 35,000 youngsters streamed onto Harriet Island for a concert Wednesday.  </P> <P> Many waited more than eight hours with little food and drink in hopes of  getting a good view of the popular performers.  </P> <P> Police estimate that about 4,000 teen-agers entered the gates at 11 a.m., and  about 20,000 had arrived by 3 p.m. Opening groups began playing for the crowd  at 7 p.m., and the New Kids took the stage at 9:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Although the temperature was only in the upper 70s, the crowded conditions  apparently contributed to the problem.  </P> <P> "It was so hot out there, and the only time you could breathe fresh air was  when a breeze blew over. It was so crowded," said Angela Frank, 15, of Cloquet.  </P> <P> Terri Nelson, who worked as coordinator of the Red Cross tent, said there was a  steady flow of visitors. Five people required hospitalization, authorities  said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These provisions further two consistent goals. Opportunities for competition in the PC operating system market are fostered by a rapid end to the unlawful practices embodied in existing licenses. At the same time, the transition rules avoid creating hardships for OEMs by not unnecessarily disrupting established commercial relationships with Microsoft. Indeed, OEMs are not required to terminate or amend their existing contracts with Microsoft; the choice to do so is theirs alone. Microsoft, however, may not enforce the per processor or minimum commitment features of any existing contract. Providing OEMs with this choice minimizes the costs of the transition from existing license agreements that are inconsistent with the decree to new license agreements, while ensuring that any unavoidable transition costs be borne largely by Microsoft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that existing licensees learn of their rights under the proposed Final Judgment, Section IV (M) requires Microsoft to provide a copy of the Final Judgment to all OEMs with which it has license agreements, except for those who have licenses only under Microsoft's Small Volume Easy Distribution program or the Delivery Service Partner program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Non-Disclosure Agreements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the proposed Final Judgment contains provisions that prevent Microsoft from imposing unlawfully restrictive NDAs on developers of applications software. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections IV(K)(l) limits the duration of any NDA to the earliest of (a) the commercial release of the product covered by the NDA, (b) an earlier public disclosure of the information covered by the NDA, or (c) one year after the information is disclosed to the person subject to the NDA. Section IV(K)(2) provides that NDAs may not restrict subject parties from developing software products that will run on competing operating systems, if such development does not entail the use or disclosure of Microsoft proprietary information during the term of the NDA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In combination, these provisions recognize that whatever Microsoft's legitimate interest in protecting the confidentiality of proprietary information covered by the NDAs, the need for any such protection must be balanced against the competitive consequences of any restriction imposed on others concerning disclosure and use of the information. The proposed Final Judgment ensures that any NDA imposed by Microsoft will not extend beyond the point that the information has been released to the public or has otherwise been in the hands of parties for more than one year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV(L) requires that the form of all standard NDAs must be approved by a Microsoft corporate officer, and that non-standard language in an NDA relating to matters covered in Section (K) must be approved by a Microsoft senior attorney. These provisions are designed to ensure that NDAs will be reviewed by company officials mindful of the requirements of the Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Enforcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section V of the proposed Final Judgment establishes standards and procedures by which the Department of Justice may obtain access to documents and information from Microsoft related to its compliance with the Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In particular, Section V(D) contains provisions under which the Department can obtain information and documents relating to any Undertaking by or Decision against Microsoft arising from parallel antitrust proceedings of the Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission (``DG&hyph;IV''). This provision will allow the Department to coordinate its monitoring and enforcement of compliance of the Final Judgment with DG&hyph;IV's monitoring and enforcement of parallel provisions contained in an Undertaking with DG&hyph;IV signed by Microsoft on July 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

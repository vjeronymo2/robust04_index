			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Israel accepts direct talks with PLO on Mideast peace ISRAEL will for the first time hold face-to-face talks with negotiators openly representing the Palestine Liberation Organisation when the next round of the Middle East peace process opens in Washington, probably at the end of this month. The Israeli government's resistance to direct talks with the PLO finally crumbled yesterday. Members of Mr Yitzhak Rabin's cabinet confirmed that Israel would continue the negotiations despite the decision by PLO leaders in Tunis to appoint seven members of the Palestinian peace talks delegation to an official PLO leadership committee. All parties to the talks have been invited by the US and Russia, the joint sponsors, to resume talks on August 30, but the Arab response will not be known until later this month. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, claimed yesterday that the appointments of key Palestinian negotiators - including Mr Faisal Husseini, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi and Mr Haider Abdel Shafi - to the PLO committee was of little significance. 'For us, it doesn't matter,' he said. 'It's the same members of the delegation, the same names, the same people, the same procedure.' But Israel's decision not to protest about the appointments and to resume talks with Palestinians now formally part of the PLO leadership constitutes a marked change in policy. The previous Israeli government, led by the hardline Likud party, agreed to talk directly only to Palestinians who had no formal PLO role. 'We tried to build a wall between Palestinian residents of the territories and PLO Tunis (where the organisation is based),' Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the former prime minister, recalled yesterday. 'This government has destroyed the wall.' Earlier this week, when Mr Husseini, Mrs Ashrawi and a third Palestinian negotiator, Mr Saeb Erakat, threatened to resign from the peace delegation in protest at their limited influence over policy positions, Mr Rabin warned Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, not to consider replacing them with PLO figures. By keeping the delegation intact but giving its members official PLO status, Mr Arafat appears to have outmanoeuvred Mr Rabin, who would clearly rather swallow the change and play down its importance than risk torpedoeing the direct talks. Most Israelis probably share Mr Shamir's belief, expressed yesterday, that the PLO remains 'a terrorist organisation' bent on Israel's destruction. But they have also witnessed the rise of the radical Hamas Islamic fundamentalist movement in the occupied territories. Many have realised, along with Mr Rabin, that it might be better to sit down now with PLO leaders pressing for a state alongside Israel than risk the PLO's replacement by Hamas leaders openly pledged to wiping Israel off the map.</p>

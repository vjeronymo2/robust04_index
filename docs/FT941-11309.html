			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Thai Military Bank nets Bt2bn Thai Military Bank (TMB), one-third owned by Thailand's armed forces, yesterday announced a 58 per cent rise in net profit to Bt2.85bn (Dollars 112m) last year from Bt1.80bn in 1992. TMB's profits rose more sharply than those of other leading banks such as Bangkok Bank, Siam Commercial Bank and Thai Farmers Bank, but some analysts believe TMB will not be large enough to compete effectively against its rivals as the Thai financial sector is liberalised and opened more to foreign banks. Siam City Bank reported a 68 per cent rise in its net profit to Bt1.98bn in 1993 from Bt1.17bn the previous year. The two banks have yet to divulge further details of their results.</p>

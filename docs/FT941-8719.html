			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Major steers clear of pitfalls in Moscow: How Number 10's new press secretary managed overseas There was an air of quiet celebration in 10 Downing Street yesterday. Mr John Major's three-day visit to Moscow may not have been the most exciting of events. But nor had it been, like most previous trips, a disaster. The Westminster journalists who have dogged and disrupted the prime minister on earlier ventures abroad came home late on Wednesday night more or less empty-handed. There were occasional mishaps for Mr Major in Moscow. The tabloids mocked his appearance in a Russian fur hat. The television cameras caught him looking awkwardly unsure of himself during an official dinner with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. But this was nothing compared with the string of disasters that accompanied his Far East tour last autumn. The agenda then had been set entirely by the press and Mr Major had been bombarded about the divisions and unrest in the Conservative party. He was provoked into a series of intemperate attacks on his critics and the resultant headlines were universally bad. In Moscow it was different, although the government is still beset by domestic trouble. Just before his departure another junior member of the government was obliged to resign because of personal conduct. The back-to-basics initiative has been reduced to a shambles. But on this occasion Mr Major decided to set his own terms for contacts with the travelling press - which dominate news coverage of such visits. He decided from the outset that he would not be harried by the inevitable questions about domestic difficulties. In interviews and press conferences during the trip he politely rebuffed questions on back to basics or the sexual proclivities of members of his government. There were no angry outbursts, no ill-judged answers. Instead Mr Major insisted on talking about the issues behind his Moscow talks - the situation in Bosnia, Anglo-Russian relations and the stalling pace of economic reform in Russia. Much of the credit for the careful news management was given to Mr Christopher Meyer, the prime minister's newly appointed press secretary. On his first foreign trip Mr Meyer was determined to maintain control of the press. So he mixed blunt warnings that the prime minister would not respond to questions about back to basics with a carefully timed flow of 'news nuggets' to keep the media - and especially the tabloid newspapers - occupied. By and large it worked. Mr Major's own attitude may have been the critical factor. After enduring the worst press of any prime minister since Mr Harold Wilson in 1968, Mr Major appeared ready to take the advice of his ministerial colleagues and officials to inject distance and formality into his links with journalists. Hence there were none of the off-the-cuff conversations which have previously got him into so much trouble. His appearances were carefully controlled and always tape-recorded by aides. Having succeeded in Moscow, Mr Major, with the help of Mr Meyer, is promising more of the same when he meets President Bill Clinton for a potentially difficult meeting in Washington in 10 days. The prime minister knows he cannot afford to provide the excuse that critics are looking for to pronounce the death of the special relationship. Some are already suggesting his relations with Mr Clinton are as brusque as those between Mr Neil Kinnock, then Labour leader, and former president Ronald Reagan during the 1980s. On the evidence of Moscow, Mr Major should succeed. He certainly needs to. The domestic pressures on his premiership over the next few months will be bad enough even without any more accidents abroad.</p>

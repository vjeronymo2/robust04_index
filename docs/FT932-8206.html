			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Brazil awards pay rises to military BRAZILIAN President Itamar Franco and the country's military chiefs issued a joint communique yesterday, warning that 'democracy cannot be allowed to commit suicide'. This arose from a four-hour meeting to discuss dissatisfaction in the military over pay and conditions, as well as the country's worsening social problems and a recent surge of regional separatist threats. The chiefs of the three armed services repeated demands for the military to be put on the same pay scale as the legislature and the judiciary. They claim that Brazil's military spending amounts to the equivalent of Dollars 3 per head, compared to Dollars 27 in Bolivia and Dollars 17 in Argentina. The air force commander says that his service cannot even afford fuel. Worried by increasing talk of agitation among the military, which prompted the meeting, Mr Franco had little choice but to accede, at least in part, to their demands. He seems to have promised a 97 per cent wage increase (Brazil's inflation is about 30 per cent a month) and funds to modernise equipment. The communique explained: 'Democracy is a delicate plant requiring careful attention if it is not to wither.' It also stressed the role of the Brazilian armed forces: 'Ethnic conflicts in Europe, disputes for control of strategic areas, and the formation of economic blocs mean that large countries such as Brazil, rich in natural resources, must make greater efforts to defend their territorial and political sovereignty.' Reuter adds from Braslia: A left-wing member of Brazil's cabinet said last night she had been fired by President Franco. Ms Luiza Erundina, administration secretary, is a former mayor of Sao Paulo.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Flexibility on pensions is resisted THE GOVERNMENT is resisting pressure from the pensions industry for a flexible 'decade of retirement' as the method for equalising male and female state retirement ages. Ministers seem likely to announce this year that the age at which women become eligible for a state pension will rise from 60 to either 63 or 65 some time after the year 2000. The appointment last week of Mr Peter Lilley, a rightwinger and former Treasury minister, as social security secretary aroused speculation that he might bow to Treasury pressure. Other European Community countries are moving towards higher retirement ages. The Department of Social Security, which published a paper on equalising retirement ages last December, has made clear that lowering men's retirement age to 60 is unlikely as it would cost an estimated Pounds 3.5bn a year. A common retirement age of 63 would save the government about Pounds 500m a year, although the Treasury may seek a mutual retirement age of 65, expected to save at least Pounds 3bn a year. The move to equalise pension ages follows a ruling from the European Court in 1990 that the present system of allowing women to retire at 60 with a full pension while requiring men to work until 65 is discriminatory. Last December the DSS put forward proposals to equalise state retirement benefits. The proposals clearly favoured equalisation at 63. The proposals were roundly criticised by the pensions industry because much of British industry has been moving to adopt flexible retirement schemes. In 1989 a House of Lords committee urged a 'decade of retirement' which would give more choice to pensioners and to employers. Employers prefer flexibility because it enables them to keep experienced workers on the payroll. In a flexible scheme, those who retire at 60 earn pensions based on a lower salary, while those who work longer can earn more. Pensions experts have said a national retirement age at 63, or even 65, would make flexibility in private schemes impossible. Ministers are said to believe privately that a flexible scheme would discriminate against blue-collar workers, who often have no occupational scheme to supplement state benefits and who thus have to work longer. Meanwhile, white-collar workers could retire comfortably at 60. Also, ministers are said to have been concerned at the difficulties in funding a flexible retirement scheme. Because UK pensions are paid out of the National Insurance contributions of current workers, any increase in pensions means higher taxes for employees. Because of the difficulty in predicting how many people would retire in any one year, taxes would have to be raised to assume a worst-case scenario in which all eligible 60-year-olds chose to retire.</p>

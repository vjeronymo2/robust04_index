			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Talks pressure and finances divide PLO: The turmoil on the Palestinian side before negotiations resume A FINANCIAL crisis in the Palestinian Liberation Organisation combined with divisions about what, if any, concessions to make to Israel, have left the Palestinians floundering as they prepare for a further round of talks with Israel in Washington next week. Analysts say the turmoil is the result of soul searching about the need, under increasing Arab and international pressure, to make compromises to reach a deal with Israel. Negotiations have yielded nothing in 22 months and conditions in the Israeli-occupied territories have deteriorated. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the PLO for 25 years, was yesterday confronted with revolt within the movement over his authoritarian leadership style and his management of the crisis. Two members of the 18-strong PLO executive committee have resigned in the past week and there have been calls for Mr Arafat to stand down. In Amman yesterday Mr Arafat dismissed any talk of crisis but he is expected to feel the heat at a meeting of the executive committee in Tunis today. His critics have concentrated their fire on two related problems: the financial crisis caused by PLO backing of Iraq in the Gulf war and Mr Arafat's apparent willingness, without consultation, to make concessions to Israel. After the PLO supported Saddam Hussein in 1991, Gulf states suspended millions of dollars of direct financial aid to the PLO and expelled hundreds of thousands of Palestinian guest workers who sent 7 per cent of their salaries to the organisation. The PLO has cut its annual budget from Dollars 320m (Pounds 215m) to Dollars 140m in the past two years. It has had to close offices and newspapers, delay salaries and monthly gratuities to more than 39,000 employees and dependants and suspend funding of universities, hospitals, municipalities and scholarships in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip. Meanwhile, Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said yesterday that the delegation to the Washington talks would be reduced from 25 to 12 because of the financial crisis. At a time of mounting criticism the PLO cannot buy political support by spreading cash around the occupied-territories and risks being outspent by the Iranian-funded Hamas, which is rapidly developing a network of social services. The financial crunch also strengthens the hands of Arab states which will continue to use the carrot of a resumption of financial support as a means of forcing the PLO to make more concessions. These money problems, combined with what opponents say is Mr Arafat's desire to strike a deal in his lifetime, have pushed the 64-year-old leader towards compromise. Critics say his willingness to make concessions is evident in his keen acceptance of the 'Gaza-Jericho option' - a proposal that provides for the immediate assumption of Palestinian authority in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho leaving the rest of the West Bank under some form of interim self-government. In return Mr Arafat might be willing to make compromises on control over occupied Arab East Jerusalem during the interim phase - the current sticking point in peace talks. Mr Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and a long-time critic of Mr Arafat, said the PLO chairman had agreed to the proposal after being promised Dollars 700m in aid from the US, Japan and European countries. Mr Arafat's enthusiasm for the Gaza-Jericho option has drawn the lines of debate. The proposal is supported by some peace negotiators from the territories anxious for a deal which will address the conditions of Palestinians living under occupation. But it is opposed by many PLO stalwarts. PLO officials said the resignation last week of Mr Mahmud Darwish was partly an act of protest against Mr Arafat's willingness to make concessions which would leave parts of the West Bank under Israeli control. And Mr Shafiq al-Hoot, who withdrew from the executive committee at the weekend, said Mr Arafat was going beyond policy 'red lines' for peace talks with Israel. The pressures on Mr Arafat, one of the greatest survivors in Arab politics, are coming from all sides. This time many Palestinians believe 'the old man' will have to give up some of his coveted powers and allow a more democratic leadership capable of nudging the disparate PLO factions towards acceptance of the hard realities of making peace with Israel.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Galip Ridvanoglu] </F>   [Text] Diyarbakir-The two, Khaki colored, convertible Land  Rovers sped past our bus heading towards Mardin. Four villagers  were seated on top of one of the vehicles among heavily armed  gendarmerie soldiers. As we watched them go by we noticed their  hands were tied behind their backs. But they could not see us,  for their eyes were covered with rags. Blindfolded, they were  clearly being taken for interrogation.    Heading towards one of the seven makeshift refugee camps set  up in northern Iraq to accommodate some 12,000 refugees, our  group which was escorting a delegation from the Turkish Human  rights Association was constantly accompanied by the sound of  blasts coming down from the mountains.    Explosions could be heard from miles away, signalling a new  operation. Perhaps there will a new communique from the  Governor's office on yet another victory against militants of  the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).    The explosions, however, are also being attributed to other  things. At the Association branch office in Diyarbakir, a wall  gazette is full of pictures. Pictures of burned down and  destroyed houses. Pictures of civilians with bodies covered  with bruises and burn marks.    Asking the local activists on what they are, we get a blunt  reply, "the houses are those which have been destroyed by  security forces. The people are those who have been tortured."  About 12,000 people living along the border have already fled  into northern Iraq where they are scattered in seven separate  camps. Everyone is scared.    Among the scared are human rights activists. Association  Chairman Akin Birdal suggests we move together and eat in the  same place. "To avoid mystery killings," he explains.    On the first day of the fact-finding mission, a decision is  taken to keep the group together and "avoid complications."  Numbering around 30 people and made up of human rights  activists and journalists, our group headed for the border some  300 kilometers away. Stopped ten times at security check points  along the road, we are constantly surrounded by the remains of  petroleum tankers.    Following the Gulf War, the road has been empty. There is  hardly any traffic now and the sanctions on Iraq have hurt the  local economy most.    A police officer explains, "this situation has helped the  PKK. Most of the unemployed youngsters are now heading for the  mountains." Custom officials tell us that two to three thousand  trucks were crossing the border before the sanctions. Now, even  the customs crossing point is empty. "If things go on this way,  the whole region will be empty," one customs official interjects.    Immediately on the other side of the border we are greeted  by  a Kurdish border policeman. "Welcome to Kurdistan," he says,  standing before a signpost saying the same thing.    Close to the border post is the vast mountain of Cudi which  ranges from Turkey into Iraq and has been used over the years as  a crossing point by PKK militants. Mount Cudi is smoking.  "Turkish planes hit it again this morning" one Peshmerge  explains.    In Zakho about 200 Turkish Kurds are on hunger strike. "They  are bombing our villages," a middle age villager says. "We want  to live like human beings," he adds.    The delegation then moves on to a camp where about 2,000  refugees who have fled Turkey are housed. Despite previous  statements by Turkey that the migration is only a PKK ploy, the  first thing which attracts our attention is the crowded number  of women and children.    The situation in the Sheranishe and Beheri camps just on the  slopes of the Zerkan mountains astonishes members of the  delegation. Suddenly there are too many people. More than  10,000 villagers are now there and about half of them are  children. Complaints are similar. Stories are almost  identical. Some complain of being forced to join the village  guards and losing their villages when they refused. Others say  their settlements were bombed. The most common complaints are  related to health and nutrition problems. There is a demand for  more assistance from the United Nations.    "We were forces to move here because of the security  operations," explains an elderly man. "They bombed and  destroyed our villages."    Following the visit to three separate camps, a Turkish  officer at the Habur border gate tells us there are 4,000 PKK  terrorists on Mount Cudi. "We are conducting operations on the  mountain every day," he says. "We have no day or night. It is  very difficult."    In the evening, we hear cannons pounding the mountain once  again. Members of the delegation go silent as they listen. The  roads at night are still dangerous. Nothing goes by but for  military vehicles. Most officers insist we do not continue.  "It is too dangerous," one of them says. It is in contrast to  official statements made back in Ankara that Turkey has full  control throughout the region.    At one military post, where we are hosted while waiting for  a  fully equipped escort convoy, we chat with officers. They  believe the problem in the Southeast can only be solved through  peaceful methods.    One officer says they have identified 2,500 PKK militants in  Mardin by name. "But in the past two years, we could only get  some of them. People forced to migrate are joining the  organization."    Another officer interjects, "peaceful methods are a must."  Two of the four villagers on the Landrover are elderly and in  no way do they resemble terrorists. Members of the delegation  are in pain, knowing they cannot do anything. Two women on the  bus wipe away their tears. If the villagers are crying as well,  there is no way to know. Their eyes are blindfolded. They  cannot even see that someone cares.    These days, the scene everywhere in the southeast is  similar.  There is only military traffic on the roads at night. During  the day, one can easily hear the blades of helicopters chopping  through the air. Echoes of faraway explosions can be heard.  And now, becoming a part of the natural scene, is the smoke.  The mountains of the Southeast are smoking....</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: George Weston sees higher 1995 earnings George Weston, the Canadian food distribution, forest products and fisheries group controlled by the Weston family, improved earnings in the first nine months and sees further gains in 1995, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Third-quarter net profit was CDollars 34.7m (USDollars 25.3m), or 74 cents a share, up from CDollars 21.1m, or 45 cents, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 3.85bn against CDollars 3.55bn. Nine-month profit was CDollars 71.6m, or CDollars 1.52 a share, up from CDollars 50.6m, or CDollars 1.08, on revenues of CDollars 9.8bn against CDollars 9.06bn. Mr Galen Weston, chairman, said food processing and distribution were improving margins, fisheries were turning round, and pulp and paper operations were now profitable. He said that while Weston's return on equity was still well below normal, the company looked forward to better results again in 1995.</p>

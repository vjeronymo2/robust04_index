			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Commenting on President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to  Egypt, AL-BA'TH says: President Hafiz al-Asad's talks with  President Husni Mubarak have attracted much attention in the  Arab nation and the world. The reason for this is the current  situation in the region and that of the peace process. The  peace process is still at square one because of the intransigent  Israeli position.    AL-BA'TH notes that the two presidents discussed  developments  in the Arab arena, the peace process, and the obstacles placed  by Israel in the wayh of peace.    The Arabs, Syria in particular, have done everything  possible, in line with the resolutions of international  legitimacy, so the peace process will achieve its objectives.  President Mubarak has stressed that the Geneva summit between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton gave great momentum to  the peace process. However, the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  obstructed this process.    AL-BA'TH concludes: Israel does not want peace. It only  seeks agreements, such as the Gaza-Jericho accord, because such  agreements achieve its dreams. At any rate, Syria will continue  to work seriously to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in  the region, but for peace to prevail Syria must restore its  territory in full.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Initial Report" by Supreme Electoral Tribunal, TSE, read </F> by unidentified TSE official--broadcast in progress]    [Text] ...participating in the elections we have  witnessed. No one can deny the atmosphere of calm surrounding  the elections. We must cite the absolute freedom, without  coercion or pressure of any sort, the voters enjoyed as they  exercised their sacred right and duty of voting.    We must also admit there are certain aspects that are  outside  human control; in this regard, we must admit at certain polling  stations the opening of the elections was delayed for a few  minutes due to difficulties stemming from the election of  station presidents and secretaries at 0600, as required by law.  Such stations are comprised of representatives of all political  parties participating in the elections.    Moreover, we must admit some citizens who had voter  registration cards did not appear on the voter registration  list. This will be noted, and, as the TSE, we will adopt  corrective measures.    After the last municipal council election in [word  indistinct] in 1991 a company specializing in polls conducted  one indicating 10 percent of 1 percent--that is, a tenth of 1  percent--of the voters claimed to have been left off the voter  registration list; thus, we will be able to determine this  figure after the elections. We will be able to quantify this.    We want to underscore a very important aspect regarding  compliance with Electoral Code provisions. I will read Article  230, Paragraph Two. It reads: Fifteen days prior to the  elections and until the results of it are definitely declared,  no political parties or coalitions, individuals or corporations,  associations or organizations of any nature may publish or  disseminate, via any medium, results of polls or projections on  candidates, political parties, or contending coalitions that  might indicate the trend of possible electoral results. Failure  to abide by this will be punished in keeping with Article 290 of  the Electoral Code, which states: Violation of the provisions  of Article 230 of this code will result in the levying of fines  between 10,000 and 50,000 colones on the violators.    This is the legal situation. The TSE will enforce these  provisions, and thus, we warn all media to abstain from making  these kinds of publications banned by the code; in fact, this is  not only banned by the code. The candidates and political party  representatives have signed a document before the president of  the Republic, UN Observers for El Salvador, and the TSE. Part  of it states the following: We will abstain from reporting on  the results of the elections until the TSE issues the  corresponding reports.    Now that this has been clarified, we warn the media may not  report anything banned by law; thus, the Salvadoran people are  duly informed of the aspects we have cited. We also want to  note that, according to the same pact the political parties have  signed, the closing of the elections will occur after every  voter waiting to cast his vote has done so. This is of what  this tribunal wished to inform you to avoid regrettable  incidents later.</p>

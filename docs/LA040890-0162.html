			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DISMANTLING OF IRON CURTAIN SETS STAGE FOR AN OVERHAUL IN AUSTRIA;  </P> <P> FOREIGN POLICY: VIENNA TAKES ITS ROLE AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN EAST AND WEST  SERIOUSLY. BUT A TOP PRIORITY IS NOT TO BE SHUT OUT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY  AFTER 1992.  </P> <P> The collapse of Communist rule in Eastern Europe is stirring hopes and fears in  Austria, which for nearly 40 years has seen itself as a neutral bridge between  East and West.  </P> <P> The hope for new economic and cultural opportunities as the artificial postwar  barriers dissolve is tempered by fears among Austrians of an unmanageable  influx from their eastern neighbors.  </P> <P> The government is also weighing how the reshaping of the Continent's economic  map will affect its own top foreign policy objective -- steering Austria into  the European Community.  </P> <P> Chancellor Franz Vranitsky reflected the optimistic school of thought in an  ebullient New Year message to his 7.5 million countrymen.  </P> <P> "In one stroke, the expression 'country in the heart of Europe' does not just  have a geographic sense but gains a political, economic and cultural  dimension," he declared.  </P> <P> However, he rejected the idea that Austria might be some form of political  hermaphrodite.  </P> <P> "It is often said Austria lies politically between East and West. That is  false. In a political sense Austria belongs to the West," he said.  </P> <P> Economically it does, too, with trade dominated by exchanges with West Germany.  </P> <P> Although Vienna and the Czech city of Bratislava were once linked by a tram  line, the Austrian capital has become effectively the terminus of West European  rail and road links.  </P> <P> Austria is the only country from which Soviet troops actually withdrew after  World War II and, unlike Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, it has  maintained its multiparty democracy, free press and largely private economy.  </P> <P> Last year the government applied to join the European Community, which it  considers vital if it is not to be shut out of the single European Community  market after 1992.  </P> <P> But, reflecting a line in the national anthem that the country is "like a  strong heart at the center of the region," it has taken its pivotal role  seriously.  </P> <P> Austria is the host for several East-West security conferences, a United  Nations headquarters and other institutions and it is arranging -- with Hungary  -- a World Exhibition in 1995.  </P> <P> Peter Michael Lingens, publisher of the weekly magazine Wochenpresse, spoke of  a potential for Viennese culture to recapture the glories of the  Austro-Hungarian Empire, when it drew inspiration from Prague and Budapest.  </P> <P> The end of Communist control and opening up of borders across the region "offer  us the greatest opportunities since the collapse of the monarchy (in 1918)," he  said.  </P> <P> "Not because, as some people may imagine, we could again become the center of a  great world empire but because Austria could re-emerge as a cultural power in  the world," once again drawing on its diverse roots across the region.  </P> <P> While political commentators waxed lyrical about the chances for the Alpine  state, the response within the overwhelmingly bourgeois society, which has  grown rich while its Communist neighbors languished, has been ambivalent.  </P> <P> As tens of thousands of Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Poles and East Germans  took advantage of new freedoms to take a peek inside the well-stocked stores of  Vienna's consumer society, many in the capital became defensive and possessive.  </P> <P> An opinion poll showed that 63% of Viennese found the peaceful invasion across  the dismantled Iron Curtain unwelcome and only 22% said they felt good about  it.  </P> <P> Warm-hearted gestures to offer free transportation and theater tickets to their  less well-off Eastern visitors drew angry protests from some Viennese, who  complained of discrimination.  </P> <P> "It is well known that we don't exactly have a great sensitivity for historic  moments," said public opinion researcher Rudolf Bretschneider.  </P> <P> Although the Vienna telephone directory is dominated by non-German names and  many of the city's 1.5 million people are themselves refugees from Communist  countries, resentment toward foreigners from the East is always near the  surface.  </P> <P> A Polish woman in her 30s who has lived in Vienna for more than four years was  told sharply by a native Viennese during a dispute over a parking place: "Go  back to your homeland."  </P> <P> A special Cabinet session on the anti-Communist revolution at Austria's  northern, southern and eastern borders confirmed that the country should retain  its role as a transit and asylum country but tighten its checks on illegal  workers.  </P> <P> Many politicians, including Vranitsky, believe that Austria, with its stability  and economic success, could be taken as a model by the East Bloc states as they  rebuild their economies.  </P> <P> "We, too, had to start from nothing (after World War II), and today we receive  general recognition and respect for our neutrality, our political freedom, our  economic success and our social security system," the chancellor said.  </P> <P> Other commentators, such as veteran conservative politician Erhard Busek, who  has long cultivated central European links, was more cautious.  </P> <P> Although Busek saw an opportunity for Austria to assert itself as a key player  in the heart of Europe, he warned of the danger of the German-speaking country  being viewed as "a third German state" or an historic part of the German  nation.  </P> <P> He also referred to half-joking assessments that Austria, much of whose heavy  industry and banking is at least part state-owned, could itself become "the  last East Bloc country" if it did not bring in economic and political reforms.  </P> <P> He mentioned specifically the immense social and economic power of the two big  political parties -- the Socialists and the conservative People's Party -- and  the monopoly of the state broadcasting system.  </P></p>

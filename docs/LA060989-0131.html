			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> UCI STAFF TO HELP WITH COLON CANCER SCREENING  </P> <P> Physicians at UC Irvine will donate their time to provide low-cost colon cancer  screening to the public to promote early detection of the disease, which is  highly curable in the beginning stages.  </P> <P> The screening program uses a technique called flexible sigmoidoscopy, which  uses fiber optics to visualize the lower third of the colon, where about 60% of  cancers occur. Patients or their insurance companies will be charged only for  the cost of facilities, testing and materials required for screening.  </P> <P> Individuals over 50 have the highest risk of developing colon cancer, which  strikes about 6% of the U.S. population, according to Dr. Daniel Hollander,  head of gastroenterology at the UCI College of Medicine and director of the  screening program. Over-the-counter colon cancer tests have a high  false-negative rate and often fail to detect cancer in the early stages, he  said.  </P> <P> For information, call (714) 856-8600 or the UCI Medical Center gastroenterology  diagnostic laboratory at (714) 634-5688.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOXING;  </P> <P> STARLING, HAVING LOST TITLE, SAYS HE'LL RETIRE  </P> <P> Marlon Starling, who lost his World Boxing Council welterweight title to  Maurice Blocker on Sunday, said the fight will be his last.  </P> <P> "I quit," Starling said Monday from a Reno, Nev., hospital bed.  </P> <P> "I retire. It's over."  </P> <P> Friends and advisers of Starling, a Hartford native, said they believe the  two-time world champion is serious about retiring.  </P> <P> "He means it right now," said Melanie Byrd, a close friend.  </P> <P> "I think it's a distinct possibility," said Starling's adviser, Mort Sharnik.  "It's his decision alone."  </P> <P> "He had a great career," said Starling's trainer, Freddie Roach. "If that's  what he decides, great. None of us would be disappointed."  </P> <P> Starling, who turns 32 next week, said his age and trouble with making weight  finally caught up with him.  </P> <P> "I knew it was going to catch up with me someday," Starling said in an  interview with the Hartford Courant. "I never felt like quitting before, but I  felt like quitting this time."  </P> <P> Blocker earned a majority decision, winning on two judges' cards. The third  judge had the fight even.  </P> <P> Starling said he is proud of his 11-year pro career. "I always tried my best,"  Starling said. "You can't win them all, but at least I tried. That's all you  can do."  </P></p>

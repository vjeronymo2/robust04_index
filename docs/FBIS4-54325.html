			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- A productive upsurge has  been effected at the Sariwon textile mill, the nation's  well-known fibre production base.    The mill topped its first quarterly plan this year by 2  percent and is now fulfilling daily quotas at more than 120  percent with the goal of hitting the first six months' target  ahead of schedule.    The mill is situated in the western part of North Hwanghae  Province 56 kilometres south of Pyongyang.    The output and variety of textiles are on an annual increase  at the mill.    Its total industrial output value now is 6.2 times that 20  years ago; cotton yarn output 1.4 times, textiles output 3 times  and processed textiles output 6.3 times.    The mill which had put out only a few kinds of cloth in the  past now mass-produces over 40 kinds of refined-pattern and  high-quality textiles including high-quality suit cloth, shirt  cloth, water-resistant cloth, linings, printed cotton and  processed plastic cloth.    Several ten million metres of high-quality textiles are  produced annually by the mill and they are exported to foreign  countries and supplied to the population of the country.    The material and technical foundations of the mill have been  consolidated immensely.    Workers and technicians there have made more than 1,000  kinds  of accessories by their own efforts to remodel along modern  lines several hundred machines including shinning machines,  shuttleless knitters and hydraulic press looms. They have  manufactured printing machines also by their own efforts and  introduced them in production.    Thus, the number of spinning machines has increased 11  times,  weaving machines 3.8 times and printing machines 5 times at the  mill over the past 20 years.    A repair base has also been consolidated.    A large number of innovators and thousands of recipients of  state decorations have been produced there in this course.    A well-arranged study-while-working higher educational base  at the mill annually rears several hundred technicians and  skilled workers.</p>

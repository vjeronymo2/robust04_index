			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy The picture of steady, non-inflationary growth painted by the Treasury's summer forecast has survived this week's batch of economic figures. The small drop in underlying inflation last month was no more than financial markets expected. More importantly, after the scares earlier in the year, there is no sign of upward pressure on average earnings. Add in the good news on wholesale prices - manufacturers are not passing on higher raw materials costs to customers - and the inflationary threat looks remote. The lingering worry is that the economy might accelerate through the second half of the year. Yet straws in the wind hint that the Treasury's forecast of 2.75 per cent growth this year is not unduly conservative. Overtime working fell unexpectedly in May, while the modest drop in unemployment in June does not smack of overheating. It may be that tax rises and higher bond yields have been just enough to take the inflationary edge off recovery. The rise in gilt yields looks all the more ferocious against the background of yesterday's comforting data. The sharp rally in gilts this week may mark a realisation that real yields have risen far enough. If that brighter mood can be sustained, equities will also have more headroom. With the FT-SE 100 index breaking back through 3000 yesterday, the equity market again looks inclined to take its lead from the promising fundamentals. But the FT-SE climbed higher than this last month only to plunge with international markets, and not that much has changed in the domestic economy since.</p>

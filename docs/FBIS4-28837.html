			<p>BFN     [Text] After attending a Unification and Security Policy  Coordination Council meeting this morning, Yi Hong-ku, deputy  prime minister and minister of the National Unification Board,  said that North Korea's attempt [as heard] to withdraw from the  International Atomic Energy Agency runs counter to a peaceful  solution to the nuclear problem. He also urged North Korea to  implement all nuclear safeguards measures, though belatedly.  You will listen to it directly from him.    [Begin Yi Hong-ku recording] I cannot but clearly point out  that North Korea's withdrawing from the mechanism of all  safeguards measures for ensuring the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula would decisively run counter to a peaceful  solution to the nuclear problem [pihaekhwarul pojanghanun modun  anjonjochiui tureso pukhani ital handanun kosun haengmunjeui  pyongjok haegyore kyolchongjoguro yokhaeng handanun kosul  myongbaekhui chijokhaji anulsu opsumnida].    Therefore, I strongly urge North Korea to cooperate, though  belatedly [chigum irado], with regard to all safeguards measures  required by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. [end recording]</p>

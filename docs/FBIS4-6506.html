			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- Long-lived people are  blessed in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il takes a warm care of  them, sending them birthday tables.    Among them is an old woman surnamed Kwon living in Hoeyang  County, Kangwon Province.    Comrade Kim Chong-il sent a centennial birthday table to her  on April 16, wishing her good health and happiness.    Born into a poor peasant family in April 1894, she could  enjoy a worthy life only after the people became masters of the  country.    She expressed deep thanks to the dear leader, saying poor  people had to die when they fell ill, feeling bitter against the  society, during the colonial rule of the aapanese  imperialists, but after the liberation of the country old  people enjoy a long life in good health without paying even a  penny benefitting by the health policy of the Workers' Party of  Korea.</p>

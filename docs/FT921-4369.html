			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / MPs urge sweeping reforms on pensions SWEEPING reform of Britain's pensions industry in the wake of the Maxwell pensions scandal was demanded yesterday by a cross-party committee of MPs. The committee added that financial institutions which bankrolled the late Mr Robert Maxwell have a moral obligation to help thousands of pensioners defrauded in the affair. The report of the select committee on social security blamed regulators, City institutions and professional advisers for failing to spot 'stealing on a massive scale' from the schemes run by Mr Maxwell. Of its own hearings, the committee said: 'Pontius Pilate would have blushed at the spectacle of so many witnesses washing their hands in public before the committee of their responsibilities in this affair.' The committee, whose report met with a cautious response from the industry and regulators, recommends that a top-level commission be established to write a new pensions act to replace the trust law which has governed pension fund activities for decades. It also urges greatly expanded powers for the Occupational Pensions Board (the quasi-governmental body that oversees some aspects of pension operations), tighter rules on the custody and transfer of pension fund assets, greater disclosure requirements and the establishment of a compensation scheme for pensioners. The committee stops short of recommending government aid for defrauded pensioners, but says that institutions which bankrolled Mr Maxwell have a moral responsibility to help. The report says that banks which received pension fund assets as collateral for their loans to Mr Maxwell have a moral obligation to return them, while some US investment banks - which it does not name - which bought Maxwell Communication Corporation shares in an alleged share support scheme should help make up the shortfall. However, it fails to address the thorniest issue for pension funds - of whether surpluses belong to beneficiaries or employers. Committee members urged that this question be settled by the commission it wants set up to reform pensions law. It was Mr Maxwell's legal use of the fund surpluses that first led to concern. The report criticises in particular the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro), the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, for its weakness in overseeing Mr Maxwell's in-house pension fund management company, Bishopsgate Investment Management. The report castigates the City's system of self-regulation for the pensions industry, as 'little short of a tragic comedy'. It recommends that oversight of pension fund managers become the responsibility of a new, more powerful Occupational Pensions Board. Mr John Morgan, Imro chief executive, believed the committee had come out with a 'fair and sensible report considering the time constraints' but he disagreed with its characterisation of self-regulation. Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, which supervises Imro, said a review of financial regulation was already under way.</p>

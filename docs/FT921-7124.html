			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Cocaine case Irish tycoon is no stranger to controversy MR BEN DUNNE, the Irish supermarket magnate who was charged with drug trafficking in Miami at the weekend, is not a newcomer to controversy, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. As chairman and chief executive of Dunnes Group, one of Ireland's largest companies and food retail outlets, he has crossed swords with industry, trade unions and government alike. In 1981 he was kidnapped by an IRA group in an incident which is believed to have ended with the payment of IPounds 300,000 ransom. Mr Dunne was arrested in Orlando, Florida, after what the police believed was a suicide attempt from the 17th floor of his hotel. He was found to have been drugged with cocaine and in possession of a further 32.5g of the substance. Mr Dunne returned to Dublin at the weekend after being released on a Dollars 25,000 (Pounds 14,285) bail, saying: 'I made a terrible blunder. I have paid a high price. I have fallen a long way.' He has admitted possession of the 32.5g of cocaine for which he was charged, but denied that he is involved in trafficking. 'I can certainly look people in the eye and say I am not a dealer. But I was in possession,' he said on Irish radio. He said that he was not attempting suicide, but felt under threat. His family company, founded in 1944 by his father, now boasts 75 supermarket and drapery outlets in Ireland, 6,000 employees and an annual turnover in the region of IPounds 900m. The company also has 23 stores in Ulster and a further five in northern Britain. The Dublin magazine, Business and Finance, recently rated it number five of Ireland's top 1,000 companies based on turnover. As a private company, it does not release its figures, but it is believed to have annual profits of some IPounds 50m. Mr Dunne is widely viewed as a tough negotiator, using his group's market strength (about 20 per cent of Ireland's retail food trade) to pare suppliers' margins in order to boost his own company's profits. Last year he was boycotted by most of Ireland's dairy suppliers when he attempted to reduce the retail price for fresh milk through his stores, threatening doorstep deliveries. He was defeated after a six-week boycott, which reportedly hit overall sales. He fell out with the Confederation of Irish Industry in 1990 as he sought to extend suppliers' credit periods. An important source of the group's profits is thought to be derived through supplier credit. This allows him to accumulate large sums of cash which are then invested in the short-term money market. Mr Seamus O'Donnell of the trade union which represents Mr Dunne's retail staff said: 'They are a difficult firm to deal with, and they work their staff pretty hard.'</p>

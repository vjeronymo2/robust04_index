			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENA;  </P> <P> PROP. A. COURSE SUGGESTED  </P> <P> Key members of a financial strategy committee for the schools have decided to  recommend not resubmitting Proposition A to the voters in the November  election, as some proponents of the measure had called for.  </P> <P> Although proponents of Proposition A had called for it to be resubmitted to the  voters, key members of a financial strategy committee for the schools have  recommended against doing so.  </P> <P> The tax measure, which would have imposed a $98 parcel tax for five years to  increase the city's school budget, was narrowly defeated in a special election  earlier this month.  </P> <P> Robert Hartsfield, treasurer of the Schools Financial Strategy Committee, said  that committee leaders had decided that they should analyze "where we went  wrong" in the earlier election before going back to the voters. To qualify for  the November election, the Board of Education would have to approve the measure  by Wednesday, then schedule a public hearing for no later than July 6.  </P> <P> The financial strategy committee is considering a revised tax measure, which  would exempt senior citizens as a way of overcoming resistance from elderly  voters. The committee leaders will poll the two dozen members next week and  make a formal recommendation to the Board of Education, which will make the  final decision on when to submit a new measure.  </P></p>

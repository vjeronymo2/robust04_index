			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; the Family (Briefcase): Queries for neighbours ABOUT 18 years ago neighbours agreed orally to dig into the hillside to widen the public right of way, now a footpath, to make room for parking and turning vehicles. The Land Registry shows, dotted, both the original site boundary lines and the newer cliff face with hedge on top. The question is: do the new neighbours have a right to reclaim their part of the communal land, for building? Footpath width would be retained but the turning and parking of vehicles would be restricted. The only deed refers to the right to use and duty to help maintain the feeder road which has been used for vehicles since the original right of way was degraded from lane to path because of its dangerous junction on the bend of a main road. The neighbours can reclaim the land up top the original boundary unless the segment used to widen the way has been used by someone (such as yourself) to the exclusion of all others including the neighbours. A change in the identity of the neighbours makes no difference. IN 1979 I bought from British Rail part of their railway cutting adjoining my garden, part of this land I purchased is also next to my neighbours garden. The land is clearly defined by the usual BR star posts every 4 yards with strong wire between. My neighbour has painted the post next to his garden and attended the grass on the other side of the posts, my land. This is OK by me as it is an improvement but he has not mentioned it or asked me about it. I am concerned that eventually he may try to make a take over bid. Is this a possibility and if so how do you think I can avoid it without upsetting what is a friendly relationship? Your only safe course is to discuss the matter with your neighbour and try to agree that you should give him a licence to tidy the land as he has been doing, and to record this in writing. It is questionable whether the activities which your neighbour has so far been performing are sufficient to give him a possessory claim (after 12 years' continuance) but you should try to ensure that not even a faint case for possessory title can be built up. Certainly, if activity were to be more intense you should take steps to prevent any period of 12 years continuance of it. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

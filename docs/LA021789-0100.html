			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> APARTMENT PLANS DIVIDE CITY, SCHOOL OFFICIALS  </P> <P> Battle lines are being drawn between the Torrance Unified School District and  the City Council over a district plan to build up to 120 apartments on the site  of the former Columbia School.  </P> <P> The district's interest in developing the 5-acre, triangular lot on 186th  Street has raised harsh criticism from council members, who question the  density of the project and fear it could include subsidized housing -- a  politically hot issue in Torrance.  </P> <P> "I don't know where they're headed, but I see potential problems," said  Councilman Bill Applegate, who last week asked city staff to investigate the  district's intentions.  </P> <P> The council's criticism comes despite assurances by district officials that  they do not intend to provide subsidized housing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Never' Part of the Plan  </P> <P> "Subsidized or low-income housing has never been a part of our plan," said Paul  Mackey, assistant superintendent for special projects. "I don't know why they  are worried."  </P> <P> Columbia School, which once provided classes for mentally and physically  handicapped children, has been vacant since 1987, when the program was  relocated to Torrance High School. Columbia is one of several schools that were  closed as enrollment declined. Some of the unneeded schools were sold or  converted to other district uses.  </P> <P> Harvey Oelkers, the district's assistant superintendent for business services,  said criticism of the project is premature because the specifics of the project  have not been determined. The council would have to approve a change of zoning  for the project as well as the actual development.  </P> <P> "We are not sneaking off in the middle of the night and building something  without anyone knowing," Oelkers said.  </P> <P> The plan to develop the land would be a joint venture between the district and  the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission, Oelkers said. The  agency develops public-owned land and provides real estate advice to other  public agencies at a nominal fee, said Judith Kendall, the commission's  director of community development and planning.  </P> <P> In July, school officials asked the commission to evaluate the vacant property  and recommend how to get the highest financial return. The commission said the  most profitable use would be a high-density apartment project, according to a  report by Oelkers to the school board. The district is considering building  about 120 two- and three-bedroom apartments on the site, Oelkers said, which  would require a high-density zoning.  </P> <P> "The case can be made that R-3 zoning (high-density housing) is compatible with  both the adjacent commercial zoning and the R-2 (medium-density housing), and  addresses a shortage of multifamily housing within the city," Oelkers said.  </P> <P> It has not been estimated how much the development may cost, but Oelkers said  the district plans to borrow all of the money needed. He estimated that the  profits to the district over a 10-year period could be as high as $13.5  million. The land alone is worth about $4.5 million, he said.  </P> <P> Once the project is completed, a private agency would be hired to manage the  property, Oelkers said.  </P> <P> State law, however, requires that any profits from the sale of school lands go  toward building improvements or purchase of other property, Oelkers said. By  developing the Columbia site instead of selling it, the district can use the  profits for operating expenses or any way it wants, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Get the Most Out of the Property'  </P> <P> "The idea is to get the most out of the property that you can," Mackey said.  </P> <P> Most council members said they sympathize with the district's attempt to raise  money, but several -- including Applegate, Dan Walker and Tim Mock -- said they  fear that if the school board uses federal or county grants to pay for the  project, it may be required to provide low-income housing.  </P> <P> Applegate said subsidized housing could bring down property values in the  neighborhood. The area north of the site has medium-density, single-family and  two-family homes. The area to the south and east is commercial. To the west are  railroad tracks. Applegate said his opposition to subsidized housing, which has  often served minorities, is not racially motivated. "It has nothing to do with  race or anything else," he said. "It has to do with the value of property."  </P> <P> Walker shared Applegate's concern. Even though district officials have said  they do not intend to provide subsidized housing, he said, "that doesn't give  anyone any assurances that they won't build it anyway."  </P> <P> Subsidized housing is a sensitive issue with the City Council. In 1980, four  council members faced recall petitions because they voted for a federal Housing  and Urban Development subsidized housing project in order to continue receiving  federal grants.  </P> <P> Faced with overwhelming opposition from residents, the council ultimately  dropped out of the federal housing program. The recall effort was ultimately  abandoned.  </P> <P> "It caused quite a fury," said Mayor Katy Geissert, who was one of the council  members who faced a recall drive.  </P> <P> Other council members said they opposed the project because they say it would  be too dense for that neighborhood. "I don't think that is the best use of the  land," said Councilman Mark Wirth.  </P> <P> Last month, the council asked city planners to recommend a new zoning for the  site, which is now zoned for public use. Their recommendation is expected in  several weeks. Wirth said he would prefer to rezone the land for medium density  and have moderately priced, owner-occupied townhouses built.  </P> <P> The district's interest in developing housing is shared in Redondo Beach, where  the elementary school district is working with developers to build two senior  citizen homes, one at the old McCandless Elementary School site and the other  on the site of the former Andrews Elementary School.  </P> <P> Torrance District officials said a similar project is under way in Huntington  Beach.  </P></p>

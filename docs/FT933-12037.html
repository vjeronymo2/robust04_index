			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Banks predict crackdown on 'laundering' CLEARING BANKS yesterday predicted a big rise in the number of transactions reported to police as possible cases of criminal activity after an imminent change in the law introduces the threat that employees who fail to do so may be jailed. The British Bankers' Association forecast a 'very significant' rise in the 20,000 cases of possible money laundering which are reported by bank employees from the 1.6bn transactions that take place each year. The Criminal Justice Bill, expected to receive royal assent this week, is likely to lead to a sharp increase in the reporting requirements on banks and other financial-services companies from April next year. The bill widens the requirements so that banks must report not only transactions suspected to be linked to money laundering and terrorism, but also possible serious criminal activity such as fraud, theft and extortion. It also introduces for the first time a penalty of up to five years' imprisonment for bank employees who are negligent in reporting suspicious activities, and up to two years' jail for directors of organisations that are negligent. Banks have argued successfully against the compulsory reporting of all transactions above a certain size, as is the case in the US. Sir Nicholas Goodison, association president, said this would have been 'crazy'. But the banks have accepted additional costs - estimated at up to Pounds 30m in the first year and Pounds 20m in subsequent years - associated with additional staff training and the setting up of central reporting offices to review branch suspicions. Ms Sue Thornhill, the association's assistant director, said there was likely to be 'an increase in suspicion at all levels' in banks as a result of the introduction of the threat of criminal prosecution for negligent staff and managers. The association also emphasised its support for the call by Mr Eric Howe, data protection registrar, for a tightening of the law to prevent people who manage to obtain confidential data from banks from selling it to third parties. Lord Inchyra, director-general of the association, said that there appeared to be 'a hole' in the law because it was not an offence to trade in information, including account details, that was held as confidential data. He said the association had developed guidance notes for banks to tighten their security.</p>

Both U.S. special envoy for Yugoslavia Charles Redman and  his  Russian counterpart Vitaly Churkin are attending the talks in  which the 12 European Community states, Canada and UN officials  are also represented.    The talks, in a hotel at Bad Godesberg, come as Russia is  proposing an international conference to try to settle the  situation in former Yugoslavia.    Moscow's return to the world diplomatic front line on the  issue coincides with the despatch of Russian troops to Sarajevo  to join in UN demilitarisation efforts following the withdrawal  of Serb artillery under threats from NATO.    Germany has also been closely associated with latest Bosnian  peace efforts.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl who has been in close telephone touch  with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris  Yeltsin on the Bosnian crisis, Monday backed the proposal of a  "high-level" international conference.    Yeltsin said Monday that the main three themes of the talks  would be the situation in Sarajevo, other intended zones of  security in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a peace plan.    French President Francois Mitterrand said Monday he was  calling on the UN Security Council to put Sarajevo under UN  administration.</p>

Section 3(o)(11) requires that the October 1, 1993 change in food stamp allotments be based upon 103 percent of the June 1993 cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) for a family of four persons consisting of a man and woman ages 20&hyph;50 and children ages 6&hyph;8 and 9&hyph;11. Adjustments are made to take into account household size, economies of scale and a requirement to round the final results down to the nearest dollar increments. Section 5(c) requires that the income eligibility standards for the program be adjusted on October 1, 1993 based on changes in the Federal income poverty guidelines. Section 5(e)(4) requires that the standard deductions and the maximum amounts for the excess shelter expense deductions be adjusted on October 1, 1993 to the nearest lower dollar increments to reflect certain changes for the 12 months ending June 30, 1993. Section 13912 of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act, chapter 3 of P.L. 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, amends section 5(e) by further raising the excess shelter expense deduction cap effective July 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action increases maximum food stamp allotments, income eligibility standards, and deductions based on the changing cost of living. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is estimated that this action will increase the cost of the Food Stamp Program by approximately $652.6 million in Fiscal Year 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Income Eligibility Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The eligibility of households for the Food Stamp Program, except those in which all members are receiving public assistance (PA) or supplemental security income benefits (SSI), is determined by comparing their incomes to the appropriate income eligibility standards (limits). Households containing an elderly or disabled member need to have net incomes below the net income limits, while households which do not contain an elderly or disabled member must have net incomes below the net income limit and gross incomes below the gross income limit. Households in which all members are receiving PA or SSI are categorically eligible; their incomes do not have to be below the income limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, elderly individuals (and their spouses) who are unable to prepare meals because of certain disabilities, may be considered separate households, even if they are living and eating with another household. 7 U.S.C.

The Food Stamp Act limits separate household status to those persons who meet both of the following requirements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Their own income may not exceed the net income eligibility standards, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The income of those with whom they reside may not exceed 165 percent of the poverty line. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The net and gross income limits are derived from the Federal income poverty guidelines. The net income limit is 100 percent of the guidelines; the gross income limit is 130 percent of the guidelines. The guidelines are updated annually. Based on that update, the Food Stamp Program's income eligibility standards are updated annually. The effective date of October 1 is required by the Food Stamp Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised income eligibility standards are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Ulster 'fair jobs' pressure: US investors to demand progress on equal opportunities US investors attending this week's international business conference in Belfast plan to tie future investment to fair employment in Northern Ireland and cross-community involvement in development projects. Renewed focus on both issues emerged at a conference held in the US at the weekend marking the 10th anniversary of the campaign in support of the so-called MacBride principles, which aim to promote civil rights and equal opportunity in Northern Ireland. The US conference was sponsored by Mr Alan Hevesi, the New York City comptroller (treasurer). He has signalled a plan to channel up to Dollars 100m (Pounds 60m) in institutional funds to Ulster in the form of 'Irish Peace bonds' and has already made clear his intention of encouraging companies to adopt employment practices based on the MacBride principles. The US conference was attended by Mr William Flyn, chairman of Mutual America, one of the biggest American insurance companies, who has helped co-ordinate private investor interest on both sides of the Irish border. At the conference both men made clear that US investor confidence in Northern Ireland remained dependent on progress in the peace talks and that any major inflow of capital would have to be tied to a political programme firmly linked to the promotion of equal rights. Mr Hevesi said yesterday that he was planning a 'significant expansion' of the MacBride principles campaign by aiming to influence corporate compliance with 'positive discrimination' towards Roman Catholics in British companies in which there was a significant US shareholding. Until now the campaign, supported by 18 US state legislatures, has played an important role in influencing the employment practices of US companies with operations in Northern Ireland. Mr Hevesi said yesterday: 'The environment for investment in Northern Ireland has improved dramatically as a result of the peace process, but progress towards the elimination of discrimination is painfully slow.' At the weekend conference Mr Flyn renewed his backing for the MacBride principles, and insisted that discrimination had no place in Northern Ireland. He was strongly critical of the opposition of the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, to the involvement of the US in the peace process. Mr Hevesi and Mr Flyn will be heading a strong Irish-American caucus at the Belfast conference which is determined to put fair employment and the continuing involvement of Sinn Fein in the peace process at the centre of talks with government officials. The UK government's position is that Northern Ireland's laws provide legally enforceable remedies against discriminatory practices. Yesterday Mr Hevesi released the results of a survey on employment practices of UK companies in Northern Ireland in which New York City has shareholdings, showing continuing religious imbalance at the workplace.</p>

[passage  omitted]    "We noted with satisfaction that NATO has confirmed the  existence of a relationship between the security of its member  states and that of the countries of Central and East Europe,"  Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said in a speech at NATO  headquarters. "In my view, this contributes to the  consolidation of the external security of those countries," he  said. "And it is also important for the fundamental reforms  which are being carried out in those countries."    Poland, which had expressed great reservations about  participating in the Partnership because of its desire to join  NATO quickly and to secure security guarantees from the  alliance, referred to the need to develop economic exchanges  between East and West.    "While putting into practice the Partnership for Peace in  the  sphere of political and military cooperation, we ought to try to  create a Partnership for Development, a multifaceted cooperation  between North America and West, Central, and East Europe, a  cooperation among different structures, governmental and  nongovernmental institutions, regional and local cooperation,"  Pawlak added.    In his view, such cooperation should take place in  particular  with the countries which are on the way to a market economy:  "It ought to contribute to the activation of growth, increase  the feeling of stability, the promotion of economic  restructuring, and the dissemination and strengthening of the  market economy throughout the area of the Partnership."    "We regard the Partnership for Peace not only as a means of  having closer contacts with NATO. We want to use the  possibilities opened up by the program to maintain a good  partnership with our East European neighbors," he said. In his  view, "the Partnership has the potential for becoming a broad  and practical basis for cooperation among European countries in  favor of their mutual security."    "The recent NATO summit (10 and 11 January in Brussels) did  not live up to all our expectations, but we appreciate the  declaration of NATO's openness with a view to developing  cooperation with the partners and creating prospects for  accepting new members in the future," Pawlak added.</p>

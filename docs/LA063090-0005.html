			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXODUS OF SOVIET JEWS TO ISRAEL  </P> <P> As co-chairman of Operation Exodus for Los Angeles, a worldwide effort to  rescue Soviet Jews, I joined a small group in Moscow earlier this month to try  and gain some understanding of the current status of Jews in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> As we boarded our van for the ride from the Moscow airport to our hotel, I  asked the Intourist guide "How is life under perestroika?" From my two previous  visits to the Soviet Union I expected to hear the usual canned public relations  response. Instead she exploded, "It's terrible here. You stand in lines  forever, there is nothing to buy anyway, the states are in revolt, and the  people everywhere are frustrated and angry. This is an awful place to live!"  </P> <P> In Moscow we spoke with dozens of Jews who were part of that daily mob  besieging the Dutch embassy where the Israeli Legation issues exit visas. One  after the other they spoke of the harshness of their life -- of the menace of  increasing anti-Semitism and the specter of a complete breakdown of the Soviet  system with the unspeakable terror that such chaos could create. Unfortunately,  there is much in Russian history to justify these fears.  </P> <P> Jews are leaving the Soviet Union at the rate of 10,000 per month, the pace is  accelerating, and hundreds of thousands more are clamoring to escape while the  doors to freedom remain open. Whatever the murky future, present policies allow  a relatively free emigration, and Soviet Jews are flocking to Moscow to secure  exit visas. They come from all points in that vast country. Some had traveled  thousands of miles to join that milling crowd, each with his unique story. Some  experienced overt anti-Semitism; some felt the overhanging menace of their  chaotic society; others want to live and raise their children in their Jewish  homeland; others crave a place of freedom and opportunity. This vast Exodus is  creating a moment in the history of the Jewish people comparable to the  biblical exodus from Egypt.  </P> <P> Standing on that street in Moscow in the middle of this tense, high energy  crowd, sensing the historical significance of what was happening, I felt a  stream of varying emotions. Watching those Soviet Jews waving their letters of  invitation from the Israeli government, pressing against the gates to reach  those Israelis processing the entry visas, literally begging for the right to  leave their homes for the unknown. To me this was an overpowering moment.  </P> <P> I felt their anguish on leaving behind whatever parts of their lives that had  been rich; I sensed their fear in going to a new land where they must learn the  language and where they know conditions of employment, housing and all elements  of life will be very difficult. I was filled with pride in Israel's willingness  with open arms to accept these people as family and to generously help them  integrate into Israel life. I felt joy and commitment being an American Jew and  through Operation Exodus being able to participate in the vast expense of  transportation and helping defray a small part of the Israeli government's cost  to absorb what could be 1 million new citizens, and finally, a great  thankfulness to be a citizen of the United States with a life of security and  opportunity that we all, Jew and Gentile alike, take so much for granted.  </P> <P> RICHARD S. GUNTHER, Co-Chairman  </P> <P> Operation Exodus, Los Angeles  </P></p>

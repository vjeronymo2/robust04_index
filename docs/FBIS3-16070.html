Turkmenbashi [Niyazov] has  given an interview to journalists from Turkmenistan National  Television. Regarding certain difficulties connected with the  transition period, the head of state advised working people and  the country's entire population not to be taken in by idle  chatterers and people who try to make these problems out to be  large and intractable. Saparmurat Turkmenbashi appealed to his  countrymen not to trust the widespread rumors about the Turkmen  manat, to maintain their restraint and keep calm. Certain  shortages in the supply of food and other goods to the  population, the president noted, are mainly attributable to the  fact that a number of states have paid their debts to  Turkmenistan at an inconvenient time.</p>

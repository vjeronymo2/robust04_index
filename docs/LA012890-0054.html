			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIP OF THE WEEK: THERE ARE PLENTY OF NUTS IN MERCED  </P> <P> For one thing, it's the place where the nuts come from. Pistachios in  particular. But this agricultural town perched at the top of the San Joaquin  Valley also is home to a fine collection of military airplanes.  </P> <P> Usually, Merced tempts travelers off the California 99 freeway with restaurants  and motels. But there are other reasons to drop by this small city, which calls  itself the "Gateway to Yosemite."  </P> <P> History buffs will discover Merced County's recently restored 19th-Century  courthouse, which has been made into a museum. Car devotees may want to visit a  private collection of restored vehicles, including one of the oldest-known,  steam-powered tractors. Airplane lovers will be fascinated by the history found  in the military planes of Castle Air Museum.  </P> <P> From Los Angeles on California 99, take the Le Grand exit just beyond  Chowchilla. Follow the Pistachio signs along County 15 three miles to the  Buchanan Hollow Nut Co., the family-run business of Sharleen and Bob Robson.  </P> <P> Pistachios are grown on 600 acres adjacent to a packing plant where the nuts  are roasted, salted and bagged for shipment worldwide.  </P> <P> The farm also grows walnuts and almonds, and other nuts are purchased locally.  Some are coated with chocolate and caramel for gift packages.  </P> <P> The Buchanan Hollow Nut Co. is open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturdays  to 2 p.m. It's closed Sundays.  </P> <P> Cotton and other San Joaquin Valley crops are visible as you continue north to  the first crossroad, Buchanan Hollow Road, and turn left to Plainsburg Road.  Turn right (north) and look for a small sign offering direction to Brights  Nursery -- home of Arthur Bright's vehicle collection.  </P> <P> Turn right onto the nursery's private road. It will lead to a huge metal  building. If the door is locked, go to the nursery office, which is open  weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.  </P> <P> Arthur Bright started collecting vehicles for an exhibit in the 1960s. His  prize is an Aveling Porter steam tractor built in England in 1873. You'll find  it among hundreds of tractors, trucks, combines, cars, wagons, motorbikes and  other vehicles.  </P> <P> Look for the electric street car from San Francisco, a milk delivery truck, a  Studebaker freight wagon and a Case threshing machine. Admission to the museum  is free.  </P> <P> Continue north on Plainsburg Road to Le Grand Road, and turn left to rejoin  California 99 north to Merced. Continue on the freeway past the city to the  Buhach Road exit near Atwater, and follow signs two miles to Castle Air Force  Base.  </P> <P> Turn left on Santa Fe Drive to the outdoor display of 34 military planes at  Castle Air Museum. It's free and open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.  </P> <P> Before following paths to the planes for close-up views, see wartime  memorabilia on exhibit in the indoor portion of the museum. You'll see weapons,  uniforms and escape maps printed on silk for downed pilots.  </P> <P> Buy a copy of "The Flightline" for 25 cents. It contains detailed descriptions  of the planes on display, which date back to World War II.  </P> <P> At the entrance you'll see a B-24, which has been carefully restored. While  18,000 of the bombers were built -- more than any other U.S. combat aircraft --  fewer than 15 still exist.  </P> <P> The largest plane at the museum is a B-52 Stratofortress that saw action in the  Vietnam War. You can view a B-29 Superfortress, like the one that dropped the  first atomic bomb on Hiroshima.  </P> <P> Also from World War II is a B-25 Mitchell, made famous by Lt. Col. Jimmie  Doolittle on bombing runs over Japan. Only two foreign planes are in the  collection -- a British Vulcan and a Canadian Canuck. The museum telephone is  (209) 723-2178.  </P> <P> Rejoin California 99 south to Merced's R Street exit and turn left under the  freeway to Main Street. Turn right to N Street, and go left to the historic  Merced County Courthouse. Free tours are offered Wednesday through Sunday from  1 to 4 p.m.  </P> <P> Dedicated in 1875, it was restored at a cost of nearly $1 million. The exterior  brick walls have been plastered to simulate marble. On the inside, redwood was  hand-painted to resemble oak or walnut.  </P> <P> Drop by the Merced Chamber of Commerce office, 1880 N St., and pick up a  walking-tour map of historic buildings and a dining/lodging guide. Hours are  8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays. Call (209) 384-3333.  </P> <P> For Italian food and patio dining, go to Chianti's on Bob Hart Square. It opens  at 11 a.m. daily except Sundays, when it opens for brunch at 10 a.m. Other  restaurants include the Mansion House, which serves Sunday brunch, as well as  Jordan's Chateau, Buchanan's California Cuisine, Wine Cellar, Branding Iron and  Eagle's Nest.  </P> <P> The Eagle's Nest also serves Sunday brunch and is at the south end of town at  the freeway exit for Childs Avenue. Just opposite is Merced's largest lodging,  the Travelodge, which is $42 for a double. Phone (209) 723-3121.  </P> <P> Other accommodations nearby along Motel Drive, include the Best Western Inn;  $38, double. Call (209) 723-2163. The remodeled Pine Cone Inn is at the other  end of town at the V Street exit. Doubles are $58; call (209) 723-3711.  </P> <P> Round trip from Los Angeles to Merced is 560 miles.  </P></p>

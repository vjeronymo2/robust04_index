			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Barclay brothers buy The European THE European newspaper, founded by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, one of Britain's most effective self-publicists, has been sold to the Barclay brothers, two of the country's most publicity-shy businessmen. Mr David and Mr Frederick Barclay, the 58-year-old identical twins who own ships and hotels, yesterday announced the acquisition of their first newspaper. It is the first significant part of the collapsed Maxwell empire to be sold by the administrators. Mr Alan Chamberlain, a director of the brothers' main company, Ellerman Investments, and the new managing director of The European, said: 'I think it's a question of timing. It's 1992 and this is an extremely exciting period for Europe and an exciting period for The European.' The Barclays' interests range from the Gotaas-Larsen bulk shipping line to the Howard Hotel in London and the Mirabeau Hotel in Monte Carlo. In the latest edition of the Sunday Times Book of the Rich, the brothers rank merely as Super-Rich - taking 18th position with a joint fortune of Pounds 450m. The edition, published in November, places them a full 10 places behind Mr Maxwell, who was rated as a billionaire worth Pounds 1.2bn. The brothers are admirers of the weekly newspaper, now selling about 200,000 copies an issue. They were impressed by the commitment of the staff who produced an issue without pay during the search for a buyer. They admired Mr Maxwell's vision of a pan-European newspaper and also saw its acquisition as a good business opportunity. Mr Maxwell invested at least Pounds 50m in the venture. It is likely that the Barclays paid less than Pounds 5m and possibly considerably less. Mr Charles Garside, the new editor of the paper is at present the only employee. The Barclays' purchase involved the title and equipment, but it is not yet clear how many journalists will be hired. The new newspaper owners began their business lives as estate agents, moved into property, survived the crash of 1973-74 and have in the past owned breweries. They evidently plan serious investment in the future of The European. The aim will be to make the paper more European and less a publication looking into Europe through British eyes. This may involve opening a Brussels office and distribution in Scandinavia and Japan. Acclaim Entertainment of the US has bought assets from Mirrorsoft, a Maxwell producer of entertainment software for an undisclosed price.</p>

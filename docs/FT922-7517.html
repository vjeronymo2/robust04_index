			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Anxious German employers weigh up interests: Prospects for the engineering sector amid signs of a breakthrough in the dispute SOME German engineering executives have been shivering in their shoes at the thought of a strike - which would be inevitable if hopes of a settlement raised by last night's twelfth-hour talks prove groundless. Others are keen for a fight, however, and the rest are playing it cool. With such a big gap between the original demand by the powerful IG Metall trade union for a 9.5 per cent pay rise and the employers' offer of 3.3 per cent, a strike had seemed unavoidable as the negotiators warmed to their task. However, the seriousness with which the latest round of weekend talks was taken in the southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg showed how strong the desire had been to reach an accord; the state is home to such doyens of German industry as Daimler-Benz and its Mercedes-Benz car and truck subsidiary, Robert Bosch, the components company, and Porsche sports cars. A strike would be expensive for both sides. The question remains whether employers look more to short- or long-term interests. Many of Germany's small- and medium-sized engineering and components manufacturers have said last year's near 7 per cent settlement was too much for them. Now, with domestic and foreign markets weaker and foreign competition stiffening, they want as low a deal as possible. If that were to mean a strike to preserve longer-term competitiveness, many would be prepared for that. There is a heavy concentration of such Mittelstand companies in north Baden-Wurttemberg, where the weekend talks took place in Karlsruhe. Deals agreed there in recent years were adopted in the rest of the country. During the last strike called by IG Metall in 1984, many Mittelstand operations were hit hard. But the big companies also suffered. Bosch, with its central importance as a supplier to car manufacturers, was a strategic target. However, the law has been changed so workers at plants affected by a strike elsewhere do not receive welfare payments if they have to stop work. If action were to go ahead, this could put pressure on the union to make its strikes more widespread so that all workers involved in industrial action received strike pay. On the other hand, such tactics would also quickly reduce IG Metall's coffers. Either way, it could make for a short strike, if there were to be one. Stuttgart, the local capital, is where the big companies such as Mercedes and Bosch are based, but Mittelstand companies are scattered through the state. Altogether, the region where the talks are being held has 700,000 of west Germany's 4m engineering workers. But it is not the only concentration of engineering might. The industry employs more than 800,000 people in the neighbouring state of Bavaria, home to the BMW and Audi car manufacturers, Kugelfischer (bearings), and MAN (trucks, printing machinery, and diesel engines). The biggest block of output, however, is located in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia which has nearly 1m engineering workers and includes the traditional heavy industrial area of the Ruhr. Many employers in the state, such as Mannesmann, Thyssen, Krupp, and Hoesch, have switched their emphasis from steel and heavy engineering to high-technology sectors such as components and automation. But that would not make them less vulnerable. Modern production methods mean that plants which rely on just-in-time deliveries - notably in the car industry - could be shut down quickly. Volkswagen, in the more remote town of Wolfsburg in Lower Saxony, a state with 120,000 engineering workers, turns out 4,000 cars a day there. Its Bavarian-based Audi subsidiary makes 2,000 daily. In the state of Hesse (360,000 workers in the industry) Opel, the General Motors subsidiary, has its main plant near Frankfurt, while the local subsidiary of Ford of the US is based in Cologne, south of the Ruhr. Mr Ferdinand Piech, head of Audi, said that a strike would cost the company some DM30m (Pounds 10.2m) a day in lost revenue. But each 1 per cent on the wage bill would also add DM30m a year to its costs. Audi is profitable and racing to meet high demand, so it could well do without a strike. But some components companies which are losing money because of weak foreign markets have indicated that they would not mind if there were a brief shutdown. Whatever happens, many companies are likely to consider shifting more output to lower-cost countries. That is what Bosch did after 1984.</p>

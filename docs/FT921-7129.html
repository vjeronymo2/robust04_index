			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (11): Less lavish but going strong - US Conventions Business RECESSION is continuing to affect the US conference and exhibition industries of the 1990s. Smaller and more cost-effective events are replacing the lavish affairs of the extravagant 1980s. The recession has been particularly hard on the US conventions business. A study by Meetings and Conferences magazine showed a 19 per cent decline in the number of conventions in the US to 10,200 in 1991 from 12,600 in 1989. In the same period corporate meetings fell to 806,000 from 867,000, while the total number of meetings dipped to 1.03m from 1.07m. The move towards smaller events was highlighted by the growth of association meetings - one of the few bright spots of 1991. The number of association meetings, other than annual conventions, rose 15 per cent to 215,000 in 1991 from 187,000 in 1989. 'People do not have the time and money to go away to large conventions where the subject might not be particularly focused and the main benefit would be networking,' says Mr David Ghitelman, managing editor of Meetings and Conventions magazine. 'But there is demand for meetings closer to home that are focused on more specific subjects, such as updates in tax law.' The recession's impact on US tourism continues to be good news for meeting planners. Conventions are an increasingly important revenue source for hoteliers trying to cope with growing vacancy rates. In resort hotels, for example, conventions contributed about 43 per cent of the industry's Dollars 6bn revenues in 1990. 'It is very much a buyer's market,' says Mr Ghitelman. One unexpected by-product of the Gulf war, which severely cut into international travel, was the growth of the video conferencing market. 'We had almost written off this industry in the 1980s because, year after year, it never took off. At about the time of the Gulf war it started to grow and it hasn't fallen off since then,' he adds. Revenues at Picturetel, which markets portable video systems for use in one's own room, grew from Dollars 17m in 1989 to Dollars 37m in 1990, and 1991 revenues are estimated at more than Dollars 70m. Another indication of the video conferencing market's growth is the growth in use of telephone meeting lines. Domestic bookings over US Sprint's meeting channel jumped 30 per cent between January and March of 1991, and international bookings surged 50 per cent. Although the increase was directly linked to the Gulf war, 'from what I've heard, it may have levelled off but it hasn't decreased since then,' says Mr Ghitelman. Companies have discovered that video conferencing is effective and cheaper than flying people around the world. Mr Ghitelman expects video conferencing to continue to develop in areas such as preliminary contract negotiations. Indeed, with new technology allowing people to work on the same document around the world, certain types of meetings may not be necessary at all in the future. Another growing trend is the use of meetings and conventions as a launching point for family holidays. 'We noticed that a lot more people brought their spouses to meetings. With the recession and the growth of the two-income family, it is becoming more important to combine business with pleasure.' Partly as a result, convention centres in the US sunbelt and the southwest are getting a larger share of the business according to Mr David Petersen, director of sports and convention facility advisory services at Price Waterhouse at Tampa, Florida. If you live in the north of the country and want to get away for a week, you might be more inclined to go to a convention in Orlando, Florida than Missoula, Montana. Mr Petersen expects the dominant convention centres in the next decade to be Las Vegas, New Orleans, Atlanta, Dallas, Orlando and Anaheim (near Disneyland in California). The large northern business centres such as New York and Chicago have also held up well. 'Larger centres are continuing to enjoy good attendance and high occupancy, and they can also draw from the resident market.' Overall convention attendance, however, is down as a result of the recession and the amount of exhibit space rented has also fallen off, particularly in small and medium-size centres. With convention centres, as well as hotels, the recession has created a buyer's market. 'Many facilities are trying to distinguish themselves by offering quality food and beverages, for example. And meeting planners and trade show producers are increasingly looking for features that might attract participants,' says Mr Petersen. In spite of the current pressures on business, the convention industry is still counting on future growth. Price Waterhouse's annual convention centre report found that centres in the largest markets such as Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Francisco, St Louis and Anaheim were expanding. Smaller markets doing well include Minneapolis, Seattle and Indianapolis. Among new centres under construction or recently opened are San Jose, Charlotte, Austin and Portland.</p>

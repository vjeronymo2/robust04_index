			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Choe Tu-sam from Beijing] </F>   [Text] China's XINHUA reported on 1 June that regarding  North Korea's replacing fuel rods at its nuclear reactor, China  had expressed its official position that the further measurement  of the removed fuel rods must be carried out as soon as possible.    XINHUA, in a dispatch from New York, reported that the UN  Security Council had adopted its presidential statement toward  North Korea, and that Li Zhaoxing, PRC Ambassador to the United  Nations, stressed that "China would oppose any action that will  aggravate the situation, and create tension on the Korean  peninsula," thus urging both North Korea and the International  Atomic Energy Agency to resume negotiations at the earliest  date. It also reported that he had openly delivered a message  of strong warning to the North Korean side.</p>

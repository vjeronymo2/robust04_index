			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Magnesia clinker of  Korea is popular at the international market.    It is exported to more than 10 countries and the needs for  it  are on a steady increase.    Korea is one of the biggest magnesia clinker producers in  the  world.    The country abounds in magnesite minerals needed for the  production of magnesia clinker.    Its deposits and quality rank first in the world.    Magnesite is widely used not only as a fire-proof material  resisting the temperature of more than 2,800 degrees centigrades  but in the industrial domains for the production of metal  magnesium, cement, rubber, paper, porcelain, etc.    Its major producer is Tanchon in South Hamgyong Province.    Deposits of magnesite in this area are estimated at several  billion tons and its mining conditions are very favourable.    The Yongyang mine called "white gold mountain" is mainly  engaged in opencast mining. It was developed 50 years past.    The Taehung general mining enterprise developed extensively  in the 70s annually produces several hundred thousand tons of  magnesia clinker, or nearly a half of the magnesite ore  production of the country. Its production capacity is being  expanded.    There are modernly-equipped magnesite mineral processing  bases in Tanchon, Kim Chaek, Chongjin and other areas.    The state is increasing investment in the production of  magnesia clinker.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Observer: Inside disease In the public relations trade, it is important to be seen to have access to the people who matter. Hence the increasingly desperate backstage jostling among the Tory party's rival image-makers. Will Sir Tim Bell, Mrs Thatcher's favourite PR man, be brought in from the cold and given a plum job on Prime Minister Major's team? How important is it for Peter Gummer, brother of agriculture minister Selwyn, that the Tories are re-elected with his own firm, Shandwick, visibly playing a key role? Can Alan Parker, Sir Peter Parker's son, repeat his recent success in financial PR, by helping Shaun Woodward, the Tory's young communications chief, win the coming battle of the headlines? What role will Sir Gordon Reece, another old faithful, play? There are some big reputations, even if not-so-big businesses, at stake. Imagine the panic in competing firms when The Mail on Sunday, normally well plugged into Tory politics, reported that Bell will act as the prime minister's personal public relations officer during the election campaign. A short burst from Tory party Central Office shot down that idea . . . for the moment. John Major prefers a more collegiate approach than his predecessor took, say his advisers. Hence the old connections no longer hold good. If true, this is bad news for the influence-pedlars.</p>

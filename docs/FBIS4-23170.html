			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 30 SAPA -- KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank  Mdlalose announced on Monday [30 May] evening that his  provincial cabinet had been finalised after a meeting in  Pietermaritzburg. In a statement Dr Mdlalose said: "I'm pleased  to announce that the political impasse regarding the allocation  of portfolios...has been resolved."    On the face of it there appeared little change to the  cabinet  announced last week and to which the African National Congress  objected, but Dr Mdlalose said the central government would be  approached about the appointment of additional deputy MECs  [members of the executive council].    The only change to the 11-member cabinet was the allocation  of the economic affairs and tourism portfolio to KwaZulu/Natal  African National Congress leader Jacob Zuma. He was originally  given the social welfare portfolio which was changed, without  consultation according to him, to public works. Mr Zuma said on  Monday he was satisfied with his new duties. "It has been  resolved satisfactorily ....We've got an agreement," he said.    The ANC leader reaffirmed Dr Mdlalose's statement, saying a  clause in Monday's agreement mandated central government to  appoint deputy MECs, some of whom would be ANC members.  Provincial governments do not have the power to do this. He  said according to Monday's agreement, the ANC would be given the  important post of deputy MEC of police, if central government  approved the joint request.    The three ANC cabinet members are expected to be sworn-in on  Thursday. They boycotted the original ceremony because of  dissatisfaction over the provisional portfolio allocation and  subsequent changes.    The final KwaZulu cabinet is as follows:     -  George Bartlett, agriculture (National Party)    -  Senzele Mhlungu, finance (Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP])    -  Peter Miller, housing and local government (IFP)    -  Celani Mtetwa, police (IFP)    -  Nyanga Ngubane, conservation and traditional authorities  (IFP)    -  Gideon Zulu, social welfare (IFP)    -  Vincent Zulu, education and culture (IFP)    -  Jacob Zuma, economic affairs and tourism (ANC)    -  S'bu Ndebele, roads, transport and traffic control (ANC)    -  Zweli Mkhize, health (ANC)        Dr Mdlalose is the 11th member of cabinet.</p>

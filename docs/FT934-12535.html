			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Corporation examines structure MITSUBISHI Corporation, Japan's largest trading company, has launched a review of its 600 subsidiaries and affiliates, in which it plans to close, merge or sell unprofitable businesses. This is the latest of several of Japan's keiretsus, or families of companies linked by equity cross-holdings, to reassess their alliances in the light of the recession. Mitsubishi Corporation, which embraces oil and fuels, heavy industrial goods, metals, textiles and goods among other sectors, plans to produce details of its new strategy by early next year. Businesses will be divided into three types: those to be liquidated or merged, candidates for more investment, and those that need more monitoring. Surplus staff will be shifted to other business units, officials said . The move was prompted by the poor performance of some of the several hundred businesses Mitsubishi Corporation acquired or invested in during the economic upturn of the late 1980s. Those investments were themselves the consequence of a previous strategic rethink, in 1986, when the group responded to the coming upturn of the time by expanding its activities. The latest part of an existing management plan at Mitsubishi Corporation - the most recent stage of which was its decision last month to disband the capital markets division - represents a move away from the financial engineering which was popular among Japanese industrial groups. Officials warned that restructuring costs might exceed the Y30bn (Dollars 277m) forecast for the current year. Net profits are widely expected to decline sharply from the Y52.72bn in the year to March 1992. The move should strengthen the group's earnings in the longer term, officials said.</p>

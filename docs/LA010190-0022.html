			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> BREAST CANCER TREATMENT RECYCLES BONE MARROW  </P> <P> Bone marrow transplants are helping treat some women with advanced stages of  breast cancer, researchers from the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in  Baltimore reported at the recent San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas.  </P> <P> An estimated 140,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year.  </P> <P> About 30% of these patients have a recurrence of the disease in other organs,  such as the liver, the brain and the lungs. At present, there is no effective  treatment for advanced breast cancer.  </P> <P> But an autologous bone marrow transplant -- in which a portion of the patient's  own bone marrow is removed, treated chemically to kill cancer cells and  reimplanted -- could help some of these women. With their highly sensitive bone  marrow removed, the patients are better able to tolerate higher doses of  cancer-killing drugs, which are then more effective at knocking out the cancer.  </P> <P> Since 1987, oncologist Nancy Davidson and her colleagues have performed this  procedure on 20 patients with advanced breast cancer. Nine patients have  responded completely; 11 showed partial responses during nine months of  follow-up after the treatment.  </P> <P> About a dozen centers are using the marrow transplants to battle advanced  breast cancer at a cost of $75,000 to $100,000 per patient.  </P></p>

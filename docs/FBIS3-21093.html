			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "German Aerospace Industry Mobilizing"] </F>   [Text] In an open discussion organized by Dr. R. Gohner,  coordinator of the German aerospace sector, Harmut Mehdorn (DASA  [Deutsche Aerospace]) proposed a 10-point plan for German  industry.    The German aerospace industry has redoubled efforts in  recent  months to reaffirm its identity and its spearhead role in  Germany's future. Its voice is beginning to be heard, as  evidenced at the forum last Monday at Petersberg in Konigswinter  held at the initiative of Dr. Reinhard Gohner, state secretary  for aerospace sector coordination.    Dr. Gohner discussed the eight-point program that he had  announced last October with a view to preserving the competitive  potential of the industry, which he noted has been the  beneficiary of government aid totaling an estimated 10 billion  German marks [DM].    Dr. Wolfgang Piller, president of BDLI, argued brilliantly  for Germany's need to retain a significant presence in the  aerospace sector if the country wants to keep its current  exemplary level of economic and social development. He noted  that the United States and Japan provide effective support for  their aerospace firms, recognizing the great importance of the  latter in helping maintain a strategic global position.  Aerospace is an especially good field for Europeans because it  lends itself so well to industrial cooperation. This is  demonstrated for example by Airbus Industrie group, with DASA  just recently having proven its value again by meeting the  production deadline for the A321, which Deutsche Lufthansa is  putting into service within the next few days. Indeed, no major  country's economy can afford to do without a "stimulant" like  the aerospace industry. "If we neglect this sector, it will be  others who decide our future for us," Dr. Piller concluded.    Another speaker was the president of Deutsche Lufthansa, Dr.  Jurgen Weber. Attendees were particularly keen to hear Dr.  Weber's remarks at this critical economic juncture, when the air  transport industry as a whole has lost $14 billion over the last  4 years. Weber does not expect orders to pick up substantially  before the second half of the decade.    Discussing the contribution air transport operators have  made to the industry--"without Deutsche Lufthansa and Air  France, there would be no Airbus Industrie"--he appealed to  aircraft makers for reciprocity. He called on all the airlines'  partners, including the airports, to cooperate with the airlines  on cost-cutting measures, because "the worst is still ahead of  us, and competition will get even tougher. Improvement can come  only over the longer term, when the air transport industry comes  to its senses."  <H5>  Mehdorn Plan </H5>   Harmut Mehdorn, who heads DASA's aeronautics division, told  attendees at the forum, which focused heavily on the manufacture  of civilian and space aeronautics equipment, that military  aircraft building is still the economic foundation of the  aerospace industry. He laid out a 10-point plan for surmounting  "the most serious crisis the industry has faced since the years  just after the war [World War II]." For German industry to be  able to retain its competitiveness, Mehdorn is asking annual  appropriations of DM300-340 for the sector (including  helicopters and equipment but not engines) and an equal amount  of supplementary assistance, analogous to NASA disbursements.  Such aid is indispensable for meeting competition from Boeing  and compensating for the increased aid funneled to industries in  the United States, Japan, and Asian and the CEI [Commonwealth of  Independent States] countries. Mehdorn also calls for early  finalization of the proposed FLA [Future Large Aircraft]  military air transport and immediate allocation of a DM25  million per year aid package to promote technologies associated  with the project. He demands confirmation of the Eurofighter  2000 project and faster transfer to industry of maintenance  responsibilities for military aircraft. Support is also needed  for technology projects and demonstrators that respond to needs  in the marketplace. Conditions must be created within the GATT  framework that enable the industry to withstand global  competition. Finally, budgetary appropriations are needed for  cooperation with the CEI countries. Better coordination of  research investments with major professional colleges, research  centers, and the university is indispensable. Lastly, a policy  of stronger support for marketing activities, comparable to the  practice in other countries, is necessary. And Mehdorn reminded  the audience of President Clinton's commitment to Boeing.    Dr. Reinhard Gohner, state secretary for the German  aerospace  sector, personally conducted this discussion with industry  representatives from start to finish--in part to show government  goodwill toward the sector but probably also to offset the  disastrous impact of statements made by some of his colleagues,  such as Messrs. Ruhe (Defense) and Kruger (Research). He  constantly laid stress, as did most other participants, on the  need to put development of German industry systematically into a  European perspective--and above all a Franco-German perspective.  Dr. Gohner called on the industry to submit a list of aerospace  projects for which state support would be required. But he  warned that new investment outlays cannot be expected before the  1995 budget, since the 1994 budget is already overloaded.</p>

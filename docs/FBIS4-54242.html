			<p>BFN     [Text] CANBERRA, May 24 (AFP) -- Australia has decided  against sending troops to Rwanda until their safety can be  reasonably assured, Defence Minister Robert Ray said Tuesday.  Ray told an upper-house Senate estimates committee that UN  progress towards setting in place preconditions under which  Australia would send troops was "not encouraging".    Australia wanted to see from the UN a proposal for a clear  and viable mission with a set timetable and the creation of a  political process to resolve the situation in Rwanda, he said.    The UN asked Australia to contribute about 300 troops to a  peace- keeping mission, nominating a number of specialist areas,  including movement control officers, engineers, signallers and  medical teams.    Ray said Australia was sympathetic to the problems of  Rwanda,  which has been ravaged by tribal fighting. But the deployment  of any Australian troops and their security remained a crucial  issue and if Australia sent a 180-member engineering unit, it  would most likely have to be accompanied by a rifle company of  about 120 soldiers for protection.    "If I cannot be assured of their protective security, we  don't send them in," he said. "We are intensely disturbed and  moved by what is happening in Rwanda. But the response has to  be one that will work. If you take the wrong course, you will  just make matters worse."    Aid groups estimate half a million people, mostly Tutsis,  have died in the bloodbath that erupted on April 6.    Ray also said the government was considering a request from  the Cambodian government for military assistance, a request made  of several other unnamed countries as well.</p>

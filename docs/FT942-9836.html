			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bank of Ireland at IPounds 280m A substantial drop in loan loss provisions and a turnround in its US and UK divisions were the main factors behind a IPounds 156m (Pounds 152.4m) surge in pre-tax profits at Bank of Ireland, the Republic's second largest clearing bank. The group reported sharply higher pre-tax profits of IPounds 280.1m on total income up 17 per cent to IPounds 983m (IPounds 841m) for the year ending March 31. This included IPounds 13.5m in profits resulting from the harmonisation of accounting dates of certain subsidiaries. Group loan loss provisions have fallen from IPounds 150m to IPounds 69m. The biggest drop was in its First New Hampshire subsidiary where provisions fell from IPounds 66m to just IPounds 7m. FNH put in profits of IPounds 11.2m, its first contribution since it was acquired in 1988. Interest income grew by 16 per cent to IPounds 646m, while other income  - derived mainly from fees and commissions - rose by 18 per cent to IPounds 337m. Operating expenses increased 12 per cent to IPounds 631m (IPounds 564m), although the underlying increase was only 2.9 per cent after adjusting for exchange translations. Corporate and treasury operations showed a 6 per cent decline in profits to IPounds 61.2m after an exceptionally good year in 1992-93 when the ERM currency crisis resulted in a sharp boost of activity. A strong performance was also recorded by other activities, primarily in Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages in the UK and by life assurance and investment services. Their contribution to group profits jumped from IPounds 3.5m to IPounds 58.3m. The Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio improved to 7.9 per cent (6.6 per cent). Mr Pat Molloy, group chief executive, said that expansion of its retail banking operations into the continental European market 'has been looked at' but ruled out, and that further growth in the group would therefore focus in its existing markets in Ireland, the UK and the US. He would neither conform nor deny that the bank was looking to buy a large mortgage portfolio in the UK from another institution, but said: 'We have been very encouraged by the success of BIHM in the UK and we expect to see substantial further growth in this market . . . I am open-minded about an acquisition.' Earnings were 35.2p (12.8p). A final dividend of 6.75p makes a total of 10.5p (9.83p). COMMENT After several years of poor performance, Bank of Ireland is once again firing on all cylinders having finally cleaned up the mess it drove into at full speed in New Hampshire. Steady earnings growth should result as its main markets all emerge from recession, with pre-tax profits of IPounds 300m and earnings of some 38p attainable in the current year. This puts the group on a prospective p/e of 6.9, which places it at the low end of the financial sector, which is hard to justify given its strong turnround and good business prospects.</p>

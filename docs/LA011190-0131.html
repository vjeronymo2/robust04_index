			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRIGHT TO SEEK STATE HEALTH STUDY OF LAB WORKERS, NEIGHBORS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: BILL WOULD FUND FULL-SCALE INQUIRY INTO EFFECTS OF WORKING WITH  TOXIC AND RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS AT ROCKWELL'S SANTA SUSANA LABORATORY.  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) saysshe will introduce legislation  to require a state health study of workers and neighbors of Rockwell  International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory in eastern Ventura County.  </P> <P> State health epidemiologists, responding to requests from area lawmakers and  concerned residents, recently began a feasibility study to determine if such an  investigation is warranted. But they said limited funds and competing research  requests might prevent a full-scale study of the field lab west of Chatsworth,  where Rockwell employees have worked for years with toxic and radioactive  materials.  </P> <P> The bill is "the vehicle whereby the study would have to be done and it would  also be funded by a special appropriation," said Michael Murphy, an aide to  Wright.  </P> <P> Murphy said the bill will be introduced within two weeks as an "urgency  measure" that would take effect when it is signed by the governor, instead of  Jan. 1.  </P> <P> In a related development, regional water quality officials, responding to an  inquiry from state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), said they have "acted with  dispatch" to clean up chemically tainted ground water at the 2,668-acre test  site in the Simi Hills.  </P> <P> However, the Jan. 5 letter from Robert P. Ghirelli, executive officer for the  Los Angeles office of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, did  not say why cleanup in the nuclear area at the field lab is years behind  cleanup elsewhere on the site -- which is apparently what triggered Torres'  inquiry.  </P> <P> A Torres aide said Tuesday that the lawmaker would have no comment until "we .  . . further study the response."  </P> <P> The letter to Torres, who chairs the Senate toxics committee, responded to  questions he posed last month about the board's performance in solving the  ground water problems. His inquiry followed release of new data showing that  solvent-contaminated ground water in the area of the lab, which has been  devoted to nuclear research for the U.S. Department of Energy, is flowing  toward the property line and may have seeped off-site.  </P> <P> There are no drinking-water wells in the immediate area, and officials say the  situation poses no direct threat to health. The main contaminant is  trichloroethylene, or TCE, a cleaning compound that may raise the risk of  cancer to those chronically exposed.  </P> <P> Rockwell is treating about 500,000 gallons per day of TCE-laced ground water in  areas of Santa Susana devoted to rocket testing for NASA and the Air Force.  </P> <P> However, no similar cleanup is under way in the Energy Department area of the  site, where Rockwell only recently installed a new series of monitoring wells  to better determine the extent of pollution.  </P> <P> Under the board's supervision, Rockwell began investigating ground water  contamination in the rocket testing areas in 1984 and later installed cleanup  equipment.  </P> <P> But in the 290 acres controlled by the Energy Department, detailed ground water  testing for TCE was not undertaken until last summer, after disclosures of  contamination there.  </P> <P> Ghirelli noted that the state Department of Health Services, in May, 1988, took  over from the water board as the "lead agency" supervising cleanup activities.  But he did not say why less work had been done in the Energy Department areas.  </P> <P> Critics of the department have long complained of a double standard in which  its operations often are years behind other industrial sites in complying with  environmental standards.  </P> <P> In May, 1986, Rockwell told the water board that it had found solvent pollution  in the Energy Department area, but could not conduct further tests for fear of  drawing radioactively contaminated water from the basement of a former reactor  building into the surrounding ground water. Rockwell said it was awaiting funds  from the Energy Department to decontaminate the building, and the water board  did not pursue the matter.  </P> <P> The department has proposed spending $34.6 million over several years to clean  up chemical and radioactive pollution, which appears to exist mainly at low  levels. Rockwell also will investigate whether TCE-laced ground water has  seeped beyond the area's boundary.  </P></p>

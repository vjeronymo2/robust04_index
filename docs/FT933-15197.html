			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sri Lankan tea sector shows clear signs of recovery - Privatisation has enhanced the estates' efficiency and increased production AFTER LAST year's exceptionally poor performance, Sri Lanka's tea industry is showing clear signs of recovery. While annual production in the recent past has regularly exceeded 200m kg, only 178m kg was produced in 1992, about 62m kg less than in 1991. The first six months' production this year suggests, however, that total output should reach 225m kg or slightly more. A severe drought, the first phase of privatisation and its accompanying dislocations, disruption of the former Soviet and Iraqi markets and sporadic labour unrest resulted in a revenue loss of more than USDollars 80m. Nevertheless, the government and the tea trade expect Sri Lanka to retain its traditional position as the largest exporter of tea. The prospects for 1993 are 'quite bright' according to one broker, while the trade speaks of the government's adoption of a new sales strategy. One of the most noteworthy achievements of the assassinated President Premadasa was the step-by-step privatisation of the plantations. Before independence the tea estates were owned by 'sterling' companies, all London-based and run by British planters with the help of several hundred thousand Tamil workers brought from South India, now Tamil Nadu. Thus, the Kandyan (hill country) Sinhalese peasantry were ousted from their traditional lands to make way for cheap indentured Indian labour. The alien presence in the island's heartland soon became an explosive political issue. Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the first Sinhalese leader from the Kandyan hill-country to become prime minister, signed two agreements with India for the repatriation of 500,000 Indian Tamils. Her Marxist minister of plantation industries in the United Front party that took office in 1970 went a step further. He nationalised the tea, rubber and coconut estates and placed them under two state corporations. President Premadasa played a different game. The leader of the powerful trade union controlling estate labour, Mr S Thondaman, became one of Mr Premadasa's most trusted allies. When the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank insisted on the re-structuring of the planation corporations, which were running at a loss, Mr Premadasa could rely on Mr Thondaman to accede to a compromise formula that the IMF and the bank also reluctantly accepted, under which the estates were not be returned to their previous owners but given to 22 management companies. 'The management companies have increased production by better supervision of estates run down by the two corporations,' says a senior official. 'But the answer is not increased yields but adjusting to new consumer tastes and becoming more competitive. The Sri Lanka name is still an advantage but we have to move rapidly to CTC (cut, tear and curl) teas' he adds. 'We have to sell tea like they sell Coca Cola.' The Ministry of Plantations and the Tea Board hope to increase production of CTC teas to 40m kg, or 20 per cent of total production by 1995 and to more than 100m kg by the year 2000. According to the tea trade there was overproduction in 1991 and now surplus stocks with packers and importing countries are exhausted or quite thin. The need to give higher priority to CTC, says a well-known tea planter, is now more urgent 'because consumers in two of our major markets, Egypt and Pakistan are showing an increased preference for CTC'. Another worry is competition from Georgia, Vietnam and Turkey. The planter suggests Sri Lanka should establish a few 'instant tea plants' with foreign collaboration, with the fast-growing US market in mind. In 1992, Sri Lanka's major buyers were Iran (24m kg, mainly bulk), Jordan (21.7m kg, mainly packets) Egypt (17m kg, mainly bulk), Syria (14.4m kg, mainly bulk), Saudi Arabia (11.2m kg, mainly packets) and the UK (10.9m kg, mainly bulk). The Scandinavian countries, Libya, Japan and Pakistan bought between 5m and 7m kg each. The re-appearance of the former Soviet Union as a buyer has heartened the tea trade. The hard currency payments are made through a series of intermediaries, including agents in Israel, 'as if the deal was handled by the KGB', observes Mr Ananda Pieris, a local tea broker.</p>

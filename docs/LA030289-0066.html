			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHLORINE LEAK'S IMPACT;  </P> <P> SIMI HIRES FIRM TO STUDY TOXIC MATERIALS PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Simi Valley officials have hired a consultant to help prepare a plan to handle  storage and disposal of hazardous materials nearly two months after a chlorine  gas leak forced the evacuation of 12,000 people.  </P> <P> The City Council's hiring Monday of a Ventura firm for $50,000 stems from a  months-old effort to improve the city's management of toxic materials, city  officials said. The Jan. 5 chlorine leak made that effort more urgent, they  said.  </P> <P> "The chlorine incident reinforced a feeling in the community and on the council  that many of these chemicals that we are dealing with . . . have got to be  handled a lot better than maybe they have been," Mayor Gregory Stratton said.  </P> <P> The city Department of Public Works on Monday presented to the council an  83-page report outlining 11 recommendations on how the city could keep a closer  eye on toxic materials and businesses that use them. The recommendations  included on-site inspections, planning and zoning laws to control where toxics  are stored or disposed of, and a household hazardous waste collection program.  </P> <P> The council hired the firm of Kennedy/Jenks/Chilton to analyze the report and  return in four to six months, possibly with additional measures. The study will  mainly focus on how the city can better coordinate its efforts with county,  state and federal agencies that also regulate toxic materials, Stratton said.  </P> <P> "There are about 15 different agencies that have their finger in it one way or  another," Stratton said. "What we're trying to do is become sort of an umbrella  organization . . . to make sure each of them gets what it needs."  </P> <P> For example, the city would make sure that new and existing businesses notify  other government bodies of all toxic materials storage, transportation or  disposal, he said.  </P> <P> Simi Valley officials would like the city to assume the lead role in handling  toxic materials within city boundaries, rather than have an outside regulatory  agency make the key decisions, said Ronald C. Coons, city director of public  works.  </P> <P> On Jan. 5, a poisonous chlorine gas leak from a 30-ton tank at Travelin' West  Textiles prompted the evacuations. Twenty people were injured.  </P> <P> Last month, a Simi Valley report said Simi Valley and Ventura County officials  reacted well during the 12-hour crisis.  </P></p>

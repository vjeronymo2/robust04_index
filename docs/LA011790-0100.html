			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBC PRESIDENT PLEADS FOR EASING OF CONSTRAINTS  </P> <P> With more than 8,000 people in attendance, 1990's convention of the National  Assn. of Television Programming Executives is the largest ever.  </P> <P> And along with more people, this annual marketplace for syndicated television  programs also features more participants from foreign countries -- including  China and the Soviet Union -- and a new crop of cable companies eager to  negotiate their share of the syndicated shows that traditionally have been  gobbled up by network affiliates and independent TV stations.  </P> <P> With such a varied, international and competitive guest list, it seemed only  fitting that NBC President Robert C. Wright, this year's keynote speaker, would  kick off the event Tuesday with his oft-voiced complaint about the government's  financial interest rulings, which prevent the networks from striking up  production and ownership deals with cable companies and other TV networks at  home and abroad.  </P> <P> Wright described the Big Three networks as being locked behind "a Berlin Wall"  denying them the right of free trade. He protested that, while cable can draw  revenues from its subscribers and advertisers, and syndicators and producers  may hawk their wares to virtually anyone, the networks remain locked into  gleaning profits from only one source: advertising.  </P> <P> Wright noted that Japan's Sony Corp.'s recent acquisition of Columbia Pictures  and Lorimar's purchase by Time Warner have already broken down traditional  barriers between the movie, music and television industries.  </P> <P> He said that he hopes the 1990s will bring "the financial techniques of motion  picture film making into television," allowing creative deal-making between  producers and networks.  </P> <P> "There are no boundaries anymore, except for the wall of network regulations  surrounding three companies -- ABC, CBS and NBC," he said.  </P> <P> Wright added that, if current regulations cause the networks to lose their  competitive edge in acquiring the best entertainment shows, their news, sports  and local programming could suffer as well. "If we stumble, and if we fall, all  of you are going to feel the impact," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- A delegation of the  South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) led by  vice-chairman of its Central Committee Hong Chi-yong paid visits  to Nepal, Cyprus and Syria from March 26 to April 18, the  Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported.    During the visits, the delegation had talks with delegations  of the Nepal Communist Party (United Marxist-Leninist), the  Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, the Communist Party of Cyprus  (AKEL) and the Socialist Party of Cyprus.    At the talks the parties highly estimated the activities of  Hanminjon for independence, democracy and reunification and  expressed full support and solidarity for its struggle. They  strongly demanded a prompt end to the tricky row of the U.S.  imperialists and the traitor Kim Yong-sam over "nuclear  suspicion" against the North of Korea and the withdrawal of U.S.  troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea.    Hanminjon and the parties published joint statements and  joint communiques expressing the willingness to support and  closely cooperate with each other in the accomplishment of the  cause of global independence and socialism against the  imperialists' aggressive and belligerent moves and expand and  strengthen mutual contacts and solidarity. The Hanminjon  delegation met and conversed with leaders of the afore-said  parties.    They informed each other of their party activities and  agreed  on strengthening solidarity. The party leaders voiced support  for the struggle of Hanminjon and the South Korean people for  independence, democracy and reunification and denounced the U.S.  imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam regime of traitors for their  moves to fascistize the South Korean society, keep the nation  divided and provoke another war.    The Hanminjon delegation enjoyed full support and warm  welcome everywhere it toured.    The Nepal Communist Party (United Marxist-Leninist) and the  Nepal Workers and Peasants Party organised special lectures,  local tour and functions in welcome of the delegation, while the  Arab Socialist Baath Party of Syria hosted a roundtable talk at  the high institute of political science under the party.    The Arab solidarity committee for encouragement to the  struggle of Hanminjon and the South Korean people comprising six  international organizations including the International Arab  Confederation of Arab Trade Unions held a solidarity meeting and  released a joint statement denouncing the U.S. imperialists and  the traitor Kim Yong-sam for rendering the situation of the  Korean peninsula extremely strained, while taking issue with the  nuclear activities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  It also adopted an appeal to the world peaceloving people,  international organizations and political parties and  organizations of all countries calling for the abolition of the  "National Security Law," the release of political prisoners and  the sending to the North of Kim In-so, Ham Se-hwan and other  unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea.    Such a meeting was held and a joint statement condemning the  aggressive and belligerent moves of the U.S. imperialists and  the traitor Kim Yong-sam was adopted by the solidarity committee  of political parties and fronts in the Middle East and North  African area supporting the struggle of Hanminjon and the South  Korean people comprising 24 political parties and fronts  including the Palestine Liberation Organization in Damascus, the  Communist Parties of Syria, Iraq and Jordan and the Socialist  Progressive Party of Lebanon.</p>

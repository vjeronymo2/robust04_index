			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Greek inflation edges to 10.4% Greece's annual inflation rate rose to 10.4 per cent in April from 10.2 per cent the previous month, according to figures released yesterday by the national statistical service. Monthly consumer prices were up by 1.5 per cent, the result of a new tax on heating fuel and higher food prices. Rises in household rents and petrol prices also contributed to the rise. Last month's rise reverses a year-long trend that has seen inflation fall steadily from a peak of 16.4 per cent in March 1993. However, Greece's inflation rate is still more than three times the EU average. The government, hoping to meet the target of single-digit inflation by the third quarter of 1994, has avoided price rises for electricity and transport, despite pressure from public utilities. Kerin Hope, Athens West German insolvencies rose by 29.7 per cent in February from a year earlier to 1,710 cases, the Federal Statistics Office said.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cristina Indio do Brasil] </F>   [Text] The PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] yesterday  succeeded in preventing the vote on the Social Emergency Fund  [FSE] from being considered a priority issue of the  constitutional reform.    Congress President Senator Humberto Lucena scheduled another  session of the constitutional reform for today, when the  government will have a new chance to see the FSE approved.    The Congress again met without voting on a measure linked to  the economic stabilization program because of a lack of quorum.  They should have voted on the government request that voting on  the FSE be considered a priority. Only 279 congressmen were on  the floor, while the presence of at least 293 congressmen is  required for the vote.    Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who spent almost  10 hours in Congress holding separate meetings with the PPR and  the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party to discuss approval of  the measure, said that the government has nothing more to  negotiate:    [Begin recording] The only thing that I want to make very  clear is that there is nothing more to negotiate, because every  minute something new is invented. Everyone is currently  defending his or her own interests. It is natural for one to  defend one's own interests. The problem is that no one is  thinking about the country's interests; no one is worrying about  society's interests. By saying no one, I am exaggerating. The  truth is that a large number of people are not thinking about  the country's interests.    I believe we are having a very serious crisis. The Congress  overcame the crisis resulting from the corruption CPI  [Congressional Investigating Committee] and began the inactivity  crisis. [end recording]    Despite all, the finance minister hopes that in the session  scheduled for 1100 this morning Congress can make a decision  regarding the amendment that creates the FSE. The minister said  that he will talk to President Itamar Franco, who has supported  all negotiations between government and Congress. He added that  the Congress' failure to adopt a clear position has created a  governability crisis in the country.</p>

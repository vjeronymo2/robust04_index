			<p>Confronted     by a significant expansion of South Korean  shipbuilding  capacity, Japanese shipbuilders are reportedly  opting to coexist, rather than compete, with South Korean  shipbuilders through technological cooperation and division of  labor.  According to the 16 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japanese  shipbuilders are seeking to expand cooperative relationships with  the South Korean shipbuilding industry, which surpassed Japan in  1993 in the tonnage of shipbuilding orders received.  The  Japanese firms' current overtures--coming on the heels of a  recent deal between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and South Korea's  Samsung Heavy Industries--reportedly mark a ''major change" in the  business strategy of Japanese shipbuilding companies.  In the  past they had sought to dissuade South Korean shipbuilders from  increasing production capacity in order to avoid a worldwide  plunge in ship prices.  Now, with capital investment by South  Korean shipbuilders having increased to a level that even  Japanese shipbuilders cannot match, Japanese companies have  reportedly decided to adopt a new strategy to cooperate and share  work, rather than compete with their South Korean counterparts.     According to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the strategy of the leading  Japanese shipbuilding firms is now focused on forming an  international shipbuilding consortium.  To this end, the paper  reported,  Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) has asked  Samsung to join a group composed of IHI, Sumitomo Heavy  Industries and an Italian shipbuilder to participate in the bid  for a fifth Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) tanker for the Korean Gas  Corporation.  The paper also reported that IHI hopes Samsung's  participation will increase the group's heretofore low chance of  winning the bid.  In return, IHI has offered Samsung  technological assistance in building LNG tankers, it added.     (AUTHOR:  INNES.

			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS SPIRIT BRINGS TOP ACTS TO RECORD IN S.D.  </P> <P> Four years ago, nearly 20 big-name recording artists got together in the studio  as Band Aid and cut a single called "Do They Know It's Christmas?" to raise  money for famine relief in Ethiopia.  </P> <P> This year, in a San Diego-only benefit, an equally formidable cast of  major-league pop, rock and country stars -- from Brian Wilson and Stevie Nicks  to Loretta Lynn and the Oak Ridge Boys -- will contribute a song each to "The  Stars Come Out for Christmas," a compilation of Christmas tunes to benefit  Children's Hospital &amp; Health Center.  </P> <P> Organizers figure they can sell 12,000 copies of the local production,  scheduled for late November release on cassette and compact disc only, which  will be sold exclusively in San Diego via mail order at a price not yet  determined.  </P> <P> According to the project's producer, Steve Vaus, 100% of the proceeds will go  to the nonprofit health-care facility.  </P> <P> "Nine or 10 years ago, I used to go to the hospital's play room with my guitar  each Christmas season and play carols for the kids," said Vaus, who at the time  was a struggling singer-songwriter in constant pursuit of more nightclub work.  </P> <P> But today, as the head of a successful production company and recording studio  that, since 1984, has produced commercial jingles for dozens of local and  national businesses, Vaus said he's "finally in a position to help these kids  in a substantially bigger way."  </P> <P> "Roughly 40% of the hospital's patients do not have the ability to pay for  their health care," said Vaus, 37, who is donating both his time and the use of  his studio to the project. "So fund-raising is essential for the hospital to  continue providing needy children with free medical treatment.  </P> <P> "I've always felt that those of us who have gifts or talents have a special  responsibility to share those gifts or talents with those less fortunate. And  what better time to do it than at Christmas?"  </P> <P> Most of the heavyweight contributors to the project are sending in previously  recorded tracks, including Nicks ("Silent Night"), Lynn ("Shadrach the Black  Reindeer") and Lee Greenwood ("Oh Holy Night").  </P> <P> But at least five will be flying into San Diego during the first two weeks in  October to record fresh tracks -- either standards or originals -- at Vaus' The  Studio in Kearny Mesa.  </P> <P> Among them: Brian Wilson, with his own newly penned "Christmas All Around the  World"; the Commodores, with their version of "We Three Kings," and Juice  Newton, with her arrangement of "The First Noel."  </P> <P> "What's significant about this project, aside from raising money for the  hospital, is the fact that we're accomplishing something in industry terms that  people never thought possible -- we're getting major artists to record in San  Diego," Vaus said.  </P> <P> The idea of producing music to raise money for Children's Hospital was first  brought up several years ago, he said.  </P> <P> "I had done a theme song for the hospital for their annual telethon, and we  discussed the possibility of making a charity album featuring only my  material," Vaus recalled. "But frankly, I didn't think they would be able to  raise too much money on that.  </P> <P> "Still, we kept talking for the next few years, and then maybe two months ago  it struck me that perhaps we could get major artists to do Christmas carols for  a compilation album."  </P> <P> Vaus' concept was enthusiastically endorsed by the hospital's fund-raising arm,  the Children's Hospital Foundation, said telethon coordinator Sarah Boehmer.  </P> <P> "We were thrilled and delighted," she said. "We rely heavily on fund-raising  efforts in our community because of the amount of uncompensated care we provide  to needy patients, and we're always eager to explore other avenues to raise  money aside from our annual telethon."  </P> <P> Given the go-ahead, Vaus and Children's Hospital Foundation volunteers  immediately went to work.  </P> <P> The first step was lining up sponsors "so we could guarantee the participating  artists that 100% of the proceeds would go to the hospital," Vaus said.  </P> <P> Star Systems, an automated teller machine network, agreed to underwrite  production, manufacturing and distribution costs -- estimated at nearly  $40,000. Eagle Limousines agreed to provide visiting artists with free  transportation; the San Diego Marriott Hotel agreed to provide them with free  accommodations. The next step was lining up the artists. In mid-August, Vaus  said, he sent letters "to just over 100 acts, asking for their help."  </P> <P> "It was pretty much a shotgun approach. We went through all the music trade  magazines and pulled out the names of significant artists we thought would be  able to either take a traditional Christmas song and do something special with  it or else come up with a suitable original tune.  </P> <P> "There weren't too many people we ruled out -- except for such obvious ones as  Ozzy Osbourne," he laughed. "Somehow, we felt he just wouldn't fit in on a  Christmas album."  </P> <P> The response, Vaus said, was overwhelmingly positive.  </P> <P> "We frankly didn't have a clue about what to expect. Trying to pull together  such a wide variety of top recording artists for an album benefiting a local  charity, we didn't know if we'd get turned down flat by everyone or what.  </P> <P> "But, as it turned out, we must have hit a common chord or two -- Christmas and  children. I'm really amazed by the fact that so many people have agreed to take  part in this project. We're forced to do a double album as opposed to our  original intention of doing just a single, 10-song album.  </P> <P> "And I can't tell you how many of these artists have told me this sounds to  them like it's going to be the most impressive Christmas record ever done, and  that they'd like to get a personal copy not for their files, but for their  enjoyment."  </P> <P> Still, there were plenty of disappointments, Vaus said.  </P> <P> "We never heard back from Michael Jackson, we were rejected out of hand by  Linda Ronstadt, and Kenny Rogers' people said no, too. They told us that at  this point in Kenny's career, they felt his participation would lead to  overexposure. I fail to see how 12,000 records, available only in San Diego,  could lead to overexposure, but certainly they have a master plan for his  career that makes sense to them.  </P> <P> "We also lost a couple of artists we wanted to have because they're on Warner  Bros. Records, the only major label that refused to cooperate. Emmylou Harris  and Peter Cetera were each willing to contribute a previously recorded  Christmas track they had done, but Warner Bros. has this corporate policy that  doesn't allow anyone to use their masters."  </P> <P> This year's benefit is the first, but hopefully not the last, Vaus said.  </P> <P> "We consider this to be a pilot for future years," he said. "If we're as  successful as I think we're going to be, I plan on doing this on an annual  basis."  </P> <P> His "ultimate dream," Vaus added, "is to make these albums available nationwide  to raise money not just for the Children's Hospital in San Diego, but for all  170 hospitals around the country that are part of what they call the Children's  Miracle Network.  </P></p>

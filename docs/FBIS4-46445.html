			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Punctuation as published] </F>   [Excerpts] Zele/Brussels, KURDISH NEWS AGENCY--President  Suleyman Demirel has recently mentioned several times that the  "question of terrorist activities" has been resolved and the  Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] has been crushed. Demirel's remarks  usually came after an argument on the question of the retirement  of General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff.    However, Demirel has said in the meetings he has held with  businessmen and the opening ceremonies of various establishments  that he fears what may happen in June. He stressed that a  multisided and unpreventable political crisis will emerge if the  present situation is allowed to continue in Turkey. [passage  omitted]    The KURDISH NEWS AGENCY has asked the PKK circles to comment  on the matter. Cemil Bayik, head of the Kurdish People's  Liberation Army [KPLA] Military Council, and Kani Yilmaz,  representative of the Kurdish People's Liberation Front in  Europe, conveyed their views to the news agency by telephone.  [passage omitted]    Bayik said: "If the Turkish Republic's and the Turkish  newspapers' propaganda that the PKK has been crushed is true,  then why do they maintain their struggle? It is meaningful that  Demirel fears what may happen in June. He has already mentioned  the possibility of significant political instability. He has  begged the businessmen and warned them that the PKK will have  achieved its wish and objective if a negative development takes  place."    Stressing that the PKK has achieved significant success in  increasing the number of its militants from 30,000 to 60,000 in  1994, Bayik asserted that the 500,000-strong Turkish military  forces have failed to stand against KPLA's guerrilla forces.  <H5>  The State Is Killing Its Own Soldiers </H5>   Cemil Bayik asserted the following: "The Turkish military  units are ambushed every day. They suffer hundreds of  casualties. The State of Emergency Governor's Office has  claimed that the military units kill 50-100 guerrillas every day  and that they have destroyed the PKK. All that is a trite  tactic in psychological warfare. We found the remains of 15  soldiers on Kato Mountain yesterday. The traces of burns on  their bodies indicated that chemical weapons were used in that  area. We monitor their radio communications. The communicators  talk in English from time to time. They inform each other that  that type of weapon should not be used in this or that place  because of the presence of military units."    Bayik stressed that the incident on Kato Mountain has  indicated that the military forces, which are in a helpless  situation, have used chemical arms on their own units. He  described that as a development which has unveiled the barbaric  nature of the Turkish State. Cemil Bayik also said that the  incident clarified the situation to many families who have asked  for information on where their sons have been.    Bayik stressed that the statements that the PKK has been  either crushed or weakened or suppressed are aimed at misleading  the international media organs. He said: "They are trying to  strengthen their morale and hide their failure by waging  psychological warfare. They are convinced that their effort  will obstruct recruits from joining the PKK. The daily  statements that are issued by the State of Emergency Governor's  Office are unfounded. They are aimed at strengthening the  morale of the military units."    Cemil Bayik also commented on the "package on democracy." He  said: "It will provide for an increase in the number of village  guards, establishment of tribal political parties, cooperation  with Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK] leader Mas'ud Barzani,  programs aimed at suppressing the people. In fact, that is why  the Turkish officials provoke the clashes in southern Kurdistan  [northern Iraq]. Their objective is to create fratricide among  the Kurds. However, their effort will fail to yield results.  We have been trying to end the clashes in northern Iraq right  from the beginning. We have supported the people's just  demands." [passage omitted]    Bayik stressed that international circles have focused  significant attention on the proposals Abdullah Ocalan made in  the message he conveyed to the conference the Kurds held in  Europe some time ago and noted that they have moved to put  pressure on Turkey to force the Turkish officials to agree to  them for the solution of the Kurdish problem. [passage omitted]    Yilmaz said that the Turkish State established June as its  target in the special war it wages against the Kurdish people.  He asserted: "The Turkish Republic's move against Kurdistan  and the bombing of Kurdistan's territory are linked with its  target, which is June. The Turkish officials are aware that a  military defeat will worsen the economic crisis and political  instability. That will create a chaotic situation in Turkey.  That is why the present government has moved to determine how  long we should live. However, whether that government will  survive until June is debatable." [passage omitted]    Yilmaz also commented on how the DPK has been encouraged to  attack the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK]. He drew  attention to PKK's initiatives to end the fighting and stressed  that the DPK is not an organization that acts according to its  own free will. In fact, he said that the DPK organized its  onslaught against the PUK in cooperation with Turkey. Yilmaz  asserted: "Most probably, Germany, France, and Iraq are also  involved in that operation. Mas'ud Barzani attacked the PKK  together with the Turkish military forces in 1992. He has been  encouraged by the Turkish military forces and the Western  countries to attack PUK at the present time. The DPK is a  collaborationist and treacherous organization, which wishes to  create fratricide in Kurdistan. Those who engage in such  activities must not be expected to agree to establish peace.  They have no will of their own."</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Fight for right to clear names - The Fayed brothers' case against the UK government Alone among Council of Europe countries, the UK denies its citizens an effective remedy, if the state brands them as dishonest and criminal without the right to a fair trial. So say the Fayed brothers, owners of the House of Fraser stores group which includes Harrods in London. Publicly condemned by the Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report into their 1985 takeover of the House of Fraser for dishonestly misleading the authorities - a charge they have always disputed - Messrs Mohamed, Ali and Salah Fayed claim they have been denied the right to clear their names. They have taken their fight to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Their case is that the denial of effective access to a domestic court to defend their right to honour and reputation and the denial of effective domestic remedies to challenge the DTI inspectors' findings amount to a breach of articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Last week's oral hearing followed the rejection last summer of the Fayeds' case by the European Commission of Human Rights. The court's judgment is not expected until the autumn. Victory for the Fayeds might not only force the UK government to change the procedures of company investigations and tribunals of inquiry, such as Lord Justice Scott's current arms to Iraq inquiry. It could, in the words of Lord Lester QC, the Fayeds' counsel, 'secure stronger national judicial protection of individuals in the UK whose basic human rights and freedoms are decisively affected by administrative actions'. On the other hand, defeat, as Lord Lester told the Strasbourg judges, 'would inevitably mean that in the UK, public authorities - including government-appointed investigators and government itself - would be able publicly to defame an individual with impunity; the victim would be prevented from seeking any redress in national courts; and the convention would be unable to protect him from a violation of his human rights'. Mr Michael Cole, House of Fraser's director of public affairs, said that, by taking their case to Strasbourg, the Fayeds were not seeking to hinder public debate or hamper investigations into financial malpractice. Neither were they asking the court to clear their names. They were simply seeking to ensure that individuals accused of serious misconduct enjoyed due process of law and that there were adequate safeguards in English law against the misuse of public powers. The case they advance is a powerful one. Lord Lester told the judges there was no doubt the central conclusion of the DTI inspectors' report was that the Fayeds were guilty of dishonest misrepresentation. In the eyes of the world the report, published by the government, had the force of a judgment delivered after a lengthy trial at which the Fayeds had been convicted. But there had been no trial and criminal charges had never been brought. The government had even decided not to seek to have the Fayeds disqualified as company directors. The Fayeds' civil right to a good reputation had been drastically and decisively interfered with by the process, Lord Lester said. The procedures governing DTI company investigations afforded no safeguards for the rights of those under investigation. Hearings are held in private. Inspectors are free to decide how they conduct their inquiries. They do not have to inform those under investigation of the identity of witnesses against them. Those under investigation have no right to confront or cross-examine witnesses and no right to see the evidence against them. Inspectors can rely on evidence that would be inadmissible in a court. And the secretary of state has a broad discretion to publish a report. Lord Lester said this 'unfair' system of company investigations had been heavily criticised in recent years - most recently in a debate in the House of Lords in February. It carried a disproportionate risk of unnecessary harm to individuals. Measures were needed to minimise that harm, either by introducing greater procedural safeguards such as the right to cross-examine witnesses, or by providing real and effective access to the courts to challenge the inspectors' findings. Lord Lester said the Fayeds had no effective remedy of any kind against publication of a condemnatory report and the damage it caused. A libel action against the secretary of state or the inspectors would have been struck out on the grounds that what they had published was privileged. An action based on a separate libel against the Observer newspaper, for articles written about the Fayeds in connection with the House of Fraser takeover, was not an effective remedy against publication by the government. And English judicial review was too restrictive to provide any redress. The government's response, put by Mr Michael Baker QC, was equally robust. It said that company investigations were not designed to determine whether individuals were entitled to the reputations they enjoyed. Company investigations were not trials; their purpose was to ascertain the facts about a company's affairs and report them to the secretary of state. Any damage to the Fayeds' reputations was an incidental consequence. They themselves were largely responsible for any harm caused, both by the manner in which they conducted themselves and in the substance of their evidence to the inspectors. Mr Baker said that, in essence, the Fayeds were arguing for a full right of appeal against inspectors' reports, although they could have used judicial review to challenge any perverse or arbitrary decision of the inspectors or the secretary of state. If they felt the inspectors had been biased, or had misled them or their advisers, or had reached conclusions unsupported by the facts - all allegations that the Fayeds had made on the day after publication of the report - they could have sought a judicial review. But they did not. They also failed to seek a judicial review of the secretary of state's decision to publish the report. By not doing this and by failing to pursue the Observer, they had not exhausted their domestic remedies, as required by the convention. In spite of the rejection last year of the Fayeds' case by the European Commission of Human Rights, Lord Lester remains optimistic. The commission was often overturned by the full court, he said yesterday. The court's reception of his submission of evidence showing that the UK alone among Council of Europe countries fails to provide an effective remedy to those under investigation for alleged financial or commercial malpractice gave him most confidence. In Germany, for example, publication of such a report would be illegal if the authorities had not also indicted the individuals concerned. In Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands, no administrative body has the power to publish a report imputing serious criminal misconduct to named individuals. Even in the US, where freedom of speech is jealously guarded, an inspectors' report could not have been published by the government if the individuals concerned had not had the right to know the evidence on which the findings were based or to confront and cross-examine witnesses. The UK government appeared to have no answer to this evidence. Mr Baker argued that what happened in other countries was of little value to a case involving the UK. But, said Lord Lester, the court did not seem impressed with that line of reasoning. If he is right, the House of Fraser saga may yet be the unlikely vehicle for an improvement in human rights in the UK.</p>

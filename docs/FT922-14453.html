			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Dutch railways grind to a halt A LONE worker cleans the deserted platform of Amsterdam Central Station yesterday as Dutch rail workers staged a nationwide strike bringing trains to a virtual standstill throughout the country, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. 'The strike is almost total. Only a handful of trains were running this morning,' a spokesman for the state-owned national railway said. The country's FNV transport union called the strike after pay negotiations broke down last week. It is expected to last throughout today. ANP, the Dutch news agency, reported traffic queues of more than 60 miles on some of the country's main roads.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Demetrio Villaurrutia from Colombia] </F>   [Text] Our commander in chief's first address during the 14  June morning session of the fourth Ibero-American summit was  followed by another. This was a closed-door session held at the  Convention Center. The address came during a debate regarding  democracy in Latin America, which included a clear reference to  Cuba. Brazilian President Itamar Franco then stated that the  only way Latin American peoples can help is by joining efforts  in supporting Cuba and its reintegration into the OAS. This  motivated Fidel to speak and I believe it is important for all  our listeners throughout Cuba to listen to his words.    [Begin Castro recording] I want to -- since my country,  Cuba,  has been mentioned repeatedly by several of the speakers --  first of all give thanks to those who care about Cuba. I can  feel a sincerity in what they have said. This is why I have  applauded each one. I know that at times when I speak, some do  not applaud. That is fine. I respect that. I believe this is a  democratic thing and each has to do what they believe is  pertinent. I have applauded everyone, some more enthusiastically  than others. From everyone I have truly felt -- and I thank you  for it -- a concern about Cuba.    It caught my attention, however -- this is why I appreciate  so much President Itamar Franco's gesture -- that not a word has  been said about the unfair, criminal, and inhuman blockade which  for over 30 years has been imposed against Cuba; the largest  ever blockade in the history of a Latin American country with  which no dialogue is sought. What is sought is to smother Cuba  in blood and make it surrender by hunger. This is the reality.    I would have liked to hear, within that Latin American  spirit, some reference to this. I believe our people also  deserve commendation if we keep in mind the heroism, firmness,  and dignity with which they have resisted for over 30 years the  U.S. blockade and aggression. Later on, we were left alone.  Many, when left alone, surrender. Yet we have not surrendered.  We have continued fighting because we are aware that we are  defending the dignity, sovereignty, and independence of the  peoples of Latin America. This is, precisely, what Marti wanted  with Cuba's independence.    It amazes me that not a word has been said to the effect  that  Cuba is the country which has advanced the most socially in the  history of this hemisphere. We have done so much that I believe  we have done more than what was possible. Not a single word has  been said, as we speak about the social crisis in this  hemisphere and so many closed schools, to the effect that our  country, subjected to a double blockade, has not closed a single  hospital, a single school. It has not abandoned anyone. Our  country, even under the most difficult conditions, has struggled  and resisted.    In a hemisphere, which as you know well, whatever our  current, present, or definitive -- as you will --  accomplishments may be, which please me to no end....[pauses] We  know, however, that this hemisphere where we all live has the  worst distribution in the whole wide world by far. I am talking  about our region, with exceptions, of course, in certain  countries. This is the region with the worst distribution of  national income in the world and where so much remains to be  done. Yet, not a single word is said about it.    It also surprises me that not a single word has been said  about the joint position which we should present at the  notorious Miami summit. This is very important, vital, and  looming close.    Finally, I would like to state that I respect your views. I  sincerely respect your thoughts, concepts, and ideas about  democracy. We should hold a summit to discuss what is democracy  and what is meant by people's participation; what does it mean  that millions of people die in this hemisphere every year from  disease and hunger, millions who could be saved. It is our duty  to think about all of this if we are democratic, if we are human.    We have our ideas and views on democracy and do not feel  ashamed of them. With these views we have resisted and struggled  for 35 years. I believe the blows we have endured during these  35 years -- we cannot forget history -- since we were first  blockaded, way before the declaration of the socialist character  of the Revolution, when we were blockaded and our sugar quota  was apportioned among all ....[pauses] Cuba was left practically  alone with the highly noble exception of Mexico which maintained  ties and relations with us. I respect everyone's views. I  believe that if we are to speak about democracy, we have to  speak of a multiplicity of views and opinions. I ask that our  views be respected in the same manner that we respect yours.  This said, I thank you once more for the concern you have  expressed regarding Cuba. Thank you very much.

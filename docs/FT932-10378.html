			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Special Report on Clocks, Watches and Jewellery: Rugged and so fashionable - Sports Watches SPORTS WATCHES are today's fashion accessories and those who use them can be divided neatly into two categories: those who wear them for their cachet and those who are serious about their sport and want the watch most appropriate to it. Fashion-conscious wearers put a high priority on style. The watch must bear the brand name that will impress the right people and, almost incidentally, be ready for action should it encounter anything deeper than a champagne bucket. The sports enthusiast will put reliability and ruggedness at the top of the list. A few watches pass muster on both counts. In the last few years, one established company has forged ahead of the competition in this market and is considered by many to be the sports watch  -TAG-Heuer. It is certainly a fashionable brand but, above all, it is a serious sports watch. As timekeepers to Formula 1 motor racing - and a sister company to the McLaren racing team - TAG-Heuer is actively involved in sport and has grown to become the sixth largest Swiss watch maker, in terms of sales value. Its 6000 range, which reached the shops towards the end of last year, is already in great demand, achieving cult status in certain markets - and especially the UK. Also in the serious but fashionable league is Breitling - a Swiss company established in 1844. It makes watches that appeal to air and sea professionals, as well as providing frequent travellers with a timekeeping device that offers three time zones at a glance on the Antares World model, which has a non-magnetic steel case designed to withstand great depths. It costs Pounds 1155. Chopard is a name that some associate with jewellery and watch designs with moving diamonds, but this innovative company takes sports watches seriously. It is the sponsor of, and competitor in, the Mille Miglia vintage car rally in Italy and produces a selection of sports chronographs, including the 1000 Miglia. Prices are from Pounds 545 in steel to around Pounds 5,000 in 18ct gold. Another timepiece of interest to car enthusiasts, as well as those who prefer to walk, is the Porsche Design compass watch, made by IWC. The light-weight titanium-cased watch hinges to reveal a compass. The bracelet can easily be detached so that the 5mm wide links can be used as a measure on a map. The Altiland, by Revue Thommen, has a steel case and is water-resistant to 30 metres. It incorporates a mechanical altimeter and a barometric scale, as well as an oil-mounted compass that is also water resistant. The same company also makes a watch for golfers, called the Greenmark. To the sailing fraternity Corum is the most desirable watch. This year it is introducing a new model with three off-centre dials that show tidal movements, moon phases and high and low tides, water levels and next tides. It also features a calendar. It has a self-winding mechanical movement and has been tested by the French Navy's Hydrographic and Marine Department. This is a serious watch for seafarers and will be available in a steel and 18ct gold case with a leather strap or steel and gold bracelet. It is water resistant to a depth of 100m and costs Pounds 3815. Omega is one of many companies producing divers' watches, but its latest model is rather special. The Seamaster Professional Chrono Diver, should be in the shops later this year and has a chronometer, is water resistant to 120 metres, and made in men's and women's sizes. Two of the major Japanese manufacturers, Seiko and Citizen, cater for divers with watches designed to make diving safer. Another respected manufacturer, widely used by sportsmen, is Zenith. Its Rainbow collection with a remarkable self-winding mechanical chronograph movement is another that must be considered seriously. These cost from Pounds 799 in steel to Pounds 8949 in gold. Sector, a company which sponsors sportsmen and women in some of the most hair-raising sports such as base jumping and free diving. Prices from Pounds 115 to Pounds 600. Another brand in this category is Ellesse, a designer brand in the tennis world. Ellesse make sports watches for men and women. Prices are from Pounds 55 for fun designs up to Pounds 295 for bracelet models with water-resistance. Gucci also makes a sports watch, the 9700, that is water resistant to 100 metres. Higher up the price spectrum, is the Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso, designed more than 60 years ago for polo players. The ultimate in combining sports and elegance may be the Piaget jewellery Polo, available in two versions each for men and and set with up to 345 diamonds, costing Pounds 38,400 and Pounds 30,750.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Finance Minister Derek Keys at Parliament House </F> in Cape Town -- live; italicized passages in Afrikaans]    [Text] Madam Speaker, it's my duty and privilege to present  to this house and to the nation the proposals of the government  of national unity for the budget for the year ending 31 March  1995. These proposals have been formulated against the  background of a sound fiscal performance in the previous year.  The deficit was virtually as budgeted, and in the knowledge  that a continuation of the general structure of taxation set in  place last year puts progressive reduction of the budget deficit  in the future within our reach. [sentence as heard]    For this to come to pass, however, continued control of the  level of expenditure is vital. Consequently the government has  taken particular care in deciding on the treatment of two  issues, which are germane in this respect -- namely, funding to  spearhead the Reconstruction and Development Program, and the  treatment of the costs of our transition to democracy.    The president's first words to his cabinet emphasized the  overriding importance of reconstruction and development in the  work and life of this government, and in his opening address in  this house he reinforced this. All members of the cabinet  responded to this message and its challenge. This challenge as  we now conceive it is much more comprehensive than any  particular suite of projects and consists of nothing less than  focussing the nation's efforts on properly meeting the needs and  aspirations of all its people. Some of these needs are simple  -- shelter and the basic elements of hygiene. Some are more  complex -- an education that will allow its subjects to  contribute for a lifetime in this modern technological world.  Many are more complex still -- arranging our society in a way  that offers everyone the greatest freedom of choice and the  enjoyment of personal liberty.    Every part of our society, every citizen, has a role to play  in this transformation. Every activity needs to be judged by  its relevance to this process and adjusted accordingly.  Government is no exception to this. The activities of every  department need to be rethought and ennobled. This process has  started. Government must also play a pathfinding role for the  community, provide the spearhead in the form of specific  concentrated initiatives, and it is for this aspect that funding  provision musts be made.    As indicated in the president's speech, this year will see  the allocation of 2.5 billion rand to the Reconstruction and  Development Program [RDP] Fund, a special instrument being  created by legislation which will shortly be before the house.  These funds have been found from decreases within the budgeted  level of departmental expenditure -- in other words, without  increasing the planned level of total spending. A list of the  amounts contributed appears in the budget review. In this  process the social service departments have naturally been  largely spared. This diversion of funds represents slightly  less than 3 percent of the current level of consumption spending  by general government, and it is our judgment that an additional  figure of this order can be similarly and additionally diverted  in each of the next four years without thereby increasing the  overall level of expenditure in real terms. In the planning  budgets for those years we have therefore pencilled in the  figures of 5 billion, 7.5 billion, 10 billion, and 12.5 billion  for transmission to the RDP Fund, and the appropriations for all  other departments will be required to adjust downward to  accommodate this.    The steady build-up of these amounts over this extended  period allows both for the existing government machine to plan  the adjustments needed, and for the new spending directions to  be organized effectively and to develop their own momentum.  Applying even the initial 2.5 billion rand effectively before  31 March 1995 already represents a real challenge which the new  government structure is planning to meet in a methodical and  carefully managed way.    As the responsible minister has explained, these fiscal  injections represent only a part, though a very important part,  of the program in its entirety. They will be supplemented by  contributions from other governments and from the private  sector, while the departments themselves have many programs of  their own that can qualify as part of the larger program. We  are therefore justified, we believe, in regarding the process  set in train, as providing ample ammunition for this long-term  campaign. There is no further need to pursue calculations  regarding the ultimate cost of its completion. Instead, we have  a process in which we can have confidence and which will develop  as we progress. This process is made possible by a vision of  where we are heading and how we want to get there. It will  allow for programs that stretch over several fiscal years.  Before we pass on from this topic, however, we should note that  it will be vulnerable to two failures which we must guard  against. If we allow the overall level of expenditure to climb  in real terms, we will imperil the allocations which can be  made. Equally important, if we do not produce a sound,  effective, and attractive program, nobody will be able to  motivate the department sufficiently to bring about the future  diversions of spending which we plan.    Now let us turn to the question of the transition costs. In  order to smooth the path of transition it was necessary -- who  could deny it -- for us to have a period in which a Transitional  Executive Council was active at the heart of government, and to  create and give free rein to an Independent Electoral Commission  to manage a free and fair election. BotP?&amp;?6?es delivered  what  was required of them, but both were operating in unchartered  territory under extreme pressure from time to time, and most of  the time, and neither of them, subject to the need to find the  income needed to cover any items of expenditure they considered  necessary. [sentence as heard] Through the grace of God we have  had a wonderful transition, but we incurred costs of 4 billion  rand. A list of these will be found in the budget revue. From  the point of view of fiscal discipline this is regrettable. If  left without response, such a minus could wipe out all the  pluses that this government deserves for its commitment to the  responsible economic governance of the country. Worse still, it  could inhibit us from taking the dynamic growth-inducing steps  that are called for now that the elections have freed us from so  many other constraints.    We think the citizens of this country look to us to act  boldly and to free ourselves as soon as possible from the  consequences of past actions. We also think that every income  earner in this country can be profoundly grateful that our  transition has gone so very well. We think, therefore, that we  should join together in meeting the greater part of this bill,  put it behind us, and go on unhindered to exploit the exciting  potential now available to us. In plain language that means that  the government is proposing to levy individual and company  taxpayers an amount equal to 5 percent of their taxable income.  There are some important ameliorations to this. Firstly, all  taxpayers will have the benefit of an abatement of 50,000 rand.  Consequently, taxpayers earning less than this, which includes  paying the Standard Income Tax on Employees or SITE only, will  pay nothing, while the effective levy on a taxpayer with a  taxable income of 70,000 rand will only be 1,000 rand.  Secondly, the adjustment to the Pay As You Earn tables for  individuals will be such as to recover the appropriate amount  over the period up to 31 August 1995, rather than over the 7  months to the end of February 1995.    Finally, the abatement for married women will be set at a  higher level, which will take into account their disadvantage in  tax rates when compared to other taxpayers. The total yield of  this levy is expected to be of the order of 3.4 billion rand, of  which some 2.6 billion rand will fall in this fiscal year with  the balance being collected in the first half of the next fiscal  year.    Well, I feel that the great majority of my fellow taxpayers  will agree with this step as a way of putting the past behind  us. There will no doubt be commentators aplenty to warn that  such one-time levies are inclined to continue or to recur. This  will not happen in this case, since at least half the  expenditure was nonrecurring, and since it is our intention in  any event to call a streamlined tax commission into existence to  carry out a swift review of the tax mechanism with a view to  assessing what improvements are required. It will be chaired by  Professor Michael Katz, the chairman of the Tax Advisory  Committee, and fans of Future Imperfect will be pleased to learn  that Professor Dennis Davis will be a member. [laughter] The  sessions will be lively. Insofar as it wishes to make  recommendations for the 1995-96 financial year, it will have to  report by the end of November 1994. That report will be  published, comment will be invited, and government will then  decide the issues during February 1995, in the run-up to the  next budget in March. A notice announcing the remaining members  and the terms of reference has been published today.    Having dealt with these major issues, we can now turn our  attention to the discussion of developments leading up to  today's budget, including the upturn of the 1993-94 financial  year, the economic and policy environment of the budget, and the  government's fiscal strategy.    The 1993-94 financial year was characterized by a  commitment to structurally sound policies and to the effective  implementation thereof. This was achieved mainly as a result of  proactive tax measures and effective expenditure controls. In  this latter respect, I wish to pay tribute to former minister of  state expenditure Mr. Amie Venter and to his department. In  very difficult times, they established and maintained the  disciplinary framework which the government of national unity  has happily inherited. The 1993-94 financial year not only  represented the closing of a chapter of history, but also the  start of meaningful progress toward cooperation and  reconciliation on economic affairs. Many examples manifested  themselves in this regard. The most prominent ones were  undoubtedly the negotiation for the final foreign debt  arrangement, the successful application for an International  Monetary Fund financial facility, and the formulation of South  Africa's trade liberalization proposals made to the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    The very important role of the National Economic Forum  in the GATT initiative, as well as in helping to resolve various  possible issues of conflict in the management of the economy,  deserves recognition. These achievements show that the golden  triangle of government, business, and unions can succeed, and  that it has indeed laid a foundation for future cooperation and  consultation.    The economic environment and economic policy framework:  Today's budget is presented against the backdrop of a  much-improved economic climate. Whereas previous budgets were  constrained by negative rates of growth and double-digit  inflation, both these indicators are now moving in the right  direction. We anticipate positive real growth of some 3 percent  for the fiscal year, and an inflation rate in the present range,  figures which are significantly better than those which the  country has experienced for many years. The economic outlook for  both the international and domestic economy is encouraging.  With economic growth gradually picking up in our major trading  partner countries, commodity prices show some sign of rising.  Coupled with a higher gold price, a continuation of the solid  export performance is foreseen, although the livelier domestic  economy could result in a smaller current account surplus on the  balance of payments than in 1993.    The peaceful conditions after the elections augur well  for the continuation of the economic recovery. Increased fixed  investment expenditure, an expected rise in inventories, and a  further recovery in real private consumption expenditure,  together with a continuation of the good export performance, a  significantly less burdensome foreign debt position, improved  access to foreign markets, greater financial stability,  improving business confidence, and the present favorable  agricultural conditions are just some of the reasons for the  more positive growth prospects for the economy. These factors  are also being reflected in improved local and international  business and consumer confidence with each day that passes.    In its investor dimension, using this confidence  requires that South Africa should obtain an international,  sovereign credit rating -- that is, a formal measure of risk  associated with the borrower's willingness and ability to  fulfill the loan obligations. Most institutional investors  require such a rating as part of their investment criteria, and  many investors set great store by them. Ratings therefore  broaden the investor base for debt instruments, thereby  maximizing investor demand and reducing the cost of funds. South  Africa has taken the first steps in acquiring such a rating in  the U.S. financial markets. The process is under way and will  be completed this year. Success in this challenging  international environment will require the liberalization of our  international financial flows as soon as the preconditions  previously stated by the governor of the Reserve Bank have been  met.    The replenishment of our foreign reserves: These have  been rising since the inauguration, and we expect the trend to  continue. The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring developments  and will make the necessary preparations to enable us to take  action at the appropriate time.    Two important caveats should be mentioned as far as our  international financial relations are concerned. First, we must  guard against extravagant expectations regarding immediate  capital flows into South Africa. Such flows will be slow to  develop, and the country therefore still faces a balance of  payments constraint. The need for continued adherence to the  present responsible monetary policy is thus beyond any  doubt.    A second caveat is that our endeavors to facilitate and  broaden access to international financial markets should not be  seen as attempts to find additional sources to finance a larger  budget deficit, but rather as a substitute for domestic finance.  This will not only result in a better balance between local and  foreign debt, but will also ease pressures on the domestic  financial market to the advantage of private sector borrowers.  At this point I should like to express the country's thanks to  the former director general of finance, Mr. Gerhardt Croeser,  who made a signal contribution to good financial governance for  many years, and who now represents us in Zurich as we establish  closer links with the international financial community.    In forging these and other close links with the  international community, we are guided by a clear vision of the  kind of country we want to become: an open society trading  freely with all other nations, investing liberally to increase  our productive capacity, thus creating more and more jobs which  in turn leads to an ever more attractive growing domestic  market, and encouraging participation in the benefits of this  development by our people, by our neighbors in southern Africa,  and by kindred spirits all over the world.    Against this background, we can now move onto the  fiscal strategy for the 1994-95 financial year and how we plan  to realize it.    The fiscal strategy for 1994-95: This budget is the  first of a number of budgets of this government that will have  to meet with three considerations -- first, laying the base for  public finance to be one of the principal instruments for the  reconstruction and development of our country; second,  contributing through fiscal discipline to macroeconomic  stabilization as a crucial element in economic growth; and  third, embodying institutional change in the process of  transition from the old to the new constitutional order. This  strategy obviously necessitates new policy measures and  structures to underpin, or where necessary even replace, those  already in place. Any discussion of the expenditure and revenue  proposals must take these considerations into account.    The format of the budget: Two major changes in the  budget presentation must be explained. The first is the result  of constitutional change and involves the incorporation into the  budget of the national government of erstwhile revenue  diversions to, and budgetary shortfalls from, former regional  authorities. The second is the more comprehensive inclusion of  the informal sector in the calculation of the Gross Domestic  Product, GDP, which resulted in an upward adjustment of 5.6  percent in the GDP. Care should thus be taken in analyzing the  budget figures to ensure comparability and avoid  misinterpretations. A detailed discussion of the changed budget  format and various other important matters, which -- due to time  constraints -- I can touch on only briefly or not at all, appear  in the budget review.    Expenditures: The total estimate of expenditure from  the national revenue account for the 1994-95 financial year is a  135.1 billion rands, which now covers all expenditures at the  national and regional level, except those financed from the  former regional administrations' own revenues. If we do not  include the latter expenditure, current noninterests expenditure  -- in other words, consumption expenditure and current transfers  -- grow by only 6.5 percent. This figure will not materially be  affected once allocations from the RDP funds begin to flow and  we succeed in ridding ourselves from the cost incurred during  the transition. The increase is substantially below the  inflation rate, and bears testimony to our commitment to  continue fiscal discipline. In view of the many and varied  demands on the exchequer and the relatively small increase in  estimated expenditures, continued rigorous financial control  will be called for. The restructured Treasury Committee --  comprising the two deputy presidents, the minister of finance,  and the minister without portfolio, who is also responsible for  coordinating the reconstruction and development initiative --  will have an important role in this regard.    The committee's main function is to assist the cabinet  in meeting the government's budgetary commitments. To that end,  reordering of expenditure priorities during the course of the  financial year, which will also involve RDP-related budgetary  shifts and allocations, is a major element of this committee's  activities.    I should now like to highlight some specific  expenditures from this year's budget, details of which are  printed in the budget review.    Civil and military pensions: Even in the much lower  inflationary environment now prevailing, it is desirable to  adjust pensions on an annual basis. This year's increases in  civil and military pensions reflect the appreciably lower rate  of inflation; and they are as follows. Civil pensions will rise  by 5 percent with effect from 1 April 1994 for pensioners who  retired on or before 1 July 1993. Those who retired later but  before the 1 April 1994 will have their pensions raised by 0.56  percent for each completed month since retirement. Pensions  which have increased since retirement by a percentage which,  after taking into account the increase just announced, does not  yet equal 70 percent of the increase in the Consumer Price Index  since retirement, will be further increased to that level.  Military pensions will rise by 5.6 percent with effect from 1  April 1994.    Next, social pensions: An amount of 418 million rands  is being made available for a general increase in the various  social pensions and the elimination of the existing backlog of  potential beneficiaries. Further details will be made available  by the minister for welfare and population development.    Next, employment creation: An amount of 292 million  rands -- this is quite separate from the RDP fund -- will be  available for job creation. The improved cooperation and  participation of communities under the government of national  unity will enhance the impact of this expenditure.    Financial and Fiscal Commission: The 1993 constitution  makes provision for the establishment of a Financial and Fiscal  Commission. The aims and functions of the commission are to  apprise itself of all financial and fiscal information relevant  to national, provincial, and local government administration,  and to render advise and make recommendations regarding the  finances of, and financial relations between, the three tiers of  government. It is clear that the commission will play a crucial  role in respect of financial and fiscal matters at all levels of  government. In this, it will face a daunting task that must be  tackled with the utmost urgency. I hope to make an announcement  regarding the appointments to the commission in the near  future.    Revenues: The present level of taxation relative to the  state  of the economy can be regarded as adequate. This encouraging  situation is to a large extent the result of the structurally  sound tax changes introduced last year. Based on existing tax  rates, the total consolidated estimate of revenue for the  National Revenue Account is 104.3 billion rands, 11.2 percent  above the comparable figure for 1993-94. This figure includes  all revenue at national and regional level, except the own  revenue collections of the former regional administrations.    Excise Duties: Maintaining our sound tax structure requires  that we should revise excise taxes upwards, in line with the  general level of price increases on a regular basis. After  consultations with the affected industries, the following  increases are proposed: beer, 6 cents per liter, or about 2  cents per 340-ml can or so-called dumpy; spirits -- example  whiskey, brandy, and gin -- about 53 cents per 750-ml bottle;  cigarettes, about 7 cents per 10 cigarettes; cigarette tobacco,  about 9 cents per 50 grams; pipe tobacco and cigars, 65 cents  per kilogram; unfortified wine, 4.5 cents per 750-ml bottle;  fortified wine, about 5 cents per 750-ml bottle; sparkling wine,  about 6 cents per 750-ml bottle; other fermented drinks such as  cider, about 2 cents per 340-ml can; sorghum beer, 1 cent per  liter. Sorghum beer powder, 5 cents per kilogram; and cold  drinks and mineral water, about 1 cent per liter.    The increases are roughly in line with the rate of  inflation,  but where rates have been significantly out of line with similar  products, the increases attempt to eliminate at least part of  the discrepancy. The increase in the excise duty on tobacco  products is a special case. Based on health considerations,  arguments have been put forward for an increase in the excise  duty to 50 percent of the retail price, which is the order of  impost in many other countries. After consultations with all  interested groups, and taking into account industry's specific  limitations and market conditions, government has opted for a  phased approach, which is reflected in the announced increase.  Future budgets will have to deal with the remainder of this  issue.    The announced excise increases should yield some 525 million  rands in a full year, and some 350 million rands for the  remainder of this financial year. These adjustments take effect  immediately. In accordance with Section 58 (1) of the Customs  and Excise Act 1965, I now lay the formal tax proposals for  excise duties on the table for consideration by Parliament.    Transition levy: As argued earlier, a levy to defray the  greater part of the transition costs is called for, and the  transition levy will be on individuals and companies with  taxable income in excess of 50,000 rands.    Individuals: The levy will be 5 percent, of which 3.33  percent based on 1995 taxable income is to be collected by 28  February 1995, and the balance of 1.67 percent based on 1996  taxable income by the end of August 1995. In view of the  existing disparity between married men and women, the levy will  only be imposed on income exceeding 175,000 rands in the case of  married women. Revised tax tables will be issued in due course.  Taxpayers of the former TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda,  and Ciskei] states will also be liable for the levy on the  equivalent of taxable income as defined in the applicable  legislation. It is expected that this levy will yield an  estimated 1.46 billion rands for the current financial year, and  a further 800 million rands up to August 1995.    Companies: A rate of 5 percent will apply on taxable income  of companies in excess of 50,000 rands, in respect of years of  assessment ending during the period of 12 months up to 31 March  1995. Assessed losses brought forward from previous years will  not be set off in determining such taxable income. Companies  registered in the former TBVC states will also be liable for the  levy in the equivalent of taxable income before the deduction of  assessed losses incurred during previous years, as defined in  the legislation applicable to those countries. This levy on  companies is expected to yield some 1.116 billion rands during  this financial year.    The General Export Incentive Scheme, GEIS: The GEIS scheme  is currently under review within the National Economic Forum,  and proposals for amendment are expected shortly. Payments  under the present scheme are exempt from taxation, which is  unsound in principle and of small effect in increasing the  incentive value of the payments to the recipients. Notice is  therefore given that we intend withdrawing the tax exemption in  respect of assistance under GEIS with effect from 1 March 1995.    Based on the matters which I have dealt with up to this  point, the projected budget deficit, which was 6.9 percent last  year on the updated estimate of GDP, will be 6.3 percent for the  new year. This is a meritorious decrease in the deficit, which  becomes more so when we remember that a further almost 0.2  percent of GDP will be collected in the next fiscal year, as we  complete our collections of the transitional levy from PAYE [Pay  As You Earn] taxpayers.    Viewing these figures, the government has decided to lose no  time in taking two initiatives aimed directly at the stimulation  of investment, growth, and, consequently, jobs.    Import surcharge: The first concerns the immediate removal  of the import surcharge on all capital and intermediate goods,  that is, all goods carrying the 5 percent surcharge. The cost  to the fiscus for a full year is some 1.2 billion rands, and for  the remainder of the financial year some 800 million rands, or  slightly less than 0.2 percent of GDP. The removal of the  remaining surcharges will not be considered now, as it may be  more appropriate to deal with them in the light of  recommendations made by the tax commission.    Income tax, companies: The second initiative is to complete  the process of structural reform of corporate tax which we began  last year. This involves lowering the corporate rate from 40  percent to 35 percent as from 1 April 1994, while partly  compensating for this by raising the secondary tax on companies  from 15 percent to 25 percent with immediate effect.    The net sacrifice involved this year is some 0.14 percent  of GDP or 600 million rands. This will be covered in future  years by the taxation of GEIS payments so that the corporate  sector as such will be paying the same tax but in a framework  which is far more favorable for new small and medium companies,  and for those most capable of generating greater growth through  heavy reinvestment of profits. The outcome of the tax proposals  is an estimated net increase on the printed estimate of 1.5  billion rands, a reduction of 450 million rands for Customs and  Excise, and an increase of 1.9 billion for Inland Revenue.  Total revenue for the national government is therefore  estimated to increase by 11.2 percent to 105.8 billion rands in  1994-95.    Before dealing with the financing of the deficit, a few  other  tax issues require brief mention. Firstly, the harmonization of  the tax systems of South Africa and the former TBVC states will  be undertaken in phases starting this year. Secondly, the Tax  Advisory Committee is investigating the taxation of gains and  losses arising from financial instruments, and plans to issue a  consultative document in this regard. Thirdly, consideration is  being given by Inland Revenue to the introduction of revised  provisions to facilitate unbundling and rationalization schemes.  Details on these issues are contained in the budget review, and  more information where applicable will be announced at the  appropriate times.    The budget deficit and public debt: After the tax proposals  take effect, the final consolidated budget deficit will be 6.6  percent of GDP by March 1995, or equivalent to 66.4 percent if  the full collection of the levy is taken into account. This  compares with 6.9 percent last year on the same basis, and  confirms that the downward trend as regards budgetary deficits  is alive and well. Total expenditure, including the  supplementary proposals, for '94-95 is estimated at 135.1  billion rands. The estimated revenue, including the tax  proposals, is 105.8 billion rands, and leaves a budget deficit  of 29.3 billion rands. Taking into account loan redemptions and  the balance brought forward from the previous year, the  financing requirement is 36.5 billion rands. This amount will  again be financed primarily from the sale of domestic stock,  although provision is also made for some foreign loans.  Financing of this magnitude, inclusive of regional finances,  should not influence the financial markets unduly, or put upward  pressure on interest rates.    As an interim measure, the minister of finance was on the  27th of April 1994 authorized to take over the debt of some 15  billion rands of the former TBVC states and self-governing  territories as debt of the national government. The allocation  of the asset-related part of this debt to the provinces, as  determined by the Constitution, will be finalized at a later  date. It should be emphasized that this is not new debt, and  that previous budgets provided for its servicing cost.    In contrast to the practice last year of funding the deficit  in as short a period as possible, deficits are currently being  funded as and when they arise. This approach not only prevents  the accumulation of large exchequer balances lying idle, but  also facilitates the development of a more active market for  government stock. The authorities have also implemented a  system of treasury, tax and loan accounts since 1st February  1994, whereby tax and loan receipts are deposited in tax and  loan accounts of clearing banks and held in the respective  accounts until the money is required by government.    The flow of funds between the private sector and the  Reserve Bank, which at times in the past has considerably  disrupted the money market, has now been eliminated, thus  simplifying money market management and contributing to better  cash flow management within the government sector, which in turn  reduces the net cost of financing.    I would now like to express my thanks. Budget planning and  preparation, presentation, and eventual execution involves the  dedication, cooperation, and plain hard work of many people. I  pay tribute to the directors general and the staff in the  departments of finance and of state expenditure, who have made  this very complex transition budget happen. The cooperation of  government departments, the various regional authorities, and  other institutions, especially the South African Reserve Bank,  was indispensable, and I also thank them.    The departments of finance and state expenditure will remain  separate departments, but their present directors general, Dr.  Estian Calitz and Mr. Hannes Smit, who remain in their  positions, now both report to me. We welcome on board Mr. Alec  Irwin as deputy minister, and at the same time pay tribute to  his predecessor, Dr. Theo Alant, who was a valued member of our  team.    Another relative newcomer is Mr. Trevor van Heerden, the  commissioner of Inland Revenue. Mr. van Heerden succeeded Mr.  Johannes Hattingh, who retired after a distinguished career in  Inland Revenue. We look forward to working with these  newcomers, and have confidence that with the continued support  of the rest of management and the valued advise of Dr. Japie  Jakobs, my special economic adviser, we hope to be able to serve  the needs of the people of our country.    The success we have achieved and need to achieve with  budgetary control depends, ultimately, on the support given by  the head of the government. I am very fortunate to have had  unstinting support since assuming this position, from my first  appointment in May 1992, right up to the present day, and wish  to convey my sincere thanks and appreciation to the leaders  concerned for this vital factor.    The budget in perspective: Building on the sound fiscal  performance of the past year, today's budget confronts the  challenges head-on. The reconstruction and development  imperative is addressed through the first of several allocations  from existing resources to the RDP fund. The program itself  will also be bolstered by the existing and substantial  socioeconomic expenditures which are directly or indirectly  related to reconstruction and development.    Concomitantly, fiscal discipline is being maintained through  the further reduction in the budget deficit as a percentage of  GDP. Within that constraint, it was nonetheless possible to  improve the corporate tax structure, and to take a major step  reducing the cost of imported capital and intermediate goods.  The once-off levy in income tax effectively closes the  financial book on the transition without jeopardizing the fiscal  progress made thus far. In planning our future strategies, we  shall be able to draw on the insights of the tax and the  financial and fiscal commissions. This government has the  legitimacy, the capacity, and the resolve to succeed. It is  determined to pursue both social justice and aggressive growth,  the best of both those worlds, and the budget seeks to embody  this aim.    The members of the government, the members of this house,  and  our millions of fellow citizens have spent the past several  years demonstrating our ability to set the highest goals, and to  achieve them. This is one more. Let's do it again. Thank you.</p>

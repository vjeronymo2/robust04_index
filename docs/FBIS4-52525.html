			<p>CSO     [Text] Phnom Penh -- Mrs. Sam Kanitha, Deputy Minister of  Justice, has said that a number of authorities are still  violating the law and that she does not know whose orders they  are following. She has information that many political prisoners  are still being detained in many provinces and that there has  been torture especially of members of FUNCINPEC.    The deputy minister stated that these authorities -- who are  carrying on the system of the old regime -- are exceeding their  legal authority and are a major problem for the Ministry of  Justice. She emphasized that, "If we cannot solve this problem  now the `sickness' will be as grave as it was before."    Up until now, the Ministry of Justice has been limited in  seeking a solution to these violations because the constitution  which regulates the power of the government is not yet set up.  Mrs. Sam Kanitha said that, "At the present time disorder cannot  be avoided." But, in spite of this, in accordance with special  royal authorization from Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Ministry  of Justice is dispatching government attorneys to the various  detention centers where they suspect that there are violations.    Mrs. Kanitha explained that, "This does not mean that we are  separating ourselves from the government. We are following the  orders of the chief of state because we cannot yet operate  according to the constitution." What she termed, "those old  laws" still seem to be widely carried out. There is something  unusual and slow about the courts.    Recently we approved a memorandum for all judges to inform  them of recent legal errors. And we began to investigate every  legal case. We are trying to resolve every pending case before  the new laws go into effect. We are also establishing a court of  appeals. Up until now in Cambodia the judicial branch has not  been independent.    The laws had been made according to the wishes of the  government and no one has dared to object. In the beginning the  Ministry of Justice had no role, but was responsible for  approving the judgments of various government organizations such  as the Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Security, or  provincial governors.    These three authorities can detain a prisoner in jail as  they wish. The Ministry of Security, according to research by  the Ministry of Justice, has said that the use of torture is a  technical matter of its own. She added that the various  decisions have been made in accordance with party policies and  the judges have not been appointed by them for their ability but  rather for their loyalty. One of the many current problems which  the Ministry of Justice must solve is the lack of healthy and  independent judges in Cambodia to go back to work when there are  new laws. The Ministry of Justice is now asking retired lawyers  to return to work even those who live abroad. But Mrs. Sam  Kanitha is perfectly aware that the government's pay will not  attract many specialists. At present, monthly salaries at the  Ministry of Justice range from 30,000 to 60,000 riels. Since the  Ministry of Justice does not have enough new people to change  the old regime, it has tried to explain the new system by  teaching its own personnel.    In close cooperation with United Nations agencies and human  rights organizations, they have given many seminars to raise the  level of education. Mrs. Sam Kanitha believes strongly that  education is one of the ways to combat corruption. Beginning  when she was in the Ministry of Education, she conducted  experiments in order to combat corruption. From the beginning,  in the schools and universities, since [they] had created an  independent committee to monitor examinations and provide a  secret number for the examinees, she observed that the students  who have the ability to get good grades are not the students who  have wealthy or powerful parents.</p>

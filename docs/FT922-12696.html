			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Arts: Tomorrow's Television There are all sorts of weird and wonderful things on offer, this being the start of a holiday weekend. Do you fancy watching Johnny Weissmuller in the 17th and last of his Tarzan films? Make sure you are tuned to BBC2 by 8.05 in the morning and you can see him and Brenda Joyce in Tarzan And The Mermaids. At 1.10 on ITV you have yet another chance to catch the cuddly little 'ewoks' and special effects in Return Of The Jedi. Most promising movie offer is the first terrestrial TV screening of Tavernier's 1990 work, These Foolish Things, starring Dirk Bogarde and Jane Birkin (10.00 BBC2). The more interesting music programmes include an hour of Couperin in Music For A Dying King (7.02 C4) the king being Louis XIV; and Rossini's Stabat Mater (7.25 BBC2) with the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. As the years pass Jana Bokova's documentaries get longer and longer. Today BBC2 shows the first of her three-part Arena on 'the musical heritage of Argentina'. Her programmes are by turns intense, lyrical, irritating, and funny, but rarely boring and always idiosyncratic.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 9 ITAR-TASS -- "Allegations about Viktor  Chernomyrdin's resignation are an invention and a lie from  beginning to end," the Russian president's press secretary  Vyacheslav Kostikov announced today.    The press secretary reacted to a report in the KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA daily, which cited "informed sources in the country's  leadership" as saying that "the question about Viktor  Chernomyrdin's resignation from the post of prime minister for  reasons of health has been decided in principle, as has the  appointment of Yuriy Skokov to the post".    The report said "Viktor Chernomyrdin has reportedly agreed  with the formula, which accounts for his unexpected departure  for Germany for medical examination and treatment for  nephrolithiasis".    The newspaper cited unofficial data about the president's  meeting with Yuriy Skokov last Monday, "as a result of which,  the relevant draft presidential decrees are awaiting Boris  Yeltsin's signature".    Yuriy Skokov is the chairman of the federation of commodity  producers and entrepreneurs of Russia. Earlier, he was  secretary of the Security Council and since October 1992 was  closely involved with the affairs of the regions, where he won  considerable popularity, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reported.</p>

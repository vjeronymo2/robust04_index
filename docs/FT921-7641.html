			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Steetley attacks the German angle - Redland's management record under fire in new line of defence STEETLEY, the building materials group fighting a Pounds 639m hostile bid, yesterday launched an attack on Redland aimed at undermining faith in its assailant's management record and overseas expansion. It accused Redland of being too dependent on Germany, of making 'a costly mistake' in plasterboard and of needing Steetley to ease tax problems. The arguments were set out in a document urging shareholders to reject the bid, following Redland's reopening of hostilities on Wednesday. Redland's German profits have helped to cushion it against the effects of UK recession. However, Mr Richard Miles, Steetley's managing director, said Redland now looked over-dependent on Braas, the German roof tile company, which last year was thought to have contributed nearly half of group operating profits. Because Redland only owned 51 per cent of Braas, it had limited control over both cash flow and the board. The outlook in Germany had, in any case, deteriorated because of slower growth and increased competition. Steetley accused Redland of issuing a flood of paper. Mr Miles said if the all-share bid succeeded and the new paper were added to last year's 1-for-5 rights issue, the group's equity would be increased by 72 per cent compared with this time last year. He said that the March rights issue price had been 510p, while the underwriting of new shares for the bid had been done in part at 410p. The issuing of more shares while UK profits had been falling had aggravated the ACT problem. Acquiring Steetley would not provide a complete cure, he pointed out. As for plasterboard, where Redland owns a minority stake in a joint venture, Steetley estimated that Redland had lost Pounds 50m through its foray into this market. Mr Miles said of the document: 'It blasts holes in the carefully manipulated myth that Redland are good managers.' Mr Gerald Corbett, Redland's finance director, retorted that Steetley's 'profits have collapsed, their gearing is high, their dividend is uncovered and their joint venture with Tarmac has been referred to the MMC.' Before bid speculation began last November, he said its share price had underperformed the FT-A Building Materials Index by about 25 per cent over 12 months. He said Steetley had not understood how the German company worked and had received the wrong message about the German market, which remained buoyant. The plasterboard episode was largely history and he disputed Steetley's estimate of losses. There had been no flood of paper: last year's rights issue was the first since 1986. And on tax, he said Redland had managed to keep its rate low for 10 years, whereas Steetley's most recent rate was 37 per cent. See Lex</p>

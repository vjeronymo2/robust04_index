While meeting with reporters at Kimpo Airport upon his  return  from a visit to three Nordic countries, Kim said he believes  North Korea would accept it if the United States, in concert  with China, persuades North Korea over a package deal.    Kim stressed that the nuclear question should be resolved at  an early date before it is referred to the U.N. Security Council.    The former opposition leader also said that if a war recurs  on the Korean peninsula, it would deal a tremendous damage to  the 70 million Korean people.    Referring to the idea of taking Pyongyang in a war, which  was  recently voiced by a senior U.S. Administration official, Kim  said, "We must cooperate with the United States in areas where  we should, but the United States ought to be more prudent over  matters like this."</p>

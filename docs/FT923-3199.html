			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Initiative is example of union, says Brussels THE realignment in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and the Bundesbank's intention to cut interest rates will be welcomed by European Community ministers and officials as a sign of strong co-operation between member states, a senior Brussels official said last night. The Bundesbank's flexibility could also strengthen the hand of supporters of the Maastricht treaty in France. Last night's declaration was an example of economic and monetary union working in its early stages, the official said. For several months, EC finance ministers have been warning that Germany's tight monetary policy was imposing strains on the economies of other members. The joint German-Italian initiative paving the way for yesterday's realignment underlines the message that the Community can manage its business, the EC official said, although the final judgment would be left to the financial markets today. EC officials have been alarmed by the tenor of the French referendum campaign in which both supporters and opponents of the treaty have warned about the threat of German economic hegemony in Europe and the EC's inability to deal with political crises.</p>

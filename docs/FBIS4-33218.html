			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tania Monteiro] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE)  has produced reports for President Itamar Franco informing that  the Landless People's Movement (MST) is very well coordinated,  and that it even has training centers for the political and  ideological formation of its leaders. According to the reports  made available to O ESTADO, one of those centers is located at  the Ranch of Workers in the town of Ipojuca, in rural  Pernambuco, where landless people might be receiving guerrilla  training for the purpose of guaranteeing the possession of  occupied areas.    The reports are divided into one main section and its  annexes, all of them bearing the "confidential" seal. The  reports say that representatives from Germany, Chile, Nicaragua,  Cuba, and the former USSR are cooperating in the training of  landless people. They add that the MST is linked with Latin  American and Caribbean peasant organizations, and that it also  has links in Chile, Uruguay, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.    One 15-page SAE report says that MST leaders have  transformed  the action into a movement of masses supporting political and  ideological interests that are against the government and the  system of government. The document emphasizes the participation  of the Workers Party (PT) and the Sole Workers Center (CUT),  noting that the two organizations consider landless people their  main force in promoting conflict in the field.    The document says that the MST is like a military  organization, having pamphlets with instructions for land  occupation, resistance, and for the promotion of production in  the occupied area in order to guarantee possession of the land.  The document reveals that women and children are also  instructed to resist, that landless peasants intend to build  guerrilla bases in the Bico do Papagaio region, in Tocantins,  and that while they were planning their action they proposed  building homemade bombs. They are said to be heavily armed, but  no reference is made to the weapons they have.    PT Deputy for Sao Paulo Luci Choinacki, who backs the Sao  Paulo landless people, has questioned the contents of the  report: "The movement has no political-partisan motivation, and  envisages the fight for land as being for the sake of the  workers' survival." She added that "the land conflict in Brazil  has neither increased nor decreased over the past few years. It  is exactly the same." "Because we are in an electoral year, the  information is being used for electoral purposes," she said.    The PT deputy said that none of the 100,000 settlements were  made out of the government's own will, but through the workers'  struggle. She suggested that the government investigate those  settlements to see that productivity has increased in those  areas. She also proposed to check the work done by the Rural  Democratic Union (UDR) to confirm the number of anonymous  workers who were killed in armed conflicts. She denied that the  movement is promoting any type of guerrilla training.    PT Deputy for Sao Paulo Jose Genoino, a member of the  Defense  Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, will next week ask SAE  chief Admiral Mario Flores for a public audience with the  members of the committee for them to learn about the reports'  contents. "It is necessary to know what is partial and what is  impartial in those reports," he said.    In order to obtain the information for the reports submitted  to President Itamar Franco, SAE did the work that was previously  done by the former agents of the defunct National Intelligence  Service (SNI). To this end, SAE infiltrated the landless  movements with its agents, who are supplying the government with  new information every 15 days, and if necessary every week. SAE  has not reported how many men are involved in this job.    The report describes the factors that gave rise to the  movement. One of the highlights is the landless people's slogan:  "The need for implementation of a revolution of workers to  terminate the capitalist state, which is responsible for the  current exploitation and misery of workers, reaching Socialism."    The document makes a thorough evaluation of land invasions  in  Brazil. It says that 122 occupations occurred this year. In  Sao Paulo, for example, there were 20 actions by landless  people. Parana is another main target, with 33 invasions. The  report adds that no land conflicts have occurred in Goias and in  most Amazonian states, despite the low productivity of land.  The report notes that the MST is organized in almost all  states, with the exception of Amazonas and Acre.    Concerning PT influence on the movements, the document  emphasizes that "the PT has considerable power within the  movement, even within the Coordination Faction, which partially  disagrees with the political-ideological position of the  revolutionaries."    In its conclusions the document says that the government  position is not to negotiate under pressure. One of the  recommendations is the adoption of measures that were planned  for the farm sector, providing infrastructure to settlements and  selecting families with devotion to farm work, to give them  technological and community work orientation.</p>

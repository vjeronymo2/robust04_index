			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (9): Farmers in clover - Central agriculture planning is to be relaxed EGYPTIAN agriculture is one of the most productive systems in the world. Of a total area of 286m acres, only about 6.5m acres, or 3 per cent, are arable  -mostly along the Nile and its delta. Centralised control, which has acted as a brake on this productivity over the last three decades, is being dismantled, and Egypt's estimated 3.5m farmers may soon be able to reap the real benefits of their labours. Egypt's Ministry of Agriculture has targeted three areas for reform, all with varying degrees of success: state control of production patterns and crop quotas; price controls; land reclamation. The main reason for these reforms remains Egypt's food import bill of Dollars 4bn a year. Traditionally the ministry has tightly regulated the sector by dictating production patterns through crop quotas, procurement prices and input allocations. This control was dictated partly by the big food subsidy programme, which remains in place. About 90 per cent of Egypt's population is eligible for a ration of subsidised sugar, vegetable oil, and rice. These controls have affected productivity and yield ratios. Many farmers, for example, have grown beseem (clover) because they have been able to sell it for a higher price than many other crops. 'We had become obsessive about control to ensure the fullest production,' says Dr Hassan Khetr, the ministry's under secretary in charge of agricultural economics and statistics. The present structures have been in place since nationalisation in the early 1960s. Because it was difficult to talk about nationalising the total production process in agriculture, the government confiscated decision making rather than land. 'Our reforms are aimed at getting the government out of the production process. Our mandate is to create a conducive environment for producers  - the farmers,' he says. Reforms initiated in 1986 have already begun eroding state control. The government no longer sets fixed production quotas, prices and government allocation of fertilisers for crops, except cotton and sugar cane. In the case of wheat, marketing and production controls - including mandatory acreage - were liberalised in 1987. Since then production has increased sharply. In 1990 wheat production reached a record 4.2m tonnes and it is expected to climb to 4.8m tonnes this year - sharply higher than the 1.8m tonnes produced in 1986. Although self-sufficiency has re-emerged as a national issue, Egypt remains the world's largest flour importer and the third largest wheat importer. Production increases have done little more than keep pace with a rise in consumption. Imports of wheat are expected to total 6.5m tonnes this year, the same as last, while total consumption, 10.6m tonnes last year, is expected to rise to nearly 11m tonnes this year. But increased production has to be weighed against increased consumption. The Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation argues that the two have increased in tandem, keeping the import bill static. But the task remains formidable - and, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, not solely its responsibility. It points to Egypt's population, which increased by 2.3 per cent - or 1.25m people - last year. The ministry also argues that consumption patterns need addressing. Each Egyptian consumes 200kg of flour a year, more than in any other nation. The ministry also says the wheat import bill could be reduced by tightening the pricing system further. The number of different prices for flour (destined for bread-making) has been reduced from seven to three. 'Unless consumption and production patterns are altered significantly, domestic agriculture will play an increasingly supplementary role in providing for Egypt's food needs,' a foreign adviser warns. Egypt's foreign advisers argue further that self-sufficiency will remain a dream for Egyptians because of a shortage of land. Expanding the land base and reclaiming the desert for agricultural purposes continues to be a policy priority for the government. Over the last five years land reclamation projects have added 750,000 feddans (a feddan is about one acre) to the land resource base. Until recently land reclamation remained a source of dispute between Egypt and international organisations. 'In the past the World Bank and other donors were reluctant to support these projects. The rationale was that the payback was too long and that financial profitability was questionable. However, they have changed their stance dramatically,' says Mr Khetr. The World Bank is now supporting one of the biggest land reclamation projects in the Sinai peninsula. Headway also seems to have been made in curbing urban encroachment. Mr Khetr says a 1983 law, which for the first time banned ploughing, building on or excavating the topsoil, is proving effective. These successes are greeted with some caution by western advisers, who are concerned about Egypt's water supply. While the Nile flow is at present adequate, this could change if greater demands were made upstream in the Sudan. Egypt still faces the fundamental contradiction of, on the one hand, needing to reduce the huge drain on its resources by increasing output, and, on the other, introducing reforms in a sector which supports 35 per cent of the country's labour force. In the words of Mr Khetr: 'We are true believers in liberalisation. But our programmes have to be justified not only on economic but also on social grounds.'</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Japan credit demand weak JAPAN's broad money supply expanded at a sluggish 1.8 per cent in March, compared to a year ago, the Bank of Japan said yesterday, as a result of weak demand for credit, writes Steven Butler in Tokyo. Although the rate of expansion was slightly higher than the record low of 1.6 per cent in February, there was no sign in the money supply figures (M2 plus certificates of deposit) that the slowdown in Japan's economy was about to change. Money supply grew by 1.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year, far below the central bank's original forecast of 2-3 per cent.</p>

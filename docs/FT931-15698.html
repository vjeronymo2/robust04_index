			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US motor giants seek curb on Japan THE US motor industry wants a 25 per cent tariff imposed on two categories of imported vehicles in an attempt to intensify pressure on Japan to reduce its Dollars 33bn automotive trade surplus with the US. The US already imposes a 25 per cent tariff on imported trucks, and the big three US motor companies - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - are seeking to extend this tariff to multi-purpose vehicles or 'people carriers', such as the Toyota Previa and the VW Eurovan, and to four-door leisure/utility vehicles, such as the Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero and the Range Rover. The chief executives of the three US companies met President-elect Bill Clinton last week when they discussed the automotive trade deficit, which accounts for two-thirds of the US trade deficit with Japan. Mr Robert Eaton, chairman of Chrysler, told the Automotive News World Congress that 'the first economic act' of the new administration should be extension of the truck tariff. This would 'send an important signal to Tokyo' and could be 'the first step towards a realistic new trade agreement between the US and Japan', he said. Extending the 25 per cent tariff to MPVs and four-door leisure/utility vehicles would be aimed at Japanese imports, but there is concern at both Rover, the UK vehicle maker, and at Volkswagen of Germany that their vehicles in these categories could also be hit. Rover exports its Range Rover and Land Rover Defender vehicles to the US, while VW sells its Eurovan MPV. Land Rover increased its sales in the US by 28 per cent last year to 4,234 units, while VW sold 2,679 of its Eurovan/Vanagon ranges. Any extension of the US tariff to four-door leisure/utility vehicles would pose severe problems for Rover's plan to launch its Land Rover Discovery in the US next year. Imposition of the tariff would require a reclassification of MPVs and four-door leisure/utilities as trucks in place of their present status as cars. There is only a 2.5 per cent duty on cars imported to the US. Japan has removed all import tariffs on motor vehicles, but US car makers consider there are stiff non-tariff barriers to trade with Japan.</p>

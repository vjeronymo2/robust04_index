			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Ardayev report: "Kazakhstan: Power Crisis"] </F>   [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- The Supreme Council of  Kazakhstan has issued a statement containing its assessment of  the activity of the republic government.    The statement notes that the government, while declaring a  market-economy course, is essentially blocking it, which has  resulted in economic chaos in Kazakhstan. The government, the  statement says, has been unable to draw up a national reform  program which could serve as the basis for the consolidation of  society, given which the Supreme Council "is forced to express  its lack of confidence in the government's socioeconomic and  legal policy."    Parliament proposes "constructive dialogue among all the  branches of power and social and political forces to create a  national reform program and form a government capable of  carrying it out" as the sole way to avoid total paralysis of  power. Until such a program is adopted the Supreme Council  intends to concentrate its attention on a number of issues,  examination of the presidential edicts adopted in the absence of  the legislative organ topping that list. Moreover, parliament  has stated that it intends, first, to take a number of economic  measures to give strong support to manufacturers; second, it  intends to limit legislatively the executive branch's powers as  regards the management of state property; and, third, it intends  to extend the autonomy of enterprises in all kinds of ownership.    The statement issued at the start of the week has had a very  mixed reaction. However, at a special press conference, deputy  head of parliament Marat Ospanov assured journalists that the  statement it in no way implies measures to dismiss the cabinet  forthwith or any cadre changes in government, as this is the  prerogative of the head of state.    President Nazarbayev's reaction to the parliamentary  statement was "calm and considered," particularly as a lot in  the statement coincides with his own stance.    As far as the cabinet itself is concerned, its press service  has issued a statement which accuses parliament of being  unconstitutional -- the government is responsible to the  president alone -- and unconstructive.    Parliament's haste is, presumably, due to some extent to  public opinion's dissatisfaction with parliament itself, whose  activity (or, more accurately, its inactivity) has caused a good  deal of censure in the Kazakhstan press since the middle of  April. Nevertheless, the situation does reflect very accurately  the power crisis in Kazakhstan, where the president, who has  shouldered a heavy legislative burden, is unable to keep the  cabinet's activity under complete control, and the government is  unable to withstand the crisis, which is becoming increasingly  irreversible and unmanageable in nature, while parliament simply  does not know where to start and therefore starts by criticising  the government.</p>

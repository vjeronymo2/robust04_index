			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Howard to put plan for workers' rights to EC MR MICHAEL Howard, emp-loyment secretary, yesterday voiced his continuing opposition to the European Commission's proposed directives on employees' rights to information and consultation. He said he would seek to replace them with his own five-point plan. Mr Howard announced the initiative at a conference to launch a joint government and Confederation of British Industry campaign to improve business performance through employee involvement. He will present the plan on employee involvement to an informal meeting of his fellow employment ministers in the European Community in early May. Mr Howard will urge the EC to adopt a voluntary approach towards encouraging company policies for informing and consulting employees. The EC has proposed more formal machinery for companies with concerns in more than one member state, such as the formation of a works council containing employees from each of the countries covered by the company. Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the British initiative looked like 'a smokescreen to cover the government's embarrassment at being out of step in Europe'. He said the UK government had consistently tried to veto European proposals to give employees rights to information and consultation over company decisions. The aims of the five-point plan are: To generate the commitment of all employees to the success of the business. To enable the business to adapt to changing market requirements and improve its prospects for the future. To increase the satisfaction that employees get from their work. To improve performance and productivity by drawing on the skills and knowledge of all employees. To provide all employees with the opportunity to contribute to the development of their company. Mr Howard said the voluntary approach allowed companies to establish arrangements best suited to their own circumstances. He said: 'We shall therefore continue to resist the imposition of Community legislation on this subject. That is true of the worker participation proposals in the Fifth Company Directive and the European Company Statute.' Mr Howard yesterday said a study by his department showed Labour's economic policies could cost 2.2m jobs - leading Labour to protest at the use of government officials to compile Tory 'propaganda'.

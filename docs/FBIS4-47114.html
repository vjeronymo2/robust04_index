			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Zinovyev: "I Believe the Country Has </F> Been Murdered." From the roundtable discussion held at the Union  of Writers of Russia on the topic of "Current and Future  Position of Russia in the Context of the Current and Future  World Situation."]    [Text] [Begin boxed material]    "The Current and Future Position of Russia in the Context of  the Current and Future World Situation." That is how Aleksandr  Prokhanov defined the topic of the roundtable discussion. The  discussion was held at the Union of Writers of Russia with the  participation of the newspapers ZAVTRA and SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA.    The following writers, poets and politicians shared their  thoughts: Aleksandr Zinovyev, Vladimir Maksimov, Valentin  Rasputin, Petr Rozhanov, Eduard Limonov, Sazhi Umalatova, Viktor  Anpilov, Mikhail Astafyev, Ilya Konstantinov, Valeriy Ganichev,  Sergey Vikulov, Gennadiy Gusev, Viktor Smirnov, lawyer Mikhail  Kuznetsov and a guest from Yugoslavia, Mother Angelina.    The newspaper ZAVTRA will publish the materials of the  roundtable in one of its next issues. We are selecting only two  presentations, which define the essence and character of the  discussion--those of the widely known philosopher and Russian  writer abroad Aleksandr Zinovyev, and the remarkable current  prose-writer, the firm patriot Valentin Rasputin.    [End boxed material]    [Zinovyev's speech] ...I am only an observer, but sometimes  it is useful for someone looking from the outside to express his  thoughts. From the inside, one cannot always see all that is  going on.    How do I evaluate the present-day condition of Russia?! I  evaluate it--and I say this with pain in my soul, for me this is  perhaps the most terrible tragedy of my life--I believe that the  country has been murdered. Simply murdered. I categorically  protest against the evaluation of this situation as being some  natural process. Generally, that is what they say in Western  propaganda: The system has exhausted itself, and so on and so  forth... Nothing of the sort! There has been a murder, planned  immediately after the end of World War II. It was carried out in  a planned and systematic manner, pedantically. A strategy for  the murder was developed, and worked out down to the most minute  details. This was a murder from outside, but the murderers found  fellow conspirators inside the country, and these murderers  became the highest leaders of the country, the well-defined  strata of the intellectual elite and the upper strata of Soviet  society. They simply betrayed the interests of the entire  people, the interests of our country. I use the word "betrayal"  not in some moral sense, but as a precise scientific term.    An unprecedented phenomenon in the history of mankind has  occurred. There has never been anything like it. Just imagine  that two armies have faced off against each other, and the  commanders of these armies, the entire general staff, have all  run over to the enemy camp and begun teaching the enemy how to  defeat their own army. This is what has happened with our  country. When I was writing the second part of the book, "The  Crisis of Communism," which has now been published, I formulated  this definition in my consciousness. Yet, although I understood  this in my mind, in my feelings I nevertheless could not grasp  the impending misfortune. I spoke of the crisis, but already  then I should have spoken of catastrophe, of the most terrible  catastrophe in the history of mankind. Sometimes it seems to me  that I am living in some terrible nightmare.    What situation has the murdered, plundered, raped, spat upon  and insulted Russia found itself in relation to the rest of  mankind? I always warn that I am not a politician, not a  composer of plans for the future. I am merely a researcher, and  nothing more. This is where my task end. I have always been  guided in my research by a simple, banal principle: The truth at  any price, whatever this may cost me. I can make a mistake. I  can be accused of not knowing something, of not studying some  question. Yet to ascribe certain intentions to me--that is  dishonest. I have only one intention: In this sea of lies in  which mankind is now entangled, ideological lies, to seek out by  any means even a grain of truth.    You must understand, this is unusually hard to do. In  practice, the world does not want to know the truth about Russia  and does everything possible to silence this truth. And if it  does not succeed in silencing it, then it tries at least to  localize it. And if it cannot localize it, then it tries to  falsify it. I know of no other period in history when there was  such a physiological hatred toward the truth, and not toward  truth in general, but toward a fully definite property--the  truth about the position and fate of Russia.    It is as if everyone has conspired against it. Just imagine,  somewhere in Australia they murdered a German tourist. The  entire world is abuzz: Month after month, the TV and the press  carry on about it for half a year... In Russia they murdered  people before the very eyes of all mankind in the so-called  White House--and that is alright! And if they do speak of it, it  is with justification: This, they say, was necessary for the  sake of democracy...    I do not understand such hypocrisy. This is something which  has no equal... I believe that the struggle for the truth here  is task number one. To make known the truth about events in  Russia, beginning with the first day, when the murder began, and  up to the last. I believe that the events of 3-4 October 1993  were the final stab of the knife to the heart of Russia.    Now an evaluation of the objective position of the country.  I  read an endless number of publications on this topic. All manner  of plans are proposed, and their characteristic trait consists  of the fact that Russia is viewed in isolation. They take it and  look to see: What is possible, what will happen? When I express  my thoughts, they say to me: "Oh, enough of this. Don't fall  into such pessimism. There was, after all, the Tatar-Mongol  yoke, but we survived nevertheless. There was the discord at the  beginning of the 17th Century--but we withstood it. How  difficult it was during the time of the Great Patriotic War, but  we were victorious after all!" To this I answer: "It was a  different enemy, and those were different times!"    We do not have time to wait! The world has become such that  to ignore Russia, to view it as something autonomous--means to  evade the main question.    The fact is that a global society has already begun to be  formulated, or has already been formulated. The global world  exists not as a series of autonomous regions, but as a unified  society. Unified--not necessarily harmonious. In a family there  are fights and quarrels. Sometimes they fight more than with the  neighbors, but this is a unified society. Hundreds of thousands  of international organizations permeate the planet in the most  varied directions. There are world economic empires, which have  extended their feelers into all corners of the planet. There is  an ideological network which penetrates into the soul of each  individual person, an informational one, etc. This global  society exists, but it is not a brotherhood of equal partners,  as the Western ideology and propaganda is trying to represent it.    There is no such brotherhood!    This global society already has a clear-cut hierarchical  structure, a reticular structure. It is a very complex system  which encompasses all of mankind. The West is the world  hegemonic power. It is integrated, but already forms a single  whole. But the West, once again, is not a brotherhood of equal  peoples. It has its structure: The USA is the leader, a rank  lower is the European Community, in which Germany has already  ascended to the role of hegemonic power. On the next lower level  are the dependant countries, say, of Eastern Europe. Or, say,  France, Italy and England are one thing, and Spain and Portugal  are another. They are also unequal partners, and below them come  the dependant countries, and they also are dependant to varying  degrees... After that come the semi-colonial countries, and then  the colonial. And so, where is the planned place of our Russia  in this global society? And where are they shoving us and have  already shoved us quite successfully?    Let our leaders beat their chests: "A great power, a great  power." Yet all the while they are crawling on their knees. No!  We are no longer a great power! We have been trampled and ground  into the dirt, at the very lowest level of this world global  society. This was planned from the very beginning. This was done  consistently from one decade to the next. And, frankly speaking,  I do not see how this violence can be opposed.    Do not think that it is easy for me to pronounce these  words.  I am recounting the actual state of affairs, and then the  question arises: What are Russia's possibilities for getting out  of this situation? In my opinion, these possibilities are  negligible, if indeed they exist at all. The state system has  been destroyed. That which is being created is a mongrelized  system of a colonial regime. The ideology has been destroyed.  The moral and ideological state of the population have been  destroyed. The culture has been destroyed. The youth has been  demoralized, the next generation is being corrupted... We have  never yet known such a total disintegration of a country, even  when we devastated Germany during the Great Patriotic War. There  has never been anything like this. From that war we emerged  morally strengthened. And now? Is there a Russian army? In one  of my interviews with PRAVDA on the eve of the shooting at the  "White House," I said that it would shoot at its own.    I have expressed my highly pessimistic view of the problem  posed at the beginning of the discussion. Perhaps I am  overstating things a bit. Sometimes this is useful--to focus  attention on the gravity of the situation, so as not to deceive  the people with optimistic promises. I believe that today it is  more important to speak with the Russian people in just this way.    I personally hold the following position: We are doomed, and  therefore I as a Russian will fight to the end. Even if I am  left one against six billion.</p>

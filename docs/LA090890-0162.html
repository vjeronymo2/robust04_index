			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EX-GOMPERS TEACHER ADMITS TO MOLESTATIONS  </P> <P> A former veteran teacher at Gompers Secondary School pleaded guilty Friday to  two counts of misdemeanor child molestation in a plea-bargain agreement that  almost guarantees he will not serve time in jail.  </P> <P> Sidney J. Loveless Jr., 54, admitted to Municipal Judge Gale Kaneshiro that he  molested two girls younger than 18 between Sept. 5, 1989, and April 1, 1990.  </P> <P> Under the plea bargain, 10 felony counts of child molestation against Loveless  were dismissed. Loveless said in court that he made his plea in order to avoid  the possibility of a long jail sentence if he was convicted of the felony  charges.  </P> <P> Loveless, could get up to two years in County Jail, will be sentenced Oct. 12,  but Deputy Dist. Atty. Harry Elias said in court that he will recommend  community service. Loveless, however, will be required to register as a sex  offender.  </P> <P> Administrators at Gompers, an award-winning magnet school, came under fire  earlier this year for their handling of allegations of child abuse.  </P> <P> Police officials have said they uncovered as many as 30 victims in their  investigation.  </P></p>

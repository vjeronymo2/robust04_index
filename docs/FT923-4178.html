			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (11): Rabbit starts to run - Public cordless telephones the UK-developed public cordless telephone service which had a disastrous start in the late 1980s - is looking forward to a revival of its fortunes in the 1990s. Ironically, the revival is being led from abroad, writes Peter Purton. Telepoint in the UK started in 1988 when the government announced its intention to license at least two operators. In the end four were licensed: Manchester-based electronics company Ferranti (Creditphone), Phonepoint, a consortium consisting of BT, STC (now part of Northern Telecom), US regional telephone company Nynex and France Telecom, another consortium called Callpoint made up of BT rival Mercury, telepoint equipment maker Shaye and US electronics company Motorola and a third consortium, BYPS, made up of Dutch electronics giant Philips, UK clearing bank Barclays and the Anglo-Dutch oil company, Shell. By the end of 1991 the three licensees which had launched a service had withdrawn from the market and the fourth, BYPS, had been sold to a new owner, Hong Kong-based Hutchison Telecom. Few disagreed at that point - telepoint was an unmitigated disaster. Telepoint took longer to take off abroad. In fact, it is only now moving out of its trial stage to become a commercial service. But the early indications are that it will be successful. In Hong Kong two operators, Hutchison and local radiopaging network operator Chevalier, have been offering a telepoint service since March and April. A third, Pacific Telelink, backed by UK telecommunications network operator Vodafone, is due to come into service at the end of the year. Already there are some 30,000 users with some 7,000 newcomers signing up every month - a faster growth rate than any of the world's cellular radio services enjoyed during their start-up phase. In Singapore, the service was launched on January 27. The main Singapore newspaper, the Straits Times, reported the sale of 1,500 phones on the first day and queues of 300 people forming at the stores selling the handsets. Now there are over 12,000 users of the Callzone telepoint service offered by Singapore Telecom. Malaysia's and Thailand's national carriers are also offering telepoint services. Also in the Asia-Pacific region, Australia Telecom is planning a telepoint network in Brisbane. And in Canada, an upgraded version of the telepoint cordless telephone specification has been adopted as the country's official cordless phone standard. Even in Europe, the sun is beginning to break through for telepoint. In Germany, where telepoint got off to a bad start with a six-month delay to the trial in Munich, it now looks as if the national operator, Deutsche Telekom, will proceed with a full commercial version of its Birdie service. And Hutchison has also announced that it is keen to launch its own rival service. In France, demand for handsets in a trial of telepoint in Strasbourg, has been so great that the project has had to be extended from 2,000 to 3,000 users. This month the trial is being extended further to cover Paris, where some 3,000 base stations will provide coverage not only above ground but also underground for travellers on the Metro. Within a month of PTT Telecom of the Netherlands' launch of its telepoint service, Greenpoint, on May 20, it reported over 1,000 users. Like Germany's Telekom, PTT Telecom is likely soon to face competition from a private rival, provisionally named Bluepoint. In Finland, a commercial telepoint service is due to come into service in the coming weeks following trials lasting over two years. And Belgium's Regie des Telegraphes et des Telephones is gearing up for the commercial launch of its own telepoint service. So what went wrong in the UK? The first and biggest mistake, most observers now agree, is that too many operators were licensed for the market. But this was only the beginning of a series of disasters. 'The early operators failed because they could not perceive a route to market - you can have the best product in the world but if you don't bring it to the market in the right way, it won't sell,' says Mr Brian Wolfe, group director responsible for mobile communications products at GPT, one of the leading suppliers of telepoint infrastructure and handsets. Telepoint in the UK, he explains, was originally marketed as a competitor to cellular. 'In reality, it addresses a completely different segment of the market,' says Mr Wolfe. The emphasis, he says, should have been on the home cordless telephone. 'Add to that the feature that you can use it on the street - at a cost which is hardly different to that of making a call from home - and I am sure you have the ingredients for commercial success.' Mr Mel Zizeros, principal analyst at Marlborough-based marketing consultancy MZA, agrees, but he adds that the original networks were launched prematurely. 'The three networks launched without any sort of infrastructure in place,' says Mr Zizeros. 'On top of that, the handsets were too expensive. And with several proprietary products being offered, the market was confused about the technology.' In spite of their criticisms of the UK's first generation of telepoint networks, most analysts believe that Hutchison will make a success of the new cordless technology. Hutchison has adopted a 'refreshing new approach', says Mr Tony Warwick, director of European CT-2 systems at US-owned communications equipment maker Motorola, which alongside GPT has been responsible for the telepoint infrastructure installed around the world. Hutchison launched its telepoint service, Rabbit, at the end of May in Manchester, with 800 base stations already in place. By the end of the year, it hopes to have 12,000 base stations in place to offer full coverage of the UK's main towns and transit routes. 'Coverage will be contiguous,' says Mr Peter Wright, managing director of Hutchison Personal Communications, as BYPS was renamed after its takeover by the Hong Kong company. The emphasis of his company, he says, will be never to promise what it cannot deliver. Hutchison has already expanded its network to cover the Granada, Yorkshire and the Tyne-Tees television areas where it now has 2,000 users. By the end of 1994 it hopes for 300,000 users across the UK. Some half a million low cost analogue cordless telephones are sold each year in the UK. 'If we could convert only 10 per cent of the analogue cordless phone buyers to CT-2 it would be a nice business, and I don't think that is so ambitious a target,' Mr Wright says. Add to that the new categories of business users who he believes will use cordless phones for the first time, thanks to the improved utility and better quality of telepoint technology, and the figure could well reach 300,000. When Phonepoint, the BT telepoint consortium suspended its operations, it emphasised that it was not abandoning them completely. Mr Wright acknowledges that if Hutchison succeeds in proving that telepoint can be a commercial success, it may still find itself facing competition. But, he stresses, it will not be easy for any newcomer or re-entrant. First, it would have to renegotiate licences, then it would have to think about resourcing and building its network. 'It would be the end of 1994 before anyone could reappear in the market place - and by then we'll have sealed off most of the juicy locations,' Mr Wright says. In Hong Kong, if the current rate of uptake is maintained, telepoint will overtake cellular radio in popularity next year and may even overtake radiopaging - which with 800,000 users has the highest penetration in the world - by the second half of the decade. Even the most optimistic analysts of the UK telepoint market do not believe it will do as well as Hong Kong, where the high population density and telephone culture combine to make a special case. But even if it only does half as well, all concerned will be very pleased.</p>

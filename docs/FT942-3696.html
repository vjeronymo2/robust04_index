			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Bringing the lobbyists to book - MEPs' business interests should be more transparent One of the most important tasks facing the new European Parliament will be to tighten the rules on members' business and lobbying interests. The Strasbourg assembly is already heavily lobbied by companies and industry associations trying to get European Union laws amended to protect their interests. Slightly more than half of parliament's amendments since the Single European Act came into force in 1987 have passed into the national law of the 12 member states - a total of about 2,000 changes to what the Commission in Brussels has proposed and the Council of Ministers has disposed. But under the Maastricht treaty the parliament has significantly greater powers to shape Euro-legislation - through 'co-decision' rights which enable it to veto many directives passed by a majority in the Council of Ministers. Since the virtual completion of the single market programme, the volume of Euro-law has dropped, but the stakes for lobbyists have risen. Yet the register of MEPs' interests shows that there are no effective standardised systems for requiring members to declare their interests, and that a significant minority of Euro-MPs are paid lobbyists for companies and sectors with a direct interest in influencing Euro-law. As one Euro-lobbyist puts it, 'I'd be quite careful about taking some of them (MEPs) out with a client, because a lot of them are quite capable of making a rival offer.' As a group, and by a long way, the most active lobbyists and holders of paid consultancies for industrial and commercial interests are British Conservative MEPs. The new assembly has an opportunity to clear the muddy waters because it is at the start of a parliament that members are required to fill in a declaration on their professional activities and other paid functions. The record of what they declare is kept in 15 ring-bound volumes in an obscure cubby-hole of the parliament's offices. The records travel between Brussels and Strasbourg, where parliament holds its plenaries, and occasionally Luxembourg. It can be consulted by the public under supervision, but may not be photocopied - an unnecessary safeguard since much of it is barely legible in the original. What it reveals - using the verb loosely - is widely divergent political cultures regarding what should be declared, and what paid activities may or may not risk conflict of interest for an elected representative. A great number of the entries are blank, declare no interest, or are registered only in the mother-tongue of the MEP with no translation. Among Continental Euro-MPs, it is common to state the former profession or occupation. Very frequently, especially in France, Italy, and Germany, under the heading other (usually paid) activities, will be listed another public office, such as mayor, town or regional councillor, senator, party functionary, or, for German Social Democrats from a trade union background, continuing membership of works councils or supervisory boards of Germany's leading companies. Many MEPs broadcast, write for newspapers, and lecture at universities. Indeed, a good deal of intellectual grandstanding goes into some entries, particularly among some French and Spanish MEPs, who see the register as an opportunity to outline seemingly illustrious curricula vitae: contributions to this learned journal, professorship at that university, royalties from these books, and so on. Many neo-fascist MEPs seem to think 'author' fully describes their activity. The register is full of little oddities, some piquant, some conceivably attempts at humour. Mr Robert Hersant, for example, the French press baron and absentee Giscardian MEP, lists himself professionally as a newspaper publisher and TV station proprietor, but records zero income aside from his Euro-MP's salary. Mr Jose Maria-Ruiz Mateos, the entrepreneur who accounted for nearly 3 per cent of Spanish national output until his failing Rumasa group was expropriated in the early 1980s, is apparently a businessman without an income. Mr Jens-Peter Bonde, the Danish scourge of Maastricht who appears as an accredited journalist at EU summits to bash Europe, describes himself as 'Editor (unpaid)'. Two Italian Socialists, members of a party imploded by Italy's corruption scandals, register their interests solely via a question mark. British Labour MEPs ostentatiously list all their 'freebies', or study trips paid for by governments and outside organisations, with more than a touch of righteous pedantry. The longest single entry is from Mr Bryan Cassidy, a Conservative MEP, and indeed he and his 31 Tory colleagues in the last parliament provide most of the register's meat. This could certainly be because of higher standards of disclosure. But parliament officials, Tory officials, and lobbyists all confirm that the Conservative MEPs are the most active in paid activity on behalf of industry. Only two former right-wing Spanish ministers - Eduardo Punset and Fernando Suarez - and an eccentric Dutch Christian Democrat, James Janssen Van Raay, who all sit on the boards of large companies such as Bull and Nestle, come near to rivalling them. Mr Cassidy has four consultancies, including Union Carbide and Rowland Public Affairs. Mrs Caroline Jackson consults for Mars, the Brewers Society and Market Access International, and sits on the board of Peugeot/Talbot UK. She, and others of her colleagues, are on record as saying that proximity to industry is valuable in weeding out parts of laws that could needlessly damage business. But a significant number of Tory MEPs own, or are partners in, their own PR, lobbying, or public affairs consultancies, including Tom Spencer, Edward McMillan-Scott, James Moorhouse, and Christopher Jackson. However, it has generally been British MEPs, including the Tory Bill Newton-Dunn, who have striven for tougher rules on disclosure. UK Labour MEPs, who have become the largest national unit at Strasbourg, have, as a group, not given the issue the priority that might have been expected. From July, however, there is likely to be a groundswell in favour of full disclosure, and the requirement on MEPs to declare an interest if they have links to a company affected by the legislation they are dealing with, particularly when it is at the crucial committee stage where most amending gets done. One leading lobbyist of the parliament says that 'I've only ever heard a member declare an interest in committee twice' - not a record a parliament with Strasbourg's new powers can any longer afford.</p>

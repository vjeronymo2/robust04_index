			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, 19 Mar (MENA)--The PLO has welcomed the UN  Security Council resolution condemning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre in Jerusalem [as received].    An official Palestinian source has affirmed that the  Security  Council resolution constitutes a basis for immediate enforcement  of the measures necessary to protect the Palestinian people in  the occupied territories in order to guarantee the successful  resumption of peace negotiations with Israel.    Following a meeting under Yasir 'Arafat's chairmanship  today,  the PLO called on the international community, particularly the  sponsors of the peace process, to act immediately to implement  the Council resolution, because guaranteeing the safety of the  Palestinian people and international protection for them is an  essential necessity. The PLO underlined the need to eliminate  the terrorist pockets in the settlements and to discuss the  status of armed settlers.    The official source noted that the PLO welcomed the issuing  of the Security Council resolution despite all the difficulties  and obstacles that were raised to obstruct or avert it. The PLO  also welcomed the international community's condemnation and its  endorsement of specific measures to guarantee protection for the  Palestinian people on their occupied territories, including the  disarming of settlers and the provision of an international  presence to protect the Palestinian people.    The PLO pointed out that this consensus denotes a public  awareness of the ugliness of the massacre, its dimensions and  causes, as well as eagerness to guarantee the safety and  protection of the Palestinian people.    The organization regretted the U.S. abstention on two  paragraphs on Jerusalem and the occupied territories. It  affirmed that this attitude affects the U.S. reputation,  particularly since the issue is related to Jerusalem--a very  vital issue at the Palestinian, Arab, Islamic, Christian, and  international levels--and casts doubts on the permanence of  official U.S. stands on some basic aspects in the regional  conflict.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Sport: Gather ye rosebuds - Soccer ENGLISH soccer's short, hot summer came to an early end this week. Across the Midlands crowds wrapped in sweaters against the chill gathered to watch an unseasonal spectacle: soccer in July. Their interest in the European under-18 tournament is a triumph of hope over recent experience. When England's under-18s opened the 1993-94 season by playing France at Stoke last Sunday, only 29 days had passed since England's senior team closed the 1992-93 season by losing 2-1 to Germany in Detroit after a miserable tour. Since then, Europe has been in the grip of match-rigging mania: from Warsaw to Marseilles, from Italy to the Highland League in Scotland, championships and promotions apparently settled on the playing field have been fought again round committee tables. It was left to a bunch of 18-year-olds to restore a little dignity to a battered sport. One of the most cheering aspects of England's advance to tomorrow's final against Turkey is the way the team has challenged soccer stereotypes. The English players have exploded the myth that the country's youth system cannot produce skill. They have beaten teams who possessed much more of the traditional English virtues of organisation and physical strength. National youth teams are unsteady producers of talent. England have won this competition five times since 1970 yet those teams contained only eight future internationals, led by Trevor Francis, Ray Wilkins and Glenn Hoddle but also including John Gidman (whose only full cap was against Luxembourg) and Paul Walsh (three caps against Australia). The unreliability of the pituitary gland is one reason. This is a team of tiny tots. After they beat the Dutch, Alan Mullery, the former Spurs and England midfielder, said he thought Darren Caskey, who captained the team with striking maturity, had modelled his play on another Spurs midfielder, Hoddle. Now, said Mullery, Caskey must follow Hoddle's example and make an early breakthrough into Tottenham's first team. At 18 Hoddle was already close to 6ft. I doubt that Caskey, who slipped by in his England blazer as Mullery spoke, is 5ft 8in. Even so he is taller than several team-mates. The under-18s are managed by Ted Powell, a former amateur international, but fall under the aegis of Charles Hughes, the FA coaching director, whose long-ball evangelism has earned him the contempt of the English press. At first glance the team's fluid, skilful soccer with short passes and bursts of dribbling mixed with the longer balls, is a refreshing contrast to the under-19s, whose rigid tactics made them the ugly ducklings of the spring's world championships in Sydney. In truth the under-18s are the attractive face of what Hughes has dubbed his 'winning formula'. It is a team most dangerous on rapid breaks and at set pieces. The difference is that Powell does not force his players into a tactical straitjacket. He trusts their skill and intelligence. They are free to produce the flashes of genius with which Robbie Fowler, of Liverpool, and the dazzling Julian Joachim, of Leicester, have ripped open defences. Powell is a man you would want to coach your son. On Sunday he glowed with pride as he introduced Fowler to the press. After Tuesday's win he argued that English soccer places such demands on its youngsters, even nine-year-olds, that it risks the 'physical and mental burn-out' of its potential stars. Some of Powell's squad might play 70 games a season. Their Dutch counterparts play 40 to 45. Powell's masters at the FA must share the blame. They have not managed to trim the Premier League and it does not seem to have occurred to them to reduce the size of the youth and reserve leagues where the youngsters play so much. The demands of the FA's international teams do not help. Powell complained that one promising player had turned out for his club on a Saturday, a Sunday and a Tuesday. Tomorrow's final will be England's fourth game in eight days. One reason England started this tournament as a rabble was that Manchester United and Leeds, who between them supply nine squad members, refused to let their players take part in a warm-up tour. All those games have one advantage. England's young players are battle-hardened. They were outplayed by France and Spain but knew something their opponents did not: how to win. If England's young rosebuds are to flourish in professional soccer's weed-choked garden when frozen, muddy winter comes, they will need their thorns.</p>

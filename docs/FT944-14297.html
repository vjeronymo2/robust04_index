			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Business Travel: London's train strain London City Airport claims that passengers using its services can achieve big time savings on London-Paris and London-Brussels trips compared with existing air connections via Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, or with the new Eurostar rail service via the Channel Tunnel, writes Michael Thompson-Noel. Its claims are based on published travel data. London City Airport claims a journey time to Brussels of 2 hours 25 minutes against 4 hours by Eurostar; and of 2 hours 45 minutes to Paris against Eurostar's 3 hours 45 minutes. Last week, two Eurostar trains broke down. One replacement train raced from Waterloo to Gare du Nord in a record 2 hours 50 minutes. This was 10 minutes quicker than the Eurostar journey time for Waterloo-Gare du Nord cited by London City Airport in its own promotions. Initially, tickets for the Eurostar service, which go on sale today, will start at a basic Pounds 95 (pre-booked) from London to Paris or Brussels return. Eurostar's official starting date is November 14.</p>

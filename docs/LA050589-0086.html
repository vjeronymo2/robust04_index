			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The National Hispanic Media Coalition joined forces this week with the National  Puerto Rican Forum to file negative comments against two New York TV stations  that are up for federal license renewals. The coalition, a Los Angeles-based  umbrella group, and the New York-based forum singled out WNET Channel 13, a PBS  station, and WPIX Channel 11, a Tribune Broadcasting Co.-owned station, for  their low Latino employment numbers, particularly in upper management ranks.  Both groups said WNET was the worst offender, claiming that 6.4% of its overall  work force and 3% of its top management posts were filled by Latinos. George L.  Miles, WNET's executive vice president, defended the station's commitment to  affirmative action at all levels and argued that WNET's programming "represents  all minorities and is the finest anywhere." Coalition president Armando Duron  responded that "public TV stations like WNET are under the impression that . .  . because they offer better programming, it exempts them from certain legal  requirements. We're here to tell them it doesn't." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

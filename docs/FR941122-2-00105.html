Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to its Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner at the same time on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that rule 12b&hyph;1 fee payments relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class and any incremental transfer agency costs or Class Expenses relating to the Class A, Class B, Class C or Class Y shares will be borne exclusively by that class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares, and the proper allocation of income and expenses among the classes, have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''). The Expert has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the Commission as Exhibit D to this application, stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate Substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made under the Multiple Distribution System and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to Sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide), will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request to the Funds for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation,'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness,'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The initial determination of Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a class and any subsequent changes thereto has been or will be reviewed and approved by the Directors/Trustees, including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the Directors/Trustees, and the Directors/Trustees shall review at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the four classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among the four classes of shares. This representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 7 above, and will be concurred with by the Expert or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective measures if the Expert or appropriate Substitute Expert does not so concur in the ongoing reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The prospectuses of the Funds relating to the Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person may receive different levels of compensation for selling or servicing one particular class of shares over another in a Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Directors/Trustees of the Funds with respect to the Multiple Distribution System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the Directors/Trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Directors/Trustees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The shareholder reports of each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to Class A, Class B, Class C or Class Y shares, it will disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to the four classes. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will present separately Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

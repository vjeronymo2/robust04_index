			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Trench" newscast] </F>   [Text] General Humberto Ortega's replacement is ready.  Sources close to the Presidential House have learned Major Gen.  Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo will be promoted to lieutenant general of  the Sandinist Army. He will be the highest-ranking officer in  the country, second only to the general [Humberto Ortega], of  course, who does not allow anyone to be his equal.    Sources very close to the Presidential House have leaked  that  President Violeta Barrios will announce, any moment now, the  promotion of Major Gen. Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo to lieutenant  general. Mrs. Barrios, as supreme commander of the Armed Forces  and defense minister, has the constitutional power to grant this  promotion, thus making Cuadra Lacayo the second highest-ranking  officer, second to Humberto Ortega, who does not allow any  officer to become his equal; that would be disrespectful.    It is believed this appointment represents a message to the  U.S. Government about the changes Mrs. Barrios is making to the  image of her country and government. Many see this as a maneuver  that is taking place with the concurrence of Humberto Ortega, of  course, who has just said at the Olof Palme Convention Center  that anyone trying to change the correlation of forces would  provoke further destabilization, which could lead to a new  Nicaraguan civil war.</p>

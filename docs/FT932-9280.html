			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Letter: Integrity a priority in business Sir, Louise Kehoe's article about Levi Strauss's decision to make a stand for human rights may prove to be the first in a series ('Levi Strauss rejects investment in China', May 4). The next challenge is to find a corporate leader willing to take a public stand against corruption in international business transactions. This may happen quite soon given the rising tide of public outrage over corruption - from Italy to Japan to Brazil to increasing numbers of developing countries where the attainment of more open and honest government is now a priority. There is already consideration within some governments and some aid agencies to request companies seeking to tender for big contracts to first agree to abide by a monitorable set of anti-corruption standards. What is needed is for companies to seek roles for themselves within international co-operative efforts to raise levels of honesty and integrity in business. Frank Vogl, vice chairman, Transparency International, 1100 New Hampshire Avenue NW, Washington DC, US</p>

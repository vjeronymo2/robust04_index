			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Rebels give Georgian leader deadline to resign GEORGIA's besieged president Zviad Gamsakhurdia was yesterday given until midday today local time (9am GMT) to resign by the leaders of the armed opposition or face an all-out assault on the building where he has been trapped for 12 days. Mr Gamsakhurdia, a nationalist and former anti-Soviet dissident, was elected as Georgia's leader by a landslide victory in January 1991. He vowed yesterday to continue in office and said he was able to rule the republic from the basement of Tbilisi's government building 'indefinitely'. Speaking to a small group of journalists inside the heavily guarded and fortified basement in central Tbilisi, Mr Gamsakhurdia denounced attempts by the armed opposition to overthrow him as a 'coup by the Tbilisi mafia and former communists. 'They are receiving both weapons and support from Moscow, as well as from all the criminals and mafiosi in Georgia,' Mr Gamsakhurdia said. His comments came as opposition leaders made a television broadcast announcing the formation of a temporary government committee, including representatives of all the groups which make up the loose opposition alliance. The committee imposed a curfew in the capital Tbilisi of 11pm local time, in an effort to reduce the number of casualties in the fighting in the city. The Georgian interior ministry said that at least 62 people had died, with 500 wounded. In a wood-panelled canteen converted into a makeshift broadcasting studio several metres below ground, Mr Gamsakhurdia admitted that he could not control the entire republic. But, looking healthy and relaxed, he said he doubted the opposition's ability to launch an all-out attack on the government and insisted he could continue to act as president for an indefinite period. He compared his position with that of Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the Lithuanian president, when he was surrounded by Soviet forces in the Lithuanian television centre last January. 'Landsbergis was surrounded, he had no control over the television or the newspapers, he had no airport, but still was still able to rule the republic.' His claims seemed to have some foundation. Mr Gamsakhurdia has the use of an extensive basement complex apparently designed for such a situation by Georgia's former communist masters when the government palace was constructed by German prisoners of war at the end of the Second World War. The complex has electricity from its own generator, heating and running water. It has also been receiving supplies through a route which government forces have managed to secure into the parliament through the narrow streets of Tbilisi old town. Mr Gamsakhurdia is also supported by some highly trained troops, including elite Omon soldiers. The streets of Tbilisi were quiet yesterday apart from occasional bursts of machine gun and rifle fire, but the opposition dropped several petrol bombs on the government building from a helicopter in the morning. The helicopter also attempted to drop a petrol tank on the Interior Ministry, two miles from the government building, but was driven back by a sniper on the roof top. Mr Gamsakhurdia repeated his consistent claims that Moscow supported the opposition to his presidency, and was participating in a plot to keep control of Georgia, which occupied an important strategic position as the gateway to the Caucasus. Mr Gamsakhurdia said negotiations between the two sides were impossible as long as the opposition continued to insist that his resignation must precede any talks. He said that opposition claims that Georgia was not ready for presidential rule were misguided. 'They do not understand the concept of a legislative parliament and an executive presidency.'</p>

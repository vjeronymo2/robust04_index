			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Letter: Homework that assures success in Italy Sir, The Gieves Group, when announcing a substantial loss last year, put a large measure of the blame on the higher than expected losses suffered by its new store in Milan. Opened only a year ago, the new shop has no doubt had the misfortune to experience at the outset the economic difficulties common to the sector in general, but one has to ask the question if its plight is not symptomatic of a far deeper malaise which seems to have struck British comp anies entering Italy, more than most. I have the strong impression that normally sensible British businessmen suffer a temporary loss of their critical faculties when it comes to negotiating with Italians in Italy. No-one doubts the seriousness of the vast majority of Italian businessmen, but neither should anyone under estimate their charm, especially when it is reinforced by the background 'magic of Italy'. There is a long, sad list of serious miscalculations by British investors in Italy. Many of these might have been avoided if the companies concerned had only done their basic research properly and gone to the trouble of talking to people on the spot, who between them have a wealth of experience and a ready will-ingness to give objective advice. Until British companies interested in expanding their presence in this vitally important but complex market do their homework properly, those of us living and working in Italy can only hold our breath in horror as, lemming-like, one company after another blindly goes over the brink.

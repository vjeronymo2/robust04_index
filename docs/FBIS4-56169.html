			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Walfredo Angulo] </F>   [Text] Havana, 27 Apr (PL) -- The Cuban parliament is  preparing to debate the controversial issue of cleaning up its  internal finances without resorting to the classical mechanisms  of neoliberalism, as the country faces the most difficult  economic situation in 30 years.    Financial adjustments and shock policies have been ruled out  by the authorities because the effects on the population would  be incomparably worse, according to Carlos Lage Davila,  secretary of the Council of Ministers Executive Committee.    Many parliamentarians have said the best technical solution  must be politically feasible and consistent with the strategic  goal of protecting the social accomplishments achieved over  three decades.    These measures, these sources say, must have the support of  the majority of the people, hence the great effort recently made  to extend the debate to work centers and encourage millions of  people to directly participate in this process, popularly called  workers parliaments.    The issue was extensively debated by approximately 3 million  workers, who attended more than 80,000 meetings held between  January and March at their work centers to analyze the  improvement of internal finances.    With a fiscal deficit of more that 4.2 billion pesos  (equivalent to U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate) and  excess money in circulation amounting to approximately 11  billion, Cuban authorities are seeking formulas to correct  Cuba's finances and economic feasibility and reduce the two  indexes.    Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon said there is a  consensus that no single measure will perform the miracle unless  it is accompanied by an increase in production and economic  efficiency. What is more, we are trying to earn greater profits  in state-owned companies, 69 percent of which are currently  losing money, Alarcon admitted.    Strengthening the national currency, encouraging work and  production, and restoring the role of the salary are other goals  the National Assembly could present in the special period of  sessions to begin on 1 May.</p>

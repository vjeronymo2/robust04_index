			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / International Company News: Provigo writes off CDollars 152m Provigo, one of Canada's top three food distributors, has written off CDollars 152m (USDollars 110m) to cover the loss on the sale of its California unit last month. The write-off took the third quarter net loss to CDollars 139m, or CDollars 1.62 a share, compared with a loss of CDollars 74m, or 88 cents, after special items a year earlier. Sales were little changed at CDollars 1.4bn. Provigo is being restructured and on an operating level is staging a turnround after several years of poor results. For the nine months ended November 5, its loss was CDollars 113.2m, or CDollars 1.37 a share, against CDollars 59.1m, or 79 cents, on sales little changed at CDollars 4.2bn. Provigo said its remaining Canadian business was profitable and was now concentrating on improving performance.</p>

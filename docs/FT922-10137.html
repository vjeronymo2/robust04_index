			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Don't slip up on the trip of a lifetime - How to . . . buy travel insurance TRAVEL insurance is almost too easy to get hold of. It comes with package holidays, with credit cards, and you can even buy it from a broker. So the danger of leaving these shores uninsured is not great. The problem is to make sure that you buy the right policy, which covers against a realistic selection of risks. That is much trickier. Any number of things can go wrong on holiday, and you could reasonably hope to insure against virtually any of them. Insurers might similarly exclude a large swathe of risks in the small print. Burrowing through the small print is irksome, as there is a lot of it, but important. You are also in for an insurance headache if you plan anything hazardous. Cover for an overland trip to Kathmandu will cost rather more than for a trip to Majorca. What do less adventurous souls need? The Consumers' Association suggests that the following should be a minimum: Medical expenses cover up to Pounds 250,000 in Europe, and Pounds 1m in the US and the rest of the world; Cancellation cover for the cost of the holiday, including the cost of deposit and charges paid in advance; Baggage insurance of at least Pounds 1,500; Cover for individual expensive items such as cameras, if the main baggage insurance imposes a maximum for single items; Delays insurance of Pounds 75 - useful if your baggage takes longer to arrive than you do; Money and documents insurance of Pounds 400; and, Personal liability insurance of Pounds 2m for the US, and Pounds 1m for the rest of the world. This is unlikely to be needed and so it is cheap, but it could be vital. Many packages do not reach this exacting standard. However, some may not need to, as contents and private medical insurance policies often extend their cover to when you are abroad. So you must read that small print as well. What cover is available from the different outlets? Credit Cards The travel insurance you will receive with a credit card is useful, and unless you have a particular aversion to credit, it is sensible to book air trips, or hire cars, by credit card. Travel accident insurance will be automatically included with the booking. However, you will only be covered for injuries or accidents caused while in transit in transport you have paid for with the card. The injuries will need to be severe - for example Barclaycard covers only against death, a range of specified serious injuries and total permanent disability - and a credit card is not substitute for a full travel insurance package. The industry standard is Pounds 50,000 cover with a card. According to the Credit Card Research Group, 11 issuers provide Pounds 50,000 cover, while two offer more and two less. The range is from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 70,000. Gold cards require more homework - the total covered ranges from Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 250,000. Some also offer broader travel insurance and more ambitious 'assistance' services in case you run into problems while abroad. Again it is best to check the small print, and to assume you will need to buy more insurance. Package Holidays Proceed with caution. The concept of package holidays revolves around the 'quiet life', and cutting your need to shop around for different element of the package. But many of the apparently discounted holiday packages borrow a trick from 'discounted' mortgage packages for first-time buyers which make up for reductions in mortgage payments by over-charging for buildings and contents insurance. When buying holiday insurance you may well find that what you gain on the holiday price, you lose in over-priced insurance. Holiday Which? produced a scathing report on package deals last month, finding that only four out of 32 operators surveyed offered the minimum cover required. However, most tour operators are keen, for their own convenience, to ensure that their customers have a measure of insurance. The greatest ire was reserved for travel agents. Which? found one trade promotion urging travel agents to 'cash in on the lucrative (insurance) market'. Accept an agent's offer with caution. Independent Deals Using a broker has much the same rationale as using an independent financial adviser for an investment product. You might pay more, but you should be certain of buying a policy which suits your requirements (provided you have worked them out in advance), and charges should be relatively transparent. There is a range of holiday specialist insurers, accounting for most of the Consumers' Association's best buys. These were compiled on the assumption that travellers were buying the cover listed above, for a two-week trip in Europe, and a three-week trip elsewhere in the world. The best buy for Europe was Whiteley (0422-348411) with a Pounds 13.90 premium, followed by Briggs &amp; Hill (0535-606121) at Pounds 15.90, and Royal Bank of Scotland at Pounds 16.50. For the US, the best value came from Thomas Cook (Independent) (0733-503222) at Pounds 44.05, followed by Accident &amp; General at Pounds 44.50 and AT Mays at Pounds 44.90. Worldwide, the leader is Whiteley at Pounds 34.10. Next come Briggs &amp; Hill at Pounds 38.90, and Link Insurance At Lloyd's (0622-692002) with a premium of Pounds 40. Unusual Risks This takes you into a different world. The chances are that someone, somewhere, will be able to insure any risk you are prepared to take, but you will have to look around, and you will have to spend money. The 1992 Insurance Buyer's Guide provides information on covering against a range of disasters. It lists three companies prepared to offer cover for 'activity holidays'. Campbell Irvine (071-937-6981) offers cover over periods from one week to 12 months. It says premiums will be quoted instantly for individual risks 'such as scuba-diving, parachuting, hot air ballooning, ocean sailing etc.' Policies are underwritten at Lloyd's, and other intermediaries will receive 20 per cent commission. Crispin Speers &amp; Partners (071-480-5083) says: 'No matter where the clients are going or what they are doing, the company can cover them'. Minimum premium is Pounds 150. Policies are underwritten at Lloyd's, with a 10 per cent commission for other intermediaries. Hayman Jackson Travel Insurance Services (0730-60222) covers 'anything from amateur sports to hang gliding, mountaineering and expeditions'. Commission to intermediaries is 20 per cent. Special insurance deals are available for adventure holidays, and for group holidays - for example, Galaxy 7 Policies provides touring and travel policies for brass bands, marching bands and 'entertainers'. Be sure that you know what the consequences would be if something went wrong. For example, those trekking in Nepal should be insured against the risk of needing to call in helicopter rescue. War risks bulk larger than they did, as unrest emerges from eastern Europe to southern California. Several specialist insurers will cover you for war risks, but last month TSB became the first mainstream company to do so. TSB has abolished any exclusion from cover due to 'war risks'. This means that if you were unlucky enough to be in Bosnia-Herzegovina when hostilities broke out, you would be covered. However, this does not subvert the usual stipulation that insured people are not reckless. TSB would not be happy to pay out if you were injured having taken a helicopter tour over Kabul.</p>

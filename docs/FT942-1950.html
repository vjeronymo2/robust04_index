			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Taiwanese re-exports down Recent tensions and China's economic woes were reflected in May orders for Taiwan's exports to Hong Kong, which dropped 16.4 per cent from the April level, but climbed 9.3 per cent year-on-year, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei. Most of Taiwan's exports to Hong Kong are re-exported to China. Taiwan's total export orders last month were Dollars 7.77bn, down 0.5 per cent from April but up 4.1 per cent from May 1993, the economics ministry said yesterday. Jan-May export orders were Dollars 36.86bn, up 4.4 per cent from the equivalent period last year. Orders received from the US, Taiwan's biggest market, were Dollars 2.99bn in May, up 9.4 per cent from April and 4.6 per cent from a year earlier. For Jan-May, orders from the US were up 2.9 per cent from the same period in 1993. China, via Hong Kong, is Taiwan's fastest-growing export market with 17.2 per cent of May orders.</p>

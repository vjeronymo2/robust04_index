			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Yeltsin urges aid to ward off 'threat' to democracy MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Rus-sian president, yesterday called for immediate and substantial western aid to stave off what he called 'the serious danger of reaction' in Russia. Mr Yeltsin, speaking at a joint news conference with French president Francois Mitterrand, said: 'There is a very, very serious threat hanging over democracy and reforms.' He said last week's session of the Congress of People's Deputies, the country's top legislature, showed that communist forces were intent on avenging their defeat in the 1991 coup. 'I believe the western world and western countries did not understand the reality of revanchism before the eighth Congress,' Mr Yeltsin said in calling urgently for aid. 'We cannot wait for Tokyo in June or July. It may prove too late.' Mr Mitterrand suggested Group of Seven leaders meet as soon as possible after Mr Yeltsin's summit with President Bill Clinton in Vancouver on April 4 to discuss Russia's problems. When asked if the west would continue its support for Mr Yeltsin if he introduced authoritarian measures, Mr Mitterrand said: 'If we must choose between camps in the country, then we will choose the camp which continues democratic and economic reform.' Mr Yeltsin had 'proposals to make to the Russian people and I am certain he will do so in a democratic way', he said. Mr Yeltsin has said he will hold a plebiscite next month. In doing so, he will directly challenge parliament, which has ruled such a move unconstitutional and has voted itself the powers to strip him of office. Mr Yeltsin said he would not make 'rash decisions' but would decide what to do soon. He and Mr Mitterrand said the crisis would have to be settled in the next few weeks. The French president made clear there were sharply differing views among G7 countries on the question of aid. France and Germany were leading those who believed in the need for urgent action. Japan, by contrast, had so far refused to take part in a high-level G7 meeting before the scheduled heads of state conference in Tokyo in July. Mr Mitterrand suggested that, if Japan continued to refuse to take part, the meeting should go ahead outside the formal boundaries of the G7 process. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development announced it had signed a Dollars 43.8m technical co-operation loan to aid privatisation in Russia.

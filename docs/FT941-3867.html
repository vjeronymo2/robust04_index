			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / SPD set to win Lower Saxony: Christian Democrats slip to worst result in state election for 35 years Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) was coasting to a clear victory in the state election in Lower Saxony last night, with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union slipping to its worst result in the state since 1959. Lower Saxony's vote is seen as a key indicator of Chancellor Kohl's prospects in 19 elections this year, which culminate with the general election on October 16. That will be preceded by 16 state and local authority elections, an electoral assembly for federal president in May and European elections in June. The vote yesterday confirms the uphill struggle Mr Kohl faces if he is to win re-election, even though the SPD has yet to gain a decisive lead at a national level. Exit polls on German television predicted the SPD would win more than 44 per cent in Germany's fourth most populous state. The CDU was forecast to win up to 36.5 per cent. Mr Gerhard Schroder, SPD premier, expressed confidence that he would win an absolute majority in the Hanover-based Lower Saxony state parliament and be able to rule without his coalition partner, the Green party. Mr Jurgen Trittin, the leading Green party minister in the outgoing SPD-Green coalition in Hanover, said: 'This is the day the 'twilight of the chancellor' began in Bonn.' Yet the result amounts to less of a setback for Mr Kohl than had been feared by some party members. It may be less of a victory for the Social Democrats, who seemed unlikely to improve on the vote won in Lower Saxony in 1990, despite the Bonn government's obvious unpopularity. The CDU did far worse in both previous local elections - in Hamburg last September, when it fell to 25 per cent support, and Brandenburg in December, when it barely won 20 per cent and fell to third place behind the former Democratic Socialist party (PDS), the former Communists. The exit polls also suggest that protest parties, including the extreme rightwing Republicans, the non-party Statt Partei, and the now relatively well-established Greens, have not risen to the extent predicted by some political observers. The Green party, which has been in coalition with the SPD since the last elections in 1990, was likely to win up to 7.5 per cent, a small improvement on the 5.5 per cent it won in the 1990 election. The Free Democratic party (FDP), Chancellor Kohl's partners in the Bonn coalition, appear to have slipped a little from 6 per cent last time, and may fail to reach the 5 per cent minimum needed to win seats in the state parliament. The Republicans were likely to win at most 4 per cent, according to the exit poll conducted by ZDF television. The Statt Partei, which caused a small sensation when it won more than 6 per cent in Hamburg last year, was forecast to get no more than 1.5 per cent this time.

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Betting fall hits Ladbroke Starkly differing trading statements from two of Britain's biggest hoteliers saw the respective shares record predictably opposite fortunes yesterday. Ladbroke caused the most surprise as the annual meeting revealed a downturn in its credit betting business and disappointing performance from its Hilton hotels division. The veiled profits warning put the shares under immediate pressure as leisure analysts lopped around 8 per cent from their current year forecasts, pulling back to the Pounds 135m-145m range, and several also downgraded their performance rating. 'What is worrying is that the problems are in two of Ladbroke's core businesses,' commented one formerly bullish analyst. The shares ended a torturous session 16 1/2 down at 182 1/2 p, the worst performing FTSE 100 stock, with turnover a hefty 8.9m, the biggest in the market. In contrast, Forte produced a positive agm statement, which although less detailed than Ladbroke's, said that trading was improving through longer occupancies and firmer room rates. Forte shares moved ahead on the news but fell back with the market to close unchanged at 232p.</p>

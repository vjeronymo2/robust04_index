			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (2): Tax changes prove to be a spur to long-term savers - A look at the spectacular growth of mutual funds REPSOL, SPAIN's state controlled oil, gas and chemical conglomerate, placed three-year convertible bonds worth Pta80bn (Pounds 435m) with small domestic investors last month, despite the fact that it had scarcely bothered to advertise the issue. Originally the issue was to have been Pta25bn, but such was the demand for Repsol paper that the conglomerate successively raised its volume to Pta50bn and to Pta80bn. What Repsol did was to concentrate its energies on fund managers. The conglomerate, using the considerable muscle that it exercises in the domestic corporate scene, wrote into its contract with the managers of the issue that those who actually sold the bonds were entitled to a handsome 2.75 per cent commission. Repsol had placed a limit of a Pta8m investment, which allowed individuals to buy a maximum 800 bonds priced at Pta10,000. Fund managers, stimulated by the commission, accordingly bought major blocks of bonds and energetically started spreading them around their clients. Perhaps as many as 300,000 small investors have ended up owning the conglomerate's bonds. 'Repsol issue went great guns, but it has the fondos to thank for its success,' says Mr Francesc Guardans, chief executive of Societe Generale de Valores, the French financial group's Spanish stockbroking arm. Repsol had indeed successfully identified the potential of a key development in Spain's financial markets. In its annual report the CNMV, the Madrid-based stock market commission, noted that 1991 had marked the 'authentic launch of collective investment in Spain'. Between 1990 and 1991, the number of mutual fund institutions increased from 550 to 662, the total number of their participants doubled from 570,000 to 1.1m, and the volume of their assets held by the institutions quadrupled from Pta1.502bn to Pta4.244bn. The spectacular increase was the result of a substantial change in the fiscal treatment of mutual funds that was aimed at encouraging long-term saving, which struck a immediate and deep chord in the public. In a major publicity campaign, Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, artfully sold the fondos that they had created in the wake of the legislation as virtual tax havens. Between them, Santander and BBV have captured some 26 per cent of the total funds under management. In 1990 the total assets of mutual funds in Spain represented 3 per cent of GDP, whereas in France the volume of such assets is the equivalent of 22 per cent of the GDP, and in the UK it is 8.4 per cent. By the end of 1991, Spain's mutual funds represented 7.75 per cent of the GDP, a higher proportion than in Germany, Italy and Belgium. The CNMV asserted in its report that the funds will continue to increase in both participants and assets in the future, 'although the rhythm of growth could be a more moderate'. Madrid brokers Maxwell and Espinosa believe the growth will be sustained, and estimate that the total of assets by the end of this year may virtually double to between Pta7.000 and Pta8.000. The thinking at the CNMV, and among the Spanish broking community, is that the equities market will in time be a clear beneficiary of the major build up of the funds. At present, this is not the case, for less than 5 per cent of the funds under management are invested in the stock market. What the analysts note, however, is that the funds are continuing to grow at a time when the government is lowering its borrowing requirements. Government borrowing increased by Pta1.700bn in the last six months of last year, but the net increase of total borrowing this year is unlikely to be more than Pta1.200. Maxwell and Espinosa report that, at the height of the government's demand for cash last year, domestic fund managers were already left short of fixed-income paper, and that the gilt yields in secondary markets were being constantly bid down. This situation is likely to become more acute this year, due to the government's reduced requirements, and fund managers are therefore going to be forced into diversifying. What the markets are obviously hoping for is that fund managers will begin to look at high-yield equities. In this respect, Repsol's convertible bonds are a timely taster for such an event, for the issue seeks, by way of an 8 per cent discount, to have almost all the new bond holders converting their paper to shares at the first opportunity, which will be in September. Mr Juan Vilanova, deputy director of BBV Interactivos, believes that domestic fund managers will gain an increasing awareness of the stockmarket and begin shifting part of their assets towards it. In a New York or in a London, some 40 per cent of a mutual fund is invested in equities. Nobody realistically expects such a ratio in Spain; but nor does anyone believe that the present mere 5 per cent of domestic funds that is invested in the bolsa will continue to be the norm.  ----------------------------------------------                MUTUAL FUND LEADERS  ----------------------------------------------                                Volume   Market                               (Pta bn)   share Bank                          31/3/92        %  ---------------------------------------------- Gp Santander                      699    13.09 Grupo BBV                         673    12.71 La Caixa                          485     9.10 Bankinter                         331     6.26 Argentaria                        286     5.31 Caja Madrid                       233     4.36 BCH                               223     4.17 Banesto                           180     3.41  ---------------------------------------------- Source: 'Expansion'  ----------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------               THE GROWTH OF MUTUAL FUNDS  -------------------------------------------------------              Number of         Assets    Participants             institutions      (Pta m)       (000s)  ------------------------------------------------------- 1985                 231      308,588        286.2 1988                 403    1,057,378        561.2 1990                 550    1,502,513        570.0 1991                 662    4,244,458      1,145.1  ------------------------------------------------------- Source: CNMV  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

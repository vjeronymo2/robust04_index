Leader Yi Chong-chan and member Chang Kyong-u of the New  Korea Party, New Party for Political Reform Chairman Pak  Chong-chan, Han Yong-su of the United People's Party and  independent Yang Sun-chik will get together to try and iron out  their differences in organizing a third group.    Under the law, a negotiating group is eligible only if it  contains more than 20 lawmakers. Currently, the floor is  limited to the ruling Democratic Liberal Party and main  opposition Democratic Party.    Initially, 21 concerned lawmakers were to hold a meeting on  Monday to officially announce the idea and register the new  floor group on the following day, when the ad hoc National  Assembly session opens.    But the schedule has become unclear as a few lawmakers are  now saying there is no hurry.    "Although we may not register immediately, we will hold the  meeting on Monday as scheduled," Yi of the New Korea Party said.    "The date is a bit too close for comfort and I say we take  our time," independent Yang said, adding that he will think  about attending Monday's meeting.</p>

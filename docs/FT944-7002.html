			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: A legal way to rig the market - Serious Money What is the difference between a gumshoe and a greenshoe? And which would you send to track down the other? Lovers of classic American detective fiction will have no trouble with gumshoe - the sleuth for hire. Greenshoe has been slower to cross the Atlantic, even as a practice. But it is a term new-issue fans would do well to grapple with - for it is an integral part of what old-fashioned investors might describe as authorised market-rigging. When a big international issue - such as BT, TeleWest or BSkyB - comes to the stock market, everybody connected with it is very keen that the market price should stay above the issue price for a decent period after the launch. The professional investors do not want to lose money. The company does not want to end up with a lot of disgruntled shareholders. And the banks underwriting the issue want to keep both clients and large investors sweet. So, the banks have found a natty little mechanism which allows them effectively to guarantee that the share price will not fall below the issue price for a month. The mechanism is simplicity itself. If the market price gets dangerously close to the issue price - because there are more sellers than buyers - the underwriters just buy up the excess shares. And this altruism costs them nothing. Here is how it works. Underwriters are wholesalers: they buy shares from the issuer and sell them on to investors. Normally, they aim to match the number of shares they buy from the issuer with the number of shares they sell to investors. But if the underwriters are planning a price support operation, they deliberately sell more shares to investors than they buy from the issuer and leave themselves short of stock. Being short of stock is dangerous: if the price goes up, you could have to pay more to buy in shares than you got when you sold them. So, the underwriters need an insurance policy which guarantees them against such losses. This is where the greenshoe comes in. It is an option granted by the issuer to the underwriters which allows them to buy additional shares in the company at the offer price if they need to cover their short sales. Like any insurance policy, the greenshoe is an enabling tool, not an objective. The point of the exercise is to enable the underwriters to support the share price if necessary. If the price is looking soggy, the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase shares from the issuers; instead, they buy the extra shares they need to cover their short sales through the stock market. And, in squaring their own books, they coincidentally support the share price of a valued client at a delicate moment. It is an exercise of great beauty. Everybody who matters knows exactly what is going on. The prospectus will have a little clause saying something like: 'The underwriters may over-allot or effect transactions which stabilise or maintain the market price of the shares at levels above those which might otherwise prevail in the open market.' The over-allotment option is limited to 15 per cent of the shares being sold and there is a 30-day limit to the support operation. And when the underwriters have stopped supporting the price, they put out an announcement saying so. Meanwhile, any professional investor worried about the short-term outlook has taken the opportunity to sell some shares at the issue price. Fine, but . . . The guy left out in the cold is - as so often - the private investor. Say you have bought shares in TeleWest or BSkyB and notice the share price hovering close to the issue price for several weeks after the launch; you could well shrug your shoulders and hope that floor will hold. It might - but there is no guarantee once the artificial prop has been removed. It is, normally, illegal for companies to buy their own shares. And illegal, covert share price-rigging was the nub of the Guinness scandal. Greenshoes are legal, open and above board. But market-rigging is market-rigging even when it has its acceptable face on. The British Assets' reorganisation looks like a fudge. The basic problem is that, in order to get an above-average yield on their investment portfolio, the managers have invested in securities unlikely to produce adequate capital growth. The honest answer to this might be to cut the dividend. Instead, they are proposing a pseudo split-capital trust which leaves shareholders with Hobson's choice. Either they cling on to all their income - and watch their capital growth being diluted by other investors' warrants - or they accept an immediate reduction in yield.</p>

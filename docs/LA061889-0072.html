			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC NOTEBOOK: BEBOP, HOME OF RECORDS AND CONCERTS, TEETERING ON THE FISCAL  BRINK  </P> <P> The future of BeBop Records &amp; Fine Art in Reseda, never a highly profitable  and secure business, is once again in doubt, according to its owner, Richard  Bruland.  </P> <P> "I don't know how much longer we can keep going," Bruland said. "I haven't been  able to pay June's rent yet."  </P> <P> Operating in a precarious financial state is nothing new for Bruland. It what  he expected when he started his record store in 1982.  </P> <P> Unlike his competitors, who display the latest big-name releases, Bruland sells  mostly oldies and offbeat records. At night, his store turns into a  mini-concert venue -- 49-seat capacity -- especially appealing for acoustic  singers and songwriters. He doesn't charge for the shows.  </P> <P> But record sales have decreased in recent months, partially due to poor  attendance at concerts.  </P> <P> "I have to rely on consistently well-attended concerts, and we're not getting  that," he said. "We've had some cancellations and had shows where less than 10  people have shown up. And I need people in the store to buy the records."  </P> <P> Through it all, though, Bruland remains an optimist. He's had shows over the  years filled to capacity.  </P> <P> "We've had bad times before and something always happens to keep us going," he  said. "But the possibility of closing is always here."  </P> <P> Two Westside music venues -- the Coconut Teaszer in West Hollywood and the  Breakaway in Venice -- have started new special shows.  </P> <P> A new series called "The Coconut Teaszer presents L.A.'s Best-Kept Secrets"  began Tuesday. The series, which will stage shows every other Tuesday night, is  designed to showcase unsigned acts who have often appeared at the club.  </P> <P> "We're just trying to get more exposure for these bands that we like so much,"  said Audrey Marpoc, an assistant at the club. "We will invite all kinds of  record people from different labels to see these bands. And it gives us  credibility, too. If they become really successful, it makes us look good."  </P> <P> Marpoc said the only requirement for the bands is that they are unsigned. She  said each show will present about six bands, doing 20-minute sets each.  Ideally, she said, each Tuesday night will offer a different musical theme.  </P> <P> The first show's bands were Rebel Train, David Shelly, Slave, The Sheilas, Rain  on Fire and Sacred Heart.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at the Breakaway, a new country music night has started Wednesdays.  Jay Tinksy, talent coordinator for the restaurant/club, said: "There didn't  seem to be enough country outlets for the amount of talented country artists.  We will present the professional talent, as well as the new guy. We're not  going to turn away Dwight Yoakam."  </P> <P> Tinksy added that the country performers will be doing acoustic sets, which  fits in perfectly with the club's format.  </P> <P> Ronnie Mack, who hosts KCSN's weekly Tuesday night Barn Dance at the Palomino  in North Hollywood, said he believes that the country night at the Breakaway  stands a good chance of succeeding.  </P> <P> "The place is suited for acoustic music and has a built-in audience already,"  Mack said. "Anything that promotes more country is good."  </P></p>

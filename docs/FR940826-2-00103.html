			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's proposed order prevents these measures, and thus prevents the BOC from marketing or offering services that its interexchange competitors cannot match by reason of the BOC's control of the duopoly cellular exchange. To the extent the BOC designs service offerings that are attractive to customers, and successfully markets them, the BOCs will properly obtain business. But their interexchange competitors will likewise be able to make offerings that might be attractive to customers, on the same basis as the BOCs can. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific restrictions, which are set forth in Section VIII(L)(3)(f) and (g) of the Department's proposed order, require a separation of the persons responsible for administering presubscription (referred to as the ``wireless exchange sales force'') from persons who market the BOC's interexchange services (the ``long distance sales force''). However sold, the BOCs would be required to state separately the prices for cellular service and long distance service, and would not be permitted to offer blended or bundled service offerings. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(a)(5). Nothing would prohibit them from making claims in marketing or advertising that either their cellular service or their long distance service is more favorably priced than their competitors'. If a BOC provides its customers with a single bill for cellular and interexchange service, it would be required to permit similar billing arrangements by its long distance competitors. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department would not seek to preclude the BOCs from marketing the long distance services it believes they should be allowed to provide, and believes that the long distance sales force should be permitted to sell cellular service as well. However, this sales force should not be given any advantages not also given to the BOC's interexchange competitors: It should receive any cellular customer lists at the same time and under the same terms as the BOCs' competitors, and should not receive any additional information about those customers (eg. their cellular telephone numbers, their usage patterns) unless the same information is provided to competing interexchange carriers. <FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>  The long distance sales force is also required to advise customers that they have a right to choose interexchange carriers. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(g)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 51 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Those carriers would be restricted in their use of that information to the marketing of interexchange services; interexchange carriers affiliated with wireless carriers would not be able to use this confidential information to market wireless services. The largest interexchange carrier, AT&amp;T, is subject to the same separation and marketing restrictions. AT&amp;T/McCaw Decree, Section IV.C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``wireless exchange sales force,'' the group responsible for administering presubscription, includes salespersons in retail stores and those who receive inquiries. Those salespersons, like persons selling BOC cellular service today, would be required to provide the customer with a ballot to select an interexchange carrier, and would not be allowed to sell long distance service or advocate that the customer purchase BOC long distance service. Proposed Order, &sect;VII(L)(3)(f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department does not agree with the BOCs that these restrictions are ``unduly restrictive.'' (BOC Mem. 18) Rather, these marketing and billing restrictions are necessary to allow the BOCs to market their interexchange services while providing their competitors with the opportunity to compete on equal terms, thereby providing consumers with a meaningful opportunity to make an informed choice. By comparison, the BOC proposed order and equal access plan are silent (or at best ambiguous) as to whether bundled service offerings are permitted, and whether competing interexchange carriers will be permitted to create their own bundles. <FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>  The Department's proposal requires unbundled offers, and requires the BOCs to provide their long distance competitors with customer lists at the same time as that information is provided to their long distance sales force. <FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>  Under these arrangements, carriers that do not control cellular exchanges, and cannot themselves provide both cellular and long distance service, nonetheless have an opportunity to market long distance services to BOC cellular customers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 52 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The BOC order does require that exchange access and exchange services of such access be provided to interexchange carriers ``on an unbundled basis, that is equal in type, quality and price to that provided to any interexchange service provided by the Bell company or an affiliate thereof.'' BOC Proposed Order &sect;I.4,p.3. If there were separations between the cellular and long distance sales operations, this language presumably would prohibit the BOC from ``selling'' cellular service to an affiliated packager at lower prices than offered to competing interexchange carriers, and the BOC could not bundle cellular and long distance services in combinations that other interexchange carriers could not match. However, in the absence of such separations, it is unclear whether the BOCs' proposed order would in fact prevent discriminatory bundling, and it would be difficult for the Department to determine, in attempting to enforce the conditions to this waiver order, whether the BOC had discriminated. The Department's proposed order makes these discriminations clearly prohibited and more easily detected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 53 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The BOC equal access plan provides that a Bell cellular affiliate ``may use customer names, addresses and mobile numbers to market its own interexchange operations only if it provides that information on the same terms and conditions to unaffiliated'' interexchange carriers. (BOC Model Equal Access Plan, p. 4) However, absent separation between the cellular and long distance sales forces, there can be no genuine assurance that the BOC will in fact not receive these customer names before its competitors do, and little opportunity to enforce this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> C. Appropriate Safeguards Are Also Required To Prevent Abuse of the Landline Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is also true, as AT&amp;T has stressed, that the possibility exists that the BOCs could use their control of the local exchange to discriminate against competing interchange carriers, who rely on the local exchange for their access to both the wireline and nonwireline cellular exchanges. Cellular exchanges likewise relies on the local exchange for interconnection to local exchange customers, for access to interexchange carriers, and often for transport between cellular switches and cell sites within the cellular network. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

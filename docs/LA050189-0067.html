			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Damages Awarded in Suit on Honda ATV: Honda Motor Co. of Japan will appeal $5.9  million in damages awarded to a Salem, Ore., man who was injured while riding a  Honda three-wheel all-terrain vehicle, a spokesman said. A Multnomah County  Circuit Court Jury awarded damages Friday for Karl Oberg, 24. Honda's  all-terrain off-road vehicle has been banned from sale in the United States  since March, 1988, when the U.S. government filed suits charging the vehicles  had design flaws that made them dangerous. "Honda is extremely disappointed in  the verdict and believes it is excessive and unwarranted," Kurt Antonius of  American Honda Motor Co. Inc. of Gardena, Calif., said Saturday. "We will  pursue all of the appropriate legal remedies, including appeal."  </P></p>

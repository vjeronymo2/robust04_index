			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One purpose of the proposal is to respond to participants who have requested that DGOC's settlement procedures more closely follow the practices already established in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') marketplace for the settlement of purchases and sales of Treasury securities and for the settlement of exercised options on such securities. by shortening DGOC's settlement periods to conform to the industry standards, DGOC will reduce the amount of time such settlement obligations remain outstanding which in turn will reduce credit exposure to DGOC as well as generally in the settling of options on Government securities. DGOC's use of the same settlement period as is used in settlement of similar OTC options will help to ensure a consistent approach among clearing entities and should serve as a platform for additional coordination among clearing entities clearing identical or complimentary securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because DGOC's current settlement period of two to five business days is longer than the settlement period for similar OTC products cleared outside of DGOC, DGOC-issued options carry a price adjustment for the additional financing costs. As a result, the price of DGOC-issued options does not match exactly those of similar OTC-traded options. Implementation of DGOC's revised settlement procedures will make the relative values of DGOC-issued options comparable to those of OTC-traded options and will eliminate participants' need to make the additional calculations necessary to correlate the price of DGOC-issued options with the price of OTC-traded options. Therefore, this proposal should provide participants greater ease in trading and exercising options issued by DGOC. The proposal also should result in more options on Government securities being cleared and settled through the automated facilities of DGOC, a registered clearing agency which participates in the national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. These are options transactions that otherwise would be cleared through decentralized and labor intensive processes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In connection with the shorter settlement time frames, the rule change enables DGOC to allocate exercise settlement obligations prior to 8:00 a.m. on the day prior to settlement and, as noted above, permits accelerated settlement time frames that are more consistent with settlement of exercised options and settlement of securities in the cash market. These changes should help DGOC to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and should foster cooperation and coordination by persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The proposal also clarifies DGOC's buy-in procedures while providing DGOC with more flexibility concerning buy-ins. The Commission believes that these changes improve DGOC's ability to deal with the risks associated with the failure of a participant to fulfill its delivery obligation. By doing so, the modified buy-in procedures better enables DGOC to fulfill its statutory obligations to safeguard securities and funds within its possession or control for which it is responsible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

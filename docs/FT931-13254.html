			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Brown attacks Tories over banks LABOUR WILL this week seek to anticipate a Treasury review of the high-street banks' treatment of their customers by publishing its own damning report on charges, interest-rate margins and commissions. At the same time Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, will charge the government with serving the interests of the banking community before those of the public as a direct consequence of the Tories' many close personal connections with the sector. Labour's report will list several Tory MPs or former MPs who sit on bank boards or act as bank consultants. Mr Brown is due to meet members of the Bank Action Group, a consumers' lobby, before a conference on banking practice tomorrow at which he will renew Labour's call for a public inquiry into alleged excessive charges and inadequate services. Labour says bank charges have increased by Pounds 1.5bn since 1989 and customer complaints have risen from 1,682 to 10,109 a year over the past five years. Meanwhile, the Treasury review of banking practices, expected to be unveiled this week by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, may call on the banks to appoint internal ombudsmen to tackle the complaints of small-business customers. The review is expected to confirm that there has been a large increase in business tariffs but is also thought likely largely to exonerate the banks from charges that they have not passed on interest-rate cuts.</p>

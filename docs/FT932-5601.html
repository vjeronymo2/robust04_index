			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Venezuelan parties make presidency pact THE leaders of Venezuela's two dominant political parties have chosen Senator Ramon J. Velasquez, a respected writer and historian, as their candidate to become the country's provisional president. This decision by the ruling Democratic Action party (AD) and the opposition Christian democratic Copei may solve the national leadership crisis, which arose when President Carlos Andres Perez was suspended from office on May 21 to face corruption charges. Mr Octavio Lepage, chairman of the Senate, was sworn in as acting-president immediately after the suspension but the opposition parties have been calling for his removal. Both chambers of Congress must meet to consider the candidacy and vote in secret on the new provisional president. This is expected by the end of the week. The canddate should secure a majority because the two main political parties dominate Congress. A full presidential election is due in December. Mr Velasquez has asked the two main parties for special powers to enact by decree a series of reforms that have been languishing in Congress for months. These are expected to include new taxes to help cover the govenrment's fiscal deficit, tax cuts, levies on the national oil company, a reform of the privatisation law, and a bill authorising central government borrowing this year.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MSU TACKLE TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL  </P> <P> higan State offensive tackle Tony Mandarich said he plans to drop out of school  and move to Los Angeles to escape allegations that he has used steroids.  </P> <P> "I just need to get away from everybody," Mandarich said. "A lot of people get  on my nerves. It really annoys me when people talk behind my back."  </P> <P> Allegations of steroid use have haunted the 320-pound tackle despite being  cleared by three recent drug tests. Mandarich, named to the All-America team  for the last two years, is expected to be the first-round draft pick of the  Green Bay Packers, who own the second pick overall in next month's draft.  </P> <P> "It's a disappointment to me that he's decided to leave when he's so close to  graduating," said Charlie Wilson, Michigan State's athletic academic counselor,  adding that Mandarich is 17 credits, or one term, shy of earning a bachelor's  degree.  </P></p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Recovery signs in Pilkington's doubled profits: Glass group's shares advance, but cautious note on auto demand Pilkington has made the most of a glimmer of recovery in some of its markets by doubling pre-tax profits from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 30.5m, in the half-year to end-September. The glass maker suffered badly in the recession with annual profits plunging from Pounds 302m in 1989-90 to Pounds 41m in 1992-93. But yesterday Sir Anthony Pilkington, chairman, said: 'Things are moving in the right direction.' The group's shares rose 11p to 168p. Sir Anthony remained cautious. He warned, for instance, that short-time working at Ford and Nissan car plants in the UK would affect the second half. The interim dividend was cut from 2.93p to 1.5p. The group said this was to restore the balance, after the second dividend had been cut twice. Although Pilkington's largest subsidiary, the German glass-maker Flachglas, has been exposed to a 20 per cent downturn in German car production, continued strength in the housing market kept Flachglas in profit in the half year. Continental Europe was still worsening, Pilkington said, while the UK was showing early signs of recovery. Results were improving in the US and were good in the southern hemisphere, including Latin America and Australia. Results from Libbey-Owens-Ford in North America showed how a rise in volumes could lead to firmer prices and sharply higher profits. Volumes to automotive manufacturers rose 6 per cent, to the replacement windscreen market 13 per cent and to the residential market 14 per cent. Operating profits from the US rose sixfold from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 15.4m on sales 28.5 per cent higher at Pounds 341.3m. Group borrowings rose to Pounds 1.02bn from Pounds 932m at the year-end, following the Pounds 95m acquisition of Heywood Williams' glass division, giving gearing of 87 per cent. However, since September Pilkington has received Pounds 200m in cash from the sale of Sola, its spectacle lens business, which also added Pounds 56m to shareholders' funds, and cut gearing to 67 per cent. An exceptional profit of Pounds 38m will be recorded. The group is aiming to bring gearing below 50 per cent by 1995. Further disposals are expected, although nothing substantial in the second half. Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said cashflow had been marginally positive before capital expenditure and acquisitions. Mr Roger Leverton, chief executive, said, with capital expenditure held below depreciation and working capital being constrained, the group should be cash positive for the year for the first time since 1989.

			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Brazil, worried about dwindling cash reserves, missed an $812-million interest  payment on its $112-billion foreign debt, but the government denied it plans to  declare a new moratorium. Brazil owes about $9 billion to creditors in the  so-called Paris Club of 10 top industrialized nations. A Finance Ministry  spokeswoman said the government had postponed a payment for one week because of  "operative problems." The delay in current payments comes as the central bank,  Brazil's equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve, is attempting to stem the  outflow of money from the country and keep currency reserves from falling below  a critical level.  </P></p>

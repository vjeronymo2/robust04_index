			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ingmar Lindmarker: "Russian Talk About Interest </F> Sphere Worries Sweden"]    [Text] The Swedish Government has pointed out by means of  diplomacy that leading Western powers much too easily accept the  new Russian talk of interest spheres in Europe. The complaint is  an element of the careful Swedish monitoring of the political  development in the former Soviet Union and East and West Europe.    On the Swedish side it is stressed that the Western  democracies should constantly insist that the relations between  Russia and the weak states that were created after the Soviet  collapse be governed by international law.    "Anything else would be dangerous in view of the often  fragile national formations," says Lars-Ake Nilsson, under  secretary of state for foreign affairs at the Foreign Ministry.  "The major Western powers have accepted the Russian  interest-sphere thinking a little too easily, something we  regard as unacceptable."  <H5>  Believe in Russia </H5>   Nilsson, who was minister to Moscow for four years and  ambassador in Prague for three years before being appointed the  Foreign Ministry's highest spokesman, is commenting after the  publication of SVENSKA DAGBLADET's series of articles "Uncertain  East Europe." It has pointed up the fear of East Europeans that  they might not make it into the West European warmth before a  new icy Russian chill begins.    The under secretary confirms that the principal orientation  of the Swedish Eastern policy is to build up European security  not against but with Russia. The essential part is to preserve  and intensify the democracy that is stumbling ahead in Russia  and help the Russians push through a policy of economic reform.    "It is much too soon to write off the Russian democracy and  give up all hope that the Russians will somehow succeed in  getting through all the difficulties," in Lars-Ake Nilsson's  opinion. "That is the scenario we are pursuing."    In a country such as Poland, sharp criticism is being voiced  against NATO for not already allowing the East and Central  Europeans in, and a corresponding fear of Russian expansionism.  Poles and others are talking about appeasement policies toward  Russia, draw parallels with the 1930's, and find similarities  between extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Adolf Hitler. The  Foreign Ministry's evaluation is that Zhirinovskiy as an actor  and political phenomenon is both disturbing and unpleasant, but  that he is already quite busy unmasking himself.  <H5>  Various Groups </H5>   "We hope that this will also have a full impact on Russian  opinion, well ahead of the 1996 presidential election," Nilsson  says. "Zhirinovskiy's political platform is not monolithic  either, but consists of various groupings with conflicting  interests.    ``If things should go badly in Russia, which cannot be  excluded, of course, there is still an opportunity to let the  Visegrad nations (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary)  into NATO. The alliance has not closed any doors for the East  Europeans; on the contrary, it has opened up a way in.''    From a Swedish perspective the new proposal for entry into  the Western alliance, Partnership for Peace (PFP), is a wise  decision. If NATO right now had already welcomed membership for  just the Visegrad nations, the Swedish thinking goes, it could  have been misinterpreted in Moscow and led to risks for the  Baltic states. It would have drawn a new line in Europe and not  favored the Swedish security interests.  <H5>  Not Underestimate </H5>   "We must not underestimate the importance of PFP," Lars-Ake  Nilsson maintains. "This is one step in order to take care of  the need for greater security that the Visegrad states have. It  will also develop a network of contacts with the Russian  military and with the officer hierarchy from the Warsaw Pact,  which has only been reformed to a limited extent."    An initial Swedish PFP agreement will be ready within one or  a few months, according to the under secretary. He says that it  is a strong Swedish wish that Russia will join the PFP, which  President Yeltsin has been said to favor.  <H5>  Great Confusion </H5>   The Baltic states occupy a special position in the  government's Eastern policy, even if Ukraine's exposed position  is an increasingly disturbing factor. Prime Minister Carl  Bildt's statement that Sweden cannot be a spectator in the event  of an attack on any of the Baltic states must be regarded as  official policy. Pierre Schori, the Social Democrats' foreign  policy spokesman, also a potential foreign minister if the  government changes this fall, calls the prime minister's  position "a peculiar solo trip, which has caused a great deal of  confusion about the Baltic policy."  <H5>  Never Indifferent </H5>   In a so-called policy speech about the Swedish foreign  policy, Bildt has said, referring to, among other things, the  Swedish attitude during Finland's Winter War, that "I find it  difficult to see neutrality as a likely choice for Sweden in the  conflict cases in our immediate vicinity that we can imagine  today" and that "we can never stand indifferent before the  forces that would try to overturn Russia's democracy or seek to  undermine or crush the independence of the Baltic states."    "I have had a major argument with Bildt about the Baltic  policy in the Foreign Relations Committee," Schori reveals.    He also says that he believes the entire Swedish Eastern  policy to be in disarray. He refers primarily to the use of, or  failure to use, the foreign aid that could help the East  Europeans restructure their countries.    Other than that, his wordings are very close to those of the  government side. Pierre Schori regards the PFP (which he prefers  to abbreviate PFF) as the embryo for all security order in the  entire Europe. And he, just as Lars-Ake Nilsson, says that it is  actually more important for the East Europeans to join the EU  [European Union] than NATO.  <H5>  Softens the Impression </H5>   When the PFP was created, Schori seemed to think that Sweden  could not join unless Russia did. He now softens that impression  by saying that Sweden should not enter a new security  organization that excludes the United States and/or Russia. He  also does not believe that the PFP will "survive" if Russia does  not join.    Pierre Schori does not criticize just the Western powers but  also the Swedish Government for not having spoken up  sufficiently clearly about the Russian interest-sphere thinking.  He talks about "a Russian Monroe policy," which he equates with  U.S. interventions in Panama and Grenada.    "My point," Schori says, "is that superpower politics still  prevail, even in the era of postcommunism."    This is why there is all the more reason for Sweden to stand  up for the international law.</p>

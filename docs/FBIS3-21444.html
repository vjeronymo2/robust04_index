			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi--Efforts towards Communist unity have  begun again after three decades of separation between CPI  [Communist Party of India] and CPI(M) [Communist Party of  India-Marxist]. Both parties have set up co-ordination  committees in most states as a first step to their merger.  Merger as such is still not mentioned in so many words but that  is what leaders of both parties have in mind as their ultimate  aim.    The call for unity has been given this time round in an  unusual way. So far unity calls were erratic and disjointed.  Polemics now and then punctuated them and unity moves went two  steps backward soon after going one step forward. In a  significant departure from old grooves of hostility, general  secretaries of both parties, Harkishan Singh Surjeet CPI(M) and  Indrajit Gupta (CPI) have now shared one letter pad to send out  a circular on unity. This is intended to inspire a sense of  urgency among their comrades.    Their circular of December 11 asks party leaders in all  states to form co-ordination committees to discuss "various  issues confronting the body politic" and for "strengthening the  left." West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura have been left out on the  ground that "left democratic consolidation has come into  existence and is working alright." The circular points out  central level co-ordination has been taking place for many  years. States which have "difficulties" have been asked to seek  central parties' help.    West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura are states where communist  parties are strong. The process of merger can instantly throw up  questions of share in leadership. Party sources admit that  several people who hold big or small positions in their  respective parties will have to be ready for sacrifice when  merger takes place. That can at once unsettle matters rather  than solve them.    Other minuscule left parties, RSP [Revolutionary Socialist  Party] and Forward Bloc, also may be affected. Communist leaders  feel that those partners of the left democratic front can be  irked if a CPI-CPI(M) club is constituted within that front. If  bilateral relations between the two communist parties are  emphasised even while harping on the left democratic theme, left  unity may suffer, communist leaders say. Which is why they have  decided to make haste slowly in those states.    Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra set up co-ordination committees  soon after the decision on unity taken at the last three-yearly  conclaves of both parties was communicated to state units there.  But that is not where unity has to be forged. CPI leader A.B.  Bardhan says that unity as a prelude to merger can be possible  and meaningful only when it is achieved in areas where either  party has a significant base. But his own partymen are dragging  their feet in Bihar, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh where they are a  shade stronger than their "big brother." If CPI is not keen to  have unity where it feels it is better off, why should CPI(M) be  magnanimous in its strongholds?    The present unity move has come soon after the assembly  elections in December. The poll outcome was not exactly pleasant  to communist leaders, notwithstanding the debacle of their bete  noire, BJP. Their ally, National Front, had come a cropper. Not  only have they to find a new, viable ally but reunite themselves  in a stroke of left consolidation.    The old hostilities and imagined ideological differences,  they feel, can be left happily behind. The irony is that the  unity move has come when dissensions are rife, particularly in  CPI(M) in areas where it is strong. And, leaders of both parties  have found a new cause for quarrel. CPI(M) has not a whit liked  CPI's soft corner for expelled K.R. Gowri. Its anger is all over  a single CPI remark: "Gowri's expulsion was unfortunate."</p>

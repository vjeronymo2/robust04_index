			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COACHES FIRED IN STARTER GUN THREAT  </P> <P> A school board has fired two high football school coaches accused of holding a  starter's pistol to a student's head and threatening to hang him from the  ceiling by his hands unless he improved his grades enough to play football next  year.  </P> <P> Trustees of the New Waverly school district voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night to  dismiss football coach and athletic director Larry Spacek, 34, and assistant  coach Steve Ramsey, 37.  </P> <P> The coaches had been suspended after Thea Clark, the mother of 14-year-old  Joshua Maxey, complained they took her son into the coaches' office Nov. 27  ostensibly to encourage him to bring up failing grades so he could play  football next year.  </P> <P> Maxey testified that Spacek tried to tie his hands with an extension cord and  threatened to hang him from the ceiling and that Ramsey then went to his truck  to get a starter's pistol.  </P> <P> Ramsey held him in a hammerlock and pointed the pistol at his temple, but  Spacek told him not to fire the gun, the boy said.  </P> <P> In a 3 1/2-hour board hearing requested by the coaches, Spacek and Ramsey  denied they had ever threatened Maxey with a cord or pistol, as the boy and  five witnesses had said.  </P> <P> Superintendent Alvin Davis, who recommended the firings, said the two coaches  never denied the allegations when he questioned them the day of and the day  after the incident.  </P> <P> Huntsville lawyers Hal Ridley and Robert DeLong, who represent Spacek and  Ramsey, said they will file lawsuits alleging their clients were wrongfully  dismissed. Spacek had just completed his second year of coaching the Bulldogs;  Ramsey was in his first year.  </P> <P> The Walker County sheriff's office is investigating the incident.  </P></p>

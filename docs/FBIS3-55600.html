In the Pavlovskis words, the program should provide clearer  conditions and terms for the entrance of the states, signatories  to the program, into the NATO.    Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup, who visited Riga  earlier this week, already pledged Pavlovskis to do everything  he could to amend the program, Pavlovskis said.    "My personal opinion is that Lithuania's application for the  NATO membership was premature," Pavlovskis said. It prompted  Russia to air its (negative) stance on the acceptance of the  Central European countries to this organization with a pretext  that the move could undermine the European security, the  minister said.    Pavlovskis prognosticated that Western politicians would  heed  to Russia's anxiety in fear of the destabilization of the  situation in Russia itself.    Subsequently, the Western leaders may refuse to amend the  Partnership for Peace, said Pavlovskis. He also said he hoped  his prognosis would not come true.    The East European security problems could be tackled much  easier if "Europe guaranteed our security." Then, Eastern Europe  could focus its efforts on the development of economy and  democracy. Besides, the entrance to the NATO is very costly  because the member states need good armament and equipment.    It would also be more advantageous for the NATO to grant the  East European countries some security guarantees than to enroll  new members. The motion would even benefit Russia by  stabilizing the situation in its neighboring states.</p>

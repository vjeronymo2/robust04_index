			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK tin mine seeks cash The new owners of South Crofty, the UK's last operating tin mine, are seeking between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m from investors to increase output from just over 2,000 tonnes this year to 2,900 tonnes by the year 2000. The mine has been starved of cash because of the depressed tin price, according to Mr David Williamson, whose consultancy is arranging the financing. 'Both the shaft system and the mine concentrator are capable of handling up to 40 per cent more throughput if underground development can be accelerated,' he suggests. In August South Crofty raised about Pounds 1.3m from 1,700 investors after the UK government and RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, said they would agree to waive loans totalling Pounds 30m if the company could raise a minimum of Pounds 1m to keep itself going.</p>

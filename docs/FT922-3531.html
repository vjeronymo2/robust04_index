			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Criticisms of Cadbury report emerge CONCERNS about the recommendations of the Cadbury Committee's report on corporate governance emerged yesterday in a survey published at a conference sponsored by the Confederation of British Industry. The report was widely hailed by the government and industry when it was published last month. The heart of it was a voluntary code of practice for company directors, accountants and auditors. Managements would have to defer more decisions to non-executive directors and give shareholders more information. Yesterday's conference in London heard that a survey of fund managers and auditors by Burson-Marsteller, the public-relations company, found that a majority of both groups felt the recommendations did not go far enough. Most of the 22 leading fund managers and auditors interviewed felt that the committee had been unwilling to produce a report that upset corporate directors. One fund manager was quoted as saying: 'There are some things they were not able to come out about as they would have liked.' In particular, most shareholders doubted whether the voluntary nature of the code would be effective. The survey found that the question of enforcement was the most troubling to all respondents and the one that most divided them. One fund manager was quoted as saying that while a voluntary approach should be the initial one, 'if it becomes clear there isn't compliance, then there should be legislation'. The proposed means of enforcing compliance with the code is that to qualify for a new Stock Exchange listing, companies will have to disclose the extent to which they comply with the code, and where they do not, explain why. Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, Stock Exchange chairman and a member of the Cadbury Committee, speaking at the conference, defended that as an effective enforcement mechanism. He said shareholders would be encouraged to take managements to task for poor board structures, forcing companies to comply. The survey found some institutional shareholder scepticism about that approach. One shareholder said: 'There is no way of effective enforcement other than delisting at the Stock Exchange. That would be like using a nuclear weapon - in other words, it will never be used.' Institutions are concerned that companies may not comply fully or accurately with the new disclosure requirement and doubt whether the exchange would be willing to put its full force behind enforcement, according to the survey. Shareholders also said they wanted the committee's recommendations to include that a company's lead bank be represented on its board in a non-executive capacity. They also wanted recommendations that directors be vetted prior to appointment, that there be still greater clarification of the duties and responsibilities of directors, and that directors' service contracts be no longer than three to six months. Directors ousted for poor performance often leave with large redundancy payments stemming from the company's obligation to pay them for the term of their service contract. Company law allows directors to be appointed for up to five years - longer if shareholders agree. The Cadbury Committee urges that that be cut to three years - a period still too long for most fund managers. The survey quotes one fund manager as complaining that three years is too long because 'there have been so many deadbeats kicked out of British industry and taking huge cash handouts because of the service contracts and it is one of the worst aspects of the way that companies are run'.

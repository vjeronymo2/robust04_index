			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Building and Civil-Engineering </F> Contractors. Fewer Large Enterprises, More Small Ones--first  paragraph is NEPSZABADSAG introduction]    [Text] The Hungarian construction industry underwent a  significant transformation in recent years. Several of the large  enterprises that earlier had dominated the construction industry  went bankrupt; others have been reorganized and are continuing  to function. From 1992 to 1993, the number of organizations  employing over 300 persons dropped by nearly one-fourth, while  the number of firms employing fewer than 20 workers increased by  one-third.    According to the data of the Ministry of Industry and Trade  (IKM), in December of last year there were more than 64,500  contractors in the construction industry. That includes  incorporated construction organizations as well as sole  proprietors. Since the 1980's, the construction market has been  shrinking continually. Therefore it is not surprising that  nearly 90 percent of the businesses employ fewer than 10 persons  each. At the same time, the number of firms employing fewer than  20 workers and organized as business associations is continuing  to rise. The total number of employees was 135,600 in 1993, 4.2  percent less than the year before. Once the Bankruptcy Law came  into force, many of the large construction-industry enterprises  of years past petitioned to be declared bankrupt. But most of  these large enterprises, which usually held substantial assets  but were burdened with huge debt, had already transferred their  capacities to business associations that had split off from  them. Therefore the liquidation of the enterprises' stripped  headquarters became inevitable. At the same time, several former  state enterprises are continuing to function as corporations,  after drastically trimming their personnel and selling off  assets. The survival of firms employing more than 300 persons is  typical mostly of construction industry's civil-engineering  branch. Such organizations account for more than half of the  existing capacity within the branch. The IKM reports that there  were 113 such firms in Hungary in 1992, and 91 in 1993. In the  building industry, the proportions of the organizations within  the individual size-categories are about equal. In the  specialized building trades and in building maintenance,  however, small firms are the dominant.    The participation of foreign capital increased further in  recent years. At the end of 1992, there were about 700 joint  ventures among the incorporated organizations. Their combined  total registered capital was 24 billion forints, of which 16.3  billion forints was held by foreigners. At the same time, nearly  230 joint ventures were formed last year. Their capital stock  was 3.3 billion forints, of which 1.8 billion belonged to  foreigners. On average, foreigners hold 55 percent of the equity  in the newly formed joint ventures, while the proportion of  foreign direct investment is close to 20 percent.    In 1993, the firms within the construction industry produced  241.5 billion forints' worth of construction and installation  work. At current prices, this output was 13 percent more than  the year before. In the first quarter [of 1993]--because of pro  forma invoices due to changes in VAT refunds, and as a result of  the Accounting Law's coming into effect--output was 9 percent  lower than in the same period of the preceding year. This lag  was reduced to 1 percent by the end of the second quarter.  Thereafter there was a 20-percent rise in output by the end of  September, followed by a 4-percent decline. The price level of  construction work rose by 13.2 percent in 1993, which was  somewhat less than the rise in 1992. The price level's rise was  slightly below average in the building industry, and in  civil-engineering industry it was 1 percentage point above the  average.</p>

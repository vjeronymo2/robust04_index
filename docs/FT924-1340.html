			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Low take-up for HunterPrint rights issue HunterPrint's investors have given the troubled specialist printer's Pounds 20m rights issue an unenthusiastic reception. The company had offered investors one share for every 10 held at a placing price of 50p to raise a net Pounds 18.3m. However, the board said yesterday that at the close of the offer, applications had been received for only 8.87m shares, representing 22.18 per cent of the shares on offer. Out of the placing proceeds, Pounds 15.6m in cash will be used to pay lessors of printing equipment, which along with the Pounds 5.2m convertible preferences would eliminate HunterPrint's Pounds 36m lease obligations. The lessors also agreed to take up to Pounds 3.9m of the placing shares.</p>

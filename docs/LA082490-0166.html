			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GM OFFERS RAISE, FORD A BONUS  </P> <P> General Motors Corp. has offered its hourly workers 2% raises, while Ford Motor  Co. has proposed a lump-sum bonus in their first contract proposals made to the  United Auto Workers.  </P> <P> Neither car maker has demanded any reductions in benefits or asked employees to  share expenses for health insurance, sources close to the negotiations said  today.  </P> <P> That in itself encouraged UAW negotiators, who have been bargaining since  mid-July for new three-year labor pacts with GM, Ford and Chrysler for about  500,000 U.S. auto workers.  </P> <P> "There were no serious takeaways, which gave rise to optimism," one UAW source  at Ford told the Detroit News.  </P> <P> Both car makers and the union declined to officially reveal specifics of the  offers made Thursday while they are under review by the UAW. But sources said  the contract offer by Ford included a lump-sum payment in the first year  instead of a base wage increase.  </P></p>

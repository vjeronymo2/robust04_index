			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Dali Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: We </F> Urge United Nations To Move Yemeni Crisis to Chapter VII"]    [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali  (southerner), head of the Yemeni Socialist Party External  Relations Department, has urged the United Nations to move the  crisis from Chapter VI to Chapter VII of the Security Council  Charter in order to stop the genocide operation planned by  Sanaa. In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT al-Dali stressed  that Sanaa has -- thus far -- not complied with the cease-fire  resolution. Despite its promises to UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi  and its talk about accepting the formation of a cease-fire  committee, yesterday morning it shelled residential areas of  Aden to terrorize the inhabitants.    He said that Sanaa is fully aware that it -- and it is the  one escalating the fighting, thus inviting the the Security  Council to impose the toughest of sanctions -- is not entitled  to accuse the Arab states or Aden of exposing the region to the  threats of a large-scale war, as Aden has until this moment been  calling for peace and for halting the fighting.    On the results of his visit to the United States, he  stressed  Washington's and the United Nations' interest in a stable  situation in Yemen, in the implementation of Resolution 924, and  in giving the parties the opportunity to comply with it.</p>

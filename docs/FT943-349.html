			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Stet profits up 30% as state sell-off set for next summer Stet, Italy's state-controlled telecommunications holding company, pushed up profits by 30 per cent in the first half of 1994, as the process of modernising the sector for further privatisation continued. But the Italian government made clear yesterday that investors would have to wait at least until the middle of next year before they have the opportunity to buy further shares in the group, 65 per cent of which is still owned by IRI, the Italian state holding company. In the first half, Stet's profit before tax reached L2,695bn, (Dollars 1.73bn) taking account of the inclusion of Iritel, the vehicle for local long distance telecoms operations which was transferred to the group from direct government ownership in January. Removing Iritel from the results, Stet's pre-tax profit rose to L2,325bn, an increase of 30 per cent compared with the L1,788bn profit reported in the first six months of 1993. The company also forecast yesterday that consolidated sales would increase to L34,000bn for the full year, and that the net profit for the group would be well above the 1993 profit of L3,284bn before tax. The Italian government yesterday said further privatisation of Stet would begin next summer. Stet and its subsidiary Telecom Italia, Italy's telecoms operating company, are already two of the largest stocks quoted on the Milan stock exchange and investors had hoped the sell-off would start at the beginning of 1995, or even by the end of this year. Stet yesterday declined to comment on the government's announcement. Stet owns 60 per cent of Telecom Italia, newly formed from a merger between state telecoms interests. But Stet's holdings also include software, multimedia and equipment manufacturing operations, and international joint ventures. The group has managed to cut net debt in the first half from L22,085bn at the end of 1993, to L20,754bn at June 30, and expects the figure to drop below L20,000bn by the end of the year. Meanwhile, investment has continued with L4,100bn spent in the first half, and Stet said it expected to invest some L11,500bn during the year, funded internally, against L9,708bn spent in 1993.</p>

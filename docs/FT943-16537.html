			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: CBS/QVC CBS, the leading US broadcaster, could clearly do with a bit of sizzle. And Mr Barry Diller, chairman of cable television shopping channel QVC, could probably provide that. So the idea of putting the two groups together has appeal. But the question rival media groups and their investment bankers will have probably spent much of the weekend asking is whether there is anything unique in Mr Diller's wizardry. The answer is probably no. What CBS lacks is experience in marketing its programmes and powerful brand name outside its traditional broadcasting market. While QVC has those skills, so do other cable TV and entertainment groups such as Walt Disney and Mr Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System. Their philosophy, like Mr Diller's, is to make programmes and sell them in as many different formats, packages and geographical markets as possible. A battle for CBS on the lines of the Dollars 10bn battle for Paramount, which Mr Diller lost, is therefore a distinct possibility. Much will depend on legal and regulatory issues. Would CBS be required to consider a rival bidder since the deal has been structured as a merger not a takeover? How easy would it be for rival bidders to get regulatory clearance given the complex restrictions on cross-media ownership? CBS is such a prize that it seems hard to believe such barriers will prove insuperable. Moreover, if rival bidders are prepared to pay handsomely, Mr Laurence Tisch, the 71-year-old CBS chairman, who also owns 20 per cent of its stock, may not even want to deter them.</p>

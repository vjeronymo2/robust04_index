			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDO STANDOUT HOLDS FAMILY'S GOLDEN DREAM  </P> <P> Tony Okada is almost as shy as he is talented, so he doesn't waste words  bragging about what he does best. That is why many people, even some of his  wrestling teammates at Savanna High School, don't know that he is one of  America's brightest hopes to make the 1992 Olympic team -- in judo.  </P> <P> It is no accident that Okada, 16, is one of America's elite judo athletes and  an outstanding high school wrestler.  </P> <P> His great-grandfather first learned judo in his native Japan, the country where  the sport originated. His grandfather competed in judo, but when he immigrated  to Lomita, Calif., the family also began learning judo's American equivalent,  wrestling.  </P> <P> Okada's family tree reads like a Who's Who of judo and wrestling. His uncle,  George Espinoza, wrestled at Arizona State and won a gold medal in the 1977 Pan  American Games. Another uncle, Kenny Okada, was a member of the 1972 U.S.  Olympic judo team that competed in Munich, West Germany. And Okada has two  cousins who wrestle at Bolsa Grande High School.  </P> <P> "I've been at a few family get-togethers and it is very rare that things don't  erupt into the coffee table being moved and people sprawled about on the floor  doing things," said Tom Caspari, Okada's wrestling coach at Savanna.  </P> <P> Okada acknowledges that his father has had a profound influence on his judo  skills.  </P> <P> "I know (my father) would want me to be the first from the United States to win  the Olympics in judo," Okada said.  </P> <P> It was the dream of his father, Ted Okada, to become an Olympian in judo. He is  a former high school national champion and senior national champion. In 1964,  he was one of the youngest black belts in the nation at 15. But a knee injury  playing high school football ended his competitive career.  </P> <P> Tony has inherited the dream.  </P> <P> Ted, one of the premier judo coaches for juniors (18 and under) in the United  States, is the instructor at Orange County Buddhist Church judo club. He has  trained Tony since he was 5.  </P> <P> "It is what he tells me he wants," Ted said. "He knows it will sadden me (if he  quits) but he also knows he must do it for himself, not because I want him to  do it."  </P> <P> Steve Scott, head of U.S. junior development for United States Judo  Incorporated, recognized as the sport's governing body by the U.S. Olympic  Committee, said he doesn't believe Ted Okada lives through his son.  </P> <P> "While Ted is a strict father, and makes sure Tony gets to judo practice, I  don't think he lives through the kid," Scott said. "It takes a pretty secure  man to say, 'My son is unique. He is his own person, and I have these goals for  him, but I also know it is not me doing it, it is him.' He is really proud of  his kid and rightly so. He is not a judo parent, not a Little League parent.  Those kids usually drop out by the time they are out of high school and they  are always rebelling. And I don't see that in Tony."  </P> <P> When Tony was 11, he said he almost quit because "my uncles and dad and  grandparents were telling me to do different things. I really didn't want to  listen to anyone but my dad. Everyone's yelling at me to do one thing and  another (person) is yelling the opposite."  </P> <P> He was starting to dislike judo, when his dad intervened.  </P> <P> "He talked to me and said (I should) act like I was listening to them but do  what I think is best because once I get good enough, I will know my own  mistakes," Tony said.  </P> <P> Tony has been making all the right moves, so much so that the Olympic selection  committee has had its eye on him for the past two years.  </P> <P> He is like a football player in that he likes the contact, said Scott.  </P> <P> "In any fighting sport, be it judo, boxing or wrestling, you have to like to  fight," Scott said. "I am not talking about in the bully-boy sense. . . . You  can tell Tony enjoys the combat, the competition."  </P> <P> "He really, truly is a young sensation," said Patrick Burris, one of the U.S.  Olympic judo coaches. "It is uncanny someone that young could have the  instincts he has already for the sport. His reactions are amazing. His balance  is unparalleled in this sport at this time. He is very strong for a young man.  And the way he moves -- the way he flows his knowledge of the sport is like an  experienced veteran because he has fought in so many national and international  tournaments as a young man, and quite honestly because of his uncles and  father."  </P> <P> Tony, who has a black belt in judo, competes in 25 to 30 judo tournaments  annually with the financial help of his family and USJI.  </P> <P> "We want to develop him as much as we can," Scott said. "We want to send him  places and do things with him and spend some money on him to get this kid some  opportunities he wouldn't otherwise have."  </P> <P> Those opportunities have included travel across the United States and beyond.  </P> <P> He visited Tokyo in 1987 to train with Japan's top coaches and with Yasuhiro  Yamashita, 1984 gold-medalist, nine-time All-Japan champion and a national  hero.  </P> <P> Last year he traveled to Colorado Springs, Colo., for the U.S. Invitational  Open tournament, an international competition featuring top seniors (21 and  older) from 12 countries. Okada placed fifth and lost a close decision to 1984  Olympic bronze medalist Ed Liddie.  </P> <P> He won the National Junior Olympics in Marquette, Mich., in 1988 and a silver  medal at the junior Pan-American Games in Mexico City in 1987.  </P> <P> Last month he traveled to Bremen, West Germany, where he won a gold medal  competing against the top high school youths from Western Europe.  </P> <P> But at Savanna, Tony is just another kid who likes surfing, dirt biking and  wrestling. And though he certainly wouldn't boast about it, he is Orange  County's top-rated wrestler at 126 pounds with a 35-4 record and victories in  four of the five tournaments he has entered this season. He finished sixth in  the Southern Section 3-A last season as a freshman.  </P> <P> Savanna wrestling Coach Caspari believes Okada has the potential to be a  wrestling state champion. But he understands Okada's Olympic pursuits have  priority right now.  </P> <P> He is trying to make the Olympic team at 19 when the average age is 25 or 26,  Caspari said.  </P> <P> "As a 16-year-old, he is placing in (senior tournaments) and winning  international tournaments. So actually in judo, he is a man right now. He is  not a boy. In wrestling, he is a boy, and he is doing very well."  </P> <P> After the Olympics, Tony plans to concentrate on collegiate wrestling. But for  now, he plans to enter more senior tournaments so he can accrue enough  recognition and points to be among the field of about 64 invited to the Olympic  trials. From there, tournament competition will determine the final eight  athletes to represent America in judo.  </P> <P> Tony makes it clear that he doesn't plan just to attend the Olympics, but  return a champion. "I think he is not only one of the great young athletes but  a great young person," Olympic Coach Burris said. "In his attitude, his  disposition, his manners, he is every bit the champion his parents could want  him to be."  </P></p>

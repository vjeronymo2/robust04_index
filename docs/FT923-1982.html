			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Gilts may glister - Fixed Interest INVESTORS could be allowed a hollow laugh at the phrase 'fixed interest' after the events of the past week. But the attractions of an unchanging interest rate are understandable. The basis of most fixed interest products in the UK is the conventional UK government bond (gilt). These can be invested in directly, via forms at your Post Office, or through a gilts unit trust, which will charge more but brings the benefits of professional fund management. Gilts pay a fixed rate based on their original price of 100p, but the return to investors depends on the trading price. A gilt originally yielding 5 per cent will yield 10 per cent for someone who buys it for 50p. Gilt prices were affected by two issues this week: the prospects of base rate cuts, and of higher inflation. The former boosted the prices of short dated gilts, while the latter depressed long dated prices. Simon Briscoe, of Midland Montagu, says: 'Looking at a horizon of two or three years, I think the 9 per cent yields on offer at the moment will look very attractive.' Actuaries managing guaranteed income bonds have in many cases withdrawn from offering any rate, and are awaiting the result of the French referendum. According to Baronworth Investment Services, the best rates available have slipped slightly, but 8.53 per cent is still available over one year (from Prosperity Life), while Laurentian Life is offering 8.95 per cent over five years. These figures are net only of basic rate tax - top-rate taxpayers must pay more. Some building societies also offer fixed rates - for example, the Coventry is offering 10.6 per cent gross fixed until January 31 1994 for investments of more than Pounds 20,000.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOCTOR'S ACCOUNTS OF DEATH DIFFERED  </P> <P> A Glendale physician accused in a murder-for-insurance conspiracy gave  authorities conflicting accounts of how a man came to die last year in his  office, a death prosecutors now say was a well-planned murder, a Los Angeles  Municipal Court judge was told Friday.  </P> <P> The doctor, Richard Pryde Boggs, 56, is accused, along with two Ohio  businessmen, of killing the man, passing him off as one of the businessmen and  then collecting $1.5 million on the businessman's life insurance policies.  </P> <P> The businessman whose death was allegedly faked, Melvin Eugene Hanson, 48, was  arrested earlier this year -- with a fresh face lift, varying pieces of  personal identification and $14,000 in cash.  </P> <P> Killed was Ellis H. Greene, a 31-year-old San Fernando Valley accountant found  with papers on him that identified him as Hanson.  </P> <P> On April 16, 1988, Boggs summoned Glendale officials to his office, where they  found Greene's body. Boggs told fire and police officials separately that the  man was Hanson, and he died of a heart attack while in Boggs' office.  </P> <P> According to Glendale Police Detective Jerry Jones, Boggs said Hanson was  driven to the office by another person. But Glendale Fire Capt. Stuart Jones  testified that Boggs said he had personally driven to the man's home in  Hollywood and brought him back to his office.  </P></p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / US drops key Rio objection: Declaration enshrines good environmental practice THE US smoothed the way to the climax of the Earth Summit last night by removing its objections to one of the pivotal documents under negotiation - the Rio Declaration of environmental principles. The shift came only 24 hours before President George Bush is due to arrive in Rio de Janeiro to face what is likely to be a hostile reception from environmental activists. In Washington, White House officials, while confirming their backing for the declaration, said that the US was still seeking 'improvements in the language of a section or two' of the declaration. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, promised an 'aggressive' speech from President Bush before his departure from Washington, setting out 'the hard truths about environmental protection that we believe should be pointed out'. In Rio, Mr William Reilly, the administrator of the US Environment Protection Agency and leader of the US delegation, said that US concerns about parts of the declaration had been 'accommodated' by other summit participants. That would not involve changing any of the language, which is the result of hundreds of hours of painstaking negotiation. Although the declaration is not a document which participants will sign, the summit's achievements would have been significantly weakened if the US had remained on record with its objections. The principles take the form of a Ten Commandments of good environmental practice, though they also address other issues such as poverty, women's rights, and sovereign control of natural resources. The US had taken particular exception to a reference to the 'right to development', which it said could mean putting economic growth above human rights. Mr Reilly also said that Mr Bush will personally sign the treaty on climate change, one of the two legally binding documents agreed. The US still refuses to sign the other treaty, on biological diversity. 'Things have moved well here today,' he said. 'We expect most issues to be wrapped up tomorrow.' World leaders gather today for two days of summit talks and formal ceremonies before the 12-day conference reaches its climax with a 'round table' of world leaders on Saturday evening. Activists complain that many agreements have been so watered down as to have little meaning. Negotiations were still continuing last night on forest conservation and environmental aid for Third World countries. Editorial Comment, Page 20</p>

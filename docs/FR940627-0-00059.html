For purposes of this rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocations and benefit accruals under a plan include all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits provided under the plan, including ancillary benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Plan-year-by-plan-year requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this paragraph (b), the limit in effect for the current plan year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies only to the compensation for that year that is taken into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account in determining plan allocations or benefit accruals for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the year. The compensation for any prior plan year taken into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account in determining an employee's allocations or benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accruals for the current plan year is subject to the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual compensation limit in effect for that prior year. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases in the annual compensation limit apply only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation taken into account for the plan year in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase is effective. In addition, if compensation for any plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year beginning prior to the OBRA '93 effective date is used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining allocations or benefit accruals in a plan year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective date, then the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual compensation limit for that prior year is the annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation limit in effect for the first plan year beginning on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or after the OBRA '93 effective date (generally $150,000).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application of limit to a plan year <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of applying this paragraph (b), the annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation limit is applied to the compensation for the plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year on which allocations or benefit accruals are based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compensation for the plan year. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If a plan determines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation used in determining allocations or benefit accruals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a plan year based on compensation for the plan year, then the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual compensation limit that applies to the compensation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the plan year is the limit in effect for the calendar year in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the plan year begins. Alternatively, if a plan determines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation used in determining allocations or benefit accruals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the plan year on the basis of compensation for a 12-consecutive-month period, or periods, ending no later than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last day of the plan year, then the annual compensation limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies to compensation for each of those periods based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual compensation limit in effect for the respective calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year in which each 12-month period begins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compensation for a period of less than 12-months <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(A)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proration required. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If compensation for a period of less than 12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months is used for a plan year, then the otherwise applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual compensation limit is reduced in the same proportion as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reduction in the 12-month period. For example, if a defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit plan provides that the accrual for each month in a plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year is separately determined based on the compensation for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month and the plan year accrual is the sum of the accruals for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all months, then the annual compensation limit for each month is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1/12th of the annual compensation limit for the plan year. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, if the period for determining compensation used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculating an employee's allocation or accrual for a plan year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a short plan year (i.e., shorter than 12 months), the annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of which is the number of months in the short plan year, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denominator of which is 12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> No proration required for participation for less than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full plan year. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, a plan is not treated as using compensation for less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 12 months for a plan year merely because the plan formula  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that the allocation or accrual for each employee is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on compensation for the portion of the plan year during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the employee is a participant in the plan. In addition, no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proration is required merely because an employee is covered under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a plan for less than a full plan year, provided that allocations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or benefit accruals are otherwise determined using compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a period of at least 12 months. Finally, notwithstanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, no proration is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required merely because the amount of elective contributions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (within the meaning of &sect;1.401(k)&hyph;1(g)(3)), matching contributions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (within the meaning of &sect;1.401(m)&hyph;1(f)(12)), or employee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributions (within the meaning of &sect;1.401(m)&hyph;1(f)(6)) that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributed for each pay period during a plan year is determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separately using compensation for that pay period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limits on multiple employer and multiemployer plans. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of this paragraph (b), in the case of a plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section 413(c) or 414(f) (a plan maintained by more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than one employer), the annual compensation limit applies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separately with respect to the compensation of an employee from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each employer maintaining the plan instead of applying to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee's total compensation from all employers maintaining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Family aggregation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [Reserved]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The following examples illustrate the rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this paragraph (b). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Plan X is a defined benefit plan with a calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year plan year and bases benefits on the average of an employee's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high 3 consecutive years' compensation. The OBRA '93 effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date for Plan X is January 1, 1994. Employee A's high 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consecutive years' compensation prior to the application of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual compensation limits is $160,000 (1994), $155,000 (1993),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and $135,000 (1992). To satisfy this paragraph (b), Plan X  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot base plan benefits for Employee A in 1994 on compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in excess of $145,000 (the average of $150,000 (A's 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation capped by the annual compensation limit), $150,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A's 1993 compensation capped by the $150,000 annual compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit applicable to all years before 1994), and $135,000 (A's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 compensation capped by the $150,000 annual compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit applicable to all years before 1994)). For purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the 1994 accrual, each year (1994, 1993, and 1992),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not the average of the 3 years, is subject to the 1994 annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation limit of $150,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Assume the same facts as Example 1, except that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employee A's high 3 consecutive years' compensation prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of the limits is $185,000 (1997), $175,000 (1996),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and $165,000 (1995). Assume that the annual compensation limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is first adjusted to $160,000 for plan years beginning on or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after January 1, 1997. Plan X cannot base plan benefits for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employee A in 1997 on compensation in excess of $153,333 (the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average of $160,000 (A's 1997 compensation capped by the 1997  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit), $150,000 (A's 1996 compensation capped by the 1996  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit), and $150,000 (A's 1995 compensation capped by the 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Example 3. Plan Y is a defined benefit plan that bases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits on an employee's high consecutive 36 months of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation ending within the plan year. Employee B's high 36  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months are the period September 1995 to August 1998, in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employee B earned $50,000 in each month. Assume that the annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation limit is first adjusted to $160,000 for plan years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning on or after January 1, 1997. The annual compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit is $150,000, $150,000, and $160,000 in 1995, 1996, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1997, respectively. To satisfy this paragraph (b), Plan Y cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base Employee B's plan benefits for the 1998 plan year on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation in excess of $153,333. This amount is determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying the applicable annual compensation limit to compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each of the three 12-consecutive-month periods. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1995 to August 1996 period is capped by the annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation limit of $150,000 for 1995; the September 1996 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 1997 period is capped by the annual compensation limit of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $150,000 for 1996; and the September 1997 to August 1998 period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is capped by the annual compensation limit of $160,000 for 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The average of these capped amounts is the annual compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit applicable in determining benefits for the 1998 year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 8 (CNS) -- The Vice Minister of  Chemical Industry, Mr. Cheng Siwei, speaking of plant diseases  and pests shortly before their peak, suggested today that  production of pesticide be given the same attention as grain  production and the "food basket" project, an item to achieve a  balance in demand and supply of non-staple food. The state  should adopt preferential policy to lend support to such an idea.    According to the national plant protection headquarters,  1994  would be a year of fairly serious plant diseases and pests. The  ministry is scheduled to produce 210,000 tonnes of pesticide of  176 varieties this year. As of late last April production of  pesticide was put at 75,900 tonnes. Mr. Cheng was convinced  that varieties and quantity of pesticide turned out could by and  large meet the need to prevent and control plant diseases and  pests.    From the viewpoint on a long term, Mr. Cheng, however, said  that the pesticide production industry should be further  exploited with implementation of a number of measures. [as  received]    First, pesticide produced at present should be further  improved because the current pesticide is not as effective as  some new varieties now being developed overseas. Germicide and  herbicide shared a rather small portion in pesticide production.    Second, the vice minister put forward a proposal that the  state should adopt some measures to support pesticide production  because pesticide was used only in farming, which was naturally  subject to the profit the farming sector was able to make. As  agricultural productivity was still rather low in China, the  pesticide production industry had shown poor economic results  and in fact it suffered a loss last year.    Third, Mr. Cheng also suggested that a reserve fund for  pesticide production be set up. New variety of pesticide should  be developed and establishment of two centres in southern and  northern China for exploitation of pesticide should be  accelerated.    The vice minister attributed the false and poor quality  pesticide which flooded the market during the busy season each  year to loose administration of pesticide production and of the  sales market. Peasants' lack of knowledge of false and inferior  pesticide added fuel to the spread of such phenomenon. He  called for strict law to curb false pesticide.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> POLICE DETECTIVE FACES THEFT CHARGES  </P> <P> A Buena Park police detective was charged Monday with one count of felony grand  theft in connection with the theft of $970 from a Garden Grove house he had  searched while on duty, authorities said.  </P> <P> John T. Mallos, 30, of Ontario, has been placed on paid administrative leave.  </P> <P> He has agreed to surrender at his arraignment hearing, scheduled for Friday in  West Orange Municipal Court in Westminster, Buena Park Police Chief Richard  Tefank said.  </P> <P> Tefank and district attorney's officials said Mallos had a warrant to search a  house owned by Dorothy Smith on July 22, 1989. Officials would not provide  details of the search beyond saying that several items were seized.  </P> <P> On Feb. 21, 1990, Smith complained to Buena Park police that Mallos had cashed  a $660 money order taken from her house. Another $310 in cash was also missing,  Tefank said.  </P> <P> Tefank said the department referred the report to the district attorney's  office, which routinely investigates complaints against police officers.  </P> <P> Tefank said the department will perform an administrative investigation to  determine the "level of additional action to be taken."  </P> <P> Neither Mallos, who has been with the department for four years, nor his  attorney was available for comment Monday.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna Crandall said that Mallos has denied stealing anything  but that she could not comment on details of the case.  </P> <P> "He served the search warrant and he cashed the postal money order," Crandall  said. "The fact that we filed charges speaks for itself."  </P> <P> If he is found guilty, Mallos could face a sentence of up to three years in  prison. DAVAN MAHARAJ  </P></p>

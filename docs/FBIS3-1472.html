			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has laid the  blame for today's killings squarely at the door of the SAP  [South African Police] and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  leadership. Addressing a news conference a short while ago NEC  [National Executive Committee] member Terror Lekota said the ANC  had warned the police yesterday about possible violence. He  said the police had undertaken to set up road blocks to disarm  the Zulus but had failed to do so.    [Begin Lekota recording] The ANC made every conceivable  effort to obtain adequate policing measures around its premises  from the earliest hours of today, in order to avert clashes and  to avoid any loss of life. What is puzzling is the complacent  attitude of the police who refused to cordon off streets or  divert armed demonstrators away from possible flash points. [end  recording]    Mr. Lekota said the 10 policemen who were deployed in front  of Shell House left their posts because of the threat to their  lives. Security measures were left in the hands of the ANC's  security personnel and according to Mr. Lekota they acted with  restraint and patience and only fired when their lives were  threatened.</p>

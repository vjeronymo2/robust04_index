			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Most swaps cases settled out of court MOST OF the legal actions singled out to act as lead cases between banks and UK local authorities over interest rate swap agreements have been settled out of court, it was announced yesterday. Barclays and Midland banks said they had each settled two claims from local authorities, although the sizes of the settlements were undisclosed. The High Court determined last July on six lead cases between banks and local authorities to save the courts from being inundated with claims relating to the transactions involving 80 banks, 130 councils and some Dollars 500m. The cases resulted from the House of Lords ruling early last year that local authorities were acting outside their powers when entering swap agreements. This left open to banks only the opportunity to take action for restitution, to recover sums paid out to authorities under the agreements. These payments are estimated to amount to only around 20 per cent of banks' total losses. Barclays said it had settled two restitution claims against Hammersmith and Fulham, which had been due to come to court in February. The bank, which had already written off Pounds 41m against local authority swap deals, said its claim against the authority had been for Pounds 656,000 plus interest, but refused to disclose the size of the settlement. Midland has settled two claims against Birmingham City Council. The cases had been due to start yesterday. The settlements are believed to be the first since last July, when the lead cases were decided on. Before that, several banks had reached settlements with local authorities. In two of the earlier settlements, Ogwr Borough Council in South Wales paid Citicorp Investment Bank more than Pounds 1m, and Hammersmith and Fulham settled with one of the banks involved. The swaps involved councils exchanging their interest obligations, normally from fixed to floating rate, in the expectation that rates would fall.</p>

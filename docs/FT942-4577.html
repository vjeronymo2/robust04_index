			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Political Notebook: Now electioneering is over it's back to serious politics Serious politics starts again on Monday. The die is now cast in the elections for the European parliament and the five vacant Westminster constituencies. The Conservatives will do very badly, but they hope not catastrophically. Labour will get on with the business of choosing (almost certainly) Mr Tony Blair as its leader. The Liberal Democrats will ponder again their role as a successful, but still sidelined, third party. Mr John Major has probably had as good a campaign as he could have hoped for. The tone of his pronouncements on Britain's place in Europe has not endeared him to enthusiasts on the centre-left of the party. But after a mid-campaign lurch into the arms of the Euro-sceptics he has moderated his rhetoric. By yesterday, the multi-speed Europe first conjured up by Mr Douglas Hurd was not, after all, an excuse to opt out of everything European. Mr Major, who avoided closing any options at the 1996 intergovernmental conference, was once again preaching Eurorealism rather than Europhobia. The lifting of the immediate threat to his leadership after the death of John Smith has left the prime minister looking less beleaguered, more relaxed. His decision some weeks ago - before the death of the Labour leader  -to fight any challenge seems to have lifted a burden. He mapped out his campaign role independently of Conservative Central Office, a sign perhaps that he is determined to be more his own man. But Mr Major is not secure. Even if the last-minute optimism proves justified, defeat at Eastleigh and the loss of perhaps half of his party's European seats will deepen still further Mr Kenneth Clarke's infamous hole. The economic recovery is well under way. The government is getting no thanks for it. The rightwing sceptics who now embrace the prime minister do so only in the hope of manipulating him. He has to win back the affection of the centre-left and discover the constancy which his administration has lacked. He has until the autumn to make a convincing start. The cabinet reshuffle will be critical. The prime minister wants if possible to wait until the start of the summer recess in the third week of July. But he has been thinking hard on the changes. It is the overall impression they leave that will count. Mr Major has to demonstrate both a sense of authority and of direction. The reshuffle must not be timid. He must then shape next year's legislative programme. Some controversial bills are unavoidable. But if Mr Major is wise he will reject the advice of cabinet colleagues advocating another burst of Thatcherite radicalism. This government needs to spend more time thinking things through. Labour's agenda for the next six weeks is clear. It must have a mature contest. There will be heated debate about the direction of its economic and social policies between Mr Blair's modernism and the traditionalism of Mr John Prescott and, perhaps, Mrs Margaret Beckett. The union barons will want their say. Full employment is a slogan which quickens the pulses of party activists. A commitment to a minimum wage is not the heinous crime some imagine, but it could become a symbol of Labour's inability to escape the past. Mr Blair is tougher than allowed for by unkind Bambi epithets. There is a streak of Mr Neil Kinnock's ruthlessness in the vision of a modern Labour party. But the campaign will set the parameters in which he will have to work over the next two years. They will be tighter than he would like. Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats can look forward to a few days in the sunshine. A victory at Eastleigh and the expected election of its first MEPs will follow large gains in the local elections. After some early slip-ups Mr Ashdown has had a good campaign. But the spotlight will switch quickly to the Labour leadership - and to the threat posed by Mr Blair to the Liberal Democrat hold on disenchanted voters in southern England. The defection yesterday of the Liberal Democrat candidate in Newham underlined the risk. The Liberal Democrat party is an essentially local one with representation at a national level. Mr Ashdown dislikes the House of Commons. But unless he and his colleagues make a bigger impact at Westminster there is no prospect of the general election breakthrough that has always eluded them. No-one is thinking in terms of a pre-election pact with Labour. But the Liberal Democrats must think hard about whether they can avoid any longer an implicit alliance to deprive the Conservatives of a fifth term. So with the resumption of serious politics there are real decisions to be made. The European elections will paint the backdrop for the second half of this parliament but the politicians still have a chance to rewrite the script.</p>

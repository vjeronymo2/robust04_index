			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: NatWest Securities changes earnings stance NATWEST SECURITIES has announced a change in the way it will be calculating companies' 'normalised' earnings as a result of the new format introduced by FRS 3, the new accounting standard on the profit and loss account. In a circular to clients, it says it has re-cast its previous formula and will exclude non-trading - or capital - items in its own figure. The details come as many analysts are pondering how best to interpret FRS 3, which all but abolishes extraordinary items and changes the structure of company accounts. The firm stresses that its forecast normalised earnings will therefore show the expected operating performance of a company in the light of its structure during the reporting period. NatWest's separate calculation for 'maintainable' earnings will include simply acquisitions, continuing business operations and exceptional recurring charges from a company's trading results. It says there will never be agreement on a standardised definition of earnings while too much is expected from a single figure. NatWest also says professional investors should welcome FRS 3 as a chance to re-examine the tools of their trade.</p>

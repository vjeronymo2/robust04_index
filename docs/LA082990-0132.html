			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITY, COUNTY CRITICIZED FOR HOMELESS SWEEPS  </P> <P> Social service advocates lashed out at city and county government Tuesday,  contending that neither has done enough to help the homeless, the target of  recent police sweeps at the Civic Center.  </P> <P> "The homeless are considered the new lepers of society," said Jean Forbath,  chairwoman of the county's Human Relations Commission. "We can't push these  people to one place and expect them to disappear. There is no island out there  where we can put them."  </P> <P> In a news conference Tuesday, Forbath and other advocates said local government  must provide more drug rehabilitation programs, develop single-room occupancy  hotels and financial assistance for the homeless.  </P> <P> Those who stay at the Civic Center have been homeless the longest, said Allison  Armstrong, chairwoman of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. Many of  them have drug addictions or are mentally ill but have no place to seek help,  Armstrong added.  </P> <P> "Solutions exist," she said. "It's not like we have to reinvent something here.  We need to be less patient with our leaders."  </P> <P> According to the Homeless Issues Task Force, there are 18 shelters in the  county with 600 shelter beds; 21 of them are detoxification beds for indigent  alcoholics. Orange County has an estimated 10,000 homeless people, almost half  of whom are children under the age of 18, the task force says.  </P> <P> Forbath said the recent Santa Ana police sweeps across the Civic Center grounds  will not make the homeless go away.  </P> <P> "We can chase the homeless from Costa Mesa, Laguna and Newport Beach, make them  uncomfortable in Anaheim and Orange and Garden Grove and banish them from Santa  Ana. But the question remains, where will they go?" Forbath said.  </P> <P> On Aug. 15, Santa Ana police cited 64 homeless people for minor violations such  as littering and urinating in public. The following week, police arrested 26 in  sweeps that Police Chief Paul M. Walters said were not aimed at harassing the  homeless but, rather, reducing crime.  </P> <P> Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said police were called to the  Civic Center Tuesday to break up a rock- and bottle-throwing incident. She said  30 to 40 homeless were involved. Eleven were arrested.  </P></p>

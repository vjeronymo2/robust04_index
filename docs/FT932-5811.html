			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Management: Restoring order from chaos - A dramatic reshaping at Reuters JOHN Parcell claims gleefully that he and Geoffrey Sanderson 'still know nothing about the theory of business process re-engineering'. Yet both are arch-practitioners of the genre: they are two-and-a-half years into a dramatic re-engineering exercise which has salvaged their company. In October 1990 they were appointed by top management at Reuters, the supplier of on-line information to financial services and media organisations, to rescue its core UK activities. To put no finer point on it, the boom of the 1980s, caused especially by financial deregulation, had landed the UK operation in chaos - to an extent which until now has not been realised beyond the company and its main customers. In Parcell's words: 'By the late 1980s it had acquired a reputation for poor service and arrogance. Many orders were handled wrongly, late or not at all. So customers got angry and often refused to pay their bills.' Since many of those bills were wrong and unrecognisable from the original quotations which the clients had received, this was not surprising. When Parcell and Sanderson were called in from Reuters' continental European operations to become managing director and deputy at the British company, they discovered that many customers in the City of London - by far Reuters' largest UK market - were having to wait between three and six months to receive new hardware and services. Even if no hardware was involved, it took a fortnight. From that point, it often took the company two months just to send the bill, and another three or more to collect payment. The cause of this mess was the slow and fragmented nature of the company's long-standing procedures for taking orders, issuing contracts, processing them, arranging and executing installation, invoicing clients and then taking payment. 'The processes which the staff were trying to operate were highly compartmentalised,' says Parcell. 'Even a simple order would go sequentially through up to 12 departments' - and five computer systems. In all, there were about 24 'hand-offs' between different specialists as an order was processed, even if no re-work was required to correct the many errors. Out in the field, some salesmen looked after several hundred customers at a time, and an engineer handled about 100. So a customer 'might be served by different people on different days of the week', says Nigel Vince, who led the team of Oasis consultants which helped Reuters with the detailed re-engineering work. To make matters worse, few salesmen and engineers knew each other, since they were located in different buildings and were rarely on the same job together. The various departments of administrators who processed the paperwork were also located separately. An irate client's telephone call was almost invariably answered by someone who knew nothing about the order in question, but had to pass the inquiry on from one department to another. So many inquiries were never answered. To anyone who had strayed into Reuters from a halfway modernised factory, even back in the mid-1980s, the whole arrangement would have seemed crazy. But, as Sanderson says, it is far easier to see, and re-design, all the different parts of the physical flow in a factory than it is to analyse all the inputs into a set of white-collar processes. The Parcell-Sanderson recovery programme involved five consecutive steps, aimed at starting to serve customers promptly, accurately and to their satisfaction: The organisation was broken into four geographic divisions capable of getting closer to customers. Each division was sub-divided into a series of small multifunctional 'account teams', consisting of 'account managers' (former salespeople), planning engineers, and 'business administrators'. The last group was a new breed of person who combined the roles of the previous sales, billing, technical and general administrators, but with much more direct customer contact than before. Each team, of between three and six people, was grouped round an array of desks and terminals. Each was given a small number of clients: between six and 50, depending on the size of customers. Except for the fact that the multi-functional teams have no designated leader and are permanent, unlike many 'project teams' in manufacturing industry, steps one and two are pretty conventional. For instance, each team member still reports to his or her functional boss at present. The really radical 're-engineering' came with the next step. What consultants call the entire 'customer order life-cycle' (order-through installation-to payment) was redesigned from scratch, in order to allow the new teams to operate it swiftly and smoothly 'from end-to-end', as Sanderson puts it. A series of the previous steps - for instance, order-taking and the issue of contracts - were condensed into one, or avoided entirely by the merging of administration tasks. Instead of every step being done sequentially by separate departments, several activities are now carried out in parallel by the team members. As a result, the number of hand-offs through which the process had to pass was reduced from two dozen to four. A series of timing and other performance criteria was also laid down, in most cases for the first time, so that customers and staff knew exactly what was expected. The training and change process for the 900 staff involved was 'quite draconian and dictatorial', says Parcell, rather than along the consultative and 'empowering' lines advocated in most re-engineering theory. Two years on, Parcell and Sanderson recognise that pressure is now building up among the teams for more latitude on various aspects of daily decision-making. Few changes have yet been made to people's incentives, except for the crucial one that sales staff now receive commission once orders are installed, rather than received. Starting in early 1992, the company's records have been straightened out - a slog of a process which will be complete in July. The reliable and flexible old computer system, which has operated the new order process reasonably well, is in the process of being replaced by a more up-to-date system designed specifically to suit the new process. Unlike the re-engineering so far, which has caused no job reductions - rather, the reverse - the new system will automate a number of clerical functions. The impact of the new, team-based process has been striking. More than 95 per cent of installations are now on time: between three and four weeks after ordering if hardware and services are both involved, and barely a day for services alone. Bills are now more than 98 per cent accurate and debt from recalcitrant customers is minimal. Independent market research studies show that, on almost every category of customer attitudes, dissatisfaction has been brought down to 10 per cent or less. The way most front-line employees feel about the change is encapsulated by one business administrator, Alan Maguire. The old atmosphere of all-round 'firefighting', and buck-passing between specialists, has been replaced by one of mutual help and 'covering' for each other, he says. 'It's astonishing how much has been achieved by co-locating us not just in the same building or on the same floor, but around the same desk.'

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Yeltsin tries to quieten the chorus of criticism President Boris Yeltsin's long-awaited address to the nation on the Chechnya crisis, confidently delivered yesterday afternoon, was a judicious mix of resolution to finish the job of disarming the 'bandit groups' who support Chechen leader Dzhokar Dudayev and protestations of respect for the peaceful people of Chechnya, for their religion (Islam) and the need to restore their economy. At its core was the same offer made a week ago: talks with leaders 'who understand that further military confrontation is senseless', and with only one item on the agenda - a ceasefire and the disarming of all illegal groups. However, the president dwelt at length on the reasons for the Russian military intervention. These, he said, were the three-year state of lawlessness in the breakaway republic, the illegality of a regime not recognised by the former laws of Chechnya, by federal laws or by other states, and the criminalisation of a regime which, he claimed, gained most of its revenue from arms and drugs trading, and from the diversion to its own use of federal funds meant to pay pensions and other expenses. In its care for Russian fears about a long and bloody war and for Chechen sensibilities, the speech reflects Mr Yeltsin's need to attempt to placate, or at least reduce, the anxieties and hostilities of a number of senior military officers and several of his aides and advisers who have opposed his policies in Chechnya. The most outspoken in the ranks of the military have been General Boris Gromov, a deputy defence minister, General Alexander Lebed, commander of the 14th Army in Trans Dnester, and - less explicitly but more powerfully - General Eduard Vorobyev, deputy commander of land forces who offered his resignation rather than lead the Chechen mission. On Monday, speaking to veterans of the Afghan war, General Gromov, the former Soviet army commander in Afghanistan, likened the Chechen affair to the Afghan debacle. He called it a 'woeful, badly thought-out move . . . which placed (the leaders') political ambitions and the lives of the people on the same level . . . The main thing I do not understand is for what reason our young and not-so-young people have to die', he said. General Gromov, together with two other deputy defence ministers - General Georgy Kondratyev and General Valery Mironov, the latter of whom was Gen Gromov's deputy in Afghanistan - may pay the price for their insubordination. Mr Sergei Yushenkov, the forthrightly anti-war chairman of the Duma defence committee, claimed on Monday that a decree had been prepared sacking all of them. He said that the ostensible reason would be a reorganisation of the defence ministry: the real reason, however, was their refusal to take part in the 'shameful Chechen war'. In a current affairs programme on Sunday night, Mr Emil Pain, a presidential adviser on ethnic problems, appealed to Mr Yeltsin to rethink his position and switch from military tactics to negotiation while there was still time. Mr Pain, according to the programme, was speaking on the part of a wider group of advisers, including Mr Gergy Satarov, Mr Leonid Smiryagin, Mr Mark Urnov and others. These men, of a liberal bent, have voiced veiled or explicit criticisms of the action over the past week at the risk of their own positions. For the moment, like the generals, they have not been sacked and may have seen their opposition rewarded in the softer content of the president's speech. However, the war will continue. If the Chechen rebellion is crushed, sackings and resignations appear inevitable. That, in turn, means that the remaining liberals around Mr Yeltsin will be joining the ranks of the opposition. More alarmingly, a number of generals, popular with their brother officers, will be relieved of duty but not necessarily of political ambition.</p>

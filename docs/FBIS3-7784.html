			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by D. Vujicic: "God -- The Only Controller"] </F>   [Text] One of the dailies published the news that "a close  encounter between General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Srpska  republic army, who was flying in his helicopter and two U.S.  F-16 fighters has recently taken place in the skies above the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina." According to this story, the U.S.  fighters descended to the height at which general's helicopter  was flying, waved to him with their wings and flew their own way.    The air force of the Srpska republic army is not familiar  with this event, however, in Bosnia -- a land of miracles,  anything is possible.    They say that on a clear night one can count more aircraft  and helicopters in the sky above the former Bosnia-Herzegovina  than there are stars. There is noone who has not been flying --  the command of Srpska republic army air force says -- especially  since "the no-fly" directive.    Since NATO aircraft began patrolling over this republic, the  North Atlantic air force has carried out more than 12,000  flights above Bosnia, of which more than 7,000 were combat  flights. As our source explains, NATO classifies as noncombat  flights those that carry humanitarian aid and transport  organization officials. The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR],  too, have carried out thousands of flights by airplanes and  helicopters, and the air force of the Republic of Croatia does  not pay much attention to the no-fly directive either.    The Croats have actually never stopped flying over the  former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in the latest Croatian Army and Croatian  Defense Council operations in central Bosnia they have been  using helicopters daily.    According to foreign sources, the Muslim army has 14 Hind  helicopters and four ultralight airplanes, which are also  carrying our combat flights.    Since they have been on this mission, NATO aircraft have not  downed a single aircraft of either side. Our sources claim that  the opportunity to do this presents itself some 10 to 20  occasions daily, which is how many Muslim and Croatian flights  Serbian radars register over Bosnia on average. To illustrate  this information, our source says that, for example, Serbian  radars the day before yesterday registered 117 flights over this  republic, 10 of which were carried out by the Croats and Muslims.    God alone controls and coordinates these flights above  Bosnia. NATO plans its routes and controls them from Vicenza  [Italy] by means of AWACS aircraft in the Adriatic Sea. The  Croats do this via Zagreb, and the Muslims most probably from  Zenica, even though they surrendered control of the skies to the  Croats in May 1992. UNPROFOR, although it cooperates with NATO,  also uses its own systems for navigation of aircraft, most  probably from Sarajevo. Must one should point out that there is  no coordination between them.    Finally, our source, who is otherwise a senior military  expert in the Serbian Republic Army, says that it is a real  miracle that there have been no crashes and major tragedies  above Bosnia so far. He warns that anything is possible in the  skies over Bosnia-Herzegovina, bearing in mind the absence of  flight controllers. Such aa situation could be used against the  Serbian side, which really flies only when it has to, that is,  when wounded need to be transported to hospitals.  <H5>  [Box p 5] </H5> <H5>  Blind Flights </H5>   What distinguishes the flights of the Croats, the Muslims,  and the Serbs over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina from NATO and  UNPROFOR flights is that "home boys" try to avoid using radio  during the flight in order to remain unnoticed. They are,  therefore, flying blind as the local pilots know the terrain  like their backyard.    According to military circles, NATO fighters have more or  less given up chasing these aircraft as pilots manage to mislead  them and land on time. On the other hand, there have been cases  of "remote control aircraft" being sent over mountain peaks to  taunt U.S. radars and aircraft.</p>

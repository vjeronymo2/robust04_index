			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Water groups link to stay afloat  -US suppliers are merging to offset rising costs A CONFLUENCE of market forces is pulling the fragmented US water supply industry towards greater consolidation. In particular, the growing interest of European companies in this largely untapped American market suggests a period of accelerated change is under way. Evidence of the trend surfaced last week when United Water Resources, a New Jersey-based group with 235,000 customers in two states, agreed to acquire GWC, with nearly 300,000 customers in 14 states. The Dollars 200m deal would create the second-largest investor-owned water supply group in the country, with estimated annual revenues of nearly Dollars 300m. The enlarged United may seem like small fry in an industry with billions of dollars in revenues a year. In fact, it is a leading force in what is a highly-decentralised business which had not seen a significant merger in 30 years. There are some 60,000 supply systems in the US. About 70 per cent are owned by local government authorities, while the remainder are in private hands. Most of the second category are small, independently-owned concerns serving a handful of communities in a narrow operating area. Large investor-owned groups have had a relatively minor presence, but have grown steadily in recent years as more independents have been swallowed up by the likes of United, GWC and American Water Works, the largest group in the sector, with 1992 revenues of nearly Dollars 660m. Over the past decade, American has, on average added about 12 independents and some 25,000 new customers a year. Last month it completed its biggest acquisition, picking up four middle-sized water systems in the mid-west from Avatar Holdings. The deal added 130,000 customers and Dollars 30m to American's annual revenues. 'Expansion has become a strategic necessity for investor-owned groups,' says Mr Ward Welsh, director of corporate communications for American. 'With the emphasis on conservation in recent years, water use and sales have been flat. Buying up smaller companies is one of the few ways to increase earnings.' While consolidation has been evident for several years, three recent developments appear to have quickened the pace. First, compliance with stringent new federal environmental standards is forcing many water systems to spend heavily on capital projects. Many are finding it impossible to finance the required improvements, mandated by the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. Government-owned water systems, as well as private ones, have been affected. Philadelphia Suburban, an investor-owned group with 245,000 customers, recently snapped up a public water system with operations within its service area after local officials were unable to pay for improvements required by the federal government. Second, water groups are realising the benefit of geographical diversification in a business where adverse weather conditions can cause earnings to fluctuate. American, with operations in 21 states, was able to offset losses in areas of the mid-west hit by flooding this summer with profits from systems in the east, where record high temperatures brought heavy demand for water. Third, foreign-owned companies are eager to expand in the US. However, the complexity of the US regulatory and rate-setting system, with its overlapping federal, state and local jurisdictions, makes such forays difficult. As a consequence, alliances with US companies more familiar with the domestic operating environment have become appealing. All three of these factors came into play in the decision by United and GWC to join forces. For United, which had operated just two big water systems in a contiguous area of northern New Jersey and southern New York, GWC offered systems of various sizes, in areas with expanding population bases, such as Florida and New Mexico. The addition of GWC's systems not only offered higher growth potential but would help United avoid weather-related swings in earnings. The link made sense for GWC as well. The Delaware-based group was facing high capital expenditures, projected by the company at Dollars 40m in each of the next five years. The spending in part was to pay for environmental improvements, such as sophisticated filtration systems. United offered strengths that would help GWC over the financing hurdle. The New Jersey-based group not only had a healthy balance sheet but also enjoyed a reputation for being a well-managed company, according to Mr Paul Gioia, who follows the industry for First Albany, a New York securities house. Mr Donald Correll, United's chairman, says the group also has expertise in bringing systems up to federal standards. He says United recently completed many of the same improvements that GWC was just beginning to address. Finally, the deal had a foreign dimension because 82 per cent of GWC was owned by Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez, the French group with controlling interests in several UK water companies. Lyonnaise, which bought its GWC stake about 10 years ago, would own 26 per cent of the newly-merged group. Even though Lyonnaise was required to surrender control, Mr Patrick Babin, its deputy chief financial officer, says the agreement was 'a signal of persisting interest in the US market', rather than a desire to withdraw from it. He says the group decided it would achieve the critical mass necessary to grow faster if it took on a partner. 'It is not a question of aggressiveness,' says Mr Babin, 'but a question of having the proper resources, both financial and technical (in order to expand).' One field in which foreign companies have shown great interest is waste-water treatment. Anglian Water of the UK, for one, recently formed a joint venture with American to operate privatised waste-water systems in the US. Its first contract is with the city of Indianapolis. The venture, called American Anglian Environmental Technologies, shares much of the logic that led GWC and its French parent to United. The European partner, Anglian, offers special resources (proprietary treatment processes, in the UK group's case), while the US partner, American, has an insider's knowledge of the industry. Enlightened self-interest has pulled them together.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US INVESTOR-OWNED WATER COMPANIES (1992)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                      Revenues     Customers    Operating                            (Dollars m)        (000)      states  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- American Water Works          657.4          1,700          21 United Water Resources*       281.6            534          14 California Water              139.8            360           1 Aquarion                      103.7            120           1 Southern California Water     100.6            236           1 Philadelphia Suburban          93.3            245           1 Consumers Water                89.6            226           6 E-Town Corp                    89.2            184           1 SJW (San Jose Water)           89.1            204           1 IWC Resources                  63.4            219           1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Combined revenues and customers of VWR and GWC Corp, which have agreed to merge  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Edward D.

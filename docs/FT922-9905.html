			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Amnesty accuses Israelis ISRAELI officials have participated in the interrogation and torture of prisoners at Khiam jail in southern Lebanon, according to a report by the human rights group Amnesty International. The report, based mainly on interviews with former detainees held at Khiam between 1985 and 1991, says most of the approximately 200 men and women imprisoned without charge or trial there have been tortured to get information. Victims said they were beaten and given electric shocks. Khiam prison is run by the Israeli-financed South Lebanon Army militia. While claiming that it has no responsibility for the prison, Israel has said repeatedly that it was ready to 'use its influence' to free all of the remaining Khiam prisoners and some 36 Lebanese held inside Israel in exchange for four Israeli servicemen still missing in Lebanon.</p>

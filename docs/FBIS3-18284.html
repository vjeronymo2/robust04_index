			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Emily von Sydow: "EU's Offer Angered Haavisto, </F> Salolainen"]    [Text] Brussels -- Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto used  harsh words in Brussels at Monday's [7 February] negotiating  round: The EU [European Union] has dawdled over submitting its  positions on agriculture and regional issues, and once they  finally come they are a major disappointment.    EU's foreign ministers finally agreed on a joint position on  the candidate nations in the following areas: Agriculture and  regional policy. It is nothing but a framework program, which  does not contain any details. The map must be drawn during the  next few weeks. The position expresses understanding in  principle for the special problems that prevail in the Nordic  regions, it recognizes the need for treating the northern  farmers in a way similar to their colleagues in the EU, and it  envisions the need for long-range, decreasing national support  for the farmers who are affected by the price cuts.    "Public opinion in Finland is still very positive to  membership, but it is not known how it will be affected by the  most recent offer," the minister said threateningly.  <H5>  The Farmers Need 12 Billion </H5>   The EU's demand for immediate price adjustment is a  catastrophe for Finnish agriculture, says the former chairman of  MTK [Agricultural Producers' Association]. Since Finnish  agricultural prices are twice as high as in the EU, it would  result in a budget expenditure of 12 billion markkas to  compensate the farmers for their losses, Haavisto explained.    "It also would not benefit the consumers, who would only to  a  limited extent get lower prices on food. The food prices are  simply dependent on the value-added tax [VAT] system," Haavisto  further said.    The EU's position that the farmers in southern Finland  should  only get one-third of the subsidy was also something completely  unacceptable:    "We reminded them that we are net contributors to the EU,"  Haavisto said.  <H5>  Three Weeks' Time </H5>   On the part of the EU commission one has said that in the  final round everything will be dealt with as a single package:  Budget, structural funds, and agricultural subsidies, but that  is not acceptable to Finland, which says that the agricultural  questions are too essential and must be solved separately.    Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen states that EU's  negotiators must now get clear directives to reduce the gap  between the negotiating positions.    "We have three weeks to do it. We can manage it if the  political will is there. It is not enough to have technical  will," he said.    The EU was given Finland's positions on structural and  regional policy in June and on agricultural policy in September.  Not until now, however, did one sit down and negotiate on a  political level. Haavisto and Salolainen repeatedly brought up  this discrepancy in time.  <H5>  We Are Only Demanding the Same Conditions </H5>   "We are demanding nothing more than that the EU's rules are  applied in a correct manner in Finland. We only demand that our  farmers should be treated the same way as EU farmers."    Finland also explained in its seven-page-long speech at the  negotiating table that Finland will follow the common  agricultural policy to the full extent once the country is a  member of the EU, that is to say reduce production and area.    The Finnish Government's frequent trips around the capitals  of Europe in order to explain the difficult situation in the  sparsely populated Nordic provinces and of the farmers seem to  have fallen on deaf ears, judging by the EU's not very  sympathetic attitude toward the Nordic regions, said one  journalist:    "Not until three weeks from now (when the deadline for the  negotiations expires) will we see whether the trips have been  successful," replied Pertti Salolainen.    The Norwegians were more positive than Finland's negotiators  to the same offer. The Norwegian delegation stated that it has  received an "opening toward transitional periods" for price  reductions.    The Swedish negotiators also thought the day had been  useful,  although no results had been achieved in substance.    Sweden is pushing very hard for Objective 1 status, that is  to say the one given to the very poorest regions in the EU, for  its northernmost regions (Norrbotten). Finland as well is  pushing hard to have its regions recognized as Objective 1. The  major difference between Objective 1 and Objective 2, and 5b,  respectively, is that within the framework for Objective 1 it is  possible to provide money for the infrastructure. Further, the  Objective 1 funds permit the EU to contribute 75 percent of the  investments. Objective 1 funds represent three-fourths of the  funding in the total structural fund.</p>

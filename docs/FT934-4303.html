			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Coal subsidence pay-outs at risk, surveyors warn Householders could receive insufficient compensation if they suffer mining subsidence following the privatisation of the coal industry, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors said yesterday. Measures for dealing with subsidence in the Coal Privatisation Bill, published on Thursday, are unclear, the institute said. 'We are not confident that the Pounds 35m to Pounds 40m a year estimate for subsidence in the bill will prove sufficient.' The institute said its measures gave householders little protection if a private operator should become insolvent or deny responsibility for damage. Instead of having one clearly responsible statutory authority, British Coal, householders would have to deal with the new coal authority and possibly one or more private operators, the institute said. British Coal announced separately that it aims to reach agreement as soon as possible with Edwards Energy on the resumption of mining at Trentham in Staffordshire. This takes to three the number of closed pits where British Coal has indicated mining can be resumed by private operators. Edwards is also in negotiations for Coventry colliery and British Coal has agreed in principle to lease Clipston colliery in the Yorkshire region to RJB Mining. Meanwhile British Coal yesterday ceased production at three pits, Bentley and Hatfield in the Yorkshire region, and Silverdale in Staffordshire, as part of its closures programme. Miners at Littleton in Staffordshire have agreed to stop production next Friday. By Christmas, British Coal will have only 22 pits left in production. In a further development, the coal industry's two pension funds reinforced British Coal's concerns about the government's plans for pensions after privatisation. Concerns centre on the extent of the trade secretary's powers over the trustees and the omission from the bill of government guarantees for post-privatisation benefit improvements above the inflation rate. Although the government has promised that benefits will rise in line with the retail prices index, the trustees are concerned about the allocations of future surpluses and a clause in the bill giving the trade secretary powers of 'national interest'. Mrs Rhoslyn Roberts, secretary of the staff scheme, said that the government's proposals did 'not yet meet the objectives of the trustees'.</p>

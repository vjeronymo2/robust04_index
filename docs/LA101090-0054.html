			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGH WINDS LED TO DROWNING OF 2 MEN  </P> <P> Waves caused by high winds are being blamed for the deaths of two men who  drowned Sunday in Castaic Lake when their fishing boat was swamped, authorities  said.  </P> <P> "It was a freak accident," said Mike Hargett, park superintendent at Castaic  Lake.  </P> <P> "We had 1-1 1/2 foot swells caused by winds blowing 15-25 m.p.h. . . . If it  was not windy, it's very unlikely they would have taken a wave over the bow."  </P> <P> Leo Lenore, 50, and William Bunch, 17, both of Pasadena, disappeared in an area  of the lake estimated to be 175 to 225 feet deep, said Lt. Jeff Springs of the  Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The bodies have not been found.  </P> <P> The victims and two other men had been fishing for at least four hours Sunday  when a strong wave hit their boat about 4:20 p.m.  </P> <P> "It appears that they went bow first into a wave and it came over the boat  filling it with water and causing all on board to fall overboard," Hargett  said.  </P> <P> The accident was witnessed by a guard at the lake's lifeguard headquarters who  notified a rescue boat by radio. The boat arrived in three to five minutes but  the two victims could not be found, Hargett said. Lifeguards rescued Ronnie  Williams, 27, of Altadena and Derrick Potts, 31, of Duarte, who had also been  on the boat.  </P> <P> "They were fully conscious when we pulled them out," Hargett said. "Both of  them were holding on to the side of the swamped boat." The two survivors did  not require hospitalization.  </P> <P> Hargett said the men were not wearing flotation vests. "State law does not  require anyone to wear them," he said.  </P></p>

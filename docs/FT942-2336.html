			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: In banks' interests not to offer dual role to accountants Sir, I read Mr John Jackson's letter with great interest. As a specialist fund manager in the very smallest capitalisation UK companies, I have personal experience of the pressure which banks can exert on company managements. I would be interested to hear why a firm of reporting accountants should not automatically be disqualified from acting as administrator or receiver.

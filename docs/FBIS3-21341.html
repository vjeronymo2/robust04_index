			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Jamshidi, the international economy </F> deputy minister of industries, on Thursday, 3 Feb 1994, by IRNA;  place not given]    [Text] Sari, [IRNA] -- The international economy  deputy minister of industries said: In the nine months of this  year, $460 million in various goods have been exported.    Dr. Jamshidi said on Thursday in an interview with an IRNA  reporter: Industrial goods in the area of exports have two  advantages, the relative low cost of energy and especially low  wages.    He added: In some industries, including tiles, our country  has the ability to compete with foreign countries. At the  present time, Iranian tiles are exported to Kuwait and the  Persian Gulf sheikdoms. Also, contracts have been signed to  export them to Central Asian countries.    He said: Subsidies for export goods are meaningless; goods  must be produced to be competitive with similar foreign goods.    Dr. Jamshidi said: After the foreign currency rate became a  floating rate in an attempt to prevent the entry of foreign  goods, tariffs and commercial taxes were increased. At the  present time, however, on the whole they are still not  sufficient.</p>

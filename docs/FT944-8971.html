			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / BSkyB tells of damage by pirates British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, has spelled out for the first time its estimated losses from pirate card devices. In less than five months between the start of this year and May 18 when all BSkyB cards were changed at a cost of millions of pounds, the company believes it lost around 50,000 existing and potential new customers through pirate devices. A BSkyB affidavit submitted to the High Court earlier this month estimated that total losses to the company during the period was an estimated Pounds 2.25m. The satellite company was successful in its request for an injunction to stop BSB Electronics selling devices known as Genesis, which it is claimed can switch on deactivated 'smart cards' thereby defrauding BSkyB of revenue. The heart of the business of BSkyB, which intends to float in London and New York, is subscription television. The channels are scrambled so that only those who pay can watch. The evidence in the BSkyB affidavit would appear to conflict with its pathfinder prospectus published on Monday. That document, which says that the flotation will value BSkyB, at between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.6bn, sets out how the company has a policy of refining and updating its scrambling technology. The prospectus then says: 'Although there have been instances of piracy, the directors believe there has been no material loss of revenue over the past fiscal year as a consequence.' The affidavit says that in the period before the new cards were introduced, subscribers were cancelling their current subscriptions and reactivating switched-off cards through BSB Electronics and their agents. 'For the first time in the history of BSkyB it was experiencing a situation where cancellations were outnumbering term-inations,' the document says. Termination happens when BSkyB switches off subscriptions for non-payment. BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, holds a 17.5 per cent stake, said it had been advised that a loss should only be considered material if was 5 per cent instead of the 0.5 per cent loss over the period. BSkyB has a total of 3.65m subscribers and subscription revenue in the year to September of Pounds 455m.</p>

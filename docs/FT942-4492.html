			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hambros climbs to Pounds 90.5m Hambros, the merchant bank and financial services group, yesterday announced a 44 percent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 90.5m for the year ended March 31, 1994, aided by a sharp drop in loan loss provisions and improvement in the retail financial services division. Hambros also raised its dividend for the year by seven percent to 15p. However, the earnings were on the lower end of analysts estimates for the year and Hambros shares closed 8p lower while shares in other UK merchant banks generally rose. Hambros also releaved hidden reserves of Pounds 41m, in line with analysts estimates, and said it is restating its 1993 balance sheet to eliminate unrealised investment gains on equity shares in line with recent changes to accounting practice. The effect of this change eliminates Pounds 19m which had appeared as an asset on the balance sheet as of March 1993. Pre-tax profits from banking activities, at Pounds 76.2m, were only marginally above the Pounds 73.8m for 1993. At mid-year, Hambros reported banking profits of Pounds 40.3m. Full year banking results include a a drop in dealing income to Pounds 44.6m from Pounds 52.6m. Analysts attending a company briefing said Hambros had experienced a Pounds 6m loss in bond trading activities in the last quarter of its fiscal year which contributed to the drop. The drop in net interest income to Pounds 62.8m from Pounds 75.5m was almost exclusively attributable to the lower interest rate environment prevailing which cut the returns available on Hambros' free capital. However, bad and doubtful debt provisions were sharply reduced for the year to Pounds 9.4m from Pounds 21.9m in 1993, which aided banking profits. Also, the bank was aided by a rise in fee and commission income to Pounds 284.8m from Pounds 230m last year. In other sectors, retail financial services benefitted from the recovery in Hambro CountryWide. Overall, the sector contributed Pounds 3.4m to profits after causing a Pounds 10.7m loss in 1993. Hambros said it has set aside an undisclosed reserve to cover possible liabilities from pension transfer business written by its Hambro Guardian Assurance operation but noted that the full extent of any liability still cannot be determined. Direct investments showed a sharp increase in profitability to Pounds 19.6m from Pounds 8.5m in 1993, mostly from realisations of direct investments. In general, Treasury and Capital Markets produced satisfactory profits up to January 31, 1994, although lower than last year. However, in the last two months of the group's year the markets became highly volatile, particularly in bond trading where the sharp rises in long-term interest rates, both in London and New York, reduced profitability. The group's direct investment business, which has always been an important part of its activities, had a most active year. Hambro Countrywide's return to profit in 1993 represented an improvement over 1992 of more than Pounds 14m, and showed how quickly the group was able to capitalise on the recovery of the housing market in the earlier part of the year.</p>

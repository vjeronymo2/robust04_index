			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations, with a few changes to respond to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, are adopted as final regulations. The changes, as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as certain comments and suggestions that were not adopted in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations, are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations provide that the value of a loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporation under the special valuation rule of section 382(l)(6)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Code is the lesser of the value of its stock immediately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the ownership change, or the value of its assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (determined without regard to liabilities) immediately before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ownership change. The proposed regulations further provide that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the value of the loss corporation's pre-change assets is reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the amount of any capital contribution to which section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 382(l)(1) applies. The proposed regulations could be read to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require such a reduction even in cases in which the value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-change assets would not reflect the value of the contributed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets, as would be the case, for example, when the contribution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is concurrent with the ownership change. To avoid this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility, the final regulations provide that the value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-change assets of the loss corporation is determined without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard to any capital contribution to which section 382(l)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 382(l)(5)(H) of the Code allows a loss corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to elect not to have the provisions of section 382(l)(5) apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations provide that this election must be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the due date (including extensions) of the loss corporation's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return for the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations also provide that this election is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> irrevocable. One commenter suggested that the final regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow a taxpayer to file an election after the prescribed due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date upon a showing of reasonable cause. The commenter also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that taxpayers be allowed to revoke an election.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Treasury and the Service believe that the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and procedures under &sect;301.9100&hyph;1 of the Procedure and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative Regulations provide adequate relief for taxpayers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeking to make a retroactive election under section 382(l)(5)(H)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Code for an ownership change occurring on or after March 17, 1994. A specific regulatory provision allowing an election after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescribed due date or allowing revocation of an election would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriately allow the loss corporation the benefit of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hindsight to determine the relative advantages of sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 382(l)(5) and 382(l)(6). Therefore, the final regulations retain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rules of the proposed regulations that the election is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> irrevocable and must be made on the return of the loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporation for the taxable year including or ending with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change date. Because of uncertainties that existed with respect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the application of sections 382(l)(5) and 382(l)(6) before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuance of final regulations, transitional rules are provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;1.382&hyph;9(d)(6)(ii) and (p)(2) that allow taxpayers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retroactively file or revoke a prior section 382(l)(5)(H)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election for an ownership change occurring before March 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter suggested that the final regulations clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a loss corporation need not use liquidation value in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the value of its gross assets, and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporation may take into account the value of any intangible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets, such as goodwill and going concern value. The Treasury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the Service have determined that the proposed clarification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is unnecessary. The valuation rule refers to ``the value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loss corporation's pre-change assets,'' without limitation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either liquidation value or tangible assets. Therefore, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loss corporation is able to establish the existence and value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any intangible assets, that value may be taken into account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations provide that the amount received by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a loss corporation for the issuance of debt is treated as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital contribution that must be excluded from the value of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-change assets if the issuance of the debt is part of a plan a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal purpose of which is to increase the value of the loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporation under the rules of the proposed regulations. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter questioned the appropriateness of treating an issuance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of debt as a capital contribution. The commenter also suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, if the proposed rule is retained, it should be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an exception for cases in which the loss corporation uses the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeds of the debt to fund operating expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations retain the rule of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations regarding the treatment of certain debt issuances as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital contributions. The Treasury and the Service believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule effectuates the principles of section 382(l)(1) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Code. The Treasury and the Service will consider possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions to this rule in the context of providing general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance under section 382(l)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

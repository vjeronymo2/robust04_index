"Bosnian infantry units are expanding and advancing their  trench system in Zuc and Mojmilo," two regions that overlook the  capital, Aikman said. "They're improving their defense  positions. It's a violation of the ceasefire."    The ceasefire went into effect last Thursday and was  prompted  by a mortar attack on a Sarajevo market that left 68 people dead  and 197 injured.    The attack also prompted the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation to issue an ultimatum giving Bosnian Serbs  besieging Sarajevo until February 21 to surrender their heavy  weapons or face air strikes. The Bosnian army also must abide by  the ultimatum.    The weapons handover, which began Friday, has been  proceeding  at a snail's pace with each side handing in only a few pieces of  artillery.    Aikman said the Serbs surrendered two mortars Sunday  evening,  bringing to 28 the total number of mortars and heavy artillery  they have handed in since Friday. The weapons are under UN  custody.    The Bosnian army, for its part, has so far handed in 10  mortars, Aikman said.</p>

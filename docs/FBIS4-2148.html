			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Review and Prospects" column article by staff reporter Fei </F> Weiwei (6316 0251 0251): "Offshore Oil: From 100,000 Tonnes to  4.6 Million Tonnes"]    [Text] China had just begun its oil industry when the  Daqing oilfield ranked among the world's 10 million-tonne oil  fields in 1967. On 14 June, crude oil spurt from Bohai Offshore  Well Number One, China's first offshore-oil exploration well.  The State Council sent a special cable of congratulations.    Ten years elapsed. On the eve of China's reform and opening  up, offshore oil still only came from one simple offshore well  whose annual output was no more than 100,000 tonnes.    "The spring wind has come overnight and pear trees blossom  everywhere." In 1980, China signed contracts with Japanese and  French oil companies on cooperation in the offshore oil  industry. Since then, China has opened the doors to the outside  world on cooperation in the offshore oil industry. From Bohai  Bay to Beibu Bay, China's extensive waters have entered a new  period of attracting foreign capital and advanced equipment and  technology from around the world and of large-scale prospecting  and exploitation.    Another 10 years elapsed. As of the end of last year, the  China National Offshore Oil Corporation had signed 74 contracts  and agreements with 55 oil companies from 13 countries and  attracted foreign capital totalling $3.8 billion. The story of  Offshore Well Number One has been integrated with roaring  machines in the offshore oil cities. At present, 10 offshore  oil and gas fields have been erected and 10 others are being  erected. In fact, hardly anywhere in the world are so many  offshore oil and gas fields exploited on such an extensive a  scale. Last year, China's offshore oil output already reached  4.6 million tonnes.    Percussion drills, the most primitive of drills, plus the  steel frame resting on two 500-tonne salvage floats, the most  primitive of drilling vessels, were a primitive form used in  China's offshore oil industry for many years. Today, the  equipment and technology of the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation are so impressive that none of the oil companies  around the world dare to look down on them. From prospecting to  exploitation to production, various pieces of equipment are  complete and match one another, and there are 90 big and small  vessels, most of which reach the world's advanced levels,  including a 200,000-odd-tonne floating production and storage  vessel. Technologically, China has developed from sending a few  technical personnel abroad as employees of foreign companies to  completely relying on its itself to design, establish, and  manage offshore oil and gas fields.    China's offshore oil industry has stood lofty amidst reform  and opening up. Before reform and opening up, a work force of  30,000 could produce no more than 100,000 tonnes of crude oil a  year. Today, a work force of 30,000 can produce 46 times as  much. "In 1997 when our annual output of crude oil reaches 12  million tonnes and our natural gas 4 billion cubic meters, our  work force will not exceed 30,000." Looking ahead, Wang Yanman,  general manager of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation,  said with full confidence: "We are stepping into the ranks of  the world's advanced oil companies."</p>

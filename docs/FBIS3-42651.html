COLD SPOT    Protection of the lives and rights of citizens--whether they  are Ingush or Ossetians--is the meaning and purpose of the  Provisional Administration's existence. That is the reason the  state of emergency was imposed in the zone of conflict. The  Russian Federation law on the state of emergency envisages a  special form of rule on the territory where it is in effect.  Compliance with the law, by the way, would have made all  arguments regarding the introduction of federal rule in  Prigorodnyy Rayon completely superfluous--it had already been  envisaged by the law on the state of emergency but for the  president's decree of 4 November 1991. In keeping with this  decree, which amended the previous one issued a day before, a  Provisional Administration essentially was deprived of  administrative rights on the territory of North Ossetia, that  is, in the zone of conflict. Old and new laws of the North  Ossetian SSR remained in effect there and new countless decrees  were adopted that were at sharp odds with a stabilization of the  situation; all executive authority--formally subordinated to the  Provisional Administration but in essence openly ignoring  it--remained in place. The Ossetian militia, OMON [Special  Designation Militia Detachments], and republican guard continued  to operate in Prigorodnyy Rayon villages.    Given the circumstances, the Provisional Administration, in  order to protect the lives of the same Ingush, had to order the  troops subordinate to it not to let them back into the territory  of Prigorodnyy Rayon. An absurd situation developed: Russian  troops and representatives of the federal authorities, even in  the rank of deputy prime minister, found themselves in the role  of executors of the shameful decree of the North Ossetian  parliament!    Any Ossetian--be he an honest man or a marauder--has a right  to visit Prigorodnyy Rayon villages without asking anybody's  permission. There is now nothing to loot from the burned Ingush  homes--there had been more than 3,000 of them there, so now they  are stripping them of radiators and toilets and taking bricks  out of the walls. An Ingush cannot approach his former home  unless he puts his name on a list a week in advance; then he  will be checked out somewhere, vetted; he will be put on a bus  and, escorted by an APC [armored personnel vehicle] with  soldiers, he will embark on a dangerous journey--there have been  instances when entire busloads were taken hostage, buses pelted  by stones, passengers pulled out and beaten. What kind of  protection can five young frightened escorts provide against 30  hardened commandos?    In these circumstances, the very existence of the  Provisional  Administration becomes meaningless. The first law of an  administrative system: The less the expected result, the greater  the number of bureaucrats that will vie for the job. For this  reason the Provisional Administration staff is growing  continuously: It looks as if now there is a plan to increase it  by another 600 persons. Cozy Vladikavkaz, where most of the  Moscow functionaries on detached assignment are quartered,  should be considered a warm rather than hot spot. The Ossetian  authorities assiduously keep an eye on them and reward the  zealous. One would consider it a joke--who would believe in such  an open bribe--had it not been for the testimony of an Ossetian  newspaper: "Over seven and a half months of 1993, on the orders  of the North Ossetian SSR MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs],  268 servicemen in regular military and operational-investigative  groups received bonuses totaling 6.52 million rubles."    The investigative groups are a special topic. Hundreds of  killed and missing (there are still more than 300 persons  officially listed as such in Ingushetia); unburied corpses of  relatives barely covered with dirt; teenagers with wild eyes;  fathers of former families dying in strangers' beds--the very  smoke of the Nazran hearths has the persistent aftertaste of  suffering and crime. And how many convictions have we seen? But  this is not the point right now. Life goes on; it requires  settling in and orderliness. The republic may have been created  "on paper," but its citizens are living people and they present  the Provisional Administration with conventional everyday  problems, which it does not resolve. Why?    For the second year Ingushetia is essentially living under a  blockade. Rail cargo with humanitarian aid and acutely needed  items travels as far as Beslan station (North Ossetia); neither  the Provisional Administration nor the troops subordinate to it  can ensure the further movement of the cargo, to Ingushetia  (there are only six kilometers to the next--Ingush--station of  Dalakovo). Because of this one six-kilometer segment on the  territory of North Ossetia, cargo has to be routed circuitously  through Astrakhan. How many soldiers does one need to escort  cargo from Beslan station to Ingushetia? In the name of what  then do we keep such a huge and costly army contingent here?    The state has allocated billions for resettlement of  refugees. This money does not go to displaced Ingush, and the  authorities even explain why. First, the money is not being  invested in reconstruction; second, the money is designated not  for Ingush refugees but for "finding a comprehensive solution to  the refugee problem" (this is the way it is worded in those  certain Kislovodsk agreements). And one must admit that this is  a correct answer. The Ingush cannot invest money in  reconstruction because they are not permitted to get to their  ruined homes, not to mention making construction materials  available and the mechanism of arranging all of this.    This can only be explained by the fact that the head of the  Provisional Administration, no matter what his personal  qualities may be, is limited in his actions and can do very  little. Perhaps it is for this reason that administration heads  here are rotated rather quickly. There have been seven of them  in one year. And almost all, like General Filatov in his time,  followed the "text" written for them by Galazov.    How many hopes were pinned on Shakhray, and in fact he did  everything in the beginning to make himself different from his  predecessor G. Khizha. In Vladikavkaz he lived on the territory  of an army military school, wore the uniform of a Russian  paratroop officer, ate in the soldiers mess; in Nazran, where  there was no hotel, a written-off passenger train was put on a  spare truck to house the visiting officials; Shakhray occupied  one economy-class compartment.    Unlike Khizha, who, as is known, never crossed the border of  Ingushetia, three days after his arrival, on 17 November,  Shakhray spoke at the square in Nazran. He did not promise quick  prosperity to anyone, but did guarantee on behalf of the  Provisional Administration the return of the Ingush to the  locales of their old compact habitation in Prigorodnyy Rayon.  This will be difficult to accomplish, however, he warned, as  long as illegitimate units on the territory of North Ossetia are  not disarmed.    Two weeks later, however, he spoke just as convincingly at a  briefing in Vladikavkaz: "These are existing units. By the  decision of the North Ossetian government, which is supported by  the Provisional Administration, careful registration of  armaments, fighting vehicles, and personnel of these units is  being conducted."    "This is not a contradiction--this is dialectics," Shakhray  told journalists. Yes, obviously he did not learn dialectics  from Hegel. While still in Vladikavkaz, he began to look  differently at Ingush refugees as well: "We will deal with the  refugee problem in a comprehensive manner--after all, this  category includes Ingush, Ossetians, and Russians leaving  Ingushetia and Chechnya." As if during the five-day war the  people squeezed out of Prigorodnyy Rayon amidst bloodshed were  not Ingush but citizens of Georgia or Uzbekistan. As to  Cossacks--or, to be precise, Russians (Russians in the North  Caucasus, much as in other republics, are a separate problem),  they are presented as an unending stream of refugees into North  Ossetia, although according to the data of North Ossetia's own  migration service, 473 Russians arrived in the republic, and  there is no report as to how many left. For those still there, a  Potemkin village is being built near Vladikavkaz.    S. Shakhray's second invention after the "comprehensive  solution" was the notation in the labor service record of  deported Ingush: "Let go by mutual agreement of the parties."  The mocking meaning of this notation is obvious, although  perhaps the author saw it as a compromise.    Is it perhaps the air in Vladikavkaz that has such a  powerful  influence on Russian governor-generals? Among the next five  teams there were no more volunteers to follow Shakhray's example  and eat in the soldiers mess or sleep on a hard bench in a  railcar in Nazran. By the spring, investigators from the  combined group of the Russian Federation procuracy, MB [Ministry  of Security], and MVD, who stayed longer than the others, had  left the Ingush capital. And by the summer there was no longer  any need for the hotel on wheels--the train literally left the  station. And with it the last hopes of deported people that the  Provisional Administration will take care of them.    Already in Moscow, in interview to IZVESTIYA (10 January)  Shakhray put forward a far-reaching thought: "Our state has been  weakened, and in a weak state the primacy of formal law cannot  be maintained." Well, then, of course...    In Vladikavkaz (not in Nazran!) Shakhray confided to his  listeners that he himself is a Terek Cossack from nearby parts.  In the course of the election campaign he visited Cossack parts  hunting for votes and promised that the south of Russia would  become a special border region of the country and the Cossacks  (as it was in the last century--I.D.) would have an occupation  there. In return he received the rank of colonel and a Cossack  outfit. Well, he had already worn paratroop fatigues; now is  just the right time to put on a Cossack masquerade suit. One can  only hope that Sergey Mikhaylovich will be tactful enough not to  pin on a couple of St. George's crosses for settling the  Ossetian-Ingush conflict.    But how did it indeed happen that the "winners" grabbed so  much power, thereby creating a problem that transcends even the  boundaries of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict? They refuse to  recognize Russian laws on the territory of their republic,  refuse negotiations as a method of settling political conflicts.  The unprecedented dependence of Vladikavkaz on the Federation  provided the latter with the means to use power without using  force, by explaining to the Ossetian leadership the ruinous  consequences of lawless arbitrariness for the republic and its  leadership. Or a direct appeal could be made to the deceived  Ossetian people.    At the time, a year ago, a different approach was chosen.  Perhaps because, seen from Moscow, Dudayev looked like an even  greater danger for the Russian great power. By the way, it is  quite possible that Dudayev himself was ready then for a  deep-reaching compromise, but the Cossack ideology proved  stronger than common sense. And Nazran became a point of cold  calculation on the map of Russian politics.    Every political scientist and specialist on conflicts knows  what to do in the hot spots of the planet. Nobody truly knows  what to do in the cold spot of Russia. Attempts to pass crude  indulgence of regional power-grabbers or great-power dilettantes  in the capital for ethno-political research have the potential  of reviving old enmities stretching back eons. There are three  viewpoints of people who have a tremendous stake in the future  of the zone of conflict.    One belongs to President of the Ingush Republic Ruslan  Aushev. He believes that it is necessary to impose to the  fullest extent a state of emergency on the territory of  Prigorodnyy Rayon where Ossetians and Ingush lived together. The  state of emergency should be lifted in the rest of North  Ossetia, including Vladikavkaz, as well as on the territory of  Ingushetia. In the zone of conflict all authority should rest  with the Provisional Administration. All military units  controlled by Ossetian and Ingush authorities should be  withdrawn from the territory of the conflict and subsequently  disarmed and disbanded. Illegal possession of arms must be  punished in keeping with the provisions of the law on the state  of emergency in the Russian Federation. Use of arms must be  stopped by force. The entire law enforcement system is recruited  from among citizens who are not residents of the North Caucasus.  Economic aid and financial means received for the reconstruction  of the territory are placed at the disposal of the Provisional  Administration, distributed by it, and invested under its  supervision. Let a commandant appointed to every population  center have elected deputies from the two communities. In all  other respects people should live normal lives. Let them rebuild  their homes, plant the fields, and harvest the crops; as time  passes, they will get used to each other and, God willing, will  not fall for new deceptions.    Another viewpoint belongs to the Ossetian leadership and is  well known: "No" to joint habitation of Ossetians and Ingush.  This idea is being imposed on the Ossetian people and is  supported by the majority--at least publicly. If economic and  political freedom develops in Russia, this solution to the  problem will not find support in either Ossetia, Ingushetia, or  any other Russian region.    But then perhaps we will have to accept the third viewpoint  put forward in the president's edict: a phased return--first to  four population centers in the state of emergency zone--of  Ingush refugees. For the time being, while the state of  emergency is in effect, the legal status of the territory  remains unchanged.    There are perhaps other ways to untie this tight knot. The  only thing that is mandatory is honest intentions and a benign  attitude to the interests of each party. While striving for  fairness for the Ingush we cannot forget, of course, that  generations of Ossetians already have been raised in Prigorodnyy  Rayon, for whom it is also the only home they know.    For the time being, however, the president's edict does not  fully satisfy either side. Why, Issa Kostoyev asks, can the  Ingush return to four villages, not three or seven? This means  that in some villages there will be one kind of state of  emergency, and in others--a different one.    Galazov recently reassured citizens of North Ossetia:  "Please  do not be afraid! The president of the Russian Federation's  edict is not the first edict... We will find a way to resist any  force."    And he found it!    The paper that emerged a few days ago from the bowels of the  State Committee on Nationalities and has already been signed by  the prime minister instructs the agencies in Ossetia and  Ingushetia to prepare recommendations for repealing Articles 3  and 6 of the Law "On Rehabilitation of Peoples Subjected to  Repressions;" second, it assigns the task of protecting Ingush  refugees returning to the four villages in Prigorodnyy Rayon to  the Russian MVD jointly with the Prigorodnyy Rayon  law enforcement organs. The way we read this is that protection  of the Ingush again is placed in the hands of those who had been  killing them. In the said paper is Russian Federation Prime  Minister V. Chernomyrdin's List of Assignments stemming from the  Nalchik agreements. How easily our state disposes of the life  and fate of hundreds of thousands of people--actually, the fate  of its own nation and its historic choice. What  simple--sometimes most simplistic--motivation do they offer for  a political step that should have been discussed before it is  made.    There is no doubt that Russia has the right to protect  itself  from disintegration. But we always choose to travel the  unexplored path... right next to the highway. Are we the first  and only ones in the world, or even in our own history? Had  there not been within the boundaries of the Russian empire a  Bukhara Emirate, a Khivan Khanate, the Polish Kingdom, and the  Great Principality of Finland, with their own emirs, khans,  sejms, parliaments, and even their own currency?    It seems as if we are afraid that unless we show force we  will have the reputation of being powerless. Actually, what  Russia deserves is wary caution because of its erratic national  policy. We alternately jump to defend to death our dear  Tiraspol, blockade Chechnya, rouse the Cossacks and OMON against  "persons of Caucasus origin," indulge nationalist leaders, or  bring our great-power wrath on entire nations. We behave  differently in identical situations, prompting others to suspect  us of a double-play. And it does not occur to anyone that we, a  great power, are simply standing there scratching our head. All  the ethnic policy concepts authored by amateurs that have we  seen by now. Ethnic policy cannot be made a subject of  dilettante experiments if Russia wants to remain part of the  family of civilized nations. Otherwise we are not in danger of a  Yugoslav version. We are in danger of something much worse.    No, while Russia is weak, the law should be especially  strong. Otherwise power will shift into the hands of flexible  jurists or sons of jurists.    ***    We are being made to learn, small step by small step, sip by  sip. They let us try it. It tastes bitter? Well, there is not  much we can do about it, they tell us. It tastes bitter to  everyone.    When in Tbilisi soldiers chopped down 19 persons with their  spades, the entire country lamented; the Congress of USSR  People's Deputies interrogated Kryuchkov and Ligachev, Yazov and  Shevardnadze. Commissions flew to Tbilisi one after the other;  the issue of a Leningrad newspaper with Sobchak's report in it  was passed around. Then there was Baku and Vilnius; then  bombed-out Ingush homes in Prigorodnyy Rayon, hundreds dead.  Where are the writers and composers, cinematographers and  deputies now? Where is Anatoliy Sobchak? General Aushev says  bitterly that had something like this happened in the Baltics,  the whole world would be in an uproar. The Caucasus for this  world is the East, and in the East people are counted in the  millions.    The Tbilisi syndrome has finally been overcome. Now the  military doctrine of the Russian Federation envisages bringing  in military formations to aid MVD troops. Now the army has  become a no longer hidden element of politics. And the  generals--political figures of substantial weight. How long will  they continue to patiently pull smoldering wood from the fire  just to light someone's cigarette, and will they not decide to  start their own perestroyka? Whom will we then call on for help?  On the other hand, the military that stays outside politics is a  remnant of Sakharov-era illusions.    The military has been used many times by politicians against  one another, and has increasingly often undertaken independent  actions either with the consent of the political leadership or  moved by its own sympathies--or rather antipathies. The Dniester  region, Abkhazia, Ingushetia. Who knows what was sanctioned here  by the warring branches of authority, and what by the inner  convictions of some general?    Pogroms against "persons of Caucasus origins," promised by  national-patriots, were for the first time accomplished in an  organized form in Ingushetia. I will not try to guess who gave  the pogrom perpetrators absolution in advance. I only know that  nobody will harm them. We are being made to become accustomed to  many things, and there are many we have already grown used to.    We felt it acutely in Moscow in the beginning of October,  with its deceived crowds and tanks in the streets. And even more  acutely during the days of our all-Russia election mutiny. It  turned out that we did not know anything about our country,  ourselves, our people. We were being warned of a social  explosion, and we visualized smashed street kiosks and display  windows of hard currency stores. But the senseless Russian  mutiny occurred quietly, in election booths. We have been  getting used to fascism for a long time for fear of being scared  by it. And so we did not notice, or did not want to notice the  first ethnic cleansing successfully carried out a year ago on  the territory of Russia, the first Russian republic that made  ethnic intolerance its official policy, and Russians protecting  themselves from the Russian army. A year later we had all this  in Moscow: Russians protecting themselves from the Russian army,  and the ethnic cleansing of the capital.    What used to be shameful nowadays at best elicits a shrug.  But we are people of extremes. Every time we reject the old  world, we smash our possessions into dust. In rejecting the  Pharisean Stalinist "friendship of peoples" we should not  rehabilitate Hitler's racism. The Nuremberg Tribunal's rulings  remain in force.</p>

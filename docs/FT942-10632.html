			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Speechwriter in Portillo's shadow: Roland Rudd profiles an adviser of the Treasury chief secretary 'There is nothing shadowy about me whatsoever,' said Mr David Hart. The former aide to Baroness Thatcher is back in the news because of his close links with Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary and potential leadership candidate in the event that Mr John Major is forced from office. Mr Hart dismisses as 'complete nonsense' press reports that he is leading a clandestine campaign for the rightwing Treasury minister and adds that he is not equipped to be a campaign organiser. He says he is more interested in political philosophy than in party politics. Mr Hart is happy to say that Mr Portillo has been a close friend for more than 20 years. And while he is known to believe that rumours of his wealth are widely exaggerated, he does provide Mr Portillo with a valuable service  -free of charge. Ms Alison Broom, Mr Portillo's political adviser, who was the minister's former special adviser at the Department of Environment, benefits from a rent-free office from Mr Hart. Mr Hart also writes speeches for Mr Portillo and lavishly entertains him shooting and fishing at a lodge in Scotland. While Mr Portillo has been deliberately setting out his political stall in recent months, Mr Hart's views are harder to pin down. On the face of it, this champion of 19th-century liberalism appears to be on the extreme wing of the Conservative party. Yet Mr Hart published a 'freedom audit' in the 1980s which was highly critical of the Thatcherite accumulation of power in the centre. He is also opposed to capital punishment and is irritated by the government's claim to be the party of low taxation when it increased the burden of taxation under Lady Thatcher. He was closest to Lady Thatcher during the miners' strike of 1984-85, when he infuriated the then energy secretary, Mr Peter Walker, by summoning working miners to his suite at Claridges. However, Mr Hart hates the label 'rightwinger', although he would be hard-put to deny that his brand of libertarianism is closer to the right of the Conservative party than any other political grouping, which is why he is writing Mr Portillo's speeches. The Committee for Free Britain, established in 1987 as more of a dining club than a think-tank, used to debate how much power the individual could have in relation to society. Inevitably, it came down on the side of the individual, and this, more than any other policy, defines Mr Hart's political philosophy and, by implication, that of Mr Portillo.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSISSIPPI CAPITALIZES, EARNS LIBERTY BERTH  </P> <P> Liberty Bowl-bound Mississippi knows how to take advantage of the breaks.  </P> <P> As a result, the Rebels earned a 21-11 victory over arch-rival Mississippi  State Saturday and will carry that momentum into their Dec. 28 bowl game where  they probably will play Air Force.  </P> <P> "It wasn't one of our better performances. Give Mississippi State a lot of  credit, they played good, solid football," said Mississippi Coach Billy Brewer,  who is taking his third Rebel team to a bowl in his seven seasons at his alma  mater.  </P> <P> "We were patched up and we played hard for 11 games. This is probably as good  an overall performance by a team that I have coached. To accomplish the seventh  win today against a solid intrastate rival makes this victory very meaningful."  </P> <P> In a Southeastern Conference defensive struggle before a crowd of 43,218, Ed  Thigpen and Randy Baldwin scored on one-yard runs and opportunistic Ole Miss  (7-4) won for the sixth time in the last seven games of the series.  </P> <P> Ending a two-game losing streak, Mississippi, 4-3 in the SEC, used a fumble  recovery to set up a short second-quarter touchdown drive and then went 93  yards after a pass interception for one of its two fourth-quarter scores.  </P> <P> Mississippi State (5-6 overall, 1-6 in the SEC), was in the game until a gamble  backfired late in the third quarter and Ole Miss scored two fourth-quarter  touchdowns.  </P> <P> Trailing, 7-3, Mississippi State had a fourth down and a yard for a first down  at the Ole Miss seven, but Todd Jordan's pitch to Jesse Anderson went awry and  the Bulldogs lost five yards.  </P> <P> The loss was particularly disappointing for Mississippi State, which was 1-10 a  year ago and had a shot at a bowl game until a loss last week at Louisiana  State.  </P> <P> "It was a physical game and I think we played really well in some spots,"  Mississippi State Coach Rockey Felker said. "But when we had the opportunities,  we didn't take advantage of them.  </P> <P> "In particular, the fourth-down call from inside the 10. It seemed after that,  all the momentum swung over to the Ole Miss side."  </P> <P> Mississippi State hurt itself with turnovers -- losing the ball three times --  and had a couple of costly penalties in key situations.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on work of Liaoning Provincial People's </F> Procuratorate delivered by Yang Yeqin, chief procurator of the  provincial people's procuratorate, at the second session of  eighth provincial people's congress on 3 March, entitled:  "Enforce Law Strictly, Strengthen Supervision, and Maintain  Political and Social Stability"]    [Text] On 3 March, Yang Yeqin, chief procurator of the  Liaoning Provincial People's Procuratorate, delivered a "report  on work of the provincial people's procuratorate" at the second  session of the eighth provincial people's congress for  discussion by deputies. In reviewing the 1993 procuratorial  work, he said: Last year, under the leadership of the  provincial party committee and the Supreme People's  Procuratorate, and the supervision of the provincial people's  congress standing committee, procuratorial organs across the  province conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the 14th  party congress and of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, the work plans of the provincial party  committee and the provincial people's procuratorate, and the  resolutions of the first session of the eighth provincial  people's congress, adopted a series of measures to intensify the  legal supervisory functions, made overall plans for  procuratorial work in line with the principle of "enforcing laws  strictly and handling cases relentlessly," concentrated efforts  on handling major and appalling economic offenses on corruption  and bribery, dealt strict blows to serious criminal activities,  investigated and handled criminal cases on infringing upon the  democratic rights of citizens and dereliction of duty,  strengthened supervision over law enforcement, made new  achievements, and played a positive role in safeguarding  Liaoning's political and social stability, guaranetting the  smooth progress of reform, opening up, and the modernization  drive, and promoting the development of the socialist market  economy.  1. We Participated Actively in the Anticorruption Struggle and  Handled a Number of Economic Criminal Cases on Corruption and  Bribery [subhead]    In 1993, procuratorial organs across the province achieved a  fairly great success in fighting corruption and bribery. They  accepted 4,996 economic criminal cases on corruption and bribery  during the year, an increase of 30.9 percent over the previous  year, 2,299 cases of which had been filed for investigation, up  20.7 percent. Of these cases, 1,211 were criminal cases on  corruption and bribery, 598 of which were cases involving over  10,000 yuan but less than 100,000 yuan, 51 involved over 100,000  yuan but less than 500,000 yuan, and five involved over 500,000  yuan but less than 1 million yuan, and two involved more than 1  million yuan; of the 583 cases of misappropriation of public  funds, 27 involved over 500,000 yuan; and a number of these  cases involving 77 cadres at and above the county section level  were filed for investigation and handling, showing an increase  of 89.7 percent. During the year, 955 economic criminals were  prosecuted by procuratorial organs. Through handling the  aforementioned cases, illicit money and bribes totalling over  111.35 million yuan Renminbi were recovered, an increase of  44.14 percent over the previous year.    On 21 October last year, after the issuance of the major  plan  for anticorruption struggle worked out by Comrade Jiang Zemin at  the second session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission on behalf of the party Central Committee,  procuratorial cadres and policemen across the province rapidly  participated in the anticorruption struggle, gave priorities to  investigating and handling cases on corruption and bribery that  emerged in party and government organs, judicial departments,  administrative law enforcing departments, and economic  management departments, and concentrated energy on handling  major and appalling cases well. Crime report work was actively  strengthened. In four months, procuratorial organs across the  province processed 11,237 clues reported by the people, an  increase of 130 percent over the total of the previous eight  months, or an increase of 450 percent over the same period of  the previous year. We implemented a system in which chief  procurators assumed responsibility for handling cases and a  system of sharing responsibilies among all levels, strengthened  unified command and coordination, and concentrated energy on  cracking a great number of major and appalling cases. In four  months, we filed 418 major cases each involving corruption or  bribery of over 10,000 yuan or misappropriation of over 50,000  yuan in public funds for investigation and prosecution, an  increase of 32.28 percent over the same period of last year; and  investigated and handled 59 criminal cases involving cadres at  and above county and regimental levels, an increase of 15 times  over the same period of last year. Chief procurators of many  procuratorates took the lead in taking meals and living at the  organs or in places where the cases occurred, led procuratorial  cadres and policemen to work overtime, and investigated cases  round the clock. Through the painstaking efforts of  procuratorial cadres and policemen across the province, we  witnessed a good start in the anticorruption struggle and  achieved initial results in this aspect.    A. We investigated and handled a large number of criminal  cases committed by the functionaries of party and government  organs and particularly by leading cadres with regard to  embezzlement and bribe-taking. The number of such criminal  cases reached 251 and showed a 72-percent increase over 1992.  What was startling and appalling was the case uncovered by the  Tieling city people's procuratorate, in which the criminal ring  on the grain front of Changtu County embezzled and diverted  public funds, received bribes, and evaded taxes. During their  tenure, Gui Bingquan, director of the county grain bureau, and  Yang Maoyuan, deputy director of the county grain bureau, caused  great losses of almost 100 million yuan to the state by  accepting bribes in order to satisfy their personal desires.  They were greatly generous at the state's expense by spending  the state's subsidies to the grain front at will and issuing  orders on several hundred occasions to various grains depots to  buy various equipment whose quality was poor but whose prices  were high. Thus, a large number of relevant personnel illegally  made a large amount of money from buying these equipment whose  prices were, several, tens, or dozens of times higher than the  originals. The city people's procuratorate put the cases  committed by 30 functionaries on record; arrested 17 personnel,  including Gui Bingquan, Yang Maoyuan, and Xu Lianzhong, vice  chairman of the county Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference committee; and recovered over 10 million yuan of  embezzled funds. The provincial people's procuratorate directly  cracked down and put on record the appalling bribe-acceptance  case committed by Wang Yanling, director of the Fuxin city  material supply bureau. The Shenyang city people's  procuratorate put on record as well as investigated and handled  the case committed by Hu Yongshan, secretary of the Kangping  county party committee and acting head of the county, who  embezzled 20,000 yuan in public funds. The Jinxi city people's  procuratorate investigated and handled the case of "fake  recruiters," which exerted the worst influence in society. In  this case, Wang Tieshan, deputy director of the Huludao district  armed forces department in Jinxi city, and Meng Fanchun,  clerical worker of the allowance section under the Jinxi city  civil affairs bureau, colluded with one another in accepting  bribes by providing over 300 fake registration and physical  examination documents for 340 fake recruiters. The case  involved over 40 cadres of the city party and government organs,  including the civil affairs bureau and the armed forces  department, and over 170 personnel were associated with the fake  recruiter incident. The Jinxi city people's procuratorate  arrested 15 local personnel whose crimes had been proved.    B. We investigated and handled a large number of criminal  cases committed by judicial personnel who violated the law while  enforcing the law by embezzling public funds, accepting bribes,  and practicing favoritism. In 1993 the province put on record  the cases of various crimes committed by 102 judicial personnel,  which showed a 64.2 percent increase over 1992. Arrested by the  Shenyang city people's procuratorate, Ma Shiteng, leader of the  public security brigade under the Shenyang city public security  bureau embezzled a tremendous amount of money by illegally  establishing another charge for public security management  during his tenure. The province put on record as well as  investigated and handled 27 cases throughout the year of crimes  committed by judicial personnel in practicing favoritism and  conducting irregularities. The number of these cases showed a  285-percent increase over 1992 and has been the peak of such  criminal cases over the past years. When investigating and  handling the criminal cases committed by clandestine gangsters,  the province discovered that every criminal case of gangsters'  ring had involved the judicial cadres and policemen and that  there were over 30 cadres and policemen who were involved in the  cases, of whom, 20 had their cases of embezzlement and  practicing favoritism put on record for further investigations.  As for the crimes committed by the personnel of procuratorial  organs, the provincial people's procuratorate neither tolerated  nor yielded to them by any means and investigated and handled  them in a timely manner as soon as they were exposed. In  addition, the province also strictly investigated and handled a  large number of cases committed by judicial cadres and policemen  in obtaining confessions through coercion. Of these cases, 19  cadres and policemen whose crimes of reprehensible conduct and  causing serious consequences were proven, were put on record for  their pursuit of their criminal liabilities.    C. We investigated and handled some cases committed by  administrative and judicial personnel in extorting those they  served or managed, seeking and accepting bribes, and violating  the law while enforcing it. The number of cases that were put  on record for further investigations reached 98 and showed a  20.43 percent increase over 1992. Chen Shijie, director of  pharmaceutical administration section under the provincial  public health department, and Liu Shengxian, director of the  medicine supervision office, accepted a tremendous amount of  bribes on many occasions from pharmaceutical factories and in  dealing with units by taking advantage of their special  administrative and law enforcement rights and by bargaining  counters in the establishment of new pharmaceutical factories  and in the production of new medicines. Their cases were put on  record for further investigation by the Huanggu district  people's procuratorate in Shenyang city. Some administrative  and judicial personnel asked for bribes to the Yixin  construction company in the Bayuquan district of Yingkou city  before its formal opening, which distributed a tremendous amount  of cash to relevant personnel of the departments of commercial  inspection, land management, railway transportation, as well as  industry and commerce. The number of personnel who received  bribes surpassed 20. The Yingkou city people's procuratorate put  cases in which crimes were proven on record for further  investigation.    D. We investigated and handled a number of crime cases  involving corruption and bribery among functionaries of economic  management departments. All criminal cases on corruption and  bribery uncovered in the course of rectifying the financial  order in close coordination with the policy decision of the  party Central Committee and the State Council on strengthening  macroeconomic regulation and control were investigated and  handled according to law by procuratorial organs throughout the  province. During the year, we investigated and handled over 240  cases in financial departments, which accounted for over 10  percent of the total number of cases filed for investigation.  The Shenyang city Procuratorate filed for investigation the  major case of Gao Wenxia, deputy manager of the business  department of Liaoning branch of China Industrial and Commercial  Bank and of Chang Xinkai, the person in charge of granting  loans, who made use of the convenience provided by their posts  to examine and approve of certain loans for which they accepted  over 100,000 yuan in bribes from applicants. In line with crime  reports from the masses, the Benxi City Procuratorate filed for  the investigation of an appalling case in which Gao Mingqiu,  president of Benxi branch of the China Industrial and Commercial  Bank, Sun Maorong, Fei Zhirong, and Jiang Baofu, vice presidents  of Benxi branch of China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and Li  Zhende, chief of the comprehensive planning section, each  accepted 43,000 yuan, 15,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan in bribes.  According to initial statistics, procuratorial organs across the  province filed for the investigation and handling of over 30  people in a number of cases involving bank presidents and vice  presidents, and directors and deputy directors of business  departments of banks at all levels. The provincial  procuratorate investigated the crimes of Guan Weiguo, vice  chairman of the Shenyang City Commission for Economic  Restructuring and director of the city securities supervision  committee, who made use of the influence of his post to examine  and approve of the establishment of shareholding enterprises and  the issuance of stock by successively accepting 55,000 yuan in  cash bribes from four companies. This case was brought before  court for public prosecution. The major case of Xu Shiqing,  chief of the securities section of Fushun city's financial  bureau, accepting 96,000 yuan in bribes, was investigated by  Fushun city Procuratorate and prosecuted before the city  intermediate people's court.    E. We ferreted out a large number of "moths" in enterprises  that embezzled great amounts of public property. Jiang  Rensheng, manager of Dalian city Bohai Housing Development  Company, took advantage of his position to commit crimes in 20  cases and to embezzle 2.8 million yuan in public funds by  resorting to such means as understating compensation funds for  relocating households, creating a false payroll, and signing  contracts on selling commodity houses at a low price but taking  a higher payment from buyers from July 1990 to July 1993; and at  the same time, misappropriated 1 million yuan in public funds  for personal profit-making activities. Discovering hints of  Jiang Rensheng's crimes, the Ganjingzi District Procuratorate in  Dalian city adopted resolute investigation measures and caught  him red-handed. His case was brought before the Dalian city  Intermediate People's Procuratorare for prosecution. The case  of Hu Lin, the person in charge of signing contracts for the  marketing section of Fushun Steel Plant who embezzled the large  sum of 1.11 million yuan in bribes was brought to trial for  public prosecution by the Fushun city Procuratorate.    F. We expanded the degree of investigating and handling  cases on crimes involving taxation or fake trademarks. During  the year, we accepted 2,437 clues to tax evasion crimes, refusal  to pay taxes, and cheating the state with tax refunds. Of  these, 392 were filed for investigation and handling, and 30  were major cases each involving over 100,000 yuan. During the  year, we recovered 91.27 million yuan in tax losses for the  state by investigating and handling criminal cases, and working  with tax departments to safeguard tax collection. We should  actively participate in the struggle to check fake products and  investigate and handle the year's 134 cases on using fake  trademarks, an increase of 143.6 percent over the previous year.  <H5>  2. We Dealt Strict Blows to Serious Criminal Activities in </H5> Line With the Law and Safeguarded Political and Social Stability  in Our Province    Procuratorial organs at all levels across the province  followed the unified plans of the central authorities and the  provincial party committee, maintained close coordination with  the public security organs, procuratorial organs, and judicial  administrative departments, continued to uphold the principle of  dealing heavy and rapid blows to criminals in line with the law,  and dealt strict blows to all sorts of serious criminal  activities. During the year, we approved the arrest of 25,459  persons involved in various kinds of criminal cases and decided  to prosecute 23,213 persons. In the struggle to "deal strict  blows to criminals," we upheld the following few points:    First, we pinpointed some priorities for attack. We gave  priority to dealing blows to vicious criminal activities, such  as murder, robbery, rape, bomb-planting, and committing crimes  armed with guns, and criminal activities involving underworld  groups, and guaranteed the manifestation of dealing heavy and  rapid blows in the course of investigating the cases, approving  arrests, and bringing suits to court. Recently, crimes  committed by underworld gangs occurred frequently in our  province and have become a problem which we must not neglect in  current public security. The people's procuratorates of various  localities regarded the work of handling these cases as an  emphasis and selected and dispatched their outstanding personnel  to examine the cases, to approve the arrest, to check the  indictment, and to attend the trial to support public  prosecution. They earnestly implemented the duties of legal  supervision and upheld the principle of tracking down escaped  criminals and bringing supplementary suits against them so as to  exterminate the evil thoroughly. Over the past year, the  province has approved of the arrest of 278 members of  underground gangsters' rings.    Second, we heavily and rapidly dealt serious blows at  criminal elements. As for serious and appalling cases for which  the masses showed concern and about which society had lodged  strong complaints, we upheld the principle of joining in the  investigation by public security organs and the pre-trial  activities in advance so as to be familiar with the cases and to  grasp evidence rapidly, to approve the arrest or to indict  convicts rapidly within the legal date, and to rapidly put the  abominable criminals to trial. Procuratorial organs throughout  the province joined in the investigations of 1,750 appalling  criminal cases in the year in advance and played active roles in  dealing heavy, rapid, and serious blows at criminal elements.    Third, we actively joined in the activities of dealing blows  at special crimes and conducting special management of public  security. Working in close coordination with public security  organs, we took the spring offensive by regarding as a main  content the struggle against "train bandits and highway despots"  and the activities of "dealing blows at criminal rings, pursuing  and capturing escaped criminals, and cracking down on appalling  cases." We handled a large number of cases by rapidly approving  the arrest and indictment of convicts. A large number of  escaped criminals were captured, brought to justice, and  punished in line with the law. We also earnestly implemented  the three decisions made by the standing committee of the  National People's Congress with regard to banning narcotics and  dealing blows at abduction, and selling and buying of  prostitutes' services. We arrested 113 criminals for violating  the aforementioned prohibition and indicted 108 convicts.    Fourth, while "dealing serious blows to crime," we actively  joined in the comprehensive management of public security. In  line with the activities of handling cases and the procuratorial  function, we implemented measures in the procuratorial link with  regard to the comprehensive management of public security and  eliminated some factors that harmed stability.  <H5>  3. We Enhanced the Work of Supervising Law Enforcement, </H5> Safeguarded the Correct, and Unified Enforcement of State Laws    A. We enhanced supervision over investigation and  emphatically dealt with the problems of leaving crimes unchecked  and replacing imprisonment with fines. The people's  procuratorates of various localities upheld the system of  joining the investigation activities conducted by the public  security organs in advance and of keeping up with the  investigation activities to conduct supervision. They conducted  supervision and correction in line with the law over the  problems of leaving the crimes unchecked and replacing  imprisonment with fines. They also made suggestions on putting  on record the cases that deserved to be noted, on pursuing and  capturing escaped criminals who deserved to be arrested, and on  forming indictments against those who deserved to be tried.  Over the past year we have captured 369 criminals and formed  indictments against 147 unpunished convicts. We supervised 578  personnel to correct their investigation activities from  violating the law. Meanwhile, we made the decision not to  arrest 2,755 suspected criminals whose crimes did not conform  with the regulations of law and ensured that every criminal was  handled with no wrong treatment or appeasement.    B. We enhanced supervision over criminal trials and  emphatically dealt with the problems of giving no punishment to  suspects who have actually committed crimes, giving light  sentences to convicts who deserve to be heavily punished, giving  heavy sentences to those who deserve to be lightly punished.  Over the past year we have lodged appeals in line with the law  for 67 cases in which the people's courts have made wrong  decisions. We conducted macro supervision over the problems of  trends cropping up in the criminal trials, put forward the  procuratorial suggestion on the strict enforcement of laws, and  corrected the phenomena of violations cropping up in the trial  activities.    C. We enhanced inspection over jails and detention houses  and  emphatically dealt with the law-violation problems committed in  jails or detention houses. We conducted 8,297 inspections over  the enforcement of laws in the year, exposed 3,925 cases of  violations in various categories, and put forward 2,663 cases  for correction. Of these cases, 1,827 were corrected. We  conducted inspection and supervision over the implementation of  criminal judgment, adjudication, and of the decision on  reformatory education. Meanwhile, we put forward the opinions  for correction cases in which 5,386 suspects were illegally  detained. Of these cases, 1,668 were corrected.    D. We enhanced inspection of the process of filing charges  in  court and appealing against decisions and emphatically grasped  reexamination of appeals against court judgments and  adjudication as well as over the no admittance of appeals by the  procuratorial organs. We handled 1,112 cases of various  categories with regard to filing charges in courts and appealing  against decisions.    E. We enhanced the legal supervision over the trials of  civil  affairs cases and over administrative lawsuit activities and  emphatically grasped the examination and the appeals against the  judgment and adjudication on civil affairs and administrative  cases. We accepted 315 cases in the year, put 171 cases on  record, and corrected some wrongly decided cases.  <H5>  4. We Upheld the Principle of Managing Procuratorial Organs </H5> Strictly and Strengthened the Self-Development of Procuratorial  Contingents    In 1993, procuratorates at all levels across the province  continued to exert efforts to build procuratorial contingents  with a strong sense of politics, good professional skills,  strict discipline, and tough work style in accordance with the  principle of "building the procuratorates in line with law and  managing the procuratorial contingents strictly," and gave  priorities to grasping four aspects of work: First, they  attended to the building of leading bodies of procuratorates at  all levels. Second, they strengthened ideological and political  work, mobilized the enthusiasm of all procuratorial cadres and  policemen to the fullest extent, and guaranteed the fulfillment  of all kinds of procuratorial work. Third, they grasped  anticorruption work among themselves. After the convocation of  the second session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission, the provincial procuratorate decided to conduct a  struggle between two lines among procuratorial organs across the  province, gave play to the key role of procuratorial organs  during the anticorruption straggle, attended to the internal  anticorruption work of procuratorial organs, and strengthened  administrative honesty among the procuratorial contingents.  Leading cadres of procuratorates at all levels acted strictly  in line with the central stipulations on keeping oneself clean  and self-disciplined, conducted self-investigation and self-  rectification, resolutely checked and corrected all sorts of  phenomena on discipline and law violations, strictly  investigated and handled procuratorial personnel who violated  law and discipline, and screened and transferred 31  procuratorial personnel to other posts who were not suitable for  procuratorial work. In light of the problems discovered, we  further improved the system on administrative honesty. Through  education and rectification, the number of cases on law and  discipline violations involving procuratorial organs across the  province declined noticeably. Last year only 16 cases involving  16 persons occurred, showing a decline of 46.6 percent and 51.5  percent respectively from the previous year, thus marking the  year as one with the fewest incidents of crime in this category.  Fourth, they strengthened education and training for cadres and  succeeded in enhancing cultural and professional levels of  procuratorial contingents.    We also had many problems in our work, which mainly  included:  The lack of even development in the work of investigating and  handling economic criminal cases on corruption and bribery and  the inadequate efforts in handling appalling, influential cases;  the lack of courage in a small number of chief procurators in  enforcing the law justly; the low level of law enforcement by  certain cadres and policemen who could not meet the demands of  the struggle and the frequent occurrence of careless handling of  cases or the failure to enforce laws strictly; the overstepping  of rights by some units in pursuing their own interests while  handling cases; and some localities not carrying out law  enforcement supervisory work. We will conscientiously resolve  these problems in our future work.    Yang Yeqin said in conclusion: We sobemnly recognize that  during this year the task of investigating and handling economic  crimes on corruption and bribery will be more arduous, that more  painstaking efforts will be demanded for dealing blows to  serious criminal activities, and that greater courage and energy  will be required to strengthen law enforcement and supervisory  work. Procuratorial organs across the province have decided to  regard Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the third plenary  session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as the guiding  principles, implement the guidelines of the national and  provincial public security, procuratorial, and judicial work  conferences and of the national work conference of chief  procurators, uphold the principle of taking a two-handed  approach and being tough with both, adapt themselves to the  demands of building the socialist market economic structure,  strengthen the legal and supervisory functions, continue to make  overall plans for all procuratorial work in line with the  principle of "enforcing law strictly and handling cases  relentlessly, give prominence to handling major economic  criminal cases on corruption and bribery, deal strict blows to  all sorts of criminal activities, safeguard political and social  stability, and make new contributions to safeguarding and  promoting Liaoning's reform and opening up and realizing the  grand objective of conducting the "second pioneering program."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Imprudent Behavior"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Prime  Minister, Tsutomu Hata, requested an active support of Western  countries including France and Germany, saying "Japan is playing  a role commensurate with the status of permanent members of the  United Nations Security Council in all fields including politics  and the economy," and said at the budget committee of the House  of Representatives on May 24 that Japan is actively aspiring  after a permanent member of the UN Security Council.    Commenting on his remarks, a MINJU CHOSON analyst today  says:    This fully shows how desperately the Japanese authorities  are  trying to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council.    It is too shameless and impertinent an act for the Japanese  authorities to covet for a permanent seat on the UN Security  Council.    Although nearly half a century has passed since World War  II,  Japan is still failing to clearly repent of its crimes.    It is reinforcing its "self-defence forces" with  sophisticated military equipment, steadily increasing military  spendings even after the cold war came to an end.    Japan's nuclear armament which has reached the danger line  in  actuality poses a big threat to peace and security in the Korean  peninsula and Asia.    It is only too natural that Japan with such background  cannot  become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and it is  as clear as noonday what grave consequences will arise in case  Japan should obtain a permanent seat.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Time, gents - to invest - Bethan Hutton drinks in the news of a trust aimed at breweries One well-known brewer calls its product 'amber nectar' - and, to drinkers the world over, that describes beer perfectly. But actually putting money where their mouths are, and buying into a brewery, is something else. Now, though, one sober City firm is offering small investors an easy way to do just that. Lazard Investors believes the UK's regional brewing companies are set to prosper. So, it has taken the unusual step of launching an investment trust to specialise in these, along with pub companies and others producing or selling drinks. It aims to raise at least Pounds 50m from individuals and institutions. The trust is to be managed by Billy Whitbread, a member of the brewing family and formerly manager of the Whitbread Investment Company, a trust set up to hold shares mainly in regional brewers. It was bought back by the parent company at the end of last year. The Lazard trust will invest mostly in regional brewers listed on the main London Stock Exchange - such as Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley, Marston Thompson and Mansfield Brewery - and will look also at companies on the Unlisted Securities Market and elsewhere. At the start, it might buy shares in the large national brewers as well; but as opportunities arise to invest in the smaller companies, shares in the big ones will be sold. Investment of small amounts in unquoted and overseas companies which fit the trust's criteria will be considered, too. Analyst Martin Hawkins, of Greig Middleton, says the one-time trend for shares in the regional brewers to trade at a premium to the market has been absent since 1990. This is because brewing companies generally have not been popular with investors after the industry shake-up caused by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Hawkins adds, however: 'With a more favourable trading outlook now for the regional brewer than has been evident for some time, we feel that this prolonged period of discount to the market is likely to be nearing an end.' Most of the regional brewers concentrate on producing beers with a strong local following rather than developing national brands. Recent government rules forcing the large national brewers to allow their tied pubs to stock 'guest beers' have helped the smaller regional brewers, too. The proportion of beer drunk at home has been increasing for some time and, initially, this favoured the mainstream beers and lagers stocked by supermarkets. But the growing popularity of bottled traditional English beers means that a variety of brands is now stocked by many of the main off-licence and supermarket chains - which also is good news for the regionals. Any fund which invests in such a narrow range of companies has a higher risk profile than more diversified funds. But Whitbread says brewing shares actually are comparatively low risk as the sector is less volatile than many others. He adds, however, that the trust is really suitable only for shareholders with a relatively large and diversified portfolio. One drawback for small investors who choose to invest in brewers via a trust is that only direct shareholders are entitled to the perks offered by some of the companies. Burtonwood Brewery, for example, gives shareholders discount vouchers for bar snacks and meals at its pubs. The Vaux Group also offers discounts on meals, drinks and accommodation and provides a buffet lunch at its annual general meeting, while Greene King shareholders can get discounts on cases of fine wine. In a similarly alcoholic vein, Neill Clerk Capital is looking for up to Pounds 3m for three new companies being set up under the enterprise investment scheme (EIS), successor to the business expansion scheme. The Unchained Growth Pub Companies I to III will buy pubs in and around London to be managed by the recently floated Regent Inns group, which itself is a former BES company. The scheme offers investors a limited guarantee which promises that if, after five years, the asset value of the Pounds 1 shares has not grown to at least Pounds 1.40, Regent Inns will contribute up to 40p a share to make them up to that level. Losses on EIS schemes can be offset against tax and individuals, who can invest up to Pounds 100,000 in EIS companies each year, are entitled to 20 per cent tax relief on the initial investment. Minimum investment in Unchained Growth is Pounds 500.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Russian President Boris Yeltsin at the signing </F> ceremony of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement  in Ayios Yeoryios Church, Corfu--live in Russian with  simultaneous translation into Greek]    [Text] We have just signed an agreement of historic  importance. I believe that in this way we have made a  significant step toward progress in the unity of the European  continent. This agreement precisely and completely states the  conditions for Russia's economic return to Europe. It also  determines Russia's role as an equal partner. [Words  indistinct] the conflict ended some years ago. Now we have a  warm climate in international relations, one that guarantees  pluralism.    But the consequences of the Cold War still poison the  atmosphere. I think we have all felt the threat of a new clash.  In the former Soviet Union and Cocom [Coordinating Committee  for Multilateral Export Controls] we have agreements that failed  with regard to the smooth exchange of products. Now our  businesses are trying to find new openings in the international  market. Consequently there are new agreements regarding the  exchange of goods, trade, and services.    We all know that there are local clashes, local interests,  and regional clashes. These are serious symptoms that show the  possibility of a return to the Cold War, but one that is  financial in nature this time. With this agreement today, we  can truly say that this threat is lifted. The European Union  will now have new relations with the Russian Federation. The EU  and Russia have made a strategic choice regarding Russia's new  position on the international scene. Today Russia becomes one  of the most important partners for Europe and the wider  international community. In this way we will continue our  cooperation and upgrade our relations for the benefit of the  whole world.    I believe that on the eve of the 21st century this is indeed  a historic event. We are moving toward tightening relations  among people who have been artificially divided into two camps  based on ideology. We are all witness to this new direction.  We should recognize that there are many obstacles and that much  effort and wisdom is needed by all sides--probably more than we  thought at first. Under these conditions I believe that Europe  is called upon to give an important lesson in real and authentic  cooperation to the world in every sector, including the economy,  ecological problems, the handling of conflicts, and cultural  issues. Russia has vital interests when it comes to the West  and Central and East Europe. We have every reason to support  the institutions that deal with these problems. We know the  problems in the former Yugoslavia. The EU, indeed every  European country, can have faith in Russia regarding this issue.  We hope for sharing within the CSCE framework, mainly to  safeguard stability in the East of the European continent.    Russia is interested in the EU's economic and political  development. We support the process of European integration and  the expansion of the EU's institutions. We believe that soon  there will be additional results and we will do everything we  can so that today's small Europe will become a big Europe. We  are also interested in European integration within the framework  of our participation in the CIS. We have seen various tragic  events lately. Everyone is required to make efforts to realize  a unified Europe so that the 21st century will be the first  century of peace throughout Europe. This is the direction we  should follow because it is to everyone's benefit.    I consider that our common effort is already producing  tangible results. The agreement we have just signed constitutes  testimony and proof that we are following this direction and  accepting the results. It is the first tangible step toward  successfully realizing the goals. It took two years to conclude  this agreement. There were many difficulties. Russia's economic  and political reforms have not always been understandable;  perhaps there were psychological difficulties on every side.    But we reached an agreement, and I believe that this  agreement between the EU and the Russian Federation [which was]  signed today has taken the most appropriate form. It opens a  new chapter in relations, improving their quality. We have a  credible mechanism for a permanent political dialogue and have  strong foundations to continue working in the scientific,  economic, technical, and cultural sectors. Russian companies  will no longer need to fight an unequal battle in Europe; I  think that this agreement provides a more civilized mechanism  allowing activities by both sides. There is a clear possibility  of gradual progress. We hope that in this way we will have  greater opportunities to enter the West European markets and  conclude the free movement of goods and capital. An appropriate  framework for businesses will also be established in Russia. Of  course it will be difficult, beginning, as we should,  simultaneously in many fields. Already the agreement is raising  issues. We have seen the texts that make up the agreement; they  indicate the depth and detail behind the agreement.    We are here at the signing in Ayios Yeoryios Church. Do you  know that the Orthodox call Ayios Yeoryios victorious? I hope  this will be a happy coincidence. Let us consider Ayios  Yeoryios as our patron. Opportunity has brought us here so let  the last signs of mutual distrust disappear and let us begin a  new, great project for our peoples. With this opportunity, I  want to thank the heads of the EU member countries, especially  the Greek Presidency and the EU Commission, for their great  efforts and for the preparation of this agreement, which is very  important and opens up new directions. The most important thing  now is to implement this agreement. I should say that Russia  will make every effort to achieve progress. We want this  cooperation to proceed. I thank you.</p>

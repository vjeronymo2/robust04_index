			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Chile eases capital rules Chile's central bank yesterday took an important step towards opening up the capital account by relaxing rules governing the raising of capital abroad and the remittance to Chile of export earnings. Required risk classifications for Chilean companies issuing bonds or American Depository Receipts abroad have been lowered, while the minimum issue amount has been halved to Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m). The long-awaited easing of restrictions also allows Chilean exporters to leave up to 15 per cent of foreign exchange earnings abroad, against 10 per cent now. This will be raised to 20 per cent in six months. Private pension funds, which marshal Dollars 16bn of savings, can now invest 4 per cent of assets abroad, up from 3 per cent. 'Liberalising the capital account is good news because it makes Chile look more mature economically and financially,' said Mr David Lubin, economist at Samuel Montagu. He said the aim was probably to keep capital flows neutral.</p>

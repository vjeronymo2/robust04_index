			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US dairy lobby smells victory in cheese row THE US dairy lobby appears to have succeeded in heading off the threat of cheap cheese imports from Hungary. Congressman Steve Gunderson, a Wisconsin Republican, says he has received personal assurances from State Department officials that they no longer plan to support a petition to add Hungarian Goya cheese to the list of duty-free imports permitted under the US Generalised System of Preferences. The GSP is designed to help developing countries by giving export advantage to some of their products. However, it is not supposed to allow de-stabilisation of US industries - particularly in an election year. Goya cheese has already been rejected as a candidate for duty-free status, but at the request of the Hungarian embassy a special interagency committee which vets candidates for the GSP was asked to review the petition. The State Department is not officially admitting an about-face. A department official said the case was still being reviewed and the results would not be known until they were announced from the White House on May 1. 'The department is interested in seeing that a significant number of Hungary's petitions for GSP benefits are accepted,' he said. 'This is of critical importance to supporting democracy in a market economy in Hungary.' He added, however, that the Goya cheese petition was rejected in the first place 'for sound reasons' which the chastened department apparently now 'understands and recognises'. Congressman Gunderson, who could use an election year boost himself (he appeared on the list of 'bad' cheque writers, in the latest Congressional scandal surrounding the House bank) held a hearing with other dairy state congressmen earlier this month where the impact of GSP status for Goya was widely decried. It would open the floodgates for duty-free imports from everyone, Mr Gunderson said, and particularly benefit Argentina and Uruguay. The impact of duty-free Goya imports is unknown, with estimates ranging from 1,000 to 100,000 tonnes. It could displace sales of US products supported by the government dairy programme, as well as add to US surpluses and programme costs.</p>

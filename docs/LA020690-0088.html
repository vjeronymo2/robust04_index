			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDS KILLING ROMANIA'S CHILDREN  </P> <P> This country is in the throes of the first known epidemic of childhood AIDS  caused by contaminated blood and the constant reuse of needles, a humanitarian  organization says.  </P> <P> Dr. Jacques Lebas, president of the Paris-based Doctors of the World, Monday  urged the international health community to provide Romania with disposable  needles and blood-screening equipment.  </P> <P> "We know AIDS from people who take drugs, homosexuals, and heterosexuals in  Africa, but for the first time in the history of AIDS, we are confronted with  childhood AIDS," he said.  </P> <P> "It's an epidemic," he said. "It's on the level of famine. It's an  international emergency."  </P> <P> The Romanian outbreak is unusual because it does not involve the transmission  of the virus from mother to fetus -- the manner in which most children around  the world are infected -- but from contaminated blood transfusions and needles,  he said.  </P> <P> "In the adult population, the incidence of AIDS is very low," Lebas said.  </P> <P> The contaminated blood is believed to come from Romanians, not from foreigners.  </P> <P> Blood transfusions are routinely used in Romania as a treatment for premature  babies, sick children and the thousands of youngsters suffering from  malnutrition, he said. But needles are in short supply and are routinely used  hundreds of times, encouraging the spread of the virus.  </P></p>

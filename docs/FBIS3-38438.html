			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Stefano Folli report: "All Polls Show Italy Split Three </F> Ways and a Country Yet To Come to Terms With Bipolarism"]    [Text] Rome -- The preelectoral picture of Italy is  starting to come into focus thanks to the opinion polls. It is  a picture that shows clearly the cloudy state of uncertainty  into which the country has fallen. If anyone wants to  understand why it is so difficult for agreements to be struck  between [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni and [League  Secretary] Umberto Bossi, between [Italian Popular Party (PPI)  Secretary] Martinazzoli and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi,  between [Italian Republican Party (PRI) Secretary] La Malfa and  [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Achille Occhetto,  between [Italian Socialist Party (PSI) Secretary] Del Turco and  [PSI deputy] Intini, and between [Communist Renewal leader]  Cossutta and [Democratic Allaince leader] Adornato, they should  simply take a look at the figures published by Directa, CIRM, or  Diakron -- to name but a few of the polling institutions that  are exhibiting their wares in the newspapers these days.    What emerges is the image of an Italy that is split into  three, more or less equal-sized slices. There are differences  between individual polls, but in general the three Italies are a  reality, if only a virtual one. For example, the triple poll  taken by CIRM in January provides a rather interesting batch of  new information. The progressive alliance stands at around 36  percent. Within the alliance, the PDS is the hegemonic force  with 20 percent: At the beginning of the month, Occhetto's  party was given 23 percent, in the second poll it stood at 22  percent, and today it has probably lost another two points. The  Communist Renewal should have 6 percent, remaining more or less  stable since early January. The Rete and the Greens, taken  together, were on 5 percent after having reached 6 percent in  the first poll. The nondenominationalist group of the  Democratic Alliance remained steady on 5 percent. The  progressive front as a whole now appears to have four points  less than the 40 percent achieved in the first days of January.    The right, on the other hand, would appear to be on the way  up. The first poll gave it 34 percent, but in the second it had  38 percent. In the most recent poll, published a few days ago,  the right had 40 percent. If we look inside the coalition  (which, moreover, is not yet an official one) we can see that  the main group at the moment appears to be Silvio Berlusconi's  Forza Italia, which has shot up from 6 percent to 13 percent in  less than a month. The Northern League, on the other hand, has  taken the opposite trend: Leading the way with 16 percent at  the start of the month, it then dropped to 13 percent before  further shrinking back to 12 percent. Gianfranco Fini's  National Alliance remains completely stable on 10 percent (note  that this figure, taken at the national level, would give the  Alliance a considerable success concentrated in the south).  Lastly, the CIRM poll recorded an increase for the former  Christian Democratic [DC] and nondenominationalist centrists, up  from 2 to 5 percent. The split in the DC has clearly given a  slight boost to the Casini-D'Onofrio-Mastella group chasing the  moderate voters.    The third Italy that we should keep an eye on is that of  [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli and  Mario Segni. The agreement concluded between the Popular Party  and the Pact for Italy remains stable in the polls at 23  percent. From a political point of view, this would prove  Martinazzoli right in choosing to defend stubbornly his party's  identity as the center-left heir to the DC. As [Senate Speaker]  Spadolini said in an interview with LA STAMPA, "the alliance of  the left as it stands is best confronted from the center.  Martinazzoli and Segni have understood this. A new type of  dialogue is being imposed between nondenominationalists and  Catholics."    However, this 23 percent does not guarantee either  Martinazzoli or Segni sufficient representation in a future  parliament: The rules of the majority system are strict, and  those finishing third can get little or nothing. Augusta  Barbera explained this well in an interview with CORRIERE DELLA  SERA, even if we should add that the Italian-style majority  system does award a considerable consolation prize with a 25  percent proportional drawback.    In any case, the map of the three Italies must not be seen  just from an electoral point of view. The political message it  gives is that the country has not come to terms with bipolarism  and that public opinion, for the moment, prefers a three-legged  system. This is a sign that the clear-cut alternative between  left and right does not appear convincing yet and that people  want to let at least a third runner into the race. After 27  March this could also lead to that "great coalition" alluded to  by the speaker of the Senate. The other clear message is that  the left has not yet won, and thus its forces do not appear to  be superior to those of the right. Occhetto's advantage is that  the progressive coalition is already a reality, despite  contradictions and a paradoxical situation. On the other hand,  the right will continue to be the side of Agramante, as  described by [former IL GIORNALE editor] Montanelli. The new  factor in the equation, however, is that Bossi has asked  Berlusconi to act as a "mediator" between north and south -- in  effect to act as the cement for an agreement that does not yet  exist and which should bind together the League, Forza Italia,  and the MSI-National Alliance. Bossi's initiative, however, is  also the sign of Berlusconi's growing sway among the moderates.    It simply remains to be said that things are not settled  either in the Martinazzoli-Segni group with regard to possible  preelection alliances. While the Popular Party members of the  left are in favor of going it alone, many in the Pact think  otherwise. There is a border area between the two, consisting  mostly of nondenominationalists, that still believe in the idea  of a technical agreement with the ranks of the right to save the  majority constituencies. Mario Segni, after having decided to  back the agreement with Martinazzoli, now has every reason to  hold on to a degree of autonomy.</p>

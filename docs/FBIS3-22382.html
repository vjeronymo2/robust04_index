According to the latest statistics, Jiangsu, Zhejiang,  Anhui,  Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan and Guizhou provinces and the  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had planted trees on 902,000 ha  by the end of February, fulfilling their annual afforestation  plan by 43.8 percent.    The Anhui Provincial Government held a mobilization meeting  attended by local leading officials and afforestation bureau  chiefs as early as on January 1 to draw up a plan for  afforesting all barren hills within this year.    Leading officials of Guangxi and Zhejiang took the lead in  planting trees earlier this year.    The local governments of 23 counties in Hubei Province  organized 1.978 million laborers to plant trees on hills and  mountains soon after the spring festival, the traditional  Chinese new year, which fell on February 10.    Meanwhile, Hunan Province has planted trees on 93,000 ha in  the Chang Jiang River valley so far.</p>

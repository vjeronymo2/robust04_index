			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] According to preliminary  reports, the plane was hijacked by a 36-year-old man (Chou  Wen-chiang), using a carving knife and a flash light. The  airport police have taken him from the plane for investigation.  It was initially determined that there were no accomplices.    During the interrogation, (Chou Wen-chiang) said he was born  in [words indistinct] in 1958 and was a resident of Guangdong's  Lien County. He has a heart ailment [words indistinct]. He  said he hijacked the plane because he was dissatisfied with his  low pay of only a few dozen yuan a month, and he received a  compensation of only 8,000 yuan after his elder sister was  killed by an unlicensed driver.    According to the Ministry of Defense spokesman, the plane,  which was hijacked at 1920, gave the signal at 1924 that it had  been hijacked. While our military and radar placed the plane  under close surveillance, two F5-E fighter jets took off from  the Chiayi Airport to intercept it. The fighters intercepted  the plane at 1939 and guided it to a safe landing at the Chiang  Kai-shek Airport at 1956. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Minister Wu Po-hsiung, chairman of the Executive  Yuan panel in charge of affairs about hijacking, indicated that  the case will be handled according to the principle that the  hijacker and the plane will be handled separately. He said the  plane, after being routinely checked, will be allowed to fly to  its original destination, but the hijacker will be turned over  to judicial authorities for handling. He reiterated that while  the government is firmly against any plane hijacking and will  strictly punish any hijackers, relevant Chinese communist  authorities should strengthen their security checks to forestall  any hijacking attempts. He added that the hijacker will be  repatriated after the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] has  consultated the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan  Straits [ARATS] and reached a common understanding with the  latter. He said the hijacker will never be be allowed to stay  in Taiwan.    As usual, the SEF has immediately notified ARATS on the  procedures that will be taken for the repatriation of the  hijacker.

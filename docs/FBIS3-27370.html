Provincial party committee Secretary Guan Guangfu attended  and delivered a speech at the meeting chaired by Hui Liangyu,  provincial party committee deputy secretary and provincial CPPCC  committee chairman.    On behalf of the provincial party committee, Comrade Wang  Zhongnong, provincial party committee standing committee member,  briefed the participants on a series of proposed personnel  arrangements concerning the provincial CPPCC committee  leadership.    Also attending and speaking at this morning's consultation  meeting were provincial CPPCC committee leaders, provincial  industry and commerce federation leaders, as well as some well  known personalities without party affiliation, including Shen  Kechang, Shi Quan, Zeng Zhonglang, Liu Jiankang, Zhou Zibai, Liu  Zhong, Xu Guangdu, Liu Zhuqing, Xie Baoshan, Tao Yinyue, Zheng  Longfei, Yang Zaikui, Jin Linkong, Luo Jinlian, Chen Liangcai,  Cai Shaozhi, Wu Daihua, Tao Jinshi, Li Jishao, Zhang Huimin,  Zhou Yunquan, and others.    By developing the spirit of showing utter devotion to each  other and sharing honor and disgrace, all participants at the  meeting exchanged frank and candid views on the proposed  personnel arrangements in accordance with the spirit of the CPC  Central Committee and the spirit of the Hubei Provincial CPC  Committee. They held unanimously that the Hubei Provincial CPC  Committee convening such a consultation meeting is undoubtedly  of great significance in uniting all forces that can be united,  mobilizing all positive factors that can be mobilized, and  successfully furthering all types of work in Hubei.    Secretary Guan Guangfu also delivered a speech in which he  explained to the non-CPC personages a series of work  arrangements made by the Hubei Provincial CPC Committee for this  year; spelt out specific requirements on the forthcoming  provincial people's congress session and CPPCC committee  session; and also gave an account of some relevant personnel  arrangements.    Guan Guangfu said: Since the end of last year, the  provincial party committee and people's government have made a  series of work arrangements and worked out a number of grand  plans for both 1994 and the next few years. The whole province  should now strive to arrive at the following unnanimous  understanding: It is necessary to persist in reform and carry  on development in light of Hubei's actual conditions, under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, and in accordance with the spirit  of the CPC Central Committee and the spirit of the Hubei  Provincial CPC Committee.    Guan Guangfu pointed out: Since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a  series of important speeches during his south China tour last  year, Hubei has enjoyed faster economic growth and an excellent  momentum in economic growth. Thus, we should make every  possible endeavor to safeguard, with one heart and one mind,  such an excellent situation; carry on development; maintain the  current excellent momentum of economic growth; and open up new  vistas for, and successfully further and accelerate, Hubei's  economic growth with an eye on further raising Hubei's economic  efficiency.    Guan Guangfu noted: In order to maintain an excellent  momentum in economic growth, it is imperative to implement to  the letter all relevant reform measures and properly handle  relations between reform, development, and stability. In order  to maintain stability, it is imperative to tackle all new  situations and new problems in a timely manner and press ahead  with development. Reform and opening up constitute the motive  force for development. We should strive to persist in reform  and expand opening up this year. I hope that all democratic  party members will join hands with us in pushing forward Hubei's  reform and opening up.    Speaking of the upcoming provincial people's congress  session  and CPPCC committee session, Guan Guangfu asserted: This year,  we're going to hold these two important sessions earlier than  usual because we need to make work arrangements for this year  ahead of schedule. The two upcoming sessions will abide by all  the relevant legislative procedures when arranging Hubei's work  in 1994. I hope that all the provincial people's congress  deputies and CPPCC committee members will be able to  conscientiously deliberate and discuss the forthcoming  provincial government work report and work hard to turn the  upcoming two sessions into two successful sessions marked by  solidarity. The provincial CPPCC committee leadership will, as  expected, be further perfected, thereby becoming more capable of  catering to the growing needs of Hubei's CPPCC work. I hope  that all comrades concerned will make concerted and unreserved  efforts to attain this goal.    Wang Qigang and Meng Meilu, provincial CPPCC committee vice  chairmen and some others also attended this morning's political  consultation meeting.</p>

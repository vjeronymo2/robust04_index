			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / German poll points to stalemate The German election next Sunday could produce a stalemate between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's existing conservative-liberal coalition and the rival parties of the left, according to the latest opinion poll, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. The survey, carried out by the Emnid research group for Der Spiegel magazine and the ntv television news broadcaster, suggests that Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats would win 42 per cent, and his Free Democratic party allies just 6 per cent - a 1 per cent drop on the week. The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) were backed by 37 per cent in the poll, and their potential partners, the Greens, by 7 per cent. The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the former East German communists, which could get into the Bundestag by winning at least three constituencies outright, was supported by 4 per cent. Although the SPD insists it would not use PDS support to gain power, the stalemate might force a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sanaa, June 25 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni  authorities rejected a new Northern ceasefire offer due to come  into effect at midnight (2100 GMT Saturday [25 June]), after a  heavy day of fighting around Aden which left at least 11 people  dead.    The "presidential council" of the breakaway southern state  said the truce declaration made minutes earlier by President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was "aimed at buying time and to prepare a  new offensive."    The spokesman said: "Salih, who will never accept a halt in  fighting, is looking to prepare a new attack."    Northern Yemeni authorities earlier said the truce -- the  fifth declared in the two-month-old civil war -- would be  supervised initially by the French and U.S. military attaches in  Sanaa until a joint Yemeni military commission was reactivated.    But the southern spokesman rejected this mechanism, saying:  "As far as the military commission proposed by Sanaa to  supervise the ceasefire is concerned, we had already rejected  it."    The south has called instead for international observers to  monitor any accord.    Earlier Saturday northern troops cut the coast road between  Aden and the oil refinery at Little Aden, seriously threatening  fuel supplies to the besieged southern city, an AFP  correspondent reported.    Southern troops set up a roadblock at the village, which  lies  only 10 kilometres (six miles) from Aden, and turned back  civilian vehicles, saying northern forces were firing at traffic  on the road.    Sources said that if northern forces keep the road cut to  the  refinery -- the south's only oil refinery -- Aden's fuel  supplies will be seriously jeopardised, because tanker trucks  will not be able to reach it.    Long queues of cars formed outside the city's petrol  stations  when Aden residents heard of the northern advance along the road.    After an uneasy calm overnight, Katyusha rockets slammed  into  the northern Aden suburb of Dar Sa'd close to the frontline  early Saturday, leaving five civilians dead and 30 wounded,  hospital officials said.    Six southern soldiers were also killed and 48 wounded in  fierce fighting along the frontlines, mainly at Bi'r Ahmad, 15  kilometres (nine miles) northwest of the city.    Attacks around Aden continued late Saturday, a southern  military spokesman said.    But southern forces inflicted "enormous losses in men and  equipment" on northern troops, the spokesman said on Aden  television. He said 27 tanks and five military vehicles had  been destroyed.    The latest unsuccessful ceasefire initiative came after a  meeting of the National Defence Council, chaired by Salih, the  official northern agency SABA' said.    The decision was taken "in response to the call (Friday) by  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali" for an immediate  ceasefire, SABA' said.    In all, Sanaa has now declared five ceasefires since June 6.  But the first four collapsed within hours, with both sides  blaming each other for renewed fighting. [passage omitted]    [Paris AFP in English in a related Aden-datelined item at  0505 GMT on 26 June adds the following:    ["Northern and southern Yemeni artillery units clashed again  near here early Sunday following a six-hour lull that set in  after the north announced a ceasefire, correspondents said.    ["A southern spokesman accused northern forces of having  taken advantage of the announced truce to move troops into  position for an assault on the oil refinery, 18 kilometers (12  miles) west of here.    ["Fresh frighting erupted at 6.00 a.m. (0300 GMT) along  battle fronts 15 to 30 kilometers (nine to 18 miles) from this  southern Yemeni stronghold."]</p>

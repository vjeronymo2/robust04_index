			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> OC SCHOOL ENDS GAY PROGRAM  </P> <P> After 19 years of having homosexual speakers discuss their life styles with  students in the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, the district's  superintendent has decided to ban the program because he said it is no longer  necessary for the school's curriculum.  </P> <P> District Supt. John W. Nicoll reversed his earlier decision on the gay speakers  last Thursday, after a group of about 70 parents mounted opposition to the  discussions held in Mike Marino's psychology class with Corona del Mar High  School students.  </P> <P> "While I firmly believe that Mr. Marino should continue this instruction in his  classes, I did not think that the invitation of speakers in the subject of  homosexuality -- people who are not educators or specialists, but people  representing a point of view -- should continue, " Nicoll said today.  </P> <P> Marino taught the class at Newport Harbor High School for eight years before  going to Corona del Mar, where he has been teaching the class for 11 years.  </P> <P> "The speakers have altered the students' thinking and misguided notions of the  situation (of homosexuality), and that's what education is all about," Marino  said today.  </P></p>

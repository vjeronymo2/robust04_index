			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Recession and Gulf war hold back Unilever profits - Guy de Jonquieres analyses the facts and figures behind the static 1991 results THE DEEPER-than-expected recession in the US and the UK coupled with the Gulf war, the collapse of the Soviet Union and adverse currency movements held Unilever to 1 per cent growth in pre-tax profits and sales volumes last year. Nonetheless, the sluggish overall results were relieved by some strong performances by individual businesses. The company also continued to spend heavily on new products - backed by a 10 per cent increase in marketing expenditure to Pounds 2.3bn. Unilever's overall operating margin declined from 9 per cent to 8.6 per cent. It said the fall was due to currency movements and the impact of exceptional gains on 1990's results. Before exceptionals, operating profit was Pounds 75m higher at constant exchange rates. The year produced a particularly mixed picture in foods, Unilever's largest business, where operating profits were static at Pounds 1.06bn on sales of Pounds 11.9bn (Pounds 11.6bn). Consumer foods performed well, particularly in Europe, where ice-cream sales exceeded 1990's record levels. Prepared meals, sauces and edible fats - particularly European healthy eating ranges - all enjoyed good growth, though tea faced increasingly fierce competition. However, these positive developments were offset by a decline in results from food service and catering supply operations, which were hard-hit by the effects of the Gulf war on travel and the restaurant trade. Though the business recovered in Europe later in the year, it remained depressed in the US by recession. Unilever also said its exports to the Soviet Union suffered from the political and economic upheavals there. The company was, however, steadily expanding its presence in eastern and central Europe, where it expected to make further acquisitions and investments in the coming months. A rapid rate of innovation, notably in concentrated washing powders, helped detergents to increase sales volumes and market share. Operating profit rose to Pounds 374m (Pounds 365m) on sales of Pounds 5.2bn (Pounds 4.98bn), reflecting margin improvements due to cost reductions. Operating profit on personal products fell to Pounds 242m (Pounds 272m) on sales of Pounds 2.82bn (Pounds 2.72bn), reflecting lower duty-free sales of prestige lines and weaker US demand for mass-market products. In contrast, prestige brands such as Ralph Lauren and Elizabeth Arden's top-of-the-range cosmetics had an 'excellent' year, recording double-digit sales increases. Action was under way to improve Elizabeth Arden's efficiency. Sales of Chesebrough-Ponds, Unilever's US subsidiary, also fell 'materially' last year. A management reorganisation was expected to produce increased profits this year. The group said the reorganisation of its European businesses in preparation for the single market was proceeding well. About half the Pounds 195m after-tax charge it had made for European restructuring had been committed, and a total of 60 projects had been identified. Events in the Middle East and the Soviet Union disrupted the speciality chemicals business, which turned in flat profits of Pounds 222m (Pounds 223m) on sales of Pounds 1.79bn (Pounds 1.74bn). Nonetheless, National Starch enjoyed an excellent performance - though Unichema International and Crosfield encountered more difficult conditions. Unilever said it had significantly improved its position in Japan, though it was continuing to make losses there which had been magnified by the strength of the yen. The company said it was determined to remain in 'key Japanese markets' over the long term. The company said its businesses in Chile, Argentina, India and South Africa all enjoyed an 'excellent' year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by Roberto </F> Cavada; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Expressions opposing the U.S. blockade of Cuba  continue to take place in the United States. Yesterday, the  third Friendship Caravan sponsored by Pastors for Peace got  under way. Democrat Congressman Charles Rangel is drafting a  bill to be introduced in the next Congress to counter the  Torricelli Law.    [Begin recording] [Cavada] Minister, there is a bill against  the blockade by Congressmen Charles Rangel. What is your  opinion? Are you aware of what it contains, exactly?    [Robaina] Yes, we are aware. It is another way of  ....[changes thought] From within U.S. society, spokesmen of  that society are realizing the absurdity, unfairness, and  anachronic nature of that measure which not only blockades Cuba  economically, but also blockades Americans -- in a country  calling itself the land of liberty. Americans are blockaded in  travel and investment. It seems to me that it is only fair and  proper, logical and intelligent that representatives of the  American people should be the ones bringing the issue to the  attention of international public opinion.    The fact that congressmen like Rangel are doing this is  simply another step in a road we need many others to travel.  This is why we stress that there is no number one foreign policy  priority other than continuing to condemn the unfairness of the  blockade. This is separate from any conditions set for Cuba. It  is not a question of conditions for Cuba. The blockade is  unfair, independently of whatever Cuba decides to do or not to  do. This is gaining support each day. It has the important  support of a number of countries. The breaches being made in the  blockade within the U.S. society are very interesting. [end  recording]</p>

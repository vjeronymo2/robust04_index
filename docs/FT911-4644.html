			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (13): Why dirty fees are hard to rub out - Managers' Charges IT WAS a bad year for investment managers. As stock markets (and the value of most pension funds) fell in 1990, managers' incomes, based on ad valorem charges, faced a similar decline. Few tried to sustain their income by increasing charges - and fewer still succeeded. Any sympathy should be stifled quickly, though: managers still make extensive use of implicit, or 'dirty', fees to boost their income, and some last year appear to have been able to use these to support their earnings. 'Dirty' fees come in three main forms: charges for in-house unit trusts, levies to meet the higher costs of overseas transactions and soft commissions. The growing use of in-house unit trusts has been the most obvious contributor to investment managers' revenues. True, a greater proportion of pension fund assets may be dedicated to specialist areas list overseas equities or bonds, and true, these investments may be better handled on a pooled basis. But does this justify an annual charge of, say, 1 per cent, rather than the 0.2 per cent typically paid for balanced funds or 0.5 per cent for funds actively managed by a specialist? As Mr Tim Gardener, head of asset planning at Mercer Fraser, says: 'I can see the reason for using unit trusts, but not for the extra charges implicit in them. I fail to see why unit trusts need to charge more.' Whatever the justification, the use of unit trusts is becoming far more common. The second type of 'dirty' fee - transaction fees for overseas bargains - is more easily justified, given the higher costs of settling such a transaction. However, there are signs that here, too, managers may use implicit charges to enhance their own income. There are different ways of levying these overseas transaction charges. Many managers impose a flat charge per bargain (say, Pounds 50). But the method is imprecise, and is not usually matched to a precise analysis of costs. 'Most managers levy more than it costs them,' says Mr Gardener. 'They use these charges as a source of income.' The third type of dirty fee, the use of soft commissions, was sanctioned recently by the Securities and Investments Board - although the SIB said it would keep a close eye on fund managers' behaviour and may yet ban the practice (which involves brokers paying for services for fund managers, such as the provision of computer terminals or information services, in return for a set amount of commission-bearing business each year). 'In the long run, this area will be revisited by the regulators,' says Mr Malcolm Kemp, a partner at Bacon &amp; Woodrow. 'It still has an air of artificiality about it.' The SIB has insisted on minimum levels of disclosure of soft commission arrangements, so trustees should at least be able to see what is going on. But simple disclosure gives no idea of the pressures under which fund managers operate, and which may lead them sometimes not to put their own clients' interests first. Implicit fees like these are estimated to add as much as 0.5 of a percentage point to the costs of pension fund management, compared with the typical 0.2 per cent 'clean' fee. Why do plan sponsors continue to put up with the practice? In part, because it makes their own lives easier, says Mr Gardener. Dirty fees, he explains, are levied on the assets in a fund rather than a plan sponsor. By insisting on clean fees, a sponsor is shifting the direct costs onto himself, and to recover this may reduce contributions into the fund - a route often fraught with political difficulty. The abandoning of dirty fees, long predicted, may be taking a long time coming. Nevertheless, experts report that charging practice is still turning  -albeit slowly - against such habits. Meanwhile, fund managers' incomes are benefiting from the second general trend in investment management charges: the gradual replacement of balanced fund management with index and active fund management. For the fund which splits itself between the specialists, aggregate charges are generally higher than for the one that remains with the balanced fund manager (though this should be outweighed by the greater ability to control a fund's performance). Funds tied to an index frequently find their way into an in-house unit trust. It is cheaper and easier for the manager to index one pool of money of, say, Pounds 1m to an index, rather than five pools of Pounds 200,000. However, the result may be higher charges. Active managers, meanwhile, have largely moved over to the use of performance fees, to the extent that is now thought to be the exception to find an active manager charging a simple flat fee. For this and other reasons, suggests Mr Kemp, overall costs of pension fund investment have crept up slightly over the past year - though nowhere near enough to compensate managers for the loss of income from the stock market slump. Many managers cling to the belief that fee scales are set to rise: but then, as Mr Kemp says, 'many thought that a year ago.'</p>

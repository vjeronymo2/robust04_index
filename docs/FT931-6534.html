			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Observer: Hwang-power Not everyone believes that Battersea power station is God's gift to the London landscape. But Victor Hwang, who has the job of explaining why his Hong Kong family is venturing where even the UK's most hardened property developers fear to tread, insists that he doesn't want to pull it down. The 39-year-old Victor is no stranger to Britain. Along with his other three brothers, he was educated at Lindisfarne College. He says his father chose to send his boys to a minor British public school in north Wales because he wanted to keep them well out of the way of London's Chinese community. However, the Hwangs' arrival on the 31-acre Battersea power station site has caught the attention of not just the London Chinese. What is it that the Hwang boys have spotted that has escaped London's canny property types? Victor remains tight-lipped on his family's plans for London's famous landmark. All he will say is that he probably won't turn the power station into a hotel, because 'it doesn't have any windows'.</p>

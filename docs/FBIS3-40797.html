			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zineb Oubouchou: "Abroad: Algerians Who Have </F> Become Undesirable"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] No matter where they go, Algerians have now become  undesirable. Recently, several countries cracked down on illegal  aliens carrying the green Algerian passport. Tens of arrests  were followed by deportation to Algeria.    This has become so widespread that in the past few days the  border police was overwhelmed by an increasing number of  deported Algerians. In November for instance, 26 Algerians were  deported from France and returned to their native country.  According to French security services, they were in an illegal  situation.    One month later, some 40 natives of the Maghreb were  arrested  and found to possess false identity papers.    French authorities wanted to deport them to Algeria.  However,  our Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to receive them because,  we were told, these individuals' citizenship was not  established. It also seems that 20 of the 40 individuals that  were to be deported to our country either had AIDS or were drug  addicts.    In Germany, over 40 Algerians suffered the same fate.  Fifteen  of them were deported earlier this week. The reason for this  decision was the same as the one given by French authorities,  i.e., they were in an illegal situation.    Even Poland, the ideal country for most black-market  traffickers, is cracking down on Algerians. Contrary to the  other cases we just mentioned, Polish security services did not  bother to check the identity of Algerian tourists.    They just turned back the Air Algeria aircraft when it  landed  in Warsaw, without any explanation, we were told.    Surprised by the new regulation that Belgian Embassy  officials started applying recently, an Algerian assured us that  to obtain a Belgian visa you must pay 165 French francs [Fr].  "As a businessman, I went to the embassy with a letter stating  my mission, that is a perfectly legal recommendation. All the  same, Belgian Embassy officials demanded payment in foreign  currency. Knowing that this is quite illegal, I declined to do  so. Then, they denied me a visa," this man told us.    The most tragic case was that of the 10 or so Algerian  "black-market traffickers" who were arrested by Libyan security  services after going through the Debdeb border post with all  their papers in order. According to these "black-market  traffickers," the Libyan police took them to a police station,  handcuffed and blindfolded. Then, the police confiscated their  identity papers and their passports before releasing them. Some  of the individuals involved testified that the police gave them  back their papers only on condition that they spend on the local  market any foreign currency they owned.    In spite of all these humiliations, the rush to consulates  is  undescribable. The French consulate in Algiers illustrates  rather well this situation. Yesterday, drastic means had to be  used to disperse the huge crowd that had gathered at the main  entrance.    An impressive police contingent was deployed around the  consulate, on Place des Martyrs.    The security of the consulate was ensured by blue minitanks  followed by Nissan vehicles carrying armed "ninjas." At times,  when citizens attempted to cross the line, the police fired  warning shots to frighten the most obstinate.</p>

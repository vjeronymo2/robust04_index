			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Japan's jobless at seven-year peak of 3% Japanese unemployment rose to a seven-year high of 3 per cent in July - nearly 1.9m people - casting a shadow over an already weak economic recovery. The second monthly increase in a row, from 2.9 per cent in June, increases the chances the jobless rate will break through its 1987 record of 3.1 per cent. The job situation will remain 'severe' even if the general economy picks up, warned Mr Kozo Igarashi, chief cabinet secretary. This increases the pressure on the coalition government, led by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, a Socialist, whose chances of lifting its low popularity depend on delivering an economic recovery. Japanese unemployment remains low by comparison with 6.1 per cent in the US, yet any rise provokes a fresh round of public agonising over Japan's ability to uphold the hallowed tradition of job stability. Corporate Japan's drive to cut costs, by shifting production to cheaper locations in south-east Asia and cutting domestic recruitment, are the main features of the increase in jobless. Tokyo economists do not believe the unemployment rate will significantly surpass 3 per cent, yet this latest rise is enough to worry the government. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, minister of international trade and industry, yesterday called for the creation of more temporary posts, helped by fewer official restrictions on personnel agencies. Mr Manso Hamamoto, labour minister, promised to boost efforts to help the jobless back to work. The number out of work rose sharply, by 18.2 per cent over the year to July, to 1.88m. Of those in work, the number of salaried employees fell by 20,000, for the first time in 16 years, a mark of corporate cost cuts. At the same time, the overall labour market has weakened, the main reason for the government's gloom over the outlook. There were only 62 jobs available for every 100 people seeking work in July, the third consecutive monthly decline. This confirms the poor job outlook for the latest batch of university graduates, which accounts for most job seekers. The job seekers' ratio stands at the lowest since January 1987, when the economy was reeling, as now, from a rise in the yen. A further decline in the ratio is expected, Mr Dick Beason, senior economist at James Capel Pacific, says.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Luo Hui (5012 6540)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 29 Mar (XINHUA) -- State Vice President  Rong Yiren met here this morning with visiting Libyan Foreign  Minister 'Umar Mustafa al-Muntasir.    Rong Yiren said: Since China and Libya established  diplomatic relations in 1978, friendly relations and cooperation  in various fields between the two countries have developed  continuously. The two countries share similar views on some  major international issues. They have cooperated well in  international organizations, supporting each other and  coordinating their efforts in handling some issues.    He said: China is ready to make concerted efforts with Libya  to further strengthen friendship and cooperation in all fields.  He expressed the conviction that al-Muntasir's visit would help  further the friendly relations between the two countries.    Al-Muntasir conveyed the regards of Libyan leader Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi to the Chinese Government and people. He said:  Libyan leaders are devoted to strengthening and developing  friendly relations and cooperation with China, hoping that such  relations would be furthered.    Prior to the meeting, Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State  Council and foreign minister, held talks with al-Muntasir. The  two sides exchanged views on bilateral relations and issues of  common concern.    Qian Qichen said: Since they established diplomatic  relations, China and Libya have cooperated effectively in all  fields. China is satisfied with this development and is willing  to continue to develop friendly relations and cooperation with  Libya on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  coexistence.    On the Lockerbie incident, Qian Qichen said: "China has  always been concerned about this issue. China opposes terrorism  of any description and favors the settlement of international  disputes through peaceful means. Consistent with this stand, we  favor the settlement of the Lockerbie crisis through  consultation and negotiation by the parties concerned. We  disapprove of imposing sanctions against Libya, especially of  stepping up sanctions against that country."    He pointed out: Sanctions against Libya have brought  suffering to the Libyan people and caused difficulties for  Libya's neighbors and other countries concerned, thus escalating  the tension in the region. China fully understands and  sympathizes with Libya's plight and does not want to see the  situation worsening.    He said: China appreciates Libya's stand on settling the  Lockerbie incident through peaceful negotiations, as well as the  flexibility it exhibits in this regard. China appeals to the  parties concerned to take measures to prevent the situation from  worsening.    The Chinese Government will make due efforts to this end.    Al-Muntasir praised China for its important role in  establishing a new world order, saying that Libya will  strengthen bilateral relations with China and step up  coordination and cooperation with China in international affairs.    He also briefed Qian Qichen on the latest developments in  the  Lockerbie incident and Libya's stand on the issue, saying that  Libya would resolve the international crisis through negotiation  and peaceful means.    Al-Muntasir arrived in Beijing on 28 March at the invitation  of Qian Qichen.</p>

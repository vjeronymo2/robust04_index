			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Arts: Mahler's Sixth - Concert A weekend at the Barbican framed by illuminating accounts of music from the early years of our century - Friday brought the first UK performance of Rimsky- Korsakov's Kashchey the Immortal (1902) - ended with Mahler's Sixth Symphony (1903-5), given on Sunday by the London Symphony Orchestra under Michael Tilson Thomas. The LSO and its principal conductor embark on a complete cycle of Mahler symphonies in the autumn as part of the orchestra's 90th birthday celebrations, and this concert provided both a tantalising foretaste of that series and a welcome opportunity to hear one of the less frequently performed works. The Sixth Symphony, a cornerstone of modern orchestral music, was once regarded as 'difficult'; no British orchestra played it until 1950. Most of Mahler's symphonies end affirmatively, but the life-and-death struggle of the Sixth ends in catastrophe. With its atmosphere of unreal, almost expressionist fantasy, it is a work one stands back from, and Tilson Thomas was persuasive in drawing the audience in. Tilson Thomas conducted with his characteristic all-out intensity, favouring fast tempos and lush orchestral sound. The performance was unrelenting, but no emotions were lost to speed. The Andante gained in concentration, and brought forth a stream of lustrous playing. The opening march had grim power and bite, the 'Alma' theme could hardly have been more passionate. Indeed, the LSO excelled itself with playing of great beauty and virtuosity. This was a performance that left very few reservations. But although Tilson Thomas caught the heaviness the composer directs in the Scherzo (placed second here), the movement sounded too deliberate. It lost momentum, and consequently some of its horror. Perhaps the Barbican Hall acoustics were to blame, but at every appearance the cowbells clattered intrusively, instead of providing a hazy echo of Alpine slopes. Overall, though, Tilson Thomas welded this gigantic work together impressively. His approach is at once emotional and clear-headed, qualities Mahler conductors require in equal measure.</p>

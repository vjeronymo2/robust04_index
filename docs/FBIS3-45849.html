Daxie Island is located in the northeastern part of Beilun  District, Ningbo city, east China's Zhejiang Province. Around  40 kilometers from downtown Ningbo, it occupies an area of 30.89  square kilometers. The Chinese State Council last March granted  approval to the China International Trust and Investment  Corporation (CITIC) to develop land on Daxie Island and to apply  policies covering economic and technological development zones.    CITIC hosted a briefing on the development of the island  here  this morning with some 60 participants from various foreign  firms and companies in Beijing attending.    Speaking at the briefing, a CITIC official in charge of the  program said that in the first three years between 1994 to 1996,  the island development will be focused on infrastructure  facilities, such as construction of water and electric power  facilities, telecommunications, highways and bridges, so as to  form a better investment environment for future prospects.    According to the official, the development of the island has  become a "melting pot" of various companies in the world. So  far, companies from the United States, Britain, Japan, Italy,  Germany and the Netherlands as well as from Hong Kong, Macao and  Taiwan have been to the island where they discussed possible  cooperation projects with the Chinese side. Some have signed  cooperative contracts and memorandums of understanding with  CITIC.    Wei Fuhai, chairman of the board of CITIC Daxie Company,  said  that the island enjoys geographical advantages, favorable  natural conditions and good surroundings, and its exploitation  is significant to the development of the Shanghai Pudong  Development Zone, the Chang Jiang river delta and the regions  along the river.</p>

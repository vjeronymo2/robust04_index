			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent -- TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev 22 April TASS -- It is incorrect to estimate  prospects of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant only negatively;  calls to halt the plant are unjustified, Chernobyl nuclear power  plant director Sergey Parashin told UKRINFORM on the eve of the  8th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident.    In his words, the "situation around the Chernobyl power  plant  has been excessively politicized and some are trying to use it  for pressure on Ukraine."    Speaking of the recent demands for immediate halt of the  power plant, Parashin said specialists "have done much from 1986  through now to increase the plant's safety and improve all the  parameters of its operation. We have a clear plan of further  measures to the effect and they are been consistently taken."    "Professionals are working at the Chernobyl nuclear power  plant, and all the capacities are normally operated. I am  confident that the current state of the plant is much better  than that of many facilities of other branches," said the plant  director.    The work of plant power units is under constant control over  the state inspection for supervision over nuclear safety and  other state bodies, he stressed. In case of any doubts,  international experts, including those from the International  Atomic Energy Agency, are invited. The situation at the  "shelter" facility (the sarcophagus above the fourth power unit)  is also under reliable control, and it provokes no serious  concern over safety.    The plant director referred to the conclusions of the IAEA  commission outlined in the commission's draft report on results  of its work at the plant in March 1994: "The Chernobyl nuclear  power plant has held all the arrangements scheduled for power  units with RBMK reactors after the Chernobyl accident. The  safety level at the first and third power units is equal to that  of corresponding power units at the Leningrad, Kursk and  Smolensk nuclear power plants.    "Despite the fact many highly-professional plant staffers  have quitted, there are adequate resources for full staffing of  the plant's six shifts to operate two power units. General  impression of the control board personnel is `professionalism'."    Unfortunately, said the director, "these essential  provisions  of the report were not included in the IAEA press release  circulated so widely in mass media bodies."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- At 1000 [0700 GMT] on  24 May, a parliamentary delegation from Supreme Council of  Crimea led by Serhiy Tsekov, parliamentary chairman and a former  people's deputy of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, arrived at  the Supreme Council of Ukraine. According to unofficial  information, a private meeting between Serhiy Tsekov and Borys  Oliynyk, who heads the Ukrainian parliamentary delegation, was  held prior to the beginning of Ukrainian-Crimean parliamentary  negotiations.    Serhiy Holovatyy and Oleksandr Skipalskyy, members of the  Ukrainian delegation, informed a UNIAN correspondent that no  decision on any issue was made as of 1700 [1400 GMT].    Commenting on the current situation, Volodymyr Hrynyov,  cochairman of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms, said that what  the Crimean parliament did demonstrates that the first step  toward Ukraine's federative structure has been taken. He  believes that the only appropriate way out of the situation is  to follow the example of Russia and Tatarstan, which did not  allow the situation to escalate. V. Hrynyov believes that  Ukraine must use that example because, except for a federation,  he can see no other way. "You cannot hide the truth, and that it  had to be this way was clear as long ago as when the previous  Supreme Council passed the law "on delimiting powers between the  state bodies of Ukraine and Crimea."    Volodymyr Hrynyov believes that compromise can cause furious  disagreement in the parliament.    From Simferopol: Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the  Supreme Council of Crimea Praesidium and leader of the People's  Party of Crimea, told a UNIAN correspondent on 24 May that the  Crimean delegation at the negotiations in Kiev intended to press  for strict compliance with the law "on delimiting powers between  Ukraine and Crimea" and, in particular, on the annulment of the  Ukrainian presidential directives on reorganizing the Crimean  Internal Affairs and Justice Ministries and the Security  Service. He said the formation of Crimean authorities was the  prerogative of the Republic of Crimea, as well as on the  obligatory provision for the Crimean side of information on any  Ukrainian troop movements on the territory of the peninsula, and  so on. The Crimean delegation will also demand that the the  office of the Ukrainian presidential representative in Crimea be  disbanded.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Expanding Midland Independent plans to launch four new weeklies MIDLAND Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail, is planning to launch up to four new weekly newspapers in the next 12 months. The new launches, which will at least start as free newspapers, are the latest signs of expansion by the management buy-out team at MIN led by chief executive Mr Chris Oakley. Earlier this year the company bought 20 free weekly newspapers from Thomson Regional Newspapers. The company is also interested in the possibility of a significant newspaper acquisition outside its Midlands regional heartland. The news of further expansion comes as Midland announced a fall in pre-tax profit for the six months to end June from Pounds 3.47m to Pounds 1.92m. The main reason for the drop was a Pounds 1.7m increase in interest charges flowing from the loan stock used in the acquisition of the Thomson titles. Operating profit increased by to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 7.3m) with margins continuing at more than 21 per cent. The acquired titles, which increased the company's reach into the east Midlands, generated profit of Pounds 260,000. A flotation is getting closer for the group bought out from Ingersol Newspapers. It could happen towards the end of next year. No firm target date has been set because of uncertainties such as whether VAT is imposed on newspapers in next month's budget or whether a large acquisition comes along. The Birmingham Post marginally increased its sales in the period while the Mail circulation dropped 3 per cent, the Coventry paper 1.5 per cent and the Mercury 3 per cent - all less than the regional average.</p>

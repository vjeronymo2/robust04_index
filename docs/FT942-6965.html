			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Observer: Out of the can To veterans of the international tin crisis, Bruce Leeming will be a familiar name. The former managing director of Rudolf Wolff, one of the London Metal Exchange brokers much mauled in the tin crisis of the mid-1980s, quit his post in acrimony at the time. Now he is about to burst on to the world in what he hopes will be a controversial new guise. His first published work, An Anger Bequeathed, is due out next week - and pretty steamy stuff it is, too. Billed as 'a novel of lust and high ideals', it tells of Harriot (sic) Murray, a highly competitive and sexually voracious woman seeking revenge for past exploitation by men. Leeming - who has written several unpublished novels, including a libellous thriller about the tin crisis, and copious haiku poetry - drew on family history for his new oeuvre. But he says Harriot is 'wholly imaginary' and insists that she bears no resemblance to anybody at the LME, past or present.</p>

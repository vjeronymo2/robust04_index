			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Philippines candidate drops out ONE OF the eight presidential candidates in the May 11 Philippine elections, Mr Joseph Estrada, has dropped out to become the running mate of another opposition contender, Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, of the Nationalist People's Coalition. Mr Estrada, a member of the Senate who gained popularity as a movie actor, said yesterday he had switched over to Mr Cojuangco's camp 'to help ensure that the next president wins by a majority vote'. Charges of a sellout quickly met Mr Estrada's announcement. He had said earlier in the campaign that one of his opponents had offered him 200m pesos (Pounds 4.65m) to drop his presidential bid. Although admitting that his party had been running low on funds, Mr Estrada yesterday denied there was money involved in what he called 'a joining of forces' between his Partido ng Masang Pilipino and Mr Cojuangco's NPC. Some analysts said Mr Cojuangco's chances may have improved with the new alliance. In many pre-campaign surveys, Mr Estrada was among the leading names in terms of popularity, but his position has been eroded in recent weeks. Mrs Imelda Marcos said yesterday that the body of her husband, former President Ferdinand Marcos, would be brought to his home province in the Philippines from Hawaii next week for burial, AP adds.</p>

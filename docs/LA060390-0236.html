			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER OR TYRANT?;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: EVEN AS HE RETIRES AFTER 28 YEARS, JOURNALISM PROFESSOR MELVIN  MENCHER'S TOUGH CLASSROOM TACTICS STILL SHARPLY DIVIDE HIS STUDENTS AND  COLLEAGUES.  </P> <P> It was the first day of classes at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism  in 1971, and a group of 150 aspiring reporters listened eagerly as one teacher  after another welcomed them with open arms to New York City.  </P> <P> They expected more of the same when the last faculty member rose to speak. He  was barely five feet tall, wore a rumpled black turtleneck and seemed friendly  enough. But Melvin Mencher was not about to make them feel at home.  </P> <P> "It's amazing how much power all of you people will have in five years or so,"  he said in a flat, nasal voice, his steel-blue eyes sweeping the room. "It's  also amazing to realize that 90% of you aren't worth a damn."  </P> <P> There was stunned silence, and some faculty members shook their heads. All eyes  focused on Mencher, who began stroking his black beard and seemed to be  enjoying himself immensely.  </P> <P> "Nobody's going to like my class," he warned. "You'll be miserable. But maybe  you'll learn something."  </P> <P> Then, as now, Mencher was true to his word. For 28 years, until his retirement  this month, he ruled the roost at one of America's most prestigious graduate  schools of journalism. Like a drill sergeant, he pummeled his students into  submission and turned some of them into first-class reporters. He was petty,  abrasive, cranky, chauvinistic -- and brilliant.  </P> <P> Call it the "Paper Chase" of journalism -- except Mencher was tougher and  infinitely more cutting than the fictional Prof. Charles Kingsfield of the  Harvard Law School.  </P> <P> "This man has been a very important figure in our business because he's the  kind of teacher you never, ever forget," said Newsweek Editor Maynard Parker,  who studied under Mencher in 1963. "I remember him as a hard-driving,  meticulous man who never let up on his students. He was tough. And his greatest  contribution is that he has gotten people started in careers that really amount  to something in this business."  </P> <P> More important, Mencher was a voice of conscience in American journalism,  demanding that his students live up to the highest standards.  </P> <P> "To be anything less than excellent in your craft is immoral," he used to say.  "Our job is to elevate the standards of this profession. We deserve better role  models, because newspapers shouldn't be glamorous bulletin boards, and TV  stations that just cover fires and murders are unconscionable."  </P> <P> But now, it's all coming to an end. After decades of bitter, unceasing battles  with school administrators, Mencher is reluctantly stepping down, and the  fireworks generated by his long academic career will subside. The 63-year-old  professor says he will go bird watching in Canada, a lifelong passion, and  ponder his next career move.  </P> <P> It isn't the first time he has left a job under disagreeable circumstances.  </P> <P> Years ago, Mencher was forced out of posts at the Fresno Bee and the University  of Kansas because of his penchant for boat-rocking journalistic crusades. He's  used to the old heave-ho. Yet leaving Columbia was the toughest decision he's  ever made.  </P> <P> "I've never been able to play it safe," Mencher said softly as he cleaned out a  darkened office crammed with almost three decades of students' papers, memos,  photographs, letters, books and yellowed newspaper clippings.  </P> <P> "But what the hell. You're not supposed to do that in this business. I guess I  just began to run out of gas. You can't go on forever."  </P> <P> Except, perhaps, in the minds of students. The legacy of Mencher's iron hand  lives on for hundreds of graduates, who insist that his voice and the values he  imparted still speak to them today.  </P> <P> His classes were the intellectual equivalent of boot camp -- a nine-month  odyssey in which students were tested, prodded, humiliated and pushed to their  limits. Months later, when it was over, graduates loved him or hated him.  </P> <P> "This guy instilled in you the feeling that there was a moral purpose to what  you did in journalism, that all of this really matters," said Jayne Garrison, a  former student and now a reporter covering AIDS for the San Francisco Examiner.  "That's something I've never forgotten."  </P> <P> The lessons also ring out in the pages of "News Reporting and Writing," a  textbook written by Mencher and used by instructors nationwide. It reflects his  years of teaching and experience as a reporter in California and New Mexico.  </P> <P> Taking the long view, Tim Wiener, a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winner who works  for the Philadelphia Inquirer, said his former professor is part of an  important journalistic tradition and more than just a colorful curmudgeon.  </P> <P> "I think there's a direct line running from muckrakers like Lincoln Steffens,  through I. F. Stone and Mencher, down to us. This guy kicked my butt and made  me feel stupid, but he eventually helped light a fire in my belly that's still  there. He changed my life."  </P> <P> Today, there are more than 1,000 so-called Mencherites in newsrooms across  America. They work at such papers as the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times,  the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Newsday, the Miami Herald and the  Seattle Times; some are broadcast reporters, producers or anchors, while others  are successful authors.  </P> <P> "We're all over the place," said Lena Sun, a Beijing correspondent for the  Washington Post. "And a lot of it's because of this teacher. Just thinking  about him now makes me want to go out and do the right thing."  </P> <P> To Mencher's critics -- and there are many -- that's laughable. He alienated  faculty members with abrasive complaints about academic policies, and more than  a few Columbia colleagues applaud his departure. They cite his inability to  work with others, a tendency to whine for no reason and a supercilious attitude  that drove many of them up the wall.  </P> <P> "You shouldn't treat people the way he did," said one former instructor, who  asked not to be identified. "He was hard on women -- too hard, actually -- and  Columbia is better off with him gone.  </P> <P> Cynthia Hunter, a former student who is now an editor with Sunset magazine in  Los Angeles, said she spent three years recovering from Mencher's class: "He  made me feel terrible as a human being, as a woman, and told me a number of  times that I had no future in the field. But I've won several (journalism)  awards out here, and I'm doing well. I must be doing something right, and  whatever it is, it's certainly not because of him."  </P> <P> Even his admirers say Mencher's methods may have been too extreme. Tom  Goldstein, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley, favors a  blend of nurturing and toughness. "You have to know when to let up," he said.  The boot camp approach, he says, works for some people, but not for others.  </P> <P> To be sure, Mencher's class was not for the faint of heart. He had little  patience with students' notions of what was important, at least initially, and  took an almost bizarre delight in turning their expectations upside down.  </P> <P> Was a history major from Southern California interested in covering suburban  issues? Mencher ordered him to visit the South Bronx for a story on gang  violence and bring back a detailed story. Now.  </P> <P> Was a young woman from Yale curious about the classical music scene? Mencher  told her to visit Times Square, mingle with pimps and prostitutes, and come  back that night with a story on the underside of city life.  </P> <P> The streets were easy compared to his class exercises. In long morning drills,  students covered mock utility rate hearings, budget deliberations and  hypothetical crime stories. The worst part came when he collected the  assignments, flashed them on an overhead projector and tore them apart.  </P> <P> "At the time it seemed unnecessary, but Mencher was trying to prepare you for  the real world, where it's very competitive, very tough and generally not  compassionate," said Richard Bonin, now a producer for "60 Minutes."  </P> <P> On occasion, he could be cruel. Days after Beth Nissen broke up with her fiance  in 1976, Mencher decided to dismember one of her stories in front of the class.  It was a harsh performance, climaxed by the comment that she was "idea-free."  </P> <P> The professor then flipped a dime in the air and told Nissen to call her  fiance, saying she might be a good wife some day but would never be a good  journalist.  </P> <P> Nissen, now an ABC-TV network correspondent, rushed out of the room and burst  into tears. On the way out, she said bitterly to Mencher: "I may never be a  journalist, but you'll always be short."  </P> <P> Is she angry after all these years? "Today I see the wisdom behind the  cruelty," Nissen said. "He was basically saying that if we could survive his  class, we could survive anything. And he was right. He really did us all a  favor."  </P> <P> In his defense, Mencher said he was only trying to give students a dose of  reality. Somebody had to warn them that it was a tough world out there.  </P> <P> "Of course, people could say it's really psychological, that (I've) got a  Napoleonic complex. But our students became the editors, the editorial writers,  the managing editors. We had a terrific responsibility," he said.  </P> <P> The pressure was unrelenting. Yet Mencher also had a grudgingly compassionate  side. Insisting that his students enjoy New York culture, he handed out free  opera tickets. When one student seemed too tightly wound, he ordered her to  calm down and listen to piano sonatas in his office. On Thanksgiving, he  invited his class to dinner.  </P> <P> "You didn't have to be the next Bob Woodward to have turkey with Mencher," said  former student Jim Dwyer, now a columnist with New York Newsday. "It was a  chance to forget the times when he was so hard."  </P> <P> Many of Mencher's disciples can still recite his one-line maxims, which were  published in a book, "The Sayings of Chairman Mel." They include such pearls  as: "Keep your eye on the lead," "You can't write if you can't think" and  "Never submit the bare, hack minimum on a story."  </P> <P> Above all, there was his chief admonition: Journalists have a moral obligation  to tell the truth and expose hypocrisy.  </P> <P> For some, the message got through. David McClintick, author of "Indecent  Exposure" and other books, said his teacher imparted "a new level of  excellence, a new energy, a new unwillingness to settle for second best."  </P> <P> But school administrators saw it differently.  </P> <P> The events leading to Mencher's retirement came to a head in recent years, amid  a heated debate over the future of journalism education. Although the issue is  unresolved, Mencher came out on the losing end at Columbia.  </P> <P> In a nutshell, Mencher and other instructors believe journalism education  should be just that -- a tough, unsparing professional preparation. Over 28  years, he hammered away at the basics of reporting and writing.  </P> <P> But other experts object to what they call "the trade school" approach. They  believe students must be exposed to new trends in communications, and that  teachers should be encouraged to pursue research as do their counterparts in  other academic disciplines.  </P> <P> In truth, the two schools are not the opposites they seem to be. Mencher's  courses have always included readings on the history, literature and ethical  quandaries of journalism, and hardly any of the new-style media mavens want to  abolish traditional training.  </P> <P> However, the outspoken professor failed to reverse the tide at Columbia. New  administrators codified the curriculum over his angry protests and were  irritated by his unceasing complaints. Exhausted by years of such wrangling,  Mencher opted for early retirement.  </P> <P> Asked if the school will miss Mencher, Dean Joan Konner chose her words  carefully. The two have clashed bitterly since she took over in 1988.  </P> <P> "I think time marches on," Konner said. "Mel will be replaced by somebody very  good."  </P> <P> Is it a loss for students?  </P> <P> "It's not a loss to the school to move on into the future and to have new ideas  coming in. I don't think he (Mencher) had his head turned toward the  possibility of a positive future. I think he'd just had it," she said.  </P> <P> To others, the idea that Mencher will no longer be prowling the halls at  Columbia is inconceivable. They fear his retirement symbolizes the end of an  era and a disturbing new trend in American journalism.  </P> <P> "Mencher is a character, an American original," said Fred Kempe, a former  student who is now Berlin bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal and author  of "Divorcing the Dictator," a book about Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega.  "It's a tragic thing that he's leaving, because a whole tradition may just  disappear. And he's been very much a part of that tradition."  </P> <P> Born in 1927, Mencher was a child of the Depression who knew the value of a  steady job. The son of a stockbroker, he was very young when his mother died.  He attended high school in Manhattan and studied mathematics at the  Universities of Colorado and New Mexico but decided journalism was a good bet.  </P> <P> Early on, Mencher had shown a flair for writing. More important, there were  plenty of opportunities. His first job, at the Albuquerque Tribune in 1947,  paid $35 a week. He later hooked up with United Press in Santa Fe to cover the  state capital. As a free-lancer for the Christian Science Monitor, he delved  into political corruption and got his first taste of investigative reporting.  </P> <P> "I learned very early in the game to follow the buck," he said. "The highway  department, for example, had more federal money than many other departments,  and it was a huge cesspool. I saw how highway bids were rigged, and that people  could die because of shoddy construction."  </P> <P> Soon, Mencher began ruffling feathers with stories about infant mortality rates  on Navajo Indian Reservations. On the basis of that work, he won a 1952 Nieman  Fellowship at Harvard. At 25, he was one of the youngest people to win the  prestigious scholarship.  </P> <P> By now, Mencher was married and wanted to move to California. He took a job at  the Fresno Bee and earned a reputation for unorthodox, hard-nosed reporting.  With other journalists, he investigated the links between local politicians and  the operators of exclusive brothels. The work was satisfying, but it got him  into hot water with city officials and his editors.  </P> <P> "I don't think they understood that kind of journalism (because) you got a  controversy," Mencher said. "I was getting tired and my position was untenable.  I had to walk away. For some reason, I've always left jobs under a cloud of  anxiety and animosity."  </P> <P> His next stop was the University of Kansas at Lawrence in 1958, where he became  a journalism teacher. As the faculty adviser to student journalists, Mencher  supervised coverage of racism in university housing and other controversial  stories. The articles won an award from the National Conference of Christians  and Jews, but Mencher angered campus officials and again was forced to leave.  </P> <P> The wandering came to a halt in 1962, when Mencher accepted a post at the  Columbia School of Journalism. He and his wife, with whom he had three  children, settled into a comfortable life on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Soon,  he began a radical reshaping of the school's curriculum.  </P> <P> In the early '60s, most journalism professors gave students canned exercises  and they rarely left the classroom. Led by Mencher and other influential  professors, Columbia students were suddenly exploring every nook and cranny of  New York. They covered courts, murders, welfare demonstrations, anti-war  protests and other breaking stories.  </P> <P> In retrospect, Mencher said, the task of preparing them has been an uphill  struggle.  </P> <P> "Educational standards in this country are terrible today. I've had students on  the graduate level who can't add. Who don't know a budget from a balloon. Who  couldn't figure out a percentage.  </P> <P> "It's important for them to know what it's like to look a politician in the eye  and say, 'Tell me the truth.' It's important that they know what it's like to  have their work torn apart by an editor. If I can't do that, I have to wonder  if I've had any impact at all in 28 years."  </P> <P> Those doubts were erased two weeks ago when former students held an emotional  farewell party for Mencher at Columbia.  </P> <P> Nissen retold the anecdote about him flipping the coin and added, "he was too  cheap to even give me the dime." Kempe, a Mormon from Salt Lake City, broke up  the crowd when he recalled that Mencher's first assignment steered him  unwittingly into a gay cowboy bar, where a man tried to pick him up.  </P> <P> Some students thanked the professor for pushing them as hard as he did, and a  few seemed to be on the verge of tears. Others made sure they had his new  address and promised to send copies of their work. When Mencher made brief  remarks at the end of the evening, there was long, sustained applause.  </P> <P> Several days later, he began cleaning out his office and rummaging through  thousands of files. It was an emotionally unpleasant task and seemed to affect  him deeply. Asked if he felt badly that his students had reaped all the glory  while he remained in the background, Mencher cracked that he "could have been a  contender," then brushed off the question.  </P> <P> "I've taught probably 1,000 students and so I have 1,000 agents out there. Not  only did I help them, but they're in positions of power to do good, to do the  right thing. It's vicarious, but what an ego builder."  </P> <P> For a second, he was the old Mencher, firing off tough one-liners and telling  jokes about incompetent students. Then he slumped a little in his chair,  looking small and vulnerable. As if a mask was about to be torn away.  </P> <P> "I think I've become colder over the years than I should be, because I know I  was very moved by that reception in my honor," he said. "If you're a reporter,  you learn to mask emotions, which is a terrible thing, very hard.  </P> <P> "Those people the other night were telling me that I did something good. And  who wants to be told that? I could hardly hold back crying. It was awful.  Imagine, a man crying in public."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Grand Front [FG] and Socialist Unity [US] blocs  carried out their threat to walk out of the Constituent Assembly  session as the regulations, specifically Article 129, were being  voted on, and [FG leader] Fernando Solanas resigned his post as  Constituent Assembly second vice president. Thus, the FG and US  blocs expressed their repudiation of the approval of an article  in the regulations indicating that the Nucleus of Basic  Agreements must be voted on as a whole and not point by point,  as repeatedly requested by the opposition.    The provincial parties and Movement for Dignity and  Independence blocs, which also are challenging the regulations  proposed by the majority, decided to remain in the Constituent  Assembly meeting and vote against the regulations.</p>

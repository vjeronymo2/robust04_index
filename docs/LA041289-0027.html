			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Officials in Stockholm expelled Liza Minnelli's dog from Sweden Tuesday, saying  she smuggled it into the country in violation of quarantine laws while on tour  with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. Minnelli took the shaggy Scottish  terrier, Lilly, into Sweden aboard a car ferry from Denmark and the pet was  discovered at Minnelli's hotel in Stockholm on Monday night. Two customs  officials arrived to seize the dog, but Minnelli refused to hand over Lilly and  threatened to cancel her show Tuesday night with Sinatra and Davis. The  officials guarded her room all night until Minnelli agreed to fly the dog out  of the country with one of her assistants Tuesday morning. To keep Sweden free  from rabies, a dog has to spend four months in quarantine before it is allowed  in the country.ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NUMBERS DON'T LIE: AZTECS FACING TROUBLE AT AIR FORCE TODAY  </P> <P> The numbers, once simply depressing, are becoming staggering for the San Diego  State men's basketball team.  </P> <P> The Aztecs have lost six of the past seven games and six of the past seven road  games. They have lost 22 of the past 23 Western Athletic Conference road games,  and are 0-4 on WAC trips this season.  </P> <P> And today, at noon, they play at Air Force in Colorado Springs.  </P> <P> That's the same Air Force team SDSU defeated, 64-61, in the San Diego Sports  Arena on Jan. 7. But it's also the same Air Force team that now has won four in  a row -- including three on the road. To say the Falcons are playing their best  of the season would be, in the words of Coach Reggie Minton, "a fair  appraisal."  </P> <P> Said Minton: "Anytime you win three consecutive WAC road games, chances are  you're playing pretty good. We've been playing very well as of late. Actually,  we've played pretty well and worked hard throughout the year, but we're just  now getting some breaks."  </P> <P> The Air Force offense is designed to get the ball into the hands of 6-foot  junior guard Raymond Dudley, who scored 31 points in an 86-79 victory over  Hawaii earlier this week. Dudley is fourth in the nation in scoring at 27  points a game.  </P> <P> "He's a rare talent," Minton said. "He's one of the premier players in our  league."  </P> <P> Minton felt his team had a letdown in the final 7 minutes of the first half in  its first game against SDSU this season.  </P> <P> "We didn't have patience or execute in those 7 minutes," Minton said. "From  that point on, we were chasing them and not in our rhythm."  </P> <P> SDSU hasn't had much rhythm in a month. Since the Jan. 7 victory over Air  Force, the Aztecs have won once -- 69-61 Monday over Wyoming.  </P> <P> But Thursday's 67-47 loss to Colorado State -- a team SDSU had beaten earlier  this season, 62-57 -- was the low point of the season.  </P> <P> The Aztecs shot just 41% (19 of 46) from the floor and 39% (5 of 13) from the  free throw line in their worst defeat of the year.  </P> <P> SDSU center Mitch McMullen, who leads the team with 14.7 points a game and 7.8  rebounds, was limited to just 15 minutes against CSU because of a sore left  Achilles tendon.  </P> <P> Said Minton: "I respect every team in this league, and any team Jim Brandenburg  coaches will be well-prepared and come out and play hard."  </P></p>

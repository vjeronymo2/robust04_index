			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Concern was expressed in business circles today over  the effects which the political situation in the country could  have on the economy. The South African Chamber of Business  [SACOB], which has been playing a mediating role behind the  scenes, has called on politicians to do everything possible on  the eve of the parliamentary session to involve all political  parties in the election. Chamber President Mr. Frederick Savage  said in an open letter to politicians that SACOB supports strong  regional government and has been encouraged by progress made in  this direction. He said international mediation must be  seriously considered if a settlement cannot be achieved.    Organization of African Unity [OAU] Secretary General Dr.  Salim Ahmed Salim also played a mediating role in talks today  with leaders of the African National Congress [ANC], the  Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC], and the Afrikaner Volksfront  [National Front, AVF].    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Ronel van Zyl] Since his  arrival in South Africa yesterday Dr. Salim has been saying that  everything possible must be done to persuade all parties to  participate in the election. The whole continent's eyes are  focused on South Africa. ANC President Nelson Mandela told Dr.  Salim in Johannesburg that threats by the right wing over the  election must not be underestimated. He added that negotiations  will continue in an attempt to find a solution and allay their  fears. In Dr. Salim's meeting with the PAC later, the  organization's mediation role came up for discussion.    [Salim, in English] I've encouraged the PAC to do what they  can towards the participation of all the political forces in the  country, in the democratic elections.    [Van Zyl] PAC Deputy President Mr. Johnson Mlambo confirmed  that his organization has held several meetings with the Inkatha  Freedom Party.    [Mlambo, in English] Our efforts are continuing on that  front, to try and get them and all other parties involved in the  process.    [Van Zyl] A follow-up meeting will probably take place later  this week. Before his departture, Dr. Salim signed a  condolences book for the late APLA [Azanian People's Liberation  Army -- PAC military wing] Commander Sabelo Phama. In Pretoria  this evening Dr. Salim held discussions with AVF leader General  Constand Viljoen and other members of the front. Dr. Salim  conveyed to General Viljoen the OAU's stance on the latest  developments in the contry. In turn, General Viljoen gave the  reasons why the front has not yet committed itself to  participation in the April election. He then explained to Dr.  Salim the right-wing Afrikaners' demand for a homeland.    [Viljoen, in English] We will have a homeland, and in the  homeland we will be part of Africa. We'll be a very valuable  partner of the new South Africa, if the Afrikaners can settle  down and be peaceful in their own homeland.    [Salim, in English] I think that the Afrikaner people in  this  country can play a very significant contribution with in the  context of a united South Africa. We feel very strongly on the  question of unity of this country. We believe all the ethnic  groups and all the people of all colors, of all creeds, can be  accomodated in South Africa.

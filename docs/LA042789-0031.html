			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUPTURE OF AORTA CALLED A RESULT OF EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO CRITICAL VESSEL  </P> <P> Reports of Lucille Ball's death came as a shock to many, because she appeared  to be making a good recovery after undergoing emergency open-heart surgery last  week to replace part of her damaged aorta and her aortic valve.  </P> <P> But her heart surgeons said Wednesday that the sudden rupture of her weakened  abdominal aorta was a recognized and largely unpreventable consequence of  extensive damage to the critical blood vessel, not all of which could be fixed  with surgery.  </P> <P> The actress bled to death after the rupture of the aorta, the main blood vessel  carrying blood from the heart to the rest of the body, according to the  surgeons, Dr. Robert Kass and Dr. Aurelio Chaux.  </P> <P> The aortic blow-out "did not happen because anybody failed to do something,"  Chaux said at a crowded press conference Wednesday evening. "We both were  shocked and surprised, because of the fact she was doing so well. But this was  not totally unexpected."  </P> <P> Cardiac surgeons have learned that severely ill patients, such as Miss Ball,  have a greater chance of surviving after extensive aortic damage if doctors  concentrate on repairing key parts of the aorta. If the surgeons had tried to  replace the entire aorta, the operation itself would have been far too risky  and complicated.  </P> <P> Even with optimal medical care, Miss Ball had "a highly fatal disease," one  heart surgeon said. "These are big, dangerous operations."  </P> <P> A ruptured abdominal aorta "is not an uncommon mode of death for people with  this condition," said another surgeon, Dr. Gregory Kay of the Hospital of the  Good Samaritan in Los Angeles. "There is not a lot you can do about that."  </P> <P> The 77-year-old actress became ill with severe chest pain and other apparent  heart attack symptoms April 18. Her husband, Gary Morton, rushed her to  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.  </P> <P> Physicians quickly performed tests, including an electrocardiogram and a  coronary arteriogram, an X-ray study of the inside of the heart and blood  vessels.  </P> <P> They diagnosed an "aortic dissection." In this condition, the wall of the aorta  tears, allowing blood to flow into false passages between the three layers of  the blood vessel's wall. It is usually caused by a combination of longstanding  high blood pressure and a weakness in the wall of the aorta, which may be  related to the fat-like deposits known as atherosclerosis.  </P> <P> Like many aortic dissections, Miss Ball's appeared to have started in the first  part of the aorta, near the heart, and rapidly extended throughout the aorta --  from the chest cavity to the abdomen. "Her whole aorta was dissected from her  heart into the abdomen, which is 12 to 15 inches at least," Kass said.  </P> <P> During 6 1/2 hours of emergency surgery, Kass and Chaux, who said they have  performed similar surgery hundreds of times, replaced a five-inch segment of  the first part of Miss Ball's aorta and the damaged aortic valve. This was to  prevent virtually certain death from bleeding, from a heart attack or from a  further tear of the part of the aorta where the dissection began.  </P> <P> The surgeons apparently hoped that further damage to the parts of the aorta  that could not be repaired could be prevented with medical therapy, such as  blood pressure medications. The goal was to give the fragile aortic wall time  to heal.  </P> <P> For about a week, Miss Ball appeared to be progressing as well as could be  hoped. There were no indications that anything was about to happen.  </P> <P> "She was sitting, eating and even getting to walk a bit," said Cedars-Sinai  spokesman Ron Wise. Her spirits were "good."  </P> <P> But early Wednesday morning, disaster struck.  </P> <P> Miss Ball, who had been sleeping, complained of back pain and "lost  consciousness at that moment," Kass said.  </P> <P> Within minutes, Miss Ball's heart stopped beating -- apparently because of the  sudden loss of blood into her abdominal cavity.  </P> <P> "The (heart) monitors and the private duty nurse instantly recognized that  something catastrophic was happening," Wise said.  </P> <P> Physicians and nurses worked to resuscitate Miss Ball for 47 minutes before  pronouncing her dead at 5:47 a.m.  </P> <P> "She basically had no more blood to pump around," Kass said. "Even if she had  been in the operating room at the time it occurred, we would not have been able  to save her."  </P> <P> </P> <P> AORTIC RUPTURE  </P> <P> On April 18, Lucille Ball had an aortic dissection, a condition in which the  main artery supplying blood from the heart to the rest of the body suddenly  tears and blood flows into the vessel wall. Surgeons repaired key parts of the  damage -- the aortic valve and the ascending aorta -- but were unable to fix  all of it. The actress died after a rupture of the abdominal aorta, part of the  damaged blood vessel that could not be repaired.  </P></p>

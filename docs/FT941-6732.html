			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Serbs still believe they hold winning cards: Belgrade hopes to exploit Russia's intervention in complex moves for peace settlement Russia's entry into Bosnian peace moves has boosted the confidence of Serb leaders, who believe they can shape the map, not only of Bosnia, but of all former Yugoslavia. President Slobodan Milosevic, who emerged almost triumphant from recent confrontation with Nato over Sarajevo, was silent in the immediate aftermath of the shooting down of aircraft over Bosnia yesterday. But he is using Serb forces in a way that shows he is convinced Serbia still holds the key. Serb officials believe Belgrade has seized control, via Moscow, of the political agenda for helping to end the war. Over the past week, Serbian media found every opportunity to praise President Boris Yeltsin, formerly dubbed 'an enemy of the Serbian people and the Orthodox world'. After supporting Mr Yeltsin's proposal for a 'great powers' summit on Bosnia, Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, Serbian foreign minister, even accused the west of 'being more interested in blocking the Russian initiative than in putting forward an alternate plan'. In this vein, Serb officials believe the US is pursuing its own agenda, seeking to restore the Croatian-Moslem alliance so as to provide a balance of military power in Bosnia. This could isolate the Serbs and force them to make concessions but the gamble could backfire. 'Serbia cannot be excluded from any peace agreement,' a UN diplomat said. The US plan would undermine the alliance cultivated in secret between Zagreb and Belgrade, aimed at dividing Bosnia at the expense of the Moslems. With Croatia and Serbia about to normalise relations, there is one outstanding issue: the status of Serb-held territory in Croatia, frozen under United Nations supervision. According to senior Croatian officials, Washington has promised to guarantee return of those territories to Zagreb in exchange for Croatian backing of the US peace plan. But in a threatening broadcast, Belgrade radio on Sunday warned that the US moves could not only provoke clashes in Bosnia but lead to renewed fighting in Croatia between Serbs and Croats. Mr Jovanovic yesterday called it a 'bellicose plan', warning Zagreb to side with Belgrade despite US pressure. These statements reflect Mr Milosevic's belief he can derail the US initiative and weaken his adversaries. Recent events support this view: While Serb forces waged an offensive against the Bihac enclave in north-west Bosnia, Bosnian Serb leaders last week in Belgrade signed a defence pact with Mr Fikret Abdic. He is the renegade Moslem chief from the Bihac region who is a fierce opponent of Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. There has been a stand-off between Serb forces and UN troops at a bridge over the River Sava linking Serb-held territories in Croatia and Bosnia - to warn Zagreb that local Serbs, under control of Belgrade, could make trouble. Serb forces in the Dalmatian hinterland are poised again to destroy the strategic Maslenica bridge, which is now operating. The bridge joins northern Croatia with its southern Adriatic coasts. While sceptical about prospects for a Croat-Moslem alliance, Belgrade fears the US will use the alliance to exert pressure on Bosnian Serbs to give up more land. This could include ceding access to the northern River Sava, which would effectively sever the east-west corridor linking Serbia with other Serb-held territory in western Bosnian and Croatia. 'This would result in a new round of fighting in northern Bosnia. The Moslems would probably join with the Croats to cut the corridor. The Serbs would fight against this tooth and nail,' argues Mr Predrag Simic, head of the Institute for International Politics and Economy in Belgrade. But Mr Milosevic is aware that if the war continues, the Serbs may lose their considerable advantage over the Moslems and Croats. More war would prolong Serbia's isolation. UN sanctions, imposed 21 months ago for Belgrade's role in the violent partition of Bosnia, would remain in force without a peace agreement. But there is little doubt among Serbs that Serb-held land in Bosnia will soon unite with Serbia proper. The question that Belgrade wants to resolve is the future dimensions of Greater Serbia. While watching what role the US plays, Serbian leaders are already confident the balance of forces now involved in the peace talks has fundamentally changed. 'Russia and the US are playing an old fashioned game called the cold war, with Bosnia as a magnet,' says Mr Simic. While the Serb leadership awaits Moscow's next move, the Serbs believe Russia will defend them.</p>

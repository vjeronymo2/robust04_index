			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA also addressed the issue of whether any limited exclusions should be provided from section 210's labeling requirements. The agency stated that it was considering whether manufacturers of vehicles with low U.S./Canadian content should be permitted to identify the amount of such content as ``minimal'' instead of being required to calculate a specific percentage. The agency also indicated that it was considering excluding multi-stage and low volume manufacturers from the requirement to provide the first two items of information on the label, i.e., the two items which must be calculated on a carline basis. NHTSA stated that, as part of considering whether any limited exclusions should be provided, the agency was in the process of evaluating its authority to provide such exclusions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA also proposed to require manufacturers to report certain content information to the agency, and to require manufacturers and suppliers to maintain records of the information underlying the information provided on the content label. The agency proposed to require dealers to maintain the content label on each vehicle until the vehicle is sold to a consumer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency received about 80 comments on the NPRM, including ones from vehicle manufacturers, suppliers, automotive trade associations, and private citizens. A brief, representative summary of the major comments follows. A more specific discussion of representative comments, and the agency's responses, are set forth later in this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), representing General Motors (GM), Ford and Chrysler, expressed concern about the timing of the final regulation. That organization stated that the proposed regulation will require extensive data collection and calculation requirements, and that there are several areas of uncertainty that will not be resolved until a final rule is issued. AAMA stated that it has been working in conjunction with the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) and a number of suppliers to establish processes to comply with the law, but has been unable to complete this activity because of uncertainties about the final rule. AAMA stated that manufacturers and suppliers will not be able to comply with all the data collection and calculation requirements by the October 1994 implementation date. It requested NHTSA to allow manufacturers and suppliers to use procedures that are expected to yield similar results for at least 12 months after the final rule is published. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to expressing its concern about timing, AAMA urged the agency to make numerous changes in the proposed regulation. On the subject of the wording of the label, that organization objected to describing the first item of information as ``U.S./Canadian Parts Content.'' AAMA argued that the statute specifies use of the term ``U.S./Canadian Content,'' and that the inclusion of the word ``parts'' is contrary to the statute. That commenter also recommended against including an explanatory note concerning the percentage of a typical vehicle's wholesale cost to the dealer that is attributable to parts content. AAMA stated that such a note would be confusing to the consumer and could be misleading because of the broad range of ratios that exist for vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA also recommended a number of changes with respect to the proposed procedures for calculating the information on the label. One of the recommendations concerned which operations should be considered part of final assembly. That organization stated that under NHTSA's proposal, the painted body and chassis would be considered a substrate to which passenger motor vehicle equipment is attached to produce a finished vehicle. AAMA stated that this approach is contrary to the generally accepted definition of the passenger motor vehicle equipment assembly process. That organization agreed, however, that the production of certain equipment at the final assembly point should not be considered part of final assembly but should instead be included in the valuation of the motor vehicle equipment and content calculations. AAMA recommended that the agency define ``final assembly'' to include all operations involved in the assembly of the vehicle performed at the final assembly point, including but not limited to assembly of body panels, painting, final chassis assembly, and trim installation, except engine and transmission fabrication and assembly and the fabrication of motor vehicle equipment components produced at the same final assembly point using stamping, machining or molding processes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA also recommended numerous other changes related to such things as how the value of passenger motor vehicle equipment is determined, how the engine and transmission countries of origin are determined, the responsibilities of suppliers, how values in the currency of one country should be converted into values in the currency of another country, the time when the label must be attached to the vehicle, and what requirements are appropriate with respect to maintenance of records and reporting content information to the agency. On the subject of supplier requirements, AAMA stated that the proposal would require that suppliers report on all parts supplied to a manufacturer or allied supplier regardless of value of the item of equipment or the country of manufacture. That organization recommended that the reporting requirement be limited to providing content data on those items of equipment for which such data was requested by the manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the subject of how vehicle models that are assembled in both the U.S./Canada and other countries should be treated, AAMA stated that the statute contains a sufficient definition of ``carline'' and that additional information should not be provided on the label to indicate that a carline is produced in more than one country. That organization stated that separate content calculations, one set for each assembly country and the entire carline, would cause unnecessary burdens and confuse the consumer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the subject of possible exclusions, AAMA supported a limited exclusion for vehicles with low U.S./Canadian parts content, albeit at a lower content level from that discussed in the NPRM. AAMA also stated that since the agency ``has implied'' that it has the authority to set a minimal level for the U.S. and Canadian content which removes a recordkeeping burden on the low end of content, it urged that such relief also be provided for the high end of content. That organization recommended that, for carlines with more than 85 percent U.S./Canadian content, manufacturers be permitted to specify the content as ``at least'' 85 percent instead of stating a specific percentage. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Failed bank monitored for several months THE BANK of England closely monitored Roxburghe Bank for several months before it went into administration on Wednesday, it has emerged. Administrators are examining the operation of the business, including its unusually high volume of deposits from overseas and the uncertainty about the level of provisions required against bad loans. The directors of Roxburghe, which was based in Mayfair in London, decided on Tuesday to apply to the High Court for an administration order under UK insolvency law. Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester East, said yesterday he would be seeking an urgent meeting with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, when MPs return next week from the Easter recess. Mr Vaz said that five banks directly serving Britain's Asian community had now either been closed by the Bank or had voluntarily shut down and it would take 'a great deal of explaining' to demonstrate that 'all of this is just a coincidence'. Mr Vaz referred to last month's disclosure by the Bank that in 1991 it had launched financial lifeboats for a number of small- and medium-sized banks. The Bank needed to explain why it had adopted different criteria when dealing with institutions such as Roxburghe Bank, he said. Mr Tony Lomas, one of the joint administrators from accountants Price Waterhouse, said Roxburghe needed to seek protection from its creditors because it would have been unable to meet demands for the increasing amount of withdrawals before the end of April. He said there were also concerns about whether it had net liabilities, because it had Pounds 45m in assets at the end of February against Pounds 40m in liabilities plus the need to make further provisions of up to Pounds 6m. The effective closure of the bank is the fourth in the past year to affect the Asian community directly since the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991. Equatorial Bank and Mount Banking have since both ceased taking new business. Albaraka International Bank's deposit-taking activities have been suspended. Mr Lomas said Roxburghe's Pounds 40m in liabilities was about evenly split between cash deposits and loans to small Asian businesses in the south of England. The largest loan was for about Pounds 2m. He said most of the depositors were from overseas, predominantly based in India and Kenya, with some accounts holding hundreds of thousands of pounds each. Only about 10 per cent of the depositors lived in the UK. The bank already had about Pounds 1m in provisions against bad debts, and there was currently a debate about the size of additional provisions which needed to be made of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 6m. Under administration Roxburghe can theoretically continue to accept new deposits from existing customers although none can currently make withdrawals. The Bank has forbidden the bank from accepting deposits from any new customers. Mr Lomas said he would be writing in the next day or two to all depositors and expected to provide them with a full report well within the three months allowed for a report to creditors under administration procedures. The accounts for the year to December 31 1991 show loans to three of the directors of Pounds 120,000 and to two directors in 1990 of Pounds 87,000. They also show an account with a credit of Pounds 43,000 in the name of J H Shah, one of the directors, and another with a credit of Pounds 7,000 to J &amp; R Shah Associates, a company controlled by Mr J H Shah and Mr R H Shah, another director.</p>

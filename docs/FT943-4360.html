			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Controls urged on forensic 'cowboys' Anybody can act as an expert witness and give forensic evidence, provided they can convince a court of their expertise, Ms Christine Willmore, a lawyer from Bristol University told the meeting. Dr Janet Thompson, director-general of the Forensic Science Service, said there was no way to prevent 'cowboy' forensic scientists from acting as expert witnesses. What is needed, according to Dr Angela Gallop, a forensic adviser, is 'a proper statutory body with teeth' that will accredit expert witnesses to deal with particular areas of evidence. Dr Gallop said people are setting themselves up as expert witnesses to give evidence on areas that they do not really understand, and many courtroom disagreements between expert witnesses are the result of lack of experience. The only way to become expert in a particular area is to spend years working in a forensic laboratory, she said. One problem is the need for both prosecution and defence solicitors to keep costs down. Dr Thompson said discussions had been going on for 2 1/2 years to establish a voluntary accreditation scheme for forensic science laboratories, and National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) that will recognise the competence of expert witnesses.</p>

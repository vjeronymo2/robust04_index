			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Pit enterprise zones may be delayed MR MICHAEL HESELTINE'S pledge to set up enterprise zones to help stimulate new economic activity in areas hit by pit closures is unlikely to be fulfilled quickly. He may also face a struggle to win approval for his plans from Brussels. The record suggests that when economic catastrophe overtakes a community it takes an average of between eight and 10 months for the proposed enterprise zone to start operating. When it does start the zone provides investors with a package of measures which supporters claim can play an important role in economic regeneration. Critics say that enterprise zones merely transfer jobs and investment away from other areas. The European Commission is highly sceptical of an initiative which it believes can distort competition. The zones have been seen, particularly by the Treasury, as a comparatively expensive way of generating jobs. Zone status brings with it a package of incentives to attract inward investors. They include the absence of business rates for the life of the zone - usually 10 years - 100 per cent capital allowances and greatly simplified planning procedures. Mr Heseltine's promise to establish zones wherever they are most effective does not mean that every affected mining area will benefit. The initiative will be led by the Department of the Environment, which will appoint consultants to examine potential zones and talk to the local authorities and landowners involved. When proposals have been drawn up and agreed between the Environment Department and the Department of Trade and Industry, they will be submitted to Brussels for approval. It seems unlikely that any will be operating before next summer. Enterprise zones were started in the early 1980s. One of the most successful experiments was based on Corby, Northants, which was devastated by the closure of the British Steel plant. Others followed in places such as Delyn, following the closure of the Shotton steel works at Clwyd, north Wales, and at Sunderland, after the shipyard closure led to a protracted battle to win zone approval from Brussels. Earlier this year the government applied to the Commission to establish a zone in north Lanarkshire to offset the impact of the closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks. It is still waiting for the go-ahead. There are currently 20 enterprise zones. The government said in 1989 that it did not plan to create any more.</p>

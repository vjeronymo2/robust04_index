Against all expectations, Nabil Shritah, third secretary of the  Syrian Embassy in the German Democratic Republic and resident of  one of the Syrian intelligence services, has decided to testify  in court, even though his performance can hardly be called that.  [see item LD0702161994 in previous Terrorism report for initial  reporting on Shritah's testimony] Hidden behind two folding  screens and surrounded by bodyguards, he played out a wonderful  soap opera: eulogies to his homeland in the Middle East, which  has had very good relations with the FRG for more than six  years, as he said.    Syria is "combatting terrorism" and there are "certain  circles" that are again linking Syria with terrorism to disturb  relations, the "witness" claimed. Who the "certain circles" are  remained in the dark, or more precisely: darkened. Shritah, who  stored weapons, passports, and explosives in his embassy room at  Otto-Grotewohl Street 3 and in his private apartment for the  Carlos group, described his responsible duties as a diplomat  very prosaically: He just invited other diplomats for coffee,  opened the door, and watched for telexes on Sundays and  holidays. After all, he was not "the Embassy chieftain."    Carlos, his wife Magdalena from Ulm, and his assistant  Johannes Weinrich came to him, because he should buy them some  goods in the diplomats' commissary. Shritah's comments on the  matter at hand were of a similar quality, insofar as he made any  statements at all. When Voigt's lawyers asked about the details  of Shritah's sudden appearance in the FRG shortly before the  opening of the main trial, he pleaded his privilege to decline  to answer questions. Otherwise, he would have had to answer a  few unpleasant questions, for instance about a Syrian fighter at  the invisible frontline, called Tawas Taham.    Taham, who has lived in West Berlin for many years, is  considered to be the Syrian intelligence service's liaison with  the RAF [Red Army Faction]. He organized a lawyer for Shritah  (his own), when the latter came into conflict with FRG law in  February 1982. Shritah was in prison in West Berlin for 14 days  and had to pay a fine of 5,000 German marks [DM]. Meanwhile,  three versions of the diplomat's crime have emerged: smuggling  cigarettes (MfS file), tax evasion (Shritah), smuggling arms and  explosives (report by an unofficial MfS employee).  <H5>  How Saul Turned Into Paul </H5>   The latter report contains the interesting piece of  information that there was a West German-Syrian deal in  connection with the criminal procedure: the release of three  Germans in Syria in return for a mild sentence and a cover up of  the unfriendly act. Tawas Taham once again altruistically cared  for the imprisoned Shritah.    During the first interrogation by the State Protection  Office  on 9 January 1994, Shritah urgently asked that his stay in Bonn  not be revealed to the Syrian Embassy, because he would  incriminate Syria. Therefore, he also wanted to request  political asylum in the FRG. The next day Tawas Taham called  Shritah in Moabit prison, visited him, and provided Nicolas  Becker as his lawyer. Then Shritah had a telephone conversation  in Arabic with his wife in Damascus. On 11 January he even  asked for a visit by a Syrian Embassy employee, who quickly  appeared on 12 January, and on 13 January Saul had turned into  Paul.    Shritah had his Damascus experience [sentence as published].  He said that Syria had had nothing at all to do with the bomb  attack on the French Consulate General, and he had come  voluntarily and privately to Budapest and Berlin. The reward  for the successful coup arrived by return mail: Shritah was  released from detention pending trial "subject to conditions,"  despite the pending procedure for aiding and abetting murder and  aiding and abetting a dangerous bomb attack.  <H5>  Silence of the Grave Surrounds the Late Abul Hakkam </H5>   Exactly the same accusations are made against Helmut Voigt,  who has been in prison since 6 September 1992 because of them.  The unequal treatment goes even further, because, while  intelligence service man Voigt is presented as an "MfS  perpetrator," Shritah emerges as an "MfS victim." This became  clear in connection with Shritah's file at the Gauck office.  The MfS knew about the men behind the Syrian and about his  contacts and, therefore, it had a file about him; Shritah was a  "target for investigation," his "movements" were documented,  unofficial employees were asked about him, and there was  intensive monitoring.    All this now elevates him, because Mr. Ziem of the Gauck  Office pointed out that his is a "victim's file" and Shritah  must give approval so that others can read it. To make it clear  once again: Nabil Shritah is strongly suspected of having been  essentially involved in the terrorist attack on the Maison de  France!    However, there is still another figure in the game, who,  strangely enough, is mentioned only by Voigt and his lawyers:  Hassan Saleh Ali, who called himself Abul Hakkam. Forty years  old at the time of the bomb attack, born in Aden (Yemen),  according to his passport, he turned up in the GDR with a  diplomatic passport issued by the People's Democratic Republic  of Yemen, Nr. 002 906. In addition, he also had a Syrian  diplomatic passport, Nr. 2387/79, for the name Mohamad Bitar,  which said that he was born in Homs (Syria). He was in fact the  number two after Carlos in the group, not Johannes Weinrich from  Brakel, the former pioneer of the Revolutionary Cells in the FRG.    Abul Hakkam had influence on the uncontrolled and  unpredictable Carlos, and constantly traveled between Syria,  Iraq, Lebanon, Switzerland, the CSSR, Hungary, and the GDR.  After a meeting between Carlos, Hakkam, and other Syrian  intelligence agents in Damascus in February 1980, the Carlos  group got weapons and passports, and the ambassadors in East  Berlin, Prague, Sofia, and Budapest were ordered to help and  support the owners of the passports as much as possible. The  code phrase was: "I come from Abul Hakkam."    On 16 August 1983, nine days before the attack, Abul Hakkam  once again entered the GDR, announced by the Hungarian  intelligence service. On 20 August, also previously announced,  a Lebanese, who called himself Achmed Muhamad el-Sibai, arrived  and, naturally, presented a diplomatic passport at Schoenefeld  Airport as well as a letter to the Syrian ambassador. On the  day of the attack both crossed the Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse  border checkpoint on foot without luggage and returned after the  attack, one shortly after the other.    Who brought the explosives to West Berlin and -- above all  --  what kind of explosives? In the Syrian Embassy there were  several packages with large amounts of TNT, C4, and plastic  explosive. And why is there neither an arrest warrant nor a  request for extradition covering Abul Hakkam? Why does the name  Hakkam not appear in the "Carlos" biography by Stephan Richard  Meyer?  <H5>  No Traces and a Meager Motive </H5>   Meyer is the son of Dr. Richard Meyer, formerly head of the  Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and an  employee of the Federal Intelligence Office, who was still in  office at the time of the attack. The book is based on insider  knowledge and files, including MfS files. Was Abul Hakkam the  agent of FRG services in the Carlos group? No one will be able  to ask El-Sibai about his role in the terrorism attack anymore.  The Berlin court has received a death certificate from Lebanon,  according to which the man was shot dead in the al-Bi'qa Valley  in the 1980's because of espionage....    Judges, public prosecutors, the defendant, and his lawyers  insist on the "Magdalena Kopp" motive for the attack. I cannot  understand that the highly intelligent Helmut Voigt believes in  the sentimental story about the attempt to get Carlos's lover,  who was in prison in France, released by blackmail. Or is his  restraint some sort of protection for his life and health after  imprisonment? Why were the Syrians so intensively involved in  the bomb attack, which had to hit both the French and the  Germans? To which extent is Rifat al-'Asad, the brother of the  Syrian president, involved in the surrounding events?    Rifat had close contacts with France, he often stayed in  Berlin, and he was also involved in the French-Syrian talks  about Magdalena Kopp in the Paris Interior Ministry. Colonel  Rifat was the head of an independent elite unit (Saraju d-Difah)  with its own heavy weapons and its own intelligence service -- a  brutal, unscrupulous man, who is responsible for the bloody  massacres on the Muslim Brethren in 1980-82.    Since Syria suffered from a constant lack of money, because  it afforded itself a disproportionately inflated military  sector, Rifat solved the financial problem in his own way: by  smuggling and with the help of dollars earned through drug  dealing. With the millions gained from the sale of the famous  "Golden Lebanese" from the hemp fields in the al-Bi'qa Valley he  paid his troops and his patrons.    Rifat wanted to grab power in Syria, which has been ruled by  his brother, Air Force General Hafiz al-'Asad, since 1970. The  al-'Asads are members of the Shi'ite 'Alawi sect, whose members  were held in contempt as heretics during the 400 years of  Turkish rule and have always been considered non-Muslims by the  Sunnites. During the period of the Mandate, the French gave the  'Alawi, who had been kept away from public life for centuries,  just like the Druze and the "heterodox" Christians, the right to  enter the military forces. After Syria became independent on 14  April 1946, the power-hungry 'Alawi quickly rose to leading  political and military positions.    One must also mention that Syria, with 12 million  inhabitants, "affords" itself four intelligence services! When  Hafiz al-'Asad fell sick in 1982-83, the power struggle began.  Rifat looked for supporters at home and abroad and tried to  stage a coup when his brother's health deteriorated dramatically  at the end of 1983. Did he make specific offers to the French,  which were rejected? Or did General Ali Duba, the head of the  Syrian military intelligence service and Carlos's friend, want  to warn France against collaboration with the hated usurper?    Together with the chief of general staff, the defense  minister, and other leading military officers, Duba opposed  Rifat, which led even to armed conflicts between the rivaling  troop units. When Hafiz al-'Asad recovered, Rifat was  temporarily "banned" to Moscow; from there he defected to Paris  via Geneva. In November 1984 he was permitted to return "home  to Damascus" and became vice president.  <H5>  Too Many Questions Without Answers </H5>   The struggle for power in Syria could be one of the possible  reasons for the Syrian involvement in the attack on the Maison  de France. The trial at the 29th Criminal Division of the  Berlin Court will not be able to clarify the origins and the  motives of the attack. This is not the fault of the judges'  honest efforts to clarify the events and to understand the  structures of intelligence service work.    The requests by the joint plaintiff to summon the then  French  and Italian embassy councillors in the GDR and ask them who told  them about the forthcoming attack, remain just so much  wastepaper. It will also not be possible to ask why the  Frenchman speaks of two dead, while officially only one death  was reported. No representatives of the German and French  intelligence services will appear in front of Judge Hueller and  Senior Public Prosecutor Mehlis and will have to accept the  question of why the FRG and France also acted as a transit and  resting area for the Carlos group.    And the fact that neither traces of the explosives nor  traces  of smoke were found at the site of the bomb attack, will  probably lead to speculations not just among those who observe  the trial, when they think of Nabil Shritah's words: "Relations  between Syria and the FRG are characterized by mutual respect  and benefit; there is an exchange at all levels." Syria -- this  means refuge and care for terrorists, such as Carlos, Weinrich,  Abu-Nidal, Abu-Dawud, Abu-Iyad, Abu-Musa, Wadi Haddad, George  Habash...</p>

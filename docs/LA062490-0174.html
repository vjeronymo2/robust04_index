			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> WILSON RALLIES AROUND FLAG BEFORE VETERANS  </P> <P> Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) elicited cheers, whistles and standing ovations  from two veterans' organizations Saturday with a pledge to fight on for a  constitutional amendment that would prohibit burning the American flag.  </P> <P> The senator presented his audiences with crisp American flags that had flown  over the U.S. Capitol, declaring, "I know damn well that no scruffy's going to  take it away from you and burn it."  </P> <P> In his third post-primary weekend of campaigning for the California  governorship, Wilson addressed the state convention of the American Legion in  the upper Sacramento Valley town of Redding. He then flew to the San Joaquin  Valley town of Visalia to make a similar appearance before the Amvets state  convention.  </P> <P> Never mind that the U.S. House of Representatives last week effectively killed  the anti-flag-burning amendment for the year. Wilson vowed to fly overnight  Monday to Washington so he could cast his vote Tuesday for what he acknowledged  will be a largely symbolic vote for the Senate's version of the amendment.  </P> <P> And never mind that flag burning has not been an issue high on the California  state government agenda. Both veterans' groups were well-primed for an  emotional demonstration on the flag issue.  </P> <P> Even if Wilson is not considered a stem-winding stump speaker, he managed to  press all the right buttons when he vowed to fight for the flag. And he knew  his audience.  </P> <P> The previous night, scores of Legionnaires stood respectfully and held hands in  a cocktail lounge in a Redding hotel as the four-piece combo struck up a jazzy  rendition of "America" and then slipped into the heavy beat of "Born in the  USA." Candidates for state Legion offices sprinkled their literature heavily  with pledges to carry on the crusade against what they perceive to be  desecration of the flag.  </P> <P> In presenting the flag to the Amvets, Wilson declared: "It represents all that  you stand for, all that you fought for, all that you hope for -- for your  children and their children and down through the generations: an America of  hope and opportunity."  </P> <P> Wilson accused the U.S. Supreme Court of engaging in "tortured logic" in  declaring destruction of the flag a form of freedom of expression. He claimed  that such action does not constitute free speech, but is "conduct" that he said  "represents the ultimate obscenity" against those who carried the flag into  battle for the United States.  </P> <P> Legion officials said that Wilson's Democratic opponent, former San Francisco  Mayor Dianne Feinstein, declined an invitation to address the convention.  Feinstein generally has shunned public appearances since her June 5 primary  election victory over state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, while her campaign  focuses on fund-raising efforts to replenish an empty treasury.  </P> <P> An aide said that Feinstein would favor a constitutional amendment to allow the  prohibition of flag burning, but one that is more narrowly drawn than the  version defeated in the House. Feinstein has not decided how such an amendment  should be worded, the aide said.  </P> <P> Wilson brought more than flags to Redding and Visalia. He promised that if  elected governor, he would work to build more veterans' homes like the one that  exists in Yountville in the Napa Valley, especially in Southern California,  home to a majority of the 500,000 California veterans who are 65 and older.  </P> <P> He also drew standing applause when he vowed to stop the proposed federal sale  of "surplus" land at the Department of Veterans Affairs facility in Westwood  and to get federal funds to repair the VA hospital in Palo Alto, damaged in  last October's earthquake.  </P></p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: FCC to shed paper and packaging units FLETCHER Challenge Canada, which is 72 per cent owned by the New Zealand forestry and resources conglomerate Fletcher Challenge, is selling its western packaging manufacturing and distribution businesses as part of a strategy to concentrate on pulp and paper. FCC has put up for sale Crown Packaging, a British Columbia producer of corrugated containers and other packaging products, and Crown Papers, a western wholesaler of printing papers, stationery and industrial products. Mr Doug Whitehead, chief operating officer of Fletcher Challenge Canada, said that both Crown Packaging and Crown Paper have been 'very successful enterprises,' even during the current economic downturn. 'However, they have become essentially stand-alone operations. Meanwhile, significant external economic changes have created a situation where these enterprises would do better with different owners with stronger strategic interests in the relevant businesses,' he said. FCC has already put sawmills up for sale and seeks a partner for its big Crofton newsprint corporation in British Columbia.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAP CAMPAIGN IS LAUNCHED BY TACO BELL;  </P> <P> HEY, TIMES READERS, / HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENIN': / TACO BELL CORP. / WANTS ITS  ADS RAPPIN'. / SO THEY HIRED YOUNG MC / TO TRY THEIR LUCK / WITH A NEW PROMO /  COSTIN' MUCHO BUCKS!  </P> <P> In its latest bid to reach young male consumers, Taco Bell Corp. launched a new  $12-million advertising campaign Monday that features the rap artist Young MC  pitching its products on the MTV cable channel.  </P> <P> The campaign marks the first time that Taco Bell, a subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc.,  has bought commercial time on a national cable television network. With the ad,  the Irvine-based firm also joins other companies using rap music in their  marketing efforts.  </P> <P> "We think that rap music has entered the mainstream," said Taco Bell spokesman  Elliot Bloom. "It really speaks to almost all of our audience."  </P> <P> Specifically, Taco Bell believes the rap promotion will help it reach 12- to  34-year-old males, the mainstay customers of the discount, Mexican-style,  fast-food restaurants.  </P> <P> The fast-food chain plans to spend $1 million in advertising on the Music  Television network and much of the remaining $11 million on a plastic-cup  giveaway. The multicolored cups are emblazoned with the logo of the MTV Video  Music Awards. Taco Bell is a major sponsor of the Sept. 6 awards ceremony.  </P> <P> Young MC, in reality Marvin Young, is best known for his hit "Bust a Move,"  which earned him a Grammy Award for best new rap artist last year. The graduate  of the University of Southern California is no stranger to commercials: He was  the featured performer in Pepsi Cola's "Cool Cans" ad campaign this spring.  </P> <P> "We think rap is a great way of marketing our products to the youth market, and  there could be no better rapper than Young MC," Bloom said. "He is a Grammy  Award-winning artist; he is squeaky-clean; he is against drug use, against  violence, and, in fact, much of his music speaks of this."  </P> <P> In the commercial, Young MC performs a Taco Bell rap that talks of four  giant-sized cups and a promise of free refills. He raps as colorful desert  backgrounds pass by, "including four girls who magically turn into MTV  collector cups," according to Taco Bell.  </P> <P> A promotion with a rap artist as its focal point comes in sharp contrast to the  "Tacos to Go" campaign over the summer, which sported Greg LeMond, the  three-time winner of the Tour de France bicycle race.  </P> <P> That campaign took an ill-fated turn when Taco Bell had to recall millions of  bicycle-type water bottles that were found to have a defective valve that could  be easily swallowed by young children. This time, the company is playing it  safe with a standard plastic cup.  </P></p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Thai Airways earnings climb sharply Thai Airways International (Thai), the partially-privatised national airline, yesterday announced a sharp rise in net profit in its first quarter to end-December to Bt1.09bn (Dollars 43m) from Bt119m in the same period a year earlier. The profit for the quarter amounts to more than Thai's entire net earnings in the previous financial year, but falls short of the company's own forecast for the quarter of Bt1.15bn made a month ago. Thai released no further financial details yesterday, and it was not clear how the rise in profit was achieved. In previous years the company has inflated its profits by selling aircraft and leasing them back. There is no evidence of aircraft sales in the latest quarter, but the company may have sold other assets; to add to the confusion, the company is reforming its accounting system with the help of KPMG Peat Marwick Suthee. Thai said recently that profits have benefited from a higher load factor.</p>

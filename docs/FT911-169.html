			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: The hidden timebomb in the convertible package / Explore issuing companies' varying approaches to dealing with the put option problem IT SEEMED a good idea at the time. In the bull market of 1987 a number of companies issued convertible Eurobonds. They took advantage of rising share prices to set conversion prices at well above their then share prices. Further, they shaved the interest payments on the bonds by offering investors the right to redeem them, usually after five years, at a premium to the issue price. This would guarantee the bondholders a return roughly in line with interest rates at the time. But, the issuers thought, these put options were never going to be exercised. By the time they were due, the share price would have risen, the bonds would have been converted. The companies would have issued equity, and they hoped, the holders of the new shares would have been drawn from the pool of international investors who buy Eurobonds, thus widening the shareholder base. Now it is all too obvious that there was a flaw in this logic. The stockmarket crash of October 1987 meant that the share prices of many companies fell well below the conversion prices. Suddenly the put option, which had seemed unimportant, loomed as a potential liability. As 1992 approached, the year when many of these options become payable, companies realised they had problems. Unfortunately many of them also fell on difficult times. The prospect of a large liability worsened the outlook for companies already facing poor trading conditions, or reaping the whirlwinds of ill-judged expansions. Certainly it was not the instrument itself which was at fault, but the mistakes of the issuers. The existence of a convertible with a put option became enough, in some cases, to trigger a bear raid on the company's shares. In the case of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, with its Pounds 176.5m convertible Europreference shares due to be redeemed for Pounds 211m in July 1993, the liability would have been sufficient to put the company into receivership. Now most of issuers have found an answer, if not a solution, to the problem. These answers range from conversion as planned, to a complete refinancing of the company. The essence of any such answer is to give the issuer the ability to meet any likely redemption without straining its balance sheet. THE WHAT PROBLEM SOLUTION Last year Tesco, the food retailer, was able to force its convertible holders to convert to shares because the group's share price had risen well above the conversion price. This is the ideal answer, since it was the outcome intended when the bonds were first issued. The company has in effect borrowed cheaply for three years - Tesco's convertible paid interest at 4 per cent - and has increased its share capital at a price higher than it was at the time of issue. THE GRIN AND BEAR IT ANSWER Many issuers have decided there is nothing for it but to pay up if or when the put is exercised. Most are providing for the extra interest which would be due, adding to their interest charges, with the provision usually accumulating in creditors in the balance sheet. Thus, if a put option is exercised, there should not be a sudden charge to profits, although the cash will have to be found and the bond refinanced. Providing is not an answer on its own, issuers must also find the cash for redemption. One side effect of making the provision is that, as Tesco discovered, having set supplemental interest against its profits, it could only bring the provision back into reserves, not profits, in its latest balance sheet. THE BUY-BACK With many of the convertible bonds trading well below their issue prices, companies have been able to buy some of them back, cutting their liability on exercise of the put. Storehouse and Next, the retailers, have both tried this route. Not surprisingly, bonds which have been languishing suddenly spring to life when a company announces a buy-back programme, so issuers cannot always retrieve much of the issue. Storehouse was able to buy Pounds 40.5m of its Pounds 69m convertible issue last autumn. It even made a Pounds 400,000 profit on the transaction. That leaves only Pounds 28.5m of the issue outstanding, which will cost the company Pounds 36.8m in April 1992 if the put is exercised, much less than the original liability of Pounds 89m. Next has two issues outstanding, and has bought some of each, with purchases of its larger 5 3/4 per cent bond made recently. It now has Pounds 78.6m of that issue outstanding, and Pounds 43.3m of its 6 3/4 per cent issue. That would present liabilities of Pounds 57.8m in January 1992 and Pounds 104.8m in October 1992. THE SALE OF ASSETS WAY OUT Companies which could not put off the liability, could at least prepare for it by raising cash. Storehouse has reformed its balance sheet through asset sales, and should have minimal net debt when its March 31 accounts are published. It should not have a problem in meeting the put in April 1992. Next's sale of Grattan, its mail-order subsidiary, for Pounds 168m will give it net cash until the October 1992 payment is made, and it now has agreed facilities from its banks. THE ROLLING PUT WHEEZE Corporate financiers who had helped companies get into a mess by issuing the bonds originally, tried to help them out by inventing the 'rolling put'. This idea was to put off the evil day by offering bondholders an attractive incentive to stay with their investments. When the first put date arrived, they would be offered another put perhaps five years later at a new interest rate. At first this seemed to excuse companies from providing for extra interest, since it once again reduced the likelihood of the put being exercised. But now many expect the first puts to be exercised. Burton, Hillsdown and Asda each have rolling puts, but of these only Asda is now not providing supplemental interest. Each expects to have no financial difficulty meeting the redemption. THE RIGHTS ISSUE REPLACEMENT If the bond is not to turn into shares, then a rights issue is another answer. That was London International Group's idea when it launched a Pounds 61.6m rights in January. That not only provides the cash to repay its Pounds 50m convertible in March 1992, it also increases the group's equity. Meanwhile LIG is providing for the extra interest. THE TOTAL REFINANCING DESPERATION MEASURE Saatchi's problems were so severe that the only way out was to refinance the group. Its Europreference shareholders were offered ordinary shares instead. Such was the bargaining power of these holders that they now have 64 per cent of the enlarged share capital. It is all too easy to blame the bonds themselves or the corporate financiers who dreamed them up for the problems which have arisen. But it is not their fault if the money raised was used to finance dubious expansion, or if the recession has shown up weaknesses in balance sheets. Companies in stable sectors, such as food retailers, were better able to cope with the possible liability than those in more cyclical businesses. Nor should it be forgotten that even those issuers which are forced by investors to redeem at a premium, have tapped a cheap source of funds meanwhile. Many of the redemption yields were set at between 8 1/2 and 10 per cent  - and the cost of money has generally exceeded those levels throughout the last five years.</p>

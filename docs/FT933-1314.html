			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: AB buy helps TT to Pounds 9.42m TT GROUP, the mini conglomerate with most of its interests in electronics, impressed the City yesterday by lifting pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.47m to Pounds 9.42m in the six months to June 26, helped by the January acquisition of AB Electronics. The interim dividend goes up to 2.6p (2.4p), payable from earnings per share of 8.2p (7.7p). The company conceded the Pounds 13m acquisition of then lossmaking AB with Pounds 26m debt, covered interests costs but diluted earnings. Mr John Newman, joint chief executive, said AB would give further benefits next year: 'We are extremely pleased with the way AB has turned out. When we bought it, it was making losses of about Pounds 10m a year and now it is trading profitably.' AB had an operating profit margin of about 1.6 per cent in the first half, contributing Pounds 1.37m to operating profits of Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 8.8m). TT put in costing systems, stepped back from chasing volume on unprofitable products and shed about 550 from the 4,000-strong workforce. It is aiming for a margin of 5 per cent by the end of next year. Mr Newman said the market was 'very strong in electronics' accounting for about 80 per cent of group sales, mainly in telecommunications, mobile phones and computer components. Packaging operations were flat at the operating level while building services were still 'suffering'. Interim turnover was Pounds 179.1m (Pounds 78.6m) bolstered by Pounds 78.7m from AB. UK customers accounted for 56 per cent of sales. First half exports were Pounds 29m compared with a full year's Pounds 32m in 1992. At the half-year end, TT's gearing was 54 per cent (under 20 per cent a year earlier). Interest charges were Pounds 2.33m (Pounds 1.33m), but the group received proceeds this month from its Pounds 51.4m rights issue and now has net cash of Pounds 7.5m. COMMENT TT's joint-chief executives, Mr Nicholas Shipp and his Hanson-trained partner Mr Newman, are its main attraction. They buy sound businesses, fallen on hard times, turning them around within a year. After consolidation they then buy another business. AB is the latest in this successful series, with shareholders readily chipping in new equity to fund it. With AB coming good quicker than expected, pre-tax profit forecasts have been revised upwards to Pounds 24m for the full year. This gives a multiple of 15.5 which looks modest compared with a rating in the low 20s for Wassall, with similar interests and another Hanson-trained boss.</p>

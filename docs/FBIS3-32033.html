Uribe Velez spoke with our economics section about these  past  18 months in politics, during which time he has had to put up  with lobbying, criticism, threats, and even impertinent  questions from a reporter in Armenia, who asked him what pension  fund he owned.    [Sarmiento] What is the most important thing about the  social  security reform?    [Uribe] It contains mechanisms for expanding coverage to  improve health care; over the long run these mechanisms will  mean steady growth for social security service in terms of  broader coverage and a major improvement in quality. It also  contains a capitalization mechanism that will boost national  savings appreciably, and this should have very favorable  macroeconomic ramifications in the medium term.    [Sarmiento] The feeling in the country is that the law  boosted contributions but reduced pensions, which is not at all  good for Colombian workers....    [Uribe] Setting up state-run institutions was in vogue in  Colombia in the 1960's, as it was all over the world. The  creators of these institutions did not realize how inefficient  an all-powerful State would become. In recent years we have seen  a totally opposite vogue: the neoliberal vogue of dismantling  the entire State. The reform's major virtue is that it balances  State participation very well with the participation of private  citizens and social entities. The State is involved as a  regulator, as a monitor, and also as a provider of social  services; private citizens and social entities deliver services.  We are devising a major synthesis here. We are placing the  system at a happy medium between the two extremes of total  nationalization, as in the 1960's, and the complete transfer of  these public services to market forces, as some champions of  neoliberalism advocate. We are placing ourselves at a social  center of great importance.    Unlike countries such as Chile and Peru, among others, in  Colombia contributions are not going to be paid exclusively by  the workers; on the contrary, employers are going to pay the  larger share. And why are contributions being increased? As far  as pensions are concerned, we are moving up to 1996 the increase  to 13.5 percent that we would have to have in place by around  2010. The very likely consequence is that if we have a 13.5  percent rate as of 1996, we will not have to order further  increases to pay pensions during the next generation. The  advantage of an increase now is not only that it will avoid  future increases but also that it will enable us to gradually  resolve the government's problem of its huge debt to future  retirees. The average length of service of workers is 12 years,  and moreover there are no reserves. As the State begins to  collect these higher contributions, like any private sector  employer, they will guarantee enough reserves to meet these  obligations.    We are not boosting contributions for health care. We are  simply leveling them out at the top to extend coverage to the  worker's family.    The eligibility age is being raised very little. Whereas  other countries have put it at 65, which was the  administration's initial proposal, Congress raised it to just 62  for men and 57 for women, and only as of 2014. In other words,  the age has been raised conservatively and far into the future.    [Sarmiento] Why do you regard this reform as the most  important of the past half century?    [Uribe] Because this country delivers social security  services to a very small percentage of the population, barely 21  percent, whereas coverage in the industrialized countries is  close to 100 percent and the average is between 40 and 50  percent in Latin America. Colombia, at 21 percent, is barely at  Haiti's level. This reform provides all of the mechanisms for us  to start expanding coverage.    [Sarmiento] Isn't it utopian to think that by the year 2000  all Colombians will have health care?    [Uribe] The goal is a very ambitious one, and in this  connection I am less optimistic than the health minister, but we  have to make an effort to come as close to it as we can. The  first step is to fulfill the legal obligation that in a year's  time the ISS [Social Security Institute] has to offer family  coverage to all its affiliates. This will be an essential  element for credibility in enforcing the new law. Second, the  public funding for health care in coming years is going to rise  from 2 to 4 percent of the GDP. Third, one quarter of the  revenues of the departments and municipalities must go to health  care. And fourth, some of the revenues of the territorial  entities that will come from Cusiana and Cupiagua will expand  the health-care budgets as of 1997.    [Sarmiento] The comment that laws do not bring votes but  that  social security could cost votes is making the rounds in  Congress. Aren't you afraid that it may jeopardize your  aspiration to be governor of Antioquia?    [Uribe] The governorship is an aspiration, but now is not  the  time to bring it up. Let's see what happens in 1994. I think  that Colombia, like so many other Latin American countries, has  been banishing populism. I think that populist harangues bring  applause but do not speak to Colombians' deep-seated  rationality. I believe much more strongly in the good sense of  people, who prefer serious reforms to simple populist harangues.  Reforming is very hard and initially causes headaches, but in  the end it is one of the few things that make politics  gratifying.    [Sarmiento] Do you consider this a perfect reform?    [Uribe] This law will no doubt have to be reformed in the  future. It is not perfect, but it establishes very important  institutions that are destined to last for a very long time in  Colombia. We cannot aspire to perfection because social security  is very complicated. There is a social security crisis the world  over; all countries are seeking a model. We have developed a  very Colombian model, based on our own experience and our own  idiosyncrasies, but unlike in Chile, Peru, and Bolivia, this  reform was not adopted either by a dictatorial government, or a  strong Executive without Congress, or an Executive without a  deliberative public. We have adopted it here with a pluralistic  Congress, four months before elections, with a vigilant public,  and in a democracy with an opposition.    [Sarmiento] What worries you about the law?    [Uribe] I am worried that in the area of health care the 12  percent rate may not be enough. But to the extent that the  system works well, in a year or two political and social  conditions conducive to an increase will have been created. I am  also worried that the hike will be hard on small and mid-sized  business, but this problem will be felt just in the first few  years. They will then begin to reap the benefits of better  health services and a substantial growth in savings.    [Sarmiento] The administration says that in adopting the  reform it was thinking more about our poorest citizens. How will  it affect these segments of society?    [Uribe] The reform provides a very important instrument for  the members of the informal economy and poor peasants: the  possibility that the family allowance funds and the cooperative  sector can organize themselves as health promotion enterprises.  As family-allowance funding is rechanneled to bring health care  to these groups in our large cities and on small peasant farms,  we are going to make headway in extending services to people who  have long been ignored.    [Sarmiento] How would you convince the country that the law  is not a bad one, when some think that the next administration's  first task will be to reform it?    [Uribe] I believe strongly in the practical effects of the  reform. We have altered 50-year old social security legislation  that had brought us to very low levels of coverage. It is only  fair to call for a reasonable period of lead time before  evaluating the practical results.    [Sarmiento] The academic sector feels that in seven years or  so the pension contributions will have to be increased again  because the reform was an equation that Congress broke because  hiking the contributions was not enough.    [Uribe] Congress was conservative in tightening the  requirements, to the extent that a pluralistic Congress could do  so. Many people there said that raising contributions meant that  requirements did not have to be tightened or certain benefits  cut. The projections of the actuaries tell us that this equation  improves into the future and that the ISS and the system in  general may make it to the year 2020 with a large cushion of  reserves.    [Sarmiento] In the final accounting, who does this law  cover?    [Uribe] The main dividing line in the reform is, by and  large, age, with exceptions. A minimal part will apply to males  over 40 and females over 35. Everyone will have to make larger  contributions, however.    [Sarmiento] In one sentence how would you describe the  social  security reform?    [Uribe] As a reform with major challenges.    [Sarmiento] We are about to have a change in administration.  Is there any guarantee that the next one will implement the  reform?    [Uribe] I do not think that President Gaviria's reformist  spirit, which was a fundamental factor in this reform, is going  to go for naught. I am certain that whoever the next president  of Colombia is, he will take up the task of implementing it. It  will be excellent for the next administration to find the  legislative part clearly defined and all set to be implemented.    [Sarmiento] Doesn't this law privatize pensions and health  care?    [Uribe] The major virtue of this law is that it follows  neither the nationalization wave of the 1960's nor the  privatizing wave of neoliberalism. It aims for a sensible happy  medium. It tells the State: you monitor and regulate. And it  tells private individuals and the social sector: you cooperate  with the government in delivering these services and in steadily  expanding social security.    [Sarmiento] Since this law is not perfect, what are its  shortcomings?    [Uribe] So far I would point out two minor problems. In the  early years contributions are going to be very heavy for small  and midsized businesses. And the health-care contribution is  inadequate for now.    [Sarmiento] Was there a great deal of pressure to get this  reform out?    [Uribe] Not pressure, but everybody had ideas about the  reform. Political parties, employer and labor unions. All  economic, social, and political sectors voiced opinions. And I  would say that the purpose of the reform was not to apportion  discontent equitably, as Saint Thomas put it, but rather to  develop common ground that is good for the country.    [Sarmiento] Have there been threats against your life?    [Uribe] I have not been threatened. Politics entails risks,  and you have to face up to them with patriotism. When you enter  politics, you have to choose between trying to preserve the  entire established order, the political modus vivendi, and  helping to transform it. I believe that as long as I am in  politics, I have to help transform it and work patriotically,  with thoroughgoing devotion for Colombia and to be very prudent  during the difficult times in political life.</p>

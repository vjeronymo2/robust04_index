			<p>BFN     [Text] In Lvov, Leonid Kravchuk called the local council  elections of 26 June an attempt by Ukraine's Supreme council to  put into practice a federative territorial state system Lvov: On  12 June Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, visited the  town, where he had a number of meetings. In particular, he took  part in a conference of chairmen of rayon, oblast, and local  councils, and between entrepreneurs and businessmen. In his  speech Leonid Kravchuk called the local council elections of 26  June an attempt by Ukraine's Supreme Council to put into  practice a federative form of territorial state system without  having elaborated the necessary legislative base, which could  lead to an ungoverned society.    Together with Valeriy Shmarov, Ukraine's vice-prime  minister,  and Yevhen Sukhin, president of the "Ukranaftohaz" [Ukrainian  oil and gas] joint-stock holding company, the president of  Ukraine also attended the unveiling of a monument to Mykhaylo  Hrushevskyy, first president of Ukraine. Later Leonid Kravchuk  took part in the traditional Zankivchanski evenings at Lvov's  Mariya Zankovetska state academic theater, where he held an  improvised press conference. Leonid Kravchuk expressed himself  in favor of a presidential-parliamentary republic and in favor  of the election of executive, but not representative power.  Leonid Kravchuk also noted that, notwithstanding world  experience, he would not be influencing the general state  process until his probable election.    The president noted that in the last few years there had  been  changes for the better in Ukraine's economy: In the  metallurgical industry more had been done in four years than had  been done in the 15 years up to 1990, the reconstruction of the  oil industry is under way, Ukraine is developing its medical  industry, and so on.    Describing relations with Russia, he observed that the  accusation of Ukraine in isolation from Russia are groundless,  because in the time since the independence of both states  approximately 70 agreements and documents have been signed,  including economic ones too. Namely, Ukraine was the initiator  of free trade with Russia.    Replying to a question from a UNIAN correspondent about  whether Ukraine would agree to concessions to Crimea, Leonid  Kravchuk observed that there would not be a single concession  regarding Ukraine's territorial integrity and that Crimea would  remain a constituent part of Ukraine.</p>

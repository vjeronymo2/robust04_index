			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Local poll in Romania will test ruling National Salvation Front TOMORROW'S first democratic local government elections in Romania for over five decades are expected to show if the ruling National Salvation Front (NSF) will retain the majority in the forthcoming parliamentary elections and if a united opposition can emerge as a strong political party. The elections for 40,000 mayors and 109,000 commune councils will also reveal if the power of the mayors in the 40 counties can finally be broken, and brought under greater accountability.

Not only is the NSF divided between conservatives/former communists, and social democrats anxious to speed up reform; it also faces what appears to be the beginnings of a united opposition movement. In most counties in Transylvania, for example, the Liberal and National Peasant parties, the two 'historic' parties of the inter-war period, which together obtained only 13 per cent of the vote in 1990, have united with the local Hungarian Democratic Union party. Even in Bucharest, the capital, all the opposition parties, including the party of the Civic Alliance, a movement of intellectuals, are standing on one ticket. Beset by economic difficulties, the NSF, led by Mr Petre Roman, former prime minister, has responded to this united opposition by playing the nationalist card. Sections of the media are whipping up anti-Hungarian and anti-semitic sentiment, and calls are increasing for re-unification with the neighbouring former Soviet republic of Moldova. In several counties in Tranyslvania the NSF has united with the ultra nationalist Romanian National Union Party (RNUP).</p>

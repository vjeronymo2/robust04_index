			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY AND COUNTY REACH COMPROMISE ON COST OF JOINT ELECTIONS  </P> <P> Los Angeles city and county officials Tuesday reached tentative settlement in  their dispute over election costs, paving the way for a June public vote on a  sweeping city ethics reform package.  </P> <P> The compromise was approved Tuesday by county supervisors in a closed-door  meeting. It now goes to the City Council for expected approval.  </P> <P> Under the tentative agreement, the county will withdraw its threat to bar the  city from participating in the June 5 county-run election. In return, the city  will drop a lawsuit against the county over billing for the 1988 election.  </P> <P> The city and county also agreed to "split the difference" in their dispute over  the city's 1988 bill, Supervisor Ed Edelman said.  </P> <P> The agreement follows a month of intense behind-the-scenes negotiations,  including rare face-to-face meetings between members of the City Council and  the county board.  </P> <P> Edelman said the supervisors agreed to the settlement "in the interest of  harmony."  </P> <P> "This is not a good time to keep fighting with the city," he said, pointing out  that the county is seeking city approval for development of county-owned land  downtown.  </P> <P> At Supervisor Pete Schabarum's urging, the board last month voted to block the  city from consolidating with the county's election unless the city agreed in  advance to pay its share of the costs and dropped the lawsuit against the  county for billing in the 1988 election.  </P> <P> In 1988, the county established a new formula for billing cities for the costs  of consolidating elections. The city, whose bill for the November, 1988,  election shot up 822%, to $755,654, compared to the November, 1986, fee of  $78,223, sued the county last December challenging the statement.  </P> <P> Under the tentative agreement, the city will pay the county $401,129 for the  1988 election, Edelman said.  </P> <P> Schabarum cast the lone vote against the settlement, Edelman said. Schabarum  could not be reached for comment, but the San Gabriel Valley supervisor had  complained that many small cities paid a higher bill in 1988 but did not file  suit.  </P> <P> County Registrar-Recorder Charles Weissburd said that those cities will now be  entitled to rebates.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Council President John Ferraro described the chances for  council approval of the settlement as "very, very good."  </P> <P> "It's a good deal for the city," Councilman Mike Woo added.  </P> <P> The council has approved placing four measures on the June ballot, including  the ethics package. It would ban outside work for elected city officials while  increasing the annual pay of council members to $86,157 from $61,157. It would  also establish public financing for city campaigns.  </P></p>

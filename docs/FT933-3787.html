			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Government stands firm on public sector pay restraints SENIOR ministers yesterday met the vigorous protest over the decision to maintain tough controls on UK public sector pay with a blunt warning that the government would press ahead. Public sector union leaders said the government would face serious conflict if it sought to maintain a second 12-month period of pay restraint among 5m public sector workers after the current 1.5 per cent wage limit ends in November. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the government would stick by the policies needed to bring about economic recovery, even if these were unpopular. Speaking in Scotland, Mr Major said: 'People are concerned at controversial decisions. But sometimes it is necessary to take controversial decisions even though they may be unpopular.' The bitter unpopularity among Conservative supporters of the Budget decision to impose value added tax on domestic fuel was revealed in the motions put forward for the annual party conference published yesterday . Ministers have already said that the policy will not be reversed. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday brushed aside the threat of public sector strikes and said the time for annual automatic pay increases had gone. 'We have got to get used to a climate in which Britain is now in control of inflation,' he told BBC radio. 'We do not now have this annual performance whereby significant well-organised groups think every year that pay has got to go up to give a real increase in their living standards.' Firefighters are likely to hold a ballot next month over industrial action in defence of the 15-year-old formula that links their pay to the upper quartile of male full-time workers' earnings. Mr Ken Cameron, the Fire Brigade Union's general secretary, said a second year of wage restraint would 'increase the likelihood of (firefighters) voting 'yes' in a ballot for strike action'. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said it was an attempt to make public servants 'pay the price for the government's economic mistakes'. Tory discontent, Page 6</p>

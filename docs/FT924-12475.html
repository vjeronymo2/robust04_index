			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Italy asks EC for special stand-by loan of Ecu8bn ITALY has asked for a special stand-by loan of Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.3bn) from its European Community partners, but the EC is likely to impose strict budgetary conditions before it agrees to the request. The Italian government announced it had begun talks on a loan facility at the beginning of the month. In asking for Ecu8bn, Italy has sought the maximum funding possible from its Community partners to offset the loss of reserves supporting the lira last month. The figure is considerably higher than the Ecu5bn which had been mentioned unofficially. Rome has indicated its willingness to accept EC conditions. Commission officials said yesterday that in practice a maximum of Ecu10bn was available to Italy under rules which allow the EC to help countries experiencing balance of payments problems or adverse capital movements. Under such rules, the EC would go to the capital markets to raise the money, using its own guarantees. Commission officials confirmed yesterday that the quickest timetable for approval would involve submitting the plan to the EC monetary committee - made up of senior central bank and treasury officials - on November 16, and to finance ministers a week later. The loan is also likely to be conditioned by the timing of the approval of the main measures in the 1993 Italian budget and a decision on when the lira re-enters the European Monetary System, which it left with sterling on September 17. Greece is the only EC member to have applied for support under the 1988 rules, and received an Ecu2.2bn stabilisation loan in February 1991. Foreign Minister Emilio Colombo, calling for rapid parliamentary approval of the 1993 austerity budget, yesterday said the vote would determine Italy's standing in the Community, Reuter adds from Rome. 'It is up to us Italians to decide whether we belong to the first, second, third or fourth division of the EC - or whether we are out of the Community altogether,' he said.</p>

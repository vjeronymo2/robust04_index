			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Japanese want fair business to underpin fair trade - Employers' federation argues it is companies themselves that must change FACED with a challenge, the Japanese reach for a catchword. Grappling with the problems of an economic downturn and of economic frictions with the US and Europe, Japanese industrialists have lighted on kyosei - symbiosis. The word first appeared a few weeks ago in speeches by Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the chairman of the Keidanren, the powerful employers' federation. Last week it was enshrined in a Keidanren report which urged Japan and its trading partners to 'find a way to accomplish kyosei'. In the Keidanren's view, kyosei means establishing a framework for fair competition between companies by harmonising rules and business conditions in the world's three largest markets - the EC, the US and Japan. The report takes the federation into a controversial area. It acknowledges that reforming trade regulations will not of itself create fair markets or ease trade frictions. Instead, companies themselves must change. Keidanren says American (and by implication European) companies must become more competitive, partly be adopting well-respected Japanese practices such as long-term business planning, comprehensive quality control and close relations between management and labour. For their part, Japanese companies should abandon the excessive pursuit of market share, over-long working hours, and opaque commercial relations with business partners. In other words, western companies must try harder while Japanese groups should ease up a bit. While western companies might bristle at being given advice by the Keidanren, few would seriously quarrel with the federation's prescriptions. What is far less clear is whether Japanese companies really will change in the direction the Keidanren suggests or whether kyosei is just a verbal smokescreen. Perhaps change will come, in response to pressures such as a huge leap in the cost of capital since the late 1980s, coupled to growing labour shortages in Japan. These forces will eventually compel companies to pay more attention to securing profits and less to winning market share at any price. But such a shift will not necessarily make Japanese companies any less competitive in international markets. Moreover, changes could take a long time to start working. 'If Japanese companies are to change at all, it will take 50 years,' says Mr Masashi Kojima, president of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's largest corporation. The argument started with an article in Bungei Shunju, a magazine, by Mr Akio Morita, the outspoken chairman of Sony, the electronics group, which said western companies paid their employees more than Japanese groups, granted longer holidays, handed out higher dividends to shareholders and made greater voluntary contributions to charity. Mr Morita urged Japanese corporations to close the gap to head off criticism that Japan had unfair advantages in competing with the west. Mr Morita's comments provoked strong reactions, mainly from those who believe the Japanese economic system has great merits which should not be forgotten in some chimerical pursuit of international norms. Mr Haruo Hamada, a professor of Keio University, argued in the same magazine that Japan's economy suffers from the legacy of post-war protectionism and government intervention. These elements had to be reformed by deregulation. But the economy had also developed great strengths - including keiretsu, industrial groupings in which companies forge close mutually-supporting links. Mr Yotaro IIda, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the engineering combine, wrote that there was nothing new in western criticism of Japan, so there was no need for a new response. 'The basic attitude of Japanese industry is to work with sweat on your brow and oil in your hands and to make money from the results of hard labour.' This argument about the virtues of Japanese workers was made in extreme form by Mr Shintaro Ishihara, the maverick right-wing politician, who wrote, also in Bungei Shunju, that Japan's competitive advantages were due to its long-standing cultural differences between Japan and the west, not to commercial rules introduced in the last 100 years. Mr Morita had denied the 'history and the uniqueness of the Japanese race', said Mr Ishihara. However, within the Keidanren, Mr Morita's views gained ground, not least because as a vice chairman he is one of its most influential members. Nevertheless, as the report shows, exhortations to Japanese companies to change their ways have been matched with an acknowledgement of some of Japan's industrial strengths and an appeal to western companies to study Japan's merits. In one important way, Japanese companies are already committed to putting the report into practice - they are reducing working hours by cutting over time. The aim is to achieve a target of 1,800 hours work a year, down from 2,050 hours, including 185 hours of overtime, in 1990. However, current reductions in overtime are largely a response to the economic slow down. The real test will come when the economy recovers.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROGRESS AMID GROWING NEED  </P> <P> The largest comprehensive AIDS service center in the nation will be dedicated  Thursday by AIDS Project Los Angeles. It marks an impressive step in meeting  current needs in the pandemic of the human immune deficiency virus (HIV), but  it also serves as a stark reminder of how much more must be done to meet future  needs.  </P> <P> The Nancy Cole Sawaya Center is at 6721 Romaine St., near the intersection of  Highland and Santa Monica, near the epicenter of the epidemic. It brings  together under one roof and in 40,000 square feet of operating space all of the  services of APLA with two exceptions: The dental clinic will remain at West  Hollywood Park, and Our House, in the Pico-Union District, will continue as a  separate residential facility. Among the services available at the Sawaya  Center are case management, transportation to help clients to medical  appointments, insurance counseling, food and clothing supplies, mental-health  services, including special help in dealing with sexual compulsions and  substance abuse, group therapy and professional training to help health-care  providers protect themselves from AIDS.  </P> <P> Two of the most effective programs of APLA, the telephone hot line and the  buddy program, also are operating from the new facility. They demonstrate the  crucial role that volunteers can play in providing critical services. About 300  AIDS patients now have volunteer buddies to give them support, and about 200  volunteers staff the hot line, (800) 922-AIDS.  </P> <P> But the fine new APLA facilities and the agency's effective program of services  mask serious problems. Even in San Francisco, which established national norms  for effective and affordable AIDS care, community-based programs are imperiled  by the exhaustion of federal service demonstration project funding and by the  budget paralysis created in Sacramento by Gov. George Deukmejian's proposals to  cut funds for the medically indigent. Federal and state funding are not keeping  up with demand. And, to make matters worse, private donations have leveled off.  And so has the supply of volunteers.  </P> <P> APLA is a microcosm of the national crisis in AIDS services. The agency has  just emerged from a radical reorganization; it was forced to trim three dozen  people from the professional staff as programs outgrew support. With a vigorous  and experienced new chief executive officer, Stephen Bennett, and with better  focused and somewhat reduced goals, it is making a fresh start. With a paid  staff of 100 and 1,500 volunteers, it has a client load of 1,900, or more than  half the AIDS-diagnosed people of the county. But its $8.1-million budget is by  no means assured because of the uncertainty of government funding, which covers  30% of the budget, and fluctuations in voluntary contributions.  </P> <P> "With donor dollars, we can create models and create solutions, models for  government support," Bennett said the other day. "But, long term, the funding  has to be federal."  </P> <P> Even within APLA, however, progress is coming slowly. Our House, the  residential facility serving AIDS and ARC patients who also have psychological  or substance abuse problems, is operating at its capacity of 14, with a waiting  list of 17. The buddy program needs 80 additional volunteers to eliminate a  waiting list. Most volunteers are drawn from the gay community, but one of the  most effective buddies is a housewife with teen-age children of her own, now  working with her fourth "buddy." The hot line, which processes as many as 5,000  calls a month, 75% of them from heterosexual persons, also needs additional  volunteers.  </P> <P> The dedication will be the occasion for satisfaction, and also for reflection.  There are signs of a diminished public response to the disease, and of a  reduced concern in government, at the very moment when preparations for the  increasing caseload of the next few years are of special importance. Programs  are weakest among blacks, Latinos and intravenous drug users, the very  populations where the risk of rapid spread is greatest. There is, in effect, a  nagging doubt that there will be a continuation of the kind of generous  financial and participatory support given APLA by Nancy Cole Sawaya, for whom  the center is named. She will be represented by her husband at the dedication.  She died in 1986 of an AIDS-related illness.  </P></p>

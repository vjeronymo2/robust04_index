			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Ukrainian president seizes extra powers UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk last night took personal control of the government, appointing his erstwhile rival, prime minister Leonid Kuchma, head of an emergency committee to run the faltering economy. Mr Kravchuk's unilateral action comes amid a week-long strike by miners in eastern Ukraine which has shaken the country's political and economic structures. The presidential decree suggests that Mr Kravchuk and Mr Kuchma, who have been locked in a bitter power struggle for the past month, may have reached a compromise. According to the decree, which could be challenged by the legislature today, Mr Kravchuk is now directly in charge of the cabinet. He has also claimed direct authority over all 'non-economic' branches of the central government, which presumably includes the army and security services. Mr Kuchma is appointed to head an emergency committee to run the economy. The eight-member committee, composed of the top economics ministers and the chairman of the central bank, is charged with controlling inflation and defusing 'emergency situations' in the economic and social spheres. With his decree Mr Kravchuk has granted himself the extra powers parliament refused him a few weeks ago. By putting Mr Kuchma in charge of the emergency economic committee he may succeed in satisfying the prime minister's demands for more power over the economy, which were also rejected by the legislature. Although Mr Kravchuk is increasingly unpopular, Mr Kuchma is one of Ukraine's most trusted politicians. However, parliament, which has been effectively stripped of most of its authority, could challenge the president's move on constitutional grounds.</p>

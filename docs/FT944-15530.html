			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Weaker rule in Germany Despite the robust confidence displayed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday, his margin of victory in Sunday's German elections was uncomfortably narrow. The centre-right coalition's 10-seat Bundestag majority appears insufficient to guarantee passage of tough measures needed to improve Germany's economic structure, particularly cuts in public spending and taxation, and social security reform. Modest recovery from recession will continue, but so will voter disgruntlement caused by cuts in real incomes needed to correct post-unification economic imbalances. Mr Kohl's domestic problems may divert his attention from necessary efforts to show German leadership over European integration. Mr Kohl owes his fourth term in office to his considerable electioneering skills, mistakes by the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), and the innate conservatism of the German electorate, which since the war has never ejected an incumbent government. None the less, there is a risk that the coalition between the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) may not last the full four-year parliamentary mandate. The share of the vote registered on Sunday by both senior parties, the CDU and SPD, was well below the average of the past 30 years. Voting fragmentation, reflected in the strength of the Greens and reformed east German communists (PDS), will make the future policies and alliances of government and opposition prone to complex political arithmetic. Reflecting the shrunken Bundestag majority and the Social Democrats' hold over the Bundesrat, which has a veto over tax legislation, the coalition's power to introduce radical legislative initiatives has now crumbled. It is true that Chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt survived two past legislative periods with similarly slender majorities. However, in 1969 and 1976 the Social Democrats' comparatively fresh coalition with the Free Democrats was probably in a fundamentally stronger state than Mr Kohl's 12-year-old government. Much will depend on how the Free Democrats adjust to the loss of power and prestige caused by a string of election setbacks. Mr Kohl's recent rejection of his coalition partner's calls for tax cuts indicates the FDP's difficulties in maintaining its traditional high profile as an exponent of free market policies. On the other hand, the FDP leadership, knowing that many voters now see it as little more than an ersatz CDU, seems unlikely to risk a trial of strength with Mr Kohl by threatening to defect to the SPD in mid-term. The questions facing the SPD under its chairman and future parliamentary floor-leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, are still more painful. It has lost four successive general elections, and leadership divisions during the recent campaign have left fresh scars. Mr Scharping's task is to mount an energetic yet constructive challenge to Mr Kohl, particularly over economic policy, that will strengthen the SPD's credentials as a party of government. Given the SPD's strength in the Bundesrat, the new government in Bonn will in some ways be behaving like a de facto Grand Coalition. If Mr Scharping can use his leverage wisely, and restrain those within his party wishing an overt alliance with the PDS or the Greens, he may yet reap his reward.</p>

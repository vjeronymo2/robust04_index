			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Treuhand concludes shipyard sale THE Treuhand, the agency responsible for the privatisation of the eastern German economy, yesterday concluded the sale of the big Neptun shipyard located at the northern port of Rostock. The yard, a big lossmaker, was sold partly to Hanse Holding, which is part of the Bremen-based Bremer Vulkan Verbund, and partly through a management buy-out. The Treuhand will take over the debts, which the agency yesterday would not disclose. Although Treuhand officials declined to reveal the selling price, it said Bremer Vulkan was committed to investing DM350m (Dollars 219m) and guaranteeing 1,320 jobs. At present, about 1,450 people are employed at the shipyard, which, before 1989, used to employ more than 7,000. The security of the yard, at least in the short term, might reassure the workforce, which as members of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, have been on strike since last week in support of higher wage claims. Treuhand officials indicated that Bremer Vulkan would not be using the yards specifically for shipbuilding, particularly since there was overcapacity in Germany. However, the yard could provide base for repairs and spare parts.</p>

According to a poll conducted by NIHON  KEIZAI SHIMBUN from 25 to 27 March through telephone interviews  of 3,000 respondents, the support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet  is 47.6 percent, falling 4.9 points from the 52.5 percent  recorded in the previous poll in February. On the contrary, the  percentage of pollees who do not support the administration  increased to 31.7 percent.    The most number of pollees cited "lack of transparency in  the  policymaking process" as their reason for not supporting  Hosokawa's government, reflecting the criticism of and  dissatisfaction with the discord among the ruling coalition  parties; and the abruptness of policy decisions, as evidenced by  the national welfare tax plan, and the cabinet reshuffle fiasco.    Regarding the issue of the prime minister's loan of 100  million yen from the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking company, which  is delaying deliberations on the draft fiscal 1994 budget, as  much as 49.8 percent of respondents believed: "The prime  minister's explanation is not convincing," and "it is dubious."  On the other hand, 80 percent of pollees expressed the opinion  that the Diet should deal with the budget bill immediately.    The Hosokawa cabinet marked a record 69.6 percent support  rating last August, immediately after formation. Its popularity  has declined consistently since then, falling to 52.5 percent in  the February poll conducted after the turmoil over the national  welfare tax plan. The percentage of non-supporters has also  increased steadily in inverse proportion to the support rate.  In the latest poll, this increased by 4.5 points to 31.7  percent. Apparently, the decrease in the percentage of  supporters is directly reflected in the increase in the  percentage of non-supporters.    The top reasons cited by supporters of the administration  (more than one answer allowed) include: "Freshness," 48.2  percent; "because it is a non-Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  coalition administration," 41.8 percent; and "the prime minister  is a trustworthy person," 32.4 percent. On the other hand, only  8.6 percent said its "policies are good;" 7.8 percent  appreciated its "coordination ability;" and 4.6 percent  commended its "stability."    "Lack of transparency in the policymaking process" (53.5  percent) topped the reasons for not supporting the Hosokawa  administration, followed by "poor implementation ability," 49.3  percent; "bad policies," 44.8 percent; and "lack of coordination  ability," 40.6 percent. This seems to reflect the popular  criticism of the prime minister's weak leadership, as seen in  the breakdown of the Japan- U.S. summit talks, and the national  welfare tax commotion; and discontent with the ruling coalition  parties' bureaucrat-led policymaking process.    Regarding the prime minister's loan of 100 million yen from  Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, only 6.3 percent accepted the prime  minister's explanation as "convincing," while 35.8 percent were  "not really satisfied" with his explanation, although they  believed "nothing can be done under the circumstances." On the  other hand, 36.9 percent were of the opinion that "the prime  minister's explanation is not fully convincing," and 12.9  percent even thought that "his explanation is completely  dubious." This shows that while the prime minister claims he  "has answered questions in the Diet in good faith," around half  of the pollees doubted his explanation.    However, regarding the LDP and other groups' refusal to deal  with the draft 1994 budget until they are given a satisfactory  explanation of the 100 million yen affair, only 4 percent  thought "refusing deliberations is the normal thing to do," and  7.7 percent claimed "the refusal is inevitable." In contrast,  53.1 percent expressed the opinion that "although the refusal is  understandable, they should go into deliberations," and 27.2  percent asserted "the refusal is unacceptable; they should go  into deliberations immediately." This means that more than 80  percent of pollees want Diet deliberations on the budget to  start.    Concerning an increase in the consumption tax and other  indirect taxes, 6.3 percent were "in favor," and 46.2 percent  thought "this is inevitable as a revenue source to cover  policies dealing with the aging society," showing a majority  accepts the tax hike.</p>

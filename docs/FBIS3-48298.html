			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii stressed the need Tuesday [25 January] for Japan to  explain the economic measures it is taking at the Japan-U.S.  summit in Washington on February 11.    "It's important for Japan to show its political and economic  policies to President (Bill) Clinton in the sense of Japan-U.S.  friendship," Fujii told reporters after a morning cabinet  meeting. "That includes economic problems," he stressed,  indicating that Japan would compile a stimulus package by the  time the summit is held. But he noted that a timetable for both  the package and budget is "still not decided."    Fujii reiterated that he and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen agreed at a meeting Sunday that a recovery of the  Japanese economy is "extremely important" especially in view of  contributions to world growth [sentence as received]. He said  he told Bentsen to "trust us" and leave the details of measures  to Japan.    As six ministers responsible for economic affairs, including  Fujii, agreed on Monday, he said the government is to focus on  reviving the political reform bills rejected by the House of  Councillors last Friday, and the enactment of those bills would  be the best help now for the economy.    He said his ministry is not considering any measures for the  stock market. Tokyo stock prices recovered slightly Tuesday  morning after a key market index, the Nikkei stock average,  plummeted 954 points Monday, its biggest in two years.    Meanwhile, Fujii rejected Tuesday's comments by Economic  Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota calling for an  income tax cut separately from an increase in the consumption  tax.    "That's her personal opinion," Fujii said, adding that a  decision on the tax issue is being left to a joint economic  forum of the government and the coalition parties.    The ministry has been maintaining that the income tax cut  and  consumption tax hike must be included in the same package of tax  reform bills to guarantee repayment of "bridge" bonds issued to  cover the period until the tax hike.    Concerning reported plans to stimulate the real estate  market  and facilitate liquidation of banks' bad loans on which interest  has been reduced, Fujii said the ministry is now studying  various measures including "securitization" of loans and is in  "the final stage" of mapping out its plan.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Spanish state aids can continue - European Court The European Court of Justice has ruled that Spanish tax exemption provisions benefiting the public sector were state aids. But the Court said the provisions could remain in operation since they predated Spanish membership of the European Community and had not been declared incompatible with the common market by the European Commission under the appropriate procedure. The ECJ gave its ruling in response to questions from a Valencia court relating to the interpretation of the EC competition and state aid rules. The questions arose in the context of a dispute between the Banco de Credito Industrial SA and the Valencia Ayuntamiento over the imposition of a local business tax during the tax years 1983 to 1986. Banco de Credito claimed that it was exempt from all public taxes. The Luxembourg Court clarified a number of preliminary matters before turning to the Spanish court's questions. It noted that Banco de Credito was considered by the Valencia court to be a state company, because of an indirect capital holding by the state. It pointed out that the questions were irrelevant with regard to the tax years 1983, 1984 and 1985, because they predated Spanish accession to the Community. And it said that the factual background of the case indicated that only the Treaty rules on state aids were relevant to the national litigation. Accordingly, the ECJ redefined the questions referred. It said the Spanish court was really asking whether treaty rules governing the public sector read together with the prohibition of state aids precluded the application of a national law granting a tax exemption to public sector businesses. The ECJ held that, although such national laws were state aids, they could continue in operation so long as the Commission had not declared the aids incompatible in accordance with the procedure applicable under the treaty to existing aids. The Court confirmed that the state aid rules apply to public and private business alike, subject only to the exception available to the provision of public services of a general economic interest. It said that a measure whereby certain businesses were granted a tax exemption not available to others constituted a state aid. Where such an aid was of a type to affect trade between member countries and to restrict competition, it was incompatible with the common market unless it could benefit from the exceptions provided for by the treaty state aid rules. However, the system for monitoring state aids set up under the treaty requires constant review of aids by the Commission, which is responsible therefore for declaring the incompatibility of aids, subject to the control of the Court, in accordance with the applicable procedures. The Commission's powers extend to aids granted to public sector businesses, and in particular to those to which member countries have entrusted the provision of services of a general economic interest. The distinction made between the procedure applicable to existing and new aids applies equally. The ECJ said that, since the aid in question was created prior to Spain's accession to the Community, it was to be categorised as an existing aid. In accordance with the Court's case law, existing aids may continue in operation so long as the Commission has not declared them incompatible. Consequently, it followed that, so long as the Commission had not declared an existing aid incompatible, it was not necessary to examine if, and to what extent, the aid could escape the treaty prohibition of state aids under the public sector exception available to businesses entrusted with the provision of services of a general economic interest.

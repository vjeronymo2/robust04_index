			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Arts: Bastille a witness to dancers' pride - Ballet The Palais Garnier is closed for refurbishment, and the Paris Opera Ballet has moved for this season to the Bastille Opera. I think the Bastille a wonderful house: habitues complain about the constant need to go up and down stairs, but it is an airy, grand and welcoming place in which to see the lyric arts, and magnificently planned for its public. To mark the start of the ballet season in its new home, the first programme  -Balanchine and Robbins choreographies - begins with a Grand Defile. Impossible to reproduce that sense of infinity we know with a defile at the Palais Garnier as the cohorts of school and company process from the chandeliered and mirrored depths of the Foyer de la Danse - the line may not stretch to the crack of doom, but it goes back, symbolically speaking, to the age of Louis XIV, founder of this temple. But Francoise Seguin has devised a setting which cleverly echoes the Bastille's architecture to provide a comparable idea of a long tradition. A curved perspective leads down a ramp on to the stage. There we first see a petit rat, who takes a simple pose and leads on the girls from the school as the march from Les Troyens rings out. There follow the female ranks of the company, each led by an etoile, then the boys of the school, and the men of the troupe, each grade led by a star. Masses of applause, and splendidly stellar behaviour from the etoiles as they reach the front of the stage at slightly hastened pace to greet their adoring public with smiles and glances imperious or beguiling. It is irresistible as spectacle, and how revealing about the pride of the dancers and of the French public - and the French public purse - in the Opera as a spiffing example of a nation's art. Would we could feel the same about our national ballet, its funding and its popular image. The parade over, we had the joys of two Balanchine works - Le Palais de Cristal and Four Temperaments - and Jerome Robbins' Glass Pieces. Le Palais de Cristal is the Opera's very own Balanchine, made in 1947 when the choreographer was resident in Paris. It is known elsewhere as the white and sparkling Bizet Symphony in C. But at its creation in Paris it had a highly coloured and complex design by Leonor Fini, and was danced in a manner more  -shall we say? - temperamental than we know nowadays with New York City Ballet. (Its original cast included Tamara Toumanova in the adagio, Lycette Darsonval, Micheline Bardin, Madeleine Lafon - each a vivid personality.) Their example, the Fini costumes and the original Balanchine text, linger on. At Tuesday night's opening of the season, Monique Loudieres gave a most beguiling account of the second movement adagio, deploying the complete ballerina battery of technique, personality and a femininity that coloured every movement. It was an irresistible and enchanting performance, the epitome of a particular charm and grace of manner. The piece looked very good in this Parisian version. The succeeding Four Temperaments was no less fine on the absolute and uncompromising terms of New York's Balanchine. As if to prove her versatility, Mlle Loudieres danced the 'Sanguine' duet with ideal clarity, well partnered by Jean-Yves Lormeau. Kader Belarbi as Melancholic, Patrick Dupond as Phlegmatic, Carole Arbo as Choleric, caught the style well. After nearly half a century, Four Temperaments still looked inevitable and prophetic in this performance. Robbins' Glass Pieces, which closed the bill, might have been made for the Bastille stage. The graph-paper setting matches the house's architecture. The mechanical crossing and re-crossing of the stage that start the piece are matched by the crowds on the Place de la Bastille or in the Metro. It is an oddly heartless and urgent work, and Robbins gives the driving repetitions of Philip Glass' music a human intensity. It is a ballet I admire rather than like, but the Opera cast are superb, robot-like or - in the pas de deux well done by Marie-Claude Pietragalla and Jean-Marie Didiere - hieratically moving. Vaut le voyage. The Paris Opera Ballet repeats the programme on October 31, November 1,4,6 matinee, 8,10,12,15,18, at the Bastille.</p>

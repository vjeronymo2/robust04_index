			<p>BFN     [Text] China will exercise its veto power should the UN  Security Council [UNSC] decide on sanctions regarding North  Korea's nuclear problem.    In a meeting with Beijing-based ROK correspondents today [10  May], a high-ranking PRC official said that China is making  diplomatic efforts, including behind-the-scenes contacts, so  that dialogue between North Korea and the United States are  realized before 15 May, the deadline for allowing inspections of  the International Atomic Energy Agency.    This official, however, stressed that the Chinese Government  position opposes using pressure on North Korea as a method for  solving the problem. He strongly suggested that China will  exercise its veto power when the North Korean nuclear problem is  referred to the UN Security Council.</p>

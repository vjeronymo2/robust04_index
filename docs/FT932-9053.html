			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Dresdner Bank profits up by 15% GROUP operating profits at Dresdner Bank rose by 'around 15 per cent' in the first four months of 1993, Mr Wolfgang Roller, the bank's outgoing chief executive told shareholders yesterday. At his last shareholders' meeting before Mr Jurgen Sarrazin takes over as chief executive of Germany's second biggest bank, Mr Roller said that there had been 'substantial' gains in the profits generated by own-account securities trading and fee-based services. Commission income grew by 20 per cent, he said, while interest income remained steady over the four months. For the whole of 1992 total operating profits rose 13.1 per cent to DM2.81bn (Dollars 1.7bn), as reported last month. Mr Roller gave no figures for the first third of the year but it is likely that total operating profits were in the region of DM1.1bn for the period. This is a 15 per cent increase on one third of last year's total profit - the format the bank traditionally uses to calculate profit increases for less than a full year. Mr Roller said it was too early to draw definitive conclusions about the result for the year as a whole. although he said that from today's perspective profits would be 'good'. He said the pattern of the early months was likely to be repeated over the rest of the year, with 'restrained' growth in credit business offset by growth in fee-earnings business. The figures confirm that the German banking sector has made a good start to 1993 after a record 1992, as indicated earlier this month when Commerzbank, Germany's third biggest bank, reported total operating profits up 25.2 per cent to DM651m for the first quarter of the year. The impetus for growth has come from good conditions in the German bond and equity markets rather than strong lending. Credit business has slowed down sharply, reflecting the delayed impact of the Bundesbank's tough interest rate regime as well as the deterioration in the economy. Moreover, the operating profits disclosed by the banks take no account of the worsening credit environment in Germany which is giving rise to higher provisioning for bad and doubtful debts. BHF, the Frankfurt-based merchant bank, reported separately that partial operating profits - excluding trading results - rose by 7 per cent in the first four months of the year.</p>

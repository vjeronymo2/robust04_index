The Pakistani team  renewed a call for an Egyptian security delegation to visit  regions in Pakistan suspected of being strongholds for  extremists, to make sure that no such activities currently  exist. The delegation stressed that Pakistan is eager for  Egypt's stability and security and will not allow on its  territory any person that may harm them.    The sources stressed that over the past two months, Pakistan  has deported hundreds of Arab students who were illegally  residing in that country. The sources told AL-AHRAM  correspondent Yahya Ghanim that the Pakistani authorities gave  those Arabs--including Egyptians, Tunisians, and Algerians who  took part in the war in Afghanistan--one month to leave the  country; the deadline has expired.    In a related development, official Pakistani sources said it  is likely that Pakistan will sign extradition agreements with  Egypt, Tunisia, and Algeria.</p>

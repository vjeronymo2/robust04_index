			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Small business welcomes untangling of red tape: Government takes steps to cut bureaucracy - Insitute of Directors concerned over the patchy nature of proposed measures BUSINESS organisations and owners of small businesses last night welcomed the government's drive to reduce red tape but said a lot of hard work would be necessary for it to have any significant impact. Some were disappointed at the trivial nature of some of the 56 measures which government departments said they had already taken or were planning to implement. The Department of Employment, responsible for health and safety legislation, mentioned steps to remove the regulation specifying the distance between clothes pegs in changing rooms. 'There are items on the list which are surprising,' said Mr Ian Peters, deputy director of policy at the Confederation of British Industry. 'If that is the extent of the lists departments can come up with it demonstrates the significance of what remains to be done.' The Forum of Private Business described the programme as 'a good start' but called for the government to compensate small businesses for the cost of administering regulations until significant reductions in the burden of red tape had been made. The plan to establish seven task forces of businesspeople to re-examine existing legislation was welcome as long as small businesses were properly represented. 'We hope small business owners will make up 96 per cent of the committee members because that is their share of the business community,' said Mr Stan Mendham, the forum's chief executive. Ms Jane Lyon, managing director of Clam-Brummer, a manufacturer of industrial adhesives, said she would welcome the opportunity to sit on the relevant task force. 'The people who live with the regulations day in, day out are the people who know the costs they impose on industry,' she said. Some business owners said they feared that the task forces would be composed only of 'the great and the good'. I fear it will be a case of the old pals act,' said Mr Bud Ellis, managing director of Flexi-Pak, a food packaging company with annual sales of Pounds 1.3m. 'It is absolutely vital that the little fellow gets a look-in.' One worry was that the creation of the task forces would put an additional burden on the business community. 'What is really important is to change the culture in government so we don't need all these panels,' said Mr Peters. Of concern to the Institute of Directors was the patchy nature of the list of actions or proposed actions from the different ministries. 'Some departments have done more than others,' commented Mr Ian Smedley, responsible for deregulation policy at the institute. He expressed surprise that no mention had been made of any plan to abolish or modify the requirement that small companies have their accounts audited since this was the responsibility of Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister at the Department of Trade and Industry and the junior minister responsible for the deregulation programme. Much more needed to be done in the areas of pollution control and health and safety, while no reference was made to plans to reduce the number of licences needed to start up in certain business areas, he noted. The institute said it was pleased to see that the government intended to link its deregulation programme with the Citizen's Charter. This would require government departments to promise to respond to requests from business and the public within agreed time limits. Mr Smedley said he was also encouraged by the news that the Department of Social Security was reviewing eliminating the differences between the definition of earnings for the purposes of PAYE and National Insurance. Payroll administration is a heavy burden for small businesses and this would simplify matters, he said.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: So you want to set up a trust . . . - Caroline Garnham explains how they work and their varied uses FOR MANY, a trust is an alien concept shrouded in legal mumbo-jumbo. But a trust can be used effectively to overcome many complex practical problems to avoid tax legitimately, in Britain and elsewhere and preserve and protect wealth. The box shows the many and varied uses of trusts. Although their purposes may differ widely, the basic principles and rules governing them are more or less the same. There are three parties to a trust: the settlor, the trustees, and the beneficiaries. The settlor The role of the settlor, whether a munificent grandfather or a reluctant employer, is to provide the funds and dictate his or her wishes via the trust deed. Before setting up a trust, you must know why you want to do so; who should benefit, even in unusual circumstances such as family members dying out of chronological order; the work, obligations and functions of the trustees; the scope of the trustees' investment powers (even if not immediately exercisable); and the scope of their liability. Certainly, you should never sign a trust deed for which you have not given instructions or do not understand the contents. It is also not advisable to allow your trustee to draw up a trust deed for you unless you are advised separately. Trustees are concerned to limit their liability, whereas your concern is to keep the trustees on their toes. There is, therefore, a conflict of interest. As a settlor, you should also be clear in your mind before starting about the consequences of setting up a trust. The settlor and tax The two taxes of which you should be most wary are capital gains (CGT) and inheritance tax (IHT). CGT is chargeable on a gift, regardless of how little or how much money changes hands. The gain is calculated according to the market value of the funds being transferred. But there are exceptions and deferrals depending on: 1. Your status as the settlor. If you are not resident in the UK, you will not have to pay CGT. If you are resident but not domiciled, tax is not payable if the assets transferred are physically outside the UK at the time they are transferred into the trust. 2. What property is being transferred. There are exemptions for heritage or business property, and for a main residence. IHT is not usually payable on lifetime gifts unless you die within seven years. There is, however, one important exception. IHT is payable if property is put into a discretionary trust, other than an accumulation and maintenance trust, even if the trust is offshore. A discretionary trust is one where the trustees are allowed to pay the income to one or more people and/or when the trustees can accumulate the income. An accumulation and maintenance trust is a form of discretionary trust but it is different for IHT purposes so long as certain conditions are met. One is that all the beneficiaries must be under 25. The 1992 Finance Act introduced two important exemptions to IHT for business property and agricultural property, which now attract 100 per cent relief. Finding a trustee As a settlor, you choose the trustees. A good trustee is usually someone who is not only skilled at managing the trust assets but would take a keen interest in the well-being of the beneficiaries. So, it is advisable for trustees to have regular meetings to discuss the needs of the beneficiaries and the state of the investments. Virtually anyone can be a trustee, including the settlor and their spouse. In some cases, it will be necessary to appoint a professional trustee. You should ask them not only what their professional qualifications are for managing the trust fund but how they would keep in touch with the needs and circumstances of the beneficiaries. The duties of trustees are determined by law and the trust deed. But, briefly, they have a duty to manage the trust with as much care as an ordinary prudent man of business would use in the management of his own affairs. They also have a duty to pay the right sum to the right beneficiaries. If they mismanage the funds and make a loss, or pay the wrong amount to the wrong person, they could be forced to make up any shortfall from their own pockets. Unless there is a provision within the trust deed, they cannot expect to be paid for their services. The trustees are also liable for the tax on the trust fund. The amount depends on several factors including what type of trust it is; whether the settlor is also a beneficiary; whether the trust can be revoked; whether the children of the settlor can benefit, and what ages they are; where the trust is resident, etc. The tax system in the UK is well defined and clear, albeit somewhat unexpected on occasions. For example, if you set up a trust offshore and remain non-UK domiciled, the trust will be free of CGT and IHT provided the fund is kept outside the UK. The situation becomes more confused when trusts are used by people in countries which do not understand the concept of a trust. More and more people are trying to take advantage of this confusion in their home country; as a result, trusts are now being set up by residents of European countries and elsewhere as part of local tax-planning schemes. Beneficiaries If you are a beneficiary, you have probably the least active and most rewarding role in the trust. Apart from a right to call for information about its administration, and to sue the trustees for breach of trust, you need do little except wait until the money comes in. Invariably, tax is not payable, unless you also are the settlor, until the money is received. If there is some flexibility in the trust, it might be possible to defer receipt of your share until you are non-UK resident so that tax can be avoided. But before embarking on any such scheme, you should first check to see whether, by saving British tax, you do not fall foul of another country's tax regime as a result. Legal status of trusts A trust is very different from any other legal concept. It is not a separate legal entity, like a company or a Lichtenstein foundation; nor is it based on the law of contract. In countries which do not understand the legal concept of a trust, like Switzerland, the rights of a beneficiary can be difficult to enforce unless the trust is expressed to be governed by a law which recognises trusts, such as UK law. The trust is also a different legal concept from that of agency. If I give you my property to sell as my agent, I can at any time cancel this arrangement and demand my property back. The same is not true of a trust. The main difference between a trust and an agency is that the trustee owns the property legally, even though he does not own it for himself. It is important, therefore, that where a trust is used to avoid tax, the settlor is not seen to create an agency by controlling the trustees.

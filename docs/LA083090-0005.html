			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER BUSH'S ACTIONS IN PERSIAN GULF  </P> <P> Clark's column capped an unusually newsy day. Beyond the pornographic promises  and the pathetic head-patting, Clark made clear that Bush has been puttering  around on more than a golf course.  </P> <P> It remains grotesque, as Bush continues his vacation and Hussein tries to win  "Iraqi's Funniest Hostage Videos," that both presidents are operating as  mavericks.  </P> <P> America does have a Constitution to determine how we engage our military. Is it  unreasonable to shout for a congressional vote in this darkened theater of war?  Congress still has the power to overturn Bush's decision, and it would be good  for Americans to see our President's hand so slapped. After all, the defense  budget has already been saved, so let's save some lives.  </P> <P> BRAD S. BARNES  </P> <P> Lakewood  </P></p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Question of two-way traffic Viewers in the UK and the rest of Europe who think they can do better than television game show contestants are about to get the chance to prove it - and win prizes as well, writes Raymond Snoddy. Interactive Network, a UK-based company set up by Bill Andrewes, a former senior executive of the Granada group, plans to launch trials in July of what it calls Two Way Television. Two Way TV plans to make television interactive by piggy-backing on existing programmes such as the Blockbusters quiz show or live sport. A range of Two Way TV games can also be loaded into the set-top box that operates the system. The communication link is not provided by cable or 'superhighways' but, like teletext, uses the blank lines in the television picture. Interactive Network has developed technical concepts licenced from the US and believes it will be offering the first interactive TV of its kind in Europe. The company has developed a simple push button keypad and mouse to enable viewers to register their answers to the questions in a quiz show. Scores then go up on the screen. Families can simply play against each other or have their scores sent automatically by freephone to a central computer which pick the winners. There will be top prizes of Pounds 1,000 to make the games interesting. The system will be launched in the UK later this year or early next and there is already considerable interests from other European countries. Prices have not yet been fixed but the set-top box and four keypads will probably cost between Pounds 160-Pounds 180. A monthly subscription will cost about Pounds 6, with a complete rental package available in the region of Pounds 12. As former chairman of Granada Rental, Andrewes says he is very aware how slowly consumers generally take up new technology. 'This is a first little step towards interactive TV.' He has already raised Pounds 4m for the venture and is in the process of raising a further Pounds 10m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch from correspondent Larry Jagan] </F>   [Text] According to news from the Thai-Burma border, the  Karen National Union [KNU] has detained Moe Thee Zun and 11  members of his group which had split from the Burmese students  movement. According to the report, the students were invited to  a meeting by Karen leaders at a place 45 minutes by boat on the  river from their camp. When they arrived in Manerplaw, Karen  soldiers took the students to a guerrilla training camp near  their headquarters.    KNU leader, General Mya, in the presence of top-level KNU  officials, told the students group that the KNU would hold  cease- fire talks as planned with the Burmese Government.  Furthermore, Gen. Mya informed the student group not to  obstruct or protest against the talks in any way and told them  to watch from the sidelines. The students on their part had  consistently opposed peace talks with the Burmese Government.    According to an opposition source at the border, the 12  students are still being detained. The KNU spokesman in Bangkok  has denied the report on the above incident. He said the  incident was merely a repercussion of the split within the ABSDF  [All Burma Students Democratic Front] since 1991. There has  been tension between the DAB [Democratic Alliance of Burma] and  the students group in recent months. The DAB, which was formed  with 15 opposition organizations, includes the  goverment-in-exile headed by Dr. Sein Win.    According to reports received in the past week, the students  group had been openly voicing their criticism following the  agreement by four major armed ethnic organizations and the  Burmese Government to hold peace talks. The group was reported  to have severely criticized the Karen organization for its talks  at the DAB emergency meeting held in Manerplaw this week. At  the same time, some members of the armed students organization,  the All Burma Students Democratic Front [ABSDF], were reported  to have left Karen territory with their weapons without  informing the Karens. KNU officers have told the students to  return the weapons they have armed them with.    According to an additional report, the Karenni Progressive  Party is reported to have disarmed the ABSDF faction which had  been staying with the Karenni organization.</p>

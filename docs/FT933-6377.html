			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Speculators drive gold price lower GOLD PLUNGED through Dollars 370 a troy ounce in late trading yesterday as New York speculators made a concerted effort to drive the price down. Their efforts triggered more selling orders from investement funds that use computer programmes to limit their losses. The gold price closed in London down Dollars 3.75 at Dollars 367.50 an ounce. 'This is a very quiet time for the market and there is not much physical demand, so the market is being driven by technical factors - and the technicals look horrible,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Company, part of the Deutsche Bank group. He suggested that, if gold fell below Dollars 360 an ounce, the next level of technical support was Dollars 330. On the other hand, the price needed to stay above Dollars 380 for a day or two if the present downward trend was to be reversed. Gold has risen from a seven-year low of Dollars 327 an ounce in January to touch Dollars 409 in early August, its highest level since the outbreak of the Gulf war in January, 1991. Mr Bielski said that fundamentally gold was still looking good with jewellery demand still outpacing output from the world's mines. Also, the central bank selling which had bedevilled the market last year, had virtually dried up. Palladium's price continued to fall sharply yesterday as the investment funds that helped drive the metal up from Dollars 90 an ounce in late-1992 to a four-year peak of Dollars 146 in July turned into sellers at a time of seasonally weak physical demand. Palladium was fixed in London at Dollars 122.50 an ounce, down about Dollars 6.25 from Wednesday. The metal is used mainly for anti-pollution car catalysts and by the electronics and dental industries. Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of Johnson Matthey's platinum group metals market surveys, said physical supply of palladium was tight and JM still expected a supply deficit this year. He suspected that the Japanese had been hoarding physical metal because 'the yen price has been pretty low'.</p>

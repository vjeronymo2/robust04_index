			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Week Ahead BET, the business services conglomerate, is likely to report pre-tax profits sharply down on Monday at about Pounds 110m after an extremely tough year in joinery, personnel and plant hire. The market is expecting a halved full-year dividend. Exceptional charges could be as much as double analysts' highest expectations of about Pounds 50m. The electricity utilities results season begins in earnest with three of the regional supply companies and one generator set to report substantially increased profits. On Monday, analysts expect East Midlands Electricity to announce a historic cost pre-tax profit of around Pounds 145m, up 37 per cent. Norweb, expected to show the biggest rise in profits of the 12 regional companies, reports on Tuesday. Its profit is expected to more than double to Pounds 128m. On the same day, National Power, the largest privatised generator, should announce a profit of around Pounds 510m, from Pounds 434m last year. On Thursday, Manweb's is expected to increase by around 75 per cent to Pounds 95m. Severn Trent, the only privatised water and sewage company to report next week, is likely to reveal a 6 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 263m. Although profits from water and sewage are expected to be well ahead, attention will focus on Biffa, the waste management company acquired last year from BET for Pounds 212m. Hazlewood Foods, the Derby-based food manufacturer, is expected to reveal flat profits of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 52m for the year to March 31 in its results on Tuesday. This is in spite of the Pounds 34.7m agreed offer for its rival Sutherland at the end of July. Cable and Wireless, the UK-based international telecommunications group, is expected to announce on Wednesday that pre-tax profits for the year end to March increased from Pounds 609m to Pounds 640. However, a higher tax charge is likely to be primarily responsible for a slight fall in earnings per share.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Major plays down differences in first meeting with Clinton MR JOHN MAJOR last night sought to underpin British relations with the new US administration in a first encounter with President Bill Clinton dominated by trade issues, the continuing crisis in Bosnia and the precarious progress of economic reform in Russia. As the prime minister met Mr Clinton at the White House, he brushed aside suggestions that foreign and economic policy shifts under the new administration would undermine the close relations established during 12 years of Republican rule. Describing his differences with the US administration as 'tiny' compared with their shared interests, Mr Major was clearly relieved at the White House's apparent willingness to play down the help offered by the Conservative party for former President George Bush's election campaign. However, new sources of friction between Washington and London emerged with demands from nearly 50 representatives and senators for Mr Clinton to play an active role in the affairs of Northern Ireland. In letters sent to the president to coincide with Mr Major's visit, the members of Congress, including Senators Edward Kennedy and Daniel Moynihan, referred to continuing 'human rights abuses' by British security forces in the province. The charge, dismissed by senior aides travelling with Mr Major, put a new focus on President Clinton's campaign pledge to send an emissary to Ulster. Yesterday Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the House of Representatives, said he had not been approached by the president to carry out the task. Mr Major set as his priority for the White House talks to persuade President Clinton to give new momentum to the stalled Gatt world trade talks. After a series of meetings with senior administration officials, including Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, the prime minister emphasised to Mr Clinton the dangers of a long extension of the deadline for 'fast-track' congressional approval of a global trade deal. Mr Major wants the extension planned by Mr Clinton to last no more than six, or at most, nine months to ensure the momentum of negotiations is maintained. Reviewing with Mr Bentsen the agenda for Saturday's meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers in London, Mr Major stressed that completion of the Uruguay round of trade talks would provide the most powerful boost available to the world economy. Mr Major dismissed fears that Mr Clinton's recent rhetoric on trade issues heralded a new retreat into protectionism by Washington. But he voiced European fears that new US tariffs on steel imports and a threat to impose higher tariffs on 'sports utility vehicles' could lead to 'tit-for-tat' retaliation. The planned tariff on imports of utility vehicles would threaten Land Rover of the UK's sales to the US, even though its prime aim would be to restrict Japanese imports. In foreign policy discussions dominated by Bosnia and the former Soviet Union, Mr Major suppressed private scepticism to offer backing for Mr Clinton's plan to air-drop humanitarian supplies into eastern Bosnia. But he stressed Britain's view that resumption of the stalled peace talks between the warring factions in the former Yugoslav province offered the only durable prospect for a settlement.</p>

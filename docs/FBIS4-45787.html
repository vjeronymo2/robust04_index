			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Peter Kudlicza: "It's Touch and Go </F> with the Austrian Recyclers: Financial Crisis in Packaging  Recycling"]    [Text] VDI-N, Vienna, 15 April 1994 - Six months  after the Austrian packaging ordinance was put into effect,  private industry's ARA collection and utilization system has  become stuck in the same kind of difficulties as its German  counterpart DSD (Dual System Deutschland) did earlier.  Environmental Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat (Austrian People's  Party) has been inundated with criticism both from the  opposition parties as well as from the coalition party--the  Socialist Party of Austria. Meanwhile, the "industrial branch  recycling companies" are teetering precariously on the brink of  bankruptcy.    The efficient use of packagings and the reuse of packaging  waste, which today in Austria amounts to about 1.5 million tons,  are the goals of the Austrian packaging ordinance. It obligates  suppliers to take back the sales and transport packagings and  either return them to the original supplier, reuse them, or  otherwise utilize them. Businesses can free themselves from this  obligation by concluding a license contract with Altstoff  Recycling Austria AG (ARA) and paying a license fee. In exchange  for which, ARA takes over the packaging waste materials and  finds ways of utilizing them.    This initiative, under the motto "less government-more  private industry," came under ideological crossfire almost  immediately. The Social Democrats would prefer governmental  regulation with a packaging duty rather than a system run by  private industry.    The problems manifested themselves in early February.  Austria  Glass Recycling (AGR), an affiliate of ARA responsible for the  collection of used glass products, found itself on the verge of  financial collapse with a budgetary deficit of 70 million  schillings. At the same time, ARA was already rumored to be  threatened by a billion schilling deficit in its budget. The  head of ARA, Christian Stiglitz, complained that "no one could  realistically expect that a project like this, which in its  first six months has undergone such growth, would be immune to  some developmental disruptions." The development of the "Mega  Project," he continued, has proceeded most promisingly to now.  In just six months, some 6,000 companies throughout Austria have  contracted with ARA. In the case of Germany, only 15,600  contracts had been signed in three and a half years.    The first balance sheet, published on 1 March, showed a  brisk  income of about 2.2 billion schillings (DM 315 million), for  1994. Another 300 million schillings are expected this year  through the acquisition of new license partners, so that about  2.5 million schillings instead of the originally planned 4  million schillings, are available for collection and utilization  purposes.    Christian Stiglitz asserts that the main reason for the  "current income shortfall" is the large number of "free  loaders," i.e., companies that take advantage of the ARA system  without paying for it. Sharp action will now be taken against  such companies. In cases where new cost estimates are the  problem, rate charge restructuring will have to be considered.    In view of the crisis, Socialist Party member Josef Cap is  demanding that "the packaging ordinance be lifted for an  unspecified period of time so that the ARA can reexamine its  operating conditions." As in Germany, the system is on the brink  of bankruptcy because of inadequate control- and  sanction-mechanisms.    Franz Floss believes that the present disposal system is not  able to fulfill its own ecological intention of damming up the  flood of waste. The spokesman of the Greens fears that the  consumers will be called upon to make up for the losses.    On the other hand, Environmental Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat  hopes that the ARA will be able to save some 700 million  schillings (DM 100 million) through replanning. The difference  remaining to close the 1.2 billion schilling deficit in the ARA  balance--only 500 million schillings--could be realized through  discounts and deferment of payments of the disposal operation  (200 million schillings), advance payments and liability  transfers to the economy (200 million schillings, and other  similar measures taken by the cities and communities.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' DIVISION I;  </P> <P> LESLIE GETS 21 TO LEAD MORNINGSIDE TO TITLE  </P> <P> Junior center Lisa Leslie of Morningside High School fashioned a different  ending from last season Saturday in leading her team to the State Division I  girls' basketball championship at the Oakland Coliseum.  </P> <P> Leslie, a 6-foot 5-inch Parade All-American, led Morningside to a 60-50 victory  over Oakland Fremont with 21 points, 14 rebounds and four blocked shots.  </P> <P> Last season, Leslie missed a six-foot jumper at the buzzer as Morningside fell  to Fremont in the State final, 53-52.  </P> <P> But Leslie, who averages 25 points, 14 rebounds and seven blocked shots, was  overwhelming Saturday.  </P> <P> "We really felt hurt last year," she said. "It didn't matter to us how much we  won by, we just wanted to win."  </P> <P> Morningside (32-1), ranked No. 1 in the state, won its final 23 games. The  Monarchs' only loss was to Southern High of Louisville, Ky.  </P> <P> "We expect to beat everybody we play," Morningside Coach Frank Scott said.  "That's the attitude I've instilled in them, that there's nobody that can beat  them. This is a very young and hungry team."  </P> <P> With 3:34 left Morningside held an 11-point lead after sophomore guard Bridget  Williams made a three-pointer.  </P> <P> The Tigers (26-5), ranked No. 3 in the state, never got within 10 after that.  Besides, Leslie, Morningside's strong inside offense and aggressive defense  were too much for Fremont. "They just out-hustled us up and down the court.  They played very well," Fremont Coach Lola Smith said."  </P> <P> Despite its dominance in the second half, Morningside started slowly.  </P> <P> "I guess we were so anxious," said Morningside guard JoJo Witherspoon, the  team's only senior. "But, you know, once we got going, we got going."  </P> <P> The Monarchs went scoreless for periods of two and three minutes during the  first quarter. It wasn't until the start of the second quarter, when they went  on an 8-0 run, that they showed signs of life.  </P> <P> The Monarchs were helped by 12 Fremont turnovers and the Tigers' poor  free-throw shooting (5-of-13) in the first half.  </P> <P> Morningside took advantage and followed its 8-0 run with six unanswered points  and with 2:21 left in the half the Monarchs held an 11-point lead, 34-23, after  Witherspoon's runaway layup.  </P> <P> Leslie, who had 19 points in the first half, scored twice after that, on a  layin and a six-foot jumper, to give Morningside a 13-point lead at the break.  </P> <P> Fremont was led by Senior Priscilla Smith's 13 points and nine rebounds.  Witherspoon scored nine and freshman forward Janet Davis and Williams each  scored eight for the Monarchs.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> STATEMENT OF BASIS AND PURPOSE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Overview of the Original Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission promulgated the original Rule on September 24, 1982, making it fully effective on April 30, 1984. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission's decision to promulgate the Rule was appealed, and was subsequently affirmed in Harry &amp; Bryant Co. v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  FTC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Funeral Rule declares it an unfair or deceptive act or practice for funeral providers to: (1) fail to furnish price information to funeral consumers; (2) require consumers to purchase items they do not desire to buy; and (3) embalm deceased human remains for a fee without authorization. The Rule further declares it a deceptive practice for funeral providers to misrepresent: (1) the necessity for embalming, caskets for cremation, and grave vaults or grave liners; (2) legal and cemetery requirements; (3) preservation and protection capabilities of funeral goods and services; and (4) cash advance charges for items arranged for by the funeral provider on the consumer's behalf. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The Rule had two effective dates. Those portions of the Rule that prohibit certain oral or written representations became effective on January 1, 1984. 48 FR 45537 (Oct. 6, 1983). The remainder of the Rule_the portions imposing affirmative obligations on funeral providers_became effective on April 30, 1984. Id. The effective date of &sect;453.3(b)(1)(ii) of the Rule was changed from January 1, 1984 to April 30, 1984. 49 FR 564 (Jan. 5, 1984).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  726 F.2d 993 (4th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 820 (1984). The Court held that the Funeral Rule did not, as alleged, exceed the Commission's authority under &sect;&sect;5 and 18 of the FTC Act and did not violate funeral directors' First Amendment rights of commercial free speech.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To prevent those practices and to correct consumers' misimpressions, the Rule contains several remedial requirements. The Rule requires that funeral providers: (1) Disclose written price information by means of a General Price List (``GPL''), Casket Price List (``CPL''), and an outer burial container price list (``OBC&hyph;PL'') to persons who inquire in person about funeral arrangements or the prices of funeral goods and services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;&sect;453.2(b)(2)-(4)); <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (2) Give purchasers a written statement, after they have selected funeral goods and services, containing the prices for each of the items selected, the total price for the funeral arrangements selected, price estimates or actual costs, if known, for cash advance items, and any legal, cemetery or crematory requirements that compel the purchase of any items or services for the particular funeral (&sect;453.2(b)(5));  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The Rule permits providers to incorporate the information from the casket and outer burial container price lists in the general price list. This combined list also must be offered to persons who inquire in person about funeral arrangements or the prices of funeral goods and services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Affirmatively disclose to telephone callers who inquire about funeral ``terms, prices or conditions'' that price information is available over the telephone (&sect;453.2(b)(1)(i)); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Disclose specific price information over the telephone to persons who call and request it (&sect;453.2(b)(1)(ii)); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Make truthful representations about legal and other requirements that compel the purchase of particular items or services (&sect;453.3));  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Allow consumers to select and purchase only those goods and services they desire (rather than offering goods and services only in predetermined packages) (&sect;453.4(b)); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Seek express approval before embalming the deceased for a fee (&sect;453.5));  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Make truthful representations about the preservative and protective value of funeral goods and services (&sect;453.3(e));  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Disclose that they charge a fee for obtaining cash advance items, if that is the case (&sect;453.3(f)); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Make unfinished wood boxes or alternative containers available for direct cremation, if the provider offers direct cremation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;453.4(a)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU ASKED ABOUT . . .: CORRECT METHODS FOR MEASURING BROWN SUGAR  </P> <P> Question: When a recipe calls for brown sugar, is it always packed into the  measuring cup or spoon?  </P> <P> Answer: Yes, brown sugar should be packed into measuring cups and spoons with  your fingers until even with the rim. The packing should be firm enough so when  the measuring tool is inverted, the brown sugar is released and holds its  shape.  </P> <P> Q: After using liquid pectin successfully for many years, I decided to try the  powdered kind after a relative told me she preferred it. The results for me  were more like a disaster. I have several jars of orange marmalade that would  have to be eaten with a spoon.  </P> <P> Is there any way I can salvage this, such as cooking it slowly for a long time  or adding more pectin? I hate to throw away this good fruit and sugar and would  appreciate any help you can give me.  </P> <P> A: According to the University of California Agricultural Extension Service  pamphlet "Making Jellies, Jams and Preserves," too-soft jellies sometimes can  be improved by recooking. You might have success with orange marmalade using  their method, recooking only four to six cups at a time.  </P> <P> Measure the jelly to be recooked. For each quart of jelly, measure one-quarter  cup sugar, one-quarter cup water and four teaspoons powdered pectin. Combine  pectin and water. Boil, stirring constantly to prevent scorching. Add jelly and  sugar. Stir thoroughly. Bring to a full rolling boil over high heat, stirring  constantly. Boil mixture hard for one-half minute. Remove from heat, skim, pour  into hot containers, and seal.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that powdered pectin should not be substituted in recipes  developed for liquid pectin and vice versa. This may have been the cause of  your original problem.  </P> <P>  Address questions on food preparation to You Asked About . . ., Food Section,  The Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.

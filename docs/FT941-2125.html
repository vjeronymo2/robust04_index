			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong in retreat Hong Kong was in retreat last week as a combination of economic and political developments at home and abroad conspired against it. The fall-out was felt elsewhere in south-east Asia as Singapore and Malaysia also registered sharp declines. Japan, on the other hand, pulled ahead as foreign investors, particularly in the US, rebuilt their holdings. Mr Michael Franklin at James Capel comments that much of Hong Kong's recent decline is the result of US selling of futures, and arbitrage activity. Europeans remained sellers, but on a much smaller scale, while Japanese investors were largely absent ahead of their fiscal year end. He says technical assessment suggests that if the Hang Seng index is not able to consolidate around the current 8,700 level, then the next obvious support would be around 7,700. The latest James Capel global strategy note says there are six major concerns facing the market: rising US interest rates; the risk of a hard landing for the Chinese economy; succession uncertainty in the event of the death of the Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping; whether the Hong Kong property market is overvalued; the outlook for Sino-British relations; and the renewal of MFN status for China. The broker takes the view that the correction has been overdone and many of the concerns have been overstated. Goldman Sachs notes that the positive sentiment seen in Hong Kong during the early part of the year abruptly reversed with the unexpected 25 basis point increase in short term US interest rates on February 6, and a public appearance by the Chinese leader in the following week. 'Deng's marked deterioration in health gave investors cause for concern and provoked uncertainty over the political outlook for China.' Goldman Sachs adds that these two factors have taken much of the heat out of the Hong Kong market and have, together with a general decline in sentiment towards equity markets worldwide, contributed to the 14 per cent decline in the Hang Seng index over the last month. Looking forward, the investment bank believes that fundamentals will be the main feature and that sentiment is unlikely to rebound in the near term, with further weakness predicted. 'Our longer term outlook is more positive as Hong Kong remains the key gateway to China.' Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson comments that Japanese share prices continue to climb as a result of foreign buying, particularly from the US. 'Though technical indicators suggest the 1994 rally needs a short rest before the major indices can soar above last year's peaks, the pressure to increase weightings in Japan increases week by week.' In Europe, Germany put in the strongest performance as a 6 basis point cut in the repo rate was well received, but the Bundesbank council left official rates unchanged. Morgan Stanley comments that while a cut in the discount rate was not expected, some market participants were hoping to see a cut in the Lombard rate or, more importantly, a more aggressive easing through a fixed repo rate for this week. 'Nevertheless, we maintain our optimism on European markets where Buba easing is holding the key.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    % change  % change                 % change in local currency **     sterling **  in US                                                             dollars **              ----------------------------------------------------------               1 Week  4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of    Start of  Start of                                          1993         1993      1993  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria        +0.67    +0.53   +33.17    +42.60      +37.70    +35.41 Belgium        +0.07    -1.01   +17.98    +33.55      +29.22    +27.06 Denmark        -0.68    -3.87   +38.40    +50.90      +44.84    +42.42 Finland        -0.20    -2.16   +85.28   +125.08     +116.03   +112.46 France         +1.77    -1.46   +17.61    +26.48      +23.00    +20.95 Germany        +2.26    -0.26   +23.92    +37.31      +33.34    +31.11 Ireland        +0.67    -3.01   +34.50    +59.32      +42.76    +40.37 Italy          +0.28    -2.67   +37.71    +57.42      +40.57    +38.24 Netherlands    -0.02    -3.32   +24.02    +38.07      +33.93    +31.69 Norway         +2.59    -0.63   +38.13    +55.87      +49.05    +46.56 Spain          +0.75    -3.31   +36.70    +52.10      +27.21    +25.08 Sweden         -0.59    -4.44   +36.77    +46.40      +33.68    +31.44 Switzerland    +0.17    -5.18   +33.66    +39.87      +44.66    +42.24 UK             +0.71    -4.49   +13.62    +16.16      +16.16    +14.22 EUROPE         +0.86    -3.21   +21.55    +29.37      +26.34    +24.23  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia      +0.57    -2.21   +24.70    +34.61      +41.80    +39.43 Hong Kong      -7.54   -14.58   +54.02    +68.44      +71.58    +68.71 Japan          +1.61    +5.50   +16.61    +25.74      +50.58    +48.06 Malaysia       -4.08    -7.14   +77.35    +87.56      +83.39    +80.33 New Zealand    +4.61    +0.29   +43.21    +50.03      +70.00    +67.15 Singapore      -4.02   -11.31   +34.75    +39.39      +46.81    +44.37  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada         +3.03    +4.98   +22.65    +29.19      +22.05    +20.02 USA            +1.08    +0.81    +4.01     +7.67       +9.50     +7.67 Mexico         -3.77   -13.29   +42.77    +33.64      +28.10    +25.97  --------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa   +1.66    +7.24   +58.79    +70.21      +83.88    +80.81  --------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX                +0.92    +0.52   +14.12    +20.49      +27.06    +24.94  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on March 18th 1994.

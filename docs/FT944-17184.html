			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): LeFauve makes small bigger 'Skip' LeFauve, head of General Motors' Saturn division, simply can't build enough cars at the moment, writes Richard Waters. The US automaker's specialist small cars division, set up in the late 1980s to compete head-on with Japanese imports, has been running full-tilt in recent months to keep up with demand. Saturn's success in designing and building cars that Americans want to buy (it hasn't turned a profit yet) has now propelled LeFauve up the GM executive ladder. Last week, the 59-year old career GM employee was given responsibility for all of the group's small cars. This gives him charge of the Lansing division, which makes roughly three times as many vehicles as Saturn's 300,000 a year. LeFauve (his nickname was supplied by a mariner grandfather) draws plaudits from analysts for making the Saturn experiment a success. The message he has hammered home all along is that the company will stay small. As he told one interviewer, Saturn 'won't be a huge company, or get too big for its breeches'. Recently, though, LeFauve has been clamouring for more investment to lift the division's production capacity. But with Dollars 5bn already sunk in the venture, and no profit yet in sight, the GM top brass has so far failed to respond.</p>

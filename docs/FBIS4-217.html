			<p>BFN     [Text] Two of the police generals who took voluntary leave  after being implicated by a Goldstone Commission report on  alleged third force violence will probably be back at their  desks today. The commissioner of police, General Johan van der  Merwe, said yesterday that Lieutenant General Basie Smit and  Lieutenant General Johan le Roux would resume their duties today  unless specific evidence was submitted implicating them in  criminal activites. He added that no such evidence had been  forthcoming.    A spokesman for the Ministry of Law and Order said that  Minister Hernus Kriel would review the positions of the two  generals today. He said that their future would depend on what  new information had been uncovered by investigators.</p>

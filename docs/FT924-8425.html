			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Arts: Today's Television Italian novelist Primo Levi was a member of that relatively small band of people who were sent to Auschwitz by the Nazis and survived to bear witness to the world. The terrible thing is that, 40 years after the event, he was still so appalled by what he had seen and by the belief that it could, all too easily, happen again that he killed himself. Primo Levi: The Memory Of The Offence (8.10 BBC2) tells the story of his life using his own prose and poetry and the memories of his friends. Dispatches (9.00 C4) provides another unflattering story about the Germans, this time during the cold war. It seems that East Germans wishing to escape to the West but not wanting to risk the guns of the border guards could pay Wolfgang Vogel. His fixer role appears to have been accepted in both East and West Germany, but his deals meant that escapers often lost their houses or spent considerable periods in prison. Fatal Attraction (9.00 ITV) is one of those movies which achieved huge success largely via a campaign of vilification. Feminists took exception to the portrayal of a woman, during an affair, as predatory and hysterical.</p>

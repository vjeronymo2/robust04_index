			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A STRIP SHOW THAT CAN DRIVE YOU UP THE WALL  </P> <P> Removing wallpaper is a messy job, but somebody's got to do it, and that  somebody will probably be you.  </P> <P> Finding somebody else to do it is probably more difficult than doing it  yourself. Professional paperhangers often don't want to do it and when they do,  they charge a premium rate.  </P> <P> Fortunately, this job is more messy than difficult. It's a good example of the  kind of grunt work homeowners can do themselves. This job requires little skill  and few tools, just scraping and patience. With the advent of improved  wallpaper and removing tools, teamed with time-proven methods, the job is  easier than ever.  </P> <P> Not all wallpapers are created equal, meaning that some are more difficult to  strip than others. The easiest to remove are the "strippable" wallpapers. They  can be removed without tearing or being loosened by water or steam.  </P> <P> Slightly more difficult to remove are old, untreated and uncoated wallpapers.  They simply need to be wetted and scraped loose.  </P> <P> The most difficult to remove are the paper with vinyl coating (washable  wallpapers) or those with laminated surfaces of woven fabric or foils.  Wallpaper that's been painted falls into this category. These papers are  difficult to strip because water doesn't penetrate their surface as readily as  with uncoated paper.  </P> <P> Old-fashioned wallpaper comes off easily if you get enough moisture behind it.  It's held up with wheat paste adhesive, a substance easily softened by water.  These porous papers absorb water, hastening the decomposition of the paste.  </P> <P> Stripping the paper is even easier if you mix some wallpaper remover in the  water. The remover, sold at paint and hardware stores, has wetting agents that  penetrate the paper and soften the paste. Some strippers also have enzymes that  attack the wheat paste and dissolve it.  </P> <P> Vinyl, foil-faced and other moisture-resistant wallpapers are designed to be  cleaned. The challenge, then, is to get moisture behind their water-resistant  face to soften the glue. Wallpaper remover is not as effective on coated papers  as uncoated. The solution is to steam the paper loose, then scrape it off the  wall.  </P> <P> You have to prepare these papers before steaming them. The easiest way to get  the steam or water behind a coated wall covering is to score the surface to  allow moisture to penetrate.  </P> <P> If the paper is old and there are several painted layers, most of the layers  can be scraped off with a razor scraper. This is harder work than steaming off  individual layers, but it's much faster than trying to steam down through  individual layers.  </P> <P> Strippable wallpapers simply peel off the wall when gently pulled from a  corner. At a seam, lift the corner of the paper with a putty knife or scraper  and pull toward you.  </P> <P> Carefully remove the adhesive left on the wall with a fresh blade in a razor  scraper. Since the paste is dry and hard, most of the heavy residue can be  scraped off. Then wash the walls with warm water and detergent.  </P></p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Personal View: Too many dollars, not enough sense It still amazes me that the US dollar's weakness has caused so much surprise. The consensus may be cracking, but most people still seem to believe the outlook is promising or, more bluntly, that long positions will be rewarded eventually. Part of the reason for the surprise and continuing optimism is the failure to grasp the real issues underlying the dollar's weakness. Most commentaries on the dollar's problems have ignored or overlooked the simple words 'balance of payments deficit'. It is here the root cause of the dollar's problems lies. The financing needed, in terms of required capital inflow, has started to falter in the face of real interest rate levels that are still too weak, relative to Germany and Japan, for example. Unless the US authorities are prepared to agree soon to a substantial increase in US interest rates - for example, an increase in the Federal Funds rate to about 6 per cent, implying long yields of about 8 to 8.5 per cent - the value of the dollar will erode by a further 7 to 10 per cent. The last significant US balance of payments problem was in 1987, some time after the 1985 Plaza agreement to secure further depreciation. Then, the US current account deficit reached a record Dollars 167bn, equivalent to 3.7 per cent of gross domestic product. But at that time the US still enjoyed substantial inflows of private, long-term investment capital of about Dollars 60bn. In 1993, the US current account deficit was a mere Dollars 109bn, or 1.7 per cent of GDP, but net long-term capital (securities transactions and direct investment) recorded an outflow of some Dollars 40bn. Thus, comparing 1987 and 1993, the sum of the current account deficit and net long-term capital flows was about the same, at 2.2 per cent of GDP. This year and in 1995, America's balance of payments is set to reach real records. We forecast the current account deficit will rise this year to about Dollars 145bn-Dollars 150bn and in 1995 to about Dollars 170bn, or some 2.5 per cent of GDP. But we have to add long-term capital outflows, which are assumed at some Dollars 50bn to Dollars 60bn a year - 0.75 per cent of GDP. As the table shows, the US faces the problem of obtaining stable and secure financing of the growing amount of dollars it is creating via its balance of payments deficit, at a time when the main vehicles for such financing are suspect. Central banks have acquired large increases in dollar reserves already and net banking flows cannot be relied on. The US is already the world's largest net debtor. Its net international investment position has swung from +Dollars 230bn in 1977 to - Dollars 34bn in 1987 and to an estimated - Dollars 588bn at the end of 1983. By comparison, in Japan, the current account surplus (Dollars 130bn in fiscal 1993-94) may fall on a temporary and cyclical basis, but medium-term prospects favour a renewed widening towards the middle of the decade as Japan Inc learns to live with a stronger yen. Upward pressure on the yen has less to do with US trade rhetoric than with the fact Japan is not recycling its current account surpluses as in years gone by. Foreign investment is not that appealing to companies trying to rebuild after the domestic asset price collapse and coping with a strong yen. And in Germany, unification led to a collapse of the country's current account surplus, but its trade balance is on the rise again from 1994 and it continues to enjoy a sizeable capital inflow. The task of absorbing about Dollars 200bn a year is problematic because US real interest rates are inadequate to make US investors change the structural diversification on which they have embarked or make foreign investors, already long of dollars, buy more. It will not count for much if the Bundesbank reduces nominal interest rates once more over the next six to nine months, say to about 4 to 4.5 per cent, if this keeps real D-Mark rates at about 2 to 2.5 per cent. In the bond market, real yields are running at about 4 per cent. The US Fed would have to offer considerably in excess of that to reactivate capital flows that helped to push the dollar back up on a medium-term view. Moreover, it would have to 'shock' the markets. The trouble is, it knows it would shock the US government and domestic financial markets, too. The question is whether the US authorities would permit such monetary tightening and, if not, whether they may be forced into it by the extent of US dollar depreciation. Either way, the issue for the US - as it is for markets - is when and under what circumstances US authorities will pay attention to the imbalance between savings and investment, which is resulting in the supply of far too many dollars.

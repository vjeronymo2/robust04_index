			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Rivals gather to woo the UK's dairy farmers: Guy de Jonquieres on ventures being formed to take over from the Milk Marketing Board For 60 years, Britain's 30,000 dairy farmers have been sheltered from harsh commercial realities by the monopoly purchasing umbrella of the Milk Marketing Board (MMB). Now they are being wooed by the very organisations from which the MMB was originally set up to protect them - the big dairies and food processors. With about 18 months to go until the MMB's statutory monopoly is abolished, large milk users across the country are competing to line up secure supplies once producers become free to sell to whomever they choose. The most striking initiative was launched yesterday by Northern Foods, the country's largest private-sector dairy group, which hopes in the next year to persuade between 5,000 and 6,000 English and Welsh farmers to join it in a planned co-operative venture, the Northern Milk Partnership. The non-profit venture would supply exclusively the 2bn litres of milk, worth Pounds 500m, which Northern buys annually for its liquid milk sales and food-manufacturing businesses. Though no other large users appear to be planning similar arrangements, several are seeking to interest farmers in supplying them direct from next year. They include the UK subsidiary of Nestle, the Swiss food group, the Danish-owned MD Foods (formerly Associated Dairies) and the Co-operative Wholesale Society. The MMB, meanwhile, is urging farmers to remain loyal after its planned re-birth as a voluntary co-operative trading under the name Milk Marque. It hopes to supply 80 per cent of the Pounds 3bn annual milk market, a share some observers believe it would have to achieve to cover its high costs. Northern's initiative is widely seen as a pre-emptive strike to limit Milk Marque's market power. The venture would account initially for 17 per cent of the total UK milk market and aims for as much as 25 per cent in the longer run. However, it faces a number of uncertainties. The biggest hurdle is overcoming farmers' traditional mistrust of bigger customers. The partnership has scored a minor public relations coup by naming as its chairman Mr Richard Smith, a bluff Yorkshire dairy farmer with 120 cows, who resigned as an MMB director last year because he disagreed with the Milk Marque Scheme. To woo producers, Northern Foods is offering to buy all its needs from the partnership's members at prices higher than those paid by Milk Marque. The company would negotiate its contract collectively with producer representatives and guarantee farmers regularly monthly payments. Mr Christopher Haskins, Northern Foods' chairman, says the project is 'a totally new concept of co-operation'. By bridging the gap between producers and marketers, he believes it could serve as a model in other parts of agriculture at a time when the government is seeking ways to reduce Britain's food trade deficit of more than Pounds 5bn a year. Mr Haskins believes the venture will prosper economically by cutting out the MMB's bureaucracy and costs. It will have a permanent staff of only 25, to be housed in Northern Foods' Hull headquarters, compared with the 560 employed at the MMB's head office. The partnership will concentrate on recruiting farmers close to Northern Foods' network of dairies. The company will transport milk directly from the farm gate, instead of relying on the MMB to collect supplies, often from remote parts of the country, and store them at central depots. Northern has a reputation as a highly efficient operator, both in liquid milk delivery and in its food-manufacturing businesses, which are leading suppliers to Marks and Spencer. The group has stripped huge costs out of Express Dairies since it was acquired from Grand Metropolitan last year. However, competition is expected to reduce Northern Foods' cost advantage by making rivals more efficient. The MMB has already announced plans to shed 60 per cent of its head office staff and is expected to restructure its charges for milk collection to benefit farms close to dairies. Though Northern Foods has historically paid producers about 1p per litre more than the national average for milk, that premium may be harder to sustain in a liberalised market. Some observers believe the desire to keep producers loyal to the planned partnership could lead it to over-pay in the future. That, in turn, could push up prices across the market. On the other hand, if the venture succeeds as well as Northern Foods hopes, some analysts think the group could face pressure from milk producers for a share of corporate profits - and even for a direct stake in its dairy and processing operations. With so many uncertainties looming, other dairy groups seem likely to hesitate before committing themselves to following Northern Foods' example. Unigate, for instance, says that once the MMB monopoly ends it will buy milk through whichever channel the producers favour. MMB, meanwhile, was out to minimise the scale of the Northern Foods challenge. 'It's not unexpected,' Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive, said yesterday. 'But I have heard nothing that would make the planned venture more attractive than Milk Marque. Our role in life is clear: we're there to represent farmers. Who will represent farmers in the Northern Foods set-up?'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            UK MILK MARKET  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK milk processors' shares (February 1992)                ---------m litres------------                               Total      Total       Total    Percentage                              liquid   Manufactured  All milk     share  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dairy Crest*                 1,180       1,620       2,800       20.6 Northern Foods               1,530         105       1,635       12.0 Co-Ops                       1,025         282       1,307        9.6 Unigate                        770         510       1,280        9.4 Express**                        -         800         800        5.9 Nestle                           -         640         640        4.7 Sthn Milk Mkt Board*           350         120         470        3.5 MD Foods (Denmark)             350          50         400        2.9 Waterford (Ireland)            220         170         390        2.9 Nthn Ireland Milk Mkt Bd*       15         275         290        2.1 Others                       1,280       2,308       3,588       26.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                        6,720       6,880      13,600      100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Milk Marketing Board commercial activities **Now part of Northern Foods  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Dairy Industry Newsletters  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

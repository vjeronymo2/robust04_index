			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Turchenko report: "Officers' Council"] </F>   [Text] The Second All-Union Congress of the Officers'  Union was held in Moscow 16-17 April. It was perhaps the most  impressive forum of the officers' patriotic movement to date in  terms of the number of delegations and guests: There were 184  delegates from 21 regions, including nine republics of the  former USSR. One hundred and fourteen guests took part in the  work of the congress: These included well-known leaders of  opposition tendencies and parties such as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  Aleksandr Barkashov, Sergey Baburin, Sazhi Umalatova, Yuriy  Vlasov, Iona Andronov, Vladislav Achalov, and Ivan Shashiashvili.    Given that almost all of them addressed the assembly, the  picture of the contemporary state of society given by the  congress was composed of a wide spectrum of views and  assessments from diverse wings of the opposition. On the main  and fundamental issue of today those views proved to be similar,  augmenting and developing the report by Lieutenant Colonel  Stanislav Terekhov, chairman of the Officers' Union, and the  reports by regional delegates.    The economic situation in the former USSR was described as  catastrophic. The defense and security of the former USSR are in  an equally catastrophic state. The congress also expressed the  unanimous view that there is no possibility of reviving a great  union state under the current regime. At the same time it was  stressed that the achievement of this aim sacred to every  patriot should be carried out in a prudent and well-considered  way to avoid giving reactionary forces even the slightest  opportunity to provoke a civil war. A civil war benefits only  those bent on covering their traces and fending off  accountability for crimes committed against the peoples of the  USSR.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy urged those present to join his party  amd "pressure" the regime from within it. The reply from the  presidium was that the Officers' Union is an autonomous,  independent organization, but it is always ready to cooperate  with those who act for the country's good. Delegates asked  Zhirinovskiy to support their demands for the restoration of  officers' assemblies in units and combined units, which were  unlawfully suppressed by the "democratic" regime.    Serious concern was expressed at the congress that despite  the opposition's renunciation of all strong-arm methods of  waging struggle, representatives of the regime are ready to stop  at nothing to hold on to the power that is slipping out of their  hands. In this context the planned exercise involving 27  [Russian] motorized infantry divisions and three U.S. mechanized  divisions near Orenburg was seen as the first step in preparing  foreign military intervention to preserve the regime.    Speakers reported alarming facts which indicate that a  bloody  provocation is being prepared for the May holiday as grounds for  introducing a state of emergency, which the regime has long  craved, since it is no longer able to stay in power without  weapons.    In closed session the congress formulated counterprovocation  tactics, analyzed the state of Officers' Union organizations at  local level, and defined the immediate tasks of the officers'  movement.    The breaks between sessions saw people actively joining the  Officers' Union. Russian Federation People's Deputy Iona  Andronov set the example here, reading out from the rostrum his  own application to join the patriotic organization as a reserve  junior officer.    On 17 April the officer-delegates held the constituent  congress of the Power Party [Derzhavnaya Partiya], the nucleus  of which is formed by the Officers' Union. These organizations'  aims and tasks were declared to be the same. But the party's  social base will be broader. Not just officers, but any  patriots who share its program can join.</p>

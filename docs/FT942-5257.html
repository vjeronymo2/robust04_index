			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (3): A small step on the right path - Impact of the North American free trade agreement Any Canadian businessman will agree that while ratification of the North American free trade agreement (Nafta) late last year was important, it was secondary to the US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA) sealed in 1989 during Mr Brian Mulroney's period as prime minister. In its five-year life, the FTA has had a far-reaching impact on the structure of Canadian business and on Canada's commercial links with its biggest trading partner, the US. However, free trade advocates who had hoped that the new US-Canada-Mexico trade bloc would address some of the FTA's flaws have been disappointed. Over the longer run, Nafta will open Mexican markets to Canadian exports, but its most important function will be to cement trading practices between the US and Canada already defined by the FTA. Mexico last year accounted for less than 1 per cent of Canada's total exports, while the US absorbed 80 per cent. Together, trade flows across the US-Canadian border totalled nearly Dollars 400bn in 1993. Free and open international trade is crucial to Canada, which is in the midst of a export-led recovery after a long and trying recession. A country of only 27m people with an economy a tenth the size of its southern neighbour, it cannot afford costly trade disputes. However, for all its promise, Nafta has not offered a means to resolve subsidy and dumping disputes that have arisen between the US and Canada under the FTA. Thus, the two governments are close to an embarrassing trade war over Canadian wheat exports, just months after the Nafta accord was reached. Mr Roy MacLaren, the minister for international trade, told North American business leaders recently that Canada's government was committed to negotiating clear and agreed definitions of subsidies and dumping with its Nafta partners. Had these existed, he said, it would have averted the wheat controversy and other US-Canada trade disputes. 'They constitute a crucial missing element necessary to secure market access within North America for our companies,' he declared. Regardless of the disputes, the sheer size of trade between the two countries has shaped Canadian business, part- icularly since the FTA was put in place. Total value of merchandise trade between the US and Canada has jumped 42 per cent since 1989, and the integration of North American operations for big inter- national companies such as Ford and General Motors has been remarkable. Mr Gerry Protti, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, says that Nafta 'was not a huge win' for his industry. 'Liberalisation of energy trade between the US and Canada was already occurring at a very rapid rate,' he adds. 'Nafta insures that develop- ment will continue to expand.' If the FTA provides a clue, Canada's energy business will boom as trade becomes freer. Canada's exports of natural gas to the US, for example, have increased 25 per cent in five years. Its oil export revenues exceed Dollars 10bn and comprise more than 40 per cent of total Canadian production. Under Nafta, Mexico's state oil company, Pemex, will keep its monopoly over most of the country's oil production. However, Mexico will allow foreign investment in petro- chemicals, pipelines, refine- ries, electricity generation, and other 'downstream' energy activities. This, Mr Protti says, will open up many opportunities for Canadian energy companies, which also stand to benefit from increased exports to the US as US production companies pursue natural gas exports to Mexico. And, he is confident, as Mexico becomes accustomed to life under Nafta, 'upstream' oil and gas exploration and extraction will gradually open to Mexico's Nafta partners. Canadian telecom- munications and trans- portation companies are already feeling renewed benefits in Mexico, with companies such as Northern Telecom entering agreements to provide telephone equipment to the newly opened market.</p>

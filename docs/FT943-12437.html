			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Dollar stays focus of market attention - Currencies With the Bundesbank having set out its stall for the summer, attention this week will revert to US monetary policy, with the focus on the second quarter GDP figure due for release on Thursday. The market will also be monitoring the dollar, to see whether last week's recovery was simply a technical retracement, or heralds a turnaround in the US currency's fortunes. Last week was characterised by a number of senior US officials pledging their belief in the virtues of a stronger dollar. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, and his deputy Mr Larry Summers, were both prominent. Markets were also surprised by the degree of attention Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, gave to the dollar during his Humphrey Hawkins testimony. The next step will be to see whether the words will be supported by action, in the form of higher interest rates. With most analysts having proven too bullish in the past, they are understandably cautious about predicting that the worst of the dollar's woes are past. There is general agreement, though, that its prospects are better against the D-Mark than the yen, where the trade talks remain a potentially destabilising threat. Investors, however, appear to be more bullish about prospects. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, says a recent client survey showed that most clients believe the dollar will be at DM1.65/1.70 by the year end. Long term dollar bears, however, remain unrepentant. Swiss Bank Corporation, in its latest currency outlook, warns investors not to get carried away by the dollar rally. 'The long-term weakness of the US dollar is likely to persist,' SBC concludes, suggesting that financial markets will start buying European currencies later this year. In the UK the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and Bank of England governor, Mr Eddie George, meet to dis-cuss monetary policy on Thursday. There is little expectation of a near-term change in rates.</p>

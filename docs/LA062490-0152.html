			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER FLAG AMENDMENT  </P> <P> In 1946 I, my wife and our 4-year-old son were finally permitted to leave  Poland after living through the years of the Holocaust in a ghetto and losing  all of our family. Our train finally crossed the Polish border and continued on  the way to Germany and the American Zone.  </P> <P> The first thing that struck our vision was the American flag. We will never  forget it. For us it meant freedom, the true embodiment of the golden gate for  the masses yearning to be free, the wonderful lamp of the Statue of Liberty.  That's what we told our boy. He, too, will remember it just as we do.  </P> <P> Those who violate and desecrate the flag should know about it. Our legislators  should realize that burning this symbol of freedom and the symbol of everything  that this nation stands for will be in jeopardy if we let this assault on the  flag go unpunished.  </P> <P> BEN Z. REDNER  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

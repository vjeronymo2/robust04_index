			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: Indexation month to change - Personal Allowances THE introduction of a November Budget means that the base month for the indexation of personal allowances will also have to change. Traditionally, these are increased annually in line with inflation, although this year Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, broke with that tradition by deciding to freeze personal allowances. Until the last Budget, the amount of increase was based on the retail price index measured from the 12 months to Decem-ber. However, the new base month from this year will be Septem-ber. This means that if the chancellor were to decide to increase personal allowances for April 1994 the amount would be based on the in-crease in the RPI from September 1992-93. According to Mr Michael Bishopp of Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, the new base date should not have a significant effect on individuals, mainly because of the chancellor's decision to freeze personal taxation allowances this year. 'The chancellor had decided to lose this year's indexation so there is no longer a con-tinuous period on which the next increase would be based,' said Mr Bishopp. The new base month of September will apply to all personal allowances, the amount of capital gains tax exemption, the inheritance tax threshold, the pensions earnings cap and the limit between the 20 per cent and 25 per cent rate tax band.</p>

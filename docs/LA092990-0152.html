			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> MCELROY'S RETURN COULD BE SPECIAL  </P> <P> Activated Monday after his two-week roster exemption expired, safety Vann  McElroy is eligible to play in Sunday's game against the Chicago Bears at the  Coliseum.  </P> <P> "We'll use him if there's an opportunity where we have to use him," Coach Art  Shell said.  </P> <P> "But he'll help us on special teams."  </P> <P> McElroy could also play in the Raiders' nickel pass coverage.  </P> <P> Raider nose guard Bob Golic and his wife, Jackie, are expecting their first  child Dec. 10, the date of the Raiders' Monday night game against the Lions in  Detroit.  </P> <P> "They said she's probably going to have it early because the kid's pretty big,"  Golic said. "I'd like her to have it on a Wednesday or Thursday, because those  are our tough (practice) days. With my luck, she'll have it on Tuesday, our day  off. It's like (with) a kid who gets sick and doesn't have to go to school --  but it turns out to be Saturday."  </P> <P> The Raiders rank 11th in the AFC in total offense but have the conference's  third-best defense behind Houston and Pittsburgh. The Raiders have given up 25  points in three games, fewest in the NFL.  </P> <P> Quarterback Jay Schroeder is the AFC's No. 4 passer with a rating of 88.7,  better than Boomer Esiason of Cincinnati and John Elway of Denver.

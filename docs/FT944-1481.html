			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Story is for real Sir, Reviewing Princess Caraboo (Arts, December 15), Nigel Andrews is, wrongly, sceptical of the claim that the film is based on a real story. In her English Eccentrics, Edith Sitwell relates the story at some length and includes references to contemporary journals and letters mentioning the visit of the 'princess' to England.

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Interest in investor relations increasing COMPANIES WHICH take an active interest in investor relations typically have a couple of executives working on the subject, spending a budget of between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 500,000 a year, according to a survey carried out for the Investor Relations Society. The survey, covering 140 mid-sized and large companies, which are members of the society, is due to be published tomorrow. It shows that active investor relations is a relatively new practice for British companies. A little less than half the companies surveyed say they have been actively involved in the field for less than five years. Though interest in investor relations has been rising, the bulk of non-staff spending goes on traditional activities. Some 37 per cent of companies' investor relations budgets go on annual, interim or quarterly reports; 12 per cent on meetings with stockbrokers; 9 per cent on annual meetings, and 8 per cent on investor relations consultants. Overall, 85 per cent of the budget is spent reaching UK investors, though the very largest companies spend a quarter of their investor relations budgets overseas. Some 54 per cent have budgets of less than Pounds 250,000 a year and two thirds of the investor relations executives questioned have other responsibilities, such as finance, a company secretary's duties, or corporate communications.

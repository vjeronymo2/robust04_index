			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: German ambassador told of UK 'concern' BRITAIN yesterday came within an ace of registering its first ever diplomatic protest to a European Community country when the Foreign Office called in the German ambassador in London to express its disapproval of the way the Bundesbank had publicised its views on the sterling crisis. Though the Foreign Office stressed that it had merely 'called in' and not 'summoned' the ambassador, Baron Hermann von Richthofen, and rigorously avoided using the sensitive term 'protest', there was no mistaking the message it was seeking to convey. The official diplomatic terminology was sufficiently terse and to the point. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the minister of state at the Foreign Office, had expressed 'the government's concern at the deliberate decision to disclose Dr Schlesinger's (Bundesbank President Dr Helmut Schlesinger) letter, and to make clear the government's view that the release of the document was unhelpful.' The document rebutted official British suggestions that the Bundesbank had failed to give sterling sufficient support in foreign exchange markets before it was floated. Its publication sparked off the latest in a series of Anglo-German rows. A German official in London said that the embassy had decided to disclose the document with the consent of the Bundesbank. The adverse comment it had provoked in the British media had come as a surprise. Far from wanting to add fuel to the fire of Anglo-German relations, the intention behind the release of the document was to be helpful by demonstrating that the Bundesbank had offered substantial support to sterling. The embassy's statement that the document was issued with the Bundesbank's consent was disputed by a bank spokesman in Frankfurt. The Bundesbank had merely intended to provide the embassy with arguments backing up the central bank's position. That assertion, however, did not tally with a statement put out by the German Foreign Office in Bonn, which said: 'the release of Schlesinger's statement was made in good faith and in accordance with the Bundesbank.' Baron von Richthofen, a spokesman emphasised, had not acted on his own. Both the German Foreign Ministry and the Foreign Office in London attempted to pour oil on troubled waters by referring to the good atmosphere in which Wednesday's meeting in Bonn between Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, his British opposite number, was held. Though Mr Hurd had raised the issue of the letter at the meeting, the two sides had underlined the need to overcome the differences which had arisen over currency upheavals, British and German spokesmen said.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Cricket: Losing the image game CRICKET has always had an eye for its image, especially at the higher levels of the game. It is a spectacle, performed on a grassy stage before a devoted audience. Admittedly the numbers of the devoted vary, but the potential for hero worship is constant. Young Pakistani Yorkshiremen waved their way through the Headingley Test with national flags and rhythmic chants of 'In-za-mam,' the tourists' favourite batting stylist. Nearly a century ago, The Times produced a fulsome leader celebrating the testimonial of England's favourite batsman, W G Grace - 'the theme of all the dinner tables, the railway carriages, the public houses, and, above all, the public schools. Wherever English folk congregate, they have exchanged notes of admiration about the hero of a thousand fights and of a hundred centuries.' (June 17 1895). Today, English cricket has no Grace, no reason to boast too much about the heroes of its fights and no strong image. This last lack may not be a bad thing. Modern 'profiles' are pumped up by agents to advertise teams' and cricketers' distinctive persona, which their agents consider invaluable in an age of media attention. More's the pity. I respected Yorkshire's policy of only using home-grown players, something all other counties had abandoned. But, depressed by their failures, Yorkshire joined the international marketplace and signed Sachin Tendulkar, the young Indian superstar, as a new breed of glamorous Yorkshireman for this season. He does seem to have saved the county from getting trapped in an image of itself as the home of hard times, after great times in the 1960s and '70s. He has given the club a transfusion of outside interest. At the Test level, it is the West Indies who are in abeyance after years of splendour. A drawn tour in England last summer was followed by a drawn tour of Pakistan in the winter, which left the Pakistanis eager to prove themselves the best in the world. They returned home from the World Cup as beacons of their country's glory. They feed off this. But they also enjoy a battle. It would be sad if automatic hostility replaced strategic battle-plans. Nothing undermines the enemy so much as a fizzing leg-break, as Mushtaq Ahmed can show. But then nothing provokes Pakistani fury as much as calmness from the opposition, such as the languid David Gower, or from officials, such as the unfortunate Roy Palmer at Old Trafford, who was quickly denounced as a member of the opposition. Good behaviour is a 20th century innovation in cricket, and a welcome one. In 1973 Arthur Fagg, a great umpire, bewailed the start of a new era of high pressure dissent in which we are stuck today. He was so angry with the West Indian captain Rohan Kanhai's abuse of one of his decisions in the Edgbaston Test that he refused to go on. When the West Indies issued an official apology, Fagg agreed to complete the game, but said sadly: 'If they will not accept decisions, there is no point carrying on . . . I don't enjoy umpiring Tests any more . . . There is so much at stake . . . the game has changed, and not for the better.' He could have been speaking this summer. Cricket's ever-growing civil service is not the way to keep the peace. Its legal expansion cannot control the money and politics which let cricketers behave like prima donnas. The International Cricket Council's match referee (what an ill-conceived job]) fined Pakistan's substitute fielder Rashid Latif Pounds 120 for 'serious and obvious dissent' at Headingley. Next time, perhaps, offenders will have to miss pudding at lunch. Umpires have always been the walking wounded of struggles for the honour of the game, and they must keep walking. Respect for umpires is crucial to cricket. If international pressure affects umpiring appointments or decisions, the game is done for. Just before the Old Trafford Test, I asked Javed Miandad, Pakistan's captain, about his country's cricket in England so far this summer. He was the essence of acquiescence, all happy, all comfortable. 'You must have been in a good mood after Pakistan's victory at Lords?' 'I'm always in a good mood,' he replied. This was public relations with a vengeance. After many further attempts, ranging from food to social life, I had my last try at reaching an unguarded Javed by asking him whether he was enjoying his captaincy. He was ready for me. 'What is captaincy? . . It doesn't make any difference to me . . .I wasn't keen, you know, to take the captaincy on this trip, but I've been forced by the Board.' Javed's soft, brown eyes would have melted the rubber off cricket bat handles. It has almost reached the stage where cricketers have two languages, one for the field and one for the media. England at present are a team lacking distinctive features on the field of play, either of fast or slow pace, captaincy or keeping. Graham Gooch is a hard-working, not an inspiring, captain. Smooth talk has never been one of his problems. I hope it will never have to become one.</p>

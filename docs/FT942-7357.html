			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Kenya currency nears total convertibility Kenya yesterday made its currency fully convertible for nearly all transactions, one of the most important steps in the country's liberalisation programme. The decision reflects government confidence that Kenya's economic and political stability will ensure that there is no capital flight. Mr Musalia Mudavadi, finance minister, said Kenya's relaxation of the exchange control act made the shilling fully convertible for all current account transactions. Kenyans are now free to invest outside the country up to a maximum of Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 331,000) without central bank authorisation. The bank says it will approve all bona fide transactions beyond that amount without undue delay. Exporters are also free to retain all export proceeds in foreign currency. They used to be required to surrender part of their foreign exchange earnings after 90 days. The only area to remain subject to exchange controls is inward investment in shares and government securities by foreigners. Mr Mudavadi said legislation to allow foreign investment funds into Kenya was not yet ready. He did not say when the last controls would be removed. The currency liberalisation measures appear to have been decided in the wake of the appreciation of the shilling and the build-up of Dollars 700m in foreign exchange reserves - enough to cover 4 1/2 months' imports - which reflect a new confidence in Kenya's economic policies. Furthermore, they signalled President Daniel arap Moi's support for the 33-year-old finance minister, who has fought, since he took over last year, to implement the economic programme in the face of fierce opposition from some politicians and civil servants who resent the loss of patronage implicit in his reforms. The decision, coincided with an International Monetary Fund mission visit which said Kenya had made 'progress in restoring macroeconomic stability' under an IMF enhanced structural adjustment programme. Mr Hiroyuki Hino, the mission's leader and assistant director of the IMF's Africa department, warned: 'Major challenges remain'. Monetary conditions were 'not as tight as had been expected' and the budget deficit for the financial year ending next month was likely to reach 7 per cent of GDP, one point higher than the target.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [AzerTadzh report] </F>   [Text] In spite of the immense material and financial  difficulties experienced by the republic's oil extraction  industry, again in March oil workers managed to maintain  relative stability in their work and successfully fulfill the  month's assignment and also that for the entire first quarter of  the year.    According to figures obtained from the State Petroleum  Company, in March 810,000 tonnes were extracted, and for the  entire quarter--2,339,000 tonnes of oil. This was 4,000 tonnes  more than was envisioned by this year's assignment but 217,000  tonnes less than last year, the decline of product amounting to  8.3 percent. There was also an 11.2-percent reduction in gas  extraction as compared to the analogous period of last year.</p>

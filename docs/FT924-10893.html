			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Tampella cuts losses to FM317m as sales slide TAMPELLA, the Finnish forestry and engineering group, cut losses to FM317m (Dollars 65m) in the first eight months, from FM807m in the corresponding 1991 period. Sales fell to FM3.91bn from FM4.49bn, reflecting disposals and restructuring. The group has also benefited from rationalisation and lower interest payments thanks to a reduced debt load. Tampella expects to remain in the red this year, following a loss of FM1.16bn in 1991, but says its operating result will 'improve substantially'. The company also warns that 'stiff competition in the European markets is expected to further reduce the foreign currency based prices of forest industry products'. Tampella was saved by the Bank of Finland in late 1991 as part of a broader rescue of Skopbank. Fermenta, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, cut losses (after financial items) to SKr127m (Dollars 22m) in the first eight months from SKr470m a year earlier. The result was struck after a sharp reduction in turnover to SKr358m from SKr2.24bn, reflecting the disposal and winding up of many of the group's activities. The group said its result was no longer being dragged down by Independent, the financial subsidiary it sold this year. Including extraordinary items and minority interests, the loss for the period deepened to SKr413m from SKr357m.</p>

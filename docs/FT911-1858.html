			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Citicorp to sell 50% of Ambac CITICORP, the leading US commercial bank which has been seeking to bolster its capital base recently, is planning to sell just over 50 per cent of its Ambac, municipal bond insurance business, through a public offering. The bank filed a registration statement, related to the offering, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. It confirmed that it expects proceeds from the sale to amount to Dollars 500m (Pounds 290m). The move comes at a time when Citicorp has been attempting to boost its capital base and clean up a Dollars 2bn portfolio of non-performing commercial real estate loans. Last month, it sold Dollars 660m of convertible preferred stock to investors. Weeks earlier, the bank had received a slightly smaller infusion when a Saudi Arabian prince agreed to subscribe for another Dollars 590m-worth of convertible stock. Yesterday, Citicorp said that the Ambac share sale was part of the same strategy. An improvement in the capital position by early 1993 was being sought via 'a variety of market transactions, including the sale of non-strategic assets'. Ambac, which provides default insurance on bonds issued by states and municipalities, is currently wholly-owned by Citicorp. It is one of the three main primary insurers in the field, the others being MBIA and Financial Guaranty Insurance. Accordingly to a recent study by Fitch Investors Services, Ambac's market share was around 21 per cent in 1990, when it insured Dollars 11.3bn of bonds, at par value. Yesterday, Citicorp said that a main benefit of the sale would be the effect on its 'tier one' capital ratio. It calculates that around Dollars 25bn of assets - essentially insurance in force, adjusted by various other considerations - will be removed from the calculation. This would make the effect of the transaction on the tier one capital ratio roughly equivalent to a Dollars 1bn capital infusion. The bank, which acquired Ambac back in 1985, had been trying to sell Ambac to a single buyer, but has now decided that a share offering is more attractive. The offering envisages a two-tier share structure for Ambac, so that Citicorp's initial ongoing voting interest would only be around 20 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Certificate of Nonsegregated Facilities. The Contractor certifies that it does not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it does not permit its employees to perform their services at any location, under its control, where segregated facilities are maintained. The Contractor certifies further that it will not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location, under its control, where segregated facilities are maintained. The Contractor agrees that a breach of this certification is a violation of the Equal Opportunity Clause in this Contract. As used in this certification, the term ``segregated facilities'' means any waiting rooms, work areas, restrooms and washrooms, restaurants and other eating areas, timeclocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees which are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin, because of habit, local custom, or otherwise. The Contractor agrees that (except where it has obtained identical certifications from proposed subcontractors for specific time periods) it will obtain identical certifications from proposed subcontractors prior to the award of subcontracts exceeding $10,000 which are not exempt from the provisions of the Equal Opportunity Clause, and that it will retain such certifications in its files.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6. Franchises and Rights-of-way. The Contractor will be under no obligation to obtain or assist in obtaining any franchises, authorizations, permits, or approvals required to be obtained by the Owner from Federal, state, county, municipal or other authority; any rights-of-way over private lands; or any agreements between the Owner and third parties with respect to the construction and operation of the Project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7. Nonassignment of Contract. The Contractor shall not assign the Contract effected by an acceptance of this Proposal or any part thereof or enter into any contract with any person, firm or corporation for the performance of the Contractor's obligations thereunder, or any part thereof, without the approval in writing of the Owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 8. Extension to Successors and Assigns. Each and all of the covenants and agreements contained in the Contract effected by the acceptance of the Proposal shall extend to and be binding upon the successors and assigns of the parties thereto.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  (Contractor)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  (President)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  (Address)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATTEST:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  (Secretary)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date of Proposal  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This Proposal must be signed with the full name of the Contractor.

The unit is 1,000 feet in length and 10 feet in width (to be measured on one side of the pole line) of actual clearing of right-of-way. This includes clearing of underbrush, tree removal, and such tree trimming as is required so that the right-of-way, except for tree stumps which shall not exceed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  in height, shall be clear from the ground up of the width specified on one side of the line of poles carrying primary conductors. This unit does not include clearing or trimming associated with secondaries or services which is included with conductor units. The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between stakes and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the ground line. All trees and underbrush across the width of the right-of-way, as designated by the Engineer shall be considered to be grouped together as a single length in measuring the total length of clearing. Spaces along the right-of-way in which no trees are to be removed or trimmed or underbrush cleared shall be omitted from the total measurement. All length thus arrived at, added together and divided by 1,000, shall give the number of 1,000-foot R1&hyph;10 units of clearing. This unit includes the removal or topping, at the option of the Contractor; of danger trees outside of the right-of-way when so designated by the Engineer. (Danger trees are defined as dead or leaning trees which, in falling, will affect the operation of the line.) The Contractor shall not remove or trim shade, fruit or ornamental trees unless so directed by the Engineer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> R1&hyph;20. This unit is identical with R1&hyph;10 except that width is 20 feet (to be measured 10 feet on each side of the pole line).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> R1&hyph;30. This unit is identical with R1&hyph;10 except that width is 30 feet (to be measured 15 feet on each side of the pole line).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> R1&hyph;40. This unit is identical with R1&hyph;10 except that width is 40 feet (to be measured 20 feet on each side of the pole line).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RC1&hyph;10, RC1&hyph;20, RC1&hyph;30, RC1&hyph;40. These units are identical to the respective R1 units except that chemical treatment of stumps is required in addition to the clearing of underbrush, tree removal and tree trimming.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, March 14 (XINHUA) -- China and Nigeria are  working on proposals for holding the third session of the  China-Nigeria Economic and Trade Joint Commission in Beijing,  China, a senior official from the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria  said today.    Huang Zhaohong, the Chinese economic and commercial  counselor, said that they have proposed the third quarter of  this year as the time for the session.    They are now waiting for a decision by the Nigerian Foreign  Ministry, he said.    The proposed session is expected to discuss ways to promote  bilateral trade and economic ties, Huang said.    The second session of the joint commission was held in Lagos  in 1985.    China and Nigeria have a lot in common as both are  developing  countries, he said, adding that "we need each other not only for  economic reasons."</p>

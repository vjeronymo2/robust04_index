			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Political Notebook: Risk-taking Major keeps Major the ditherer at bay MR John Major needs confidence. His cabinet colleagues hope that international acceptance of his plan for safe havens for the Kurds will provide it. There is still some ambivalence in Whitehall about the strategy. One senior official warned yesterday of the risk that British troops could become bogged down in Iraq. Ministers want them replaced by soldiers wearing the United Nations blue beret as quickly as possible. But the judgment at Westminster is that the prime minister had taken a risk that needed to be taken - and it had paid off handsomely. Even members of Labour's shadow cabinet admitted grudgingly that it would be harder to call him a ditherer. The voters may take the same view. French participation provided an added diplomatic bonus. Mr Major's success in rehabilitating Anglo-German relations and his choice of the European summit to launch the enclave plan has led President Francois Mitterrand to take him seriously. Downing Street is clearly excited about the prospect, pointing out that its announcement on Tuesday night came a full two minutes before President George Bush's press conference. If Mr Major is to dispel entirely the charge that he can not make up his mind, he must show the same confidence over the dismantling of the poll tax. Friends do not expect him to change his character - nor do they want him to. His political success is based on a clear-thinking, careful pragmatism which has steered him through the ministerial minefields that have claimed so many other once-rising stars. It is not a bad quality for a prime minister. Some colleagues would like to see a bit less personal understatement - and a bit more readiness to deal firmly with awkward television interviews. Most do not judge his ideological innocence a dangerous weakness. Nostalgia for the rough certainties of Thatcherism is unlikely to outlive the present parliament. But there is a widely-held view that he has overestimated the power of the irritated right of the Tory party. That, as much as the need to get the numbers right, has prevented a clean break with the poll tax. The property tax which the cabinet will approve today is as distant from the poll tax as it is from a local income tax. But Mr Major's anxiety to pretend that the principles have been preserved means that the 'son of poll tax' tag might yet stick. It would be far better, colleagues believe, to risk the wrath of a dozen or so of the disaffected and disenchanted on the Tory backbenches by making a clean break. Even the newspapers might applaud. The voters certainly would. * * * Mr Neil Kinnock is looking confident. He is convinced that Labour's latest policy document has rid it of its remaining ideological baggage. He can also act - as he has during the Kurdish crisis - as a leader in full command of his party. Few electors will actually read the document, titled Opportunity Britain, and among a random selection of Labour MPs this week only a minority were ready to claim with hand on heart that they would plough through the entire 27,000 words. But that is not the point. It is the message rather than the less-than-elegant prose which counts. The opinion polls indicate that the voters are receiving that message. They are still not quite certain what Labour stands for, but they are becoming convinced that it is no longer its old extremist self. Mr Kinnock's pledge to keep an independent nuclear deterrent as long as the Soviet Union maintains a nuclear arsenal will get him into trouble with the Labour conference, but there may be no harm in that. There is some anecdotal evidence also that Mr Major's tilt towards the centre has had the perverse effect of reinforcing his opponents' respectability. But there are still potentially dangerous traps in Labour's tax plans. The economic logic of its proposal to abolish the present ceiling on National Insurance Contributions is indisputable. Mr Nigel Lawson would have liked to have done so in 1988. The problem is that it would affect more than 3m voters - more than half of them with less-than-extravagant incomes of Pounds 20,000 a year or so. In the south, Labour will need their votes - and the votes of the millions of others whose incomes are approaching that level. The Conservatives will not be shy in telling them how much they stand to lose.</p>

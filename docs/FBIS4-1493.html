			<p>BFN     [Text] Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen said, as he  put it, the chaotic state of the election has upset many people.  General Viljoen said in Lydenburg that he was not criticizing  the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] because this  commission had been entrusted with an impossible task stemming  from wrong decisions.    [Begin recording] [Viljoen] I am not sure what was going on  here, but the number of votes, the additional ballot papers that  had to be printed has been Greek to me. I cannot understand why  such a situation prevails, and to me this does not make sense. I  think the situation has to be looked into very seriously.    [Correspondent Pieter Theron] Gen. Viljoen visited several  polling stations in the eastern and northern Transvaal. It was  clear that most people in these regions had already voted  yesterday. The voting in some places took place very  peacefully; no problems were experienced, although ballot papers  at some voting stations were lacking. The Freedom Front  contends that in view of numerous logistic and administrative  problems which cropped up during the election period, a leaders'  summit should be held immediately after the elections were  completed. It will determine whether the election had been free  and fair. [end recording]</p>

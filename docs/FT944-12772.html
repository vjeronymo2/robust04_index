			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Banks vie for Deutsche Telekom sale The German government will announce in the next few days which banks are to play the leading roles in the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, with Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, the most likely candidate to handle the international placing. Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, and Dresdner Bank are expected jointly to head the overall issue, set for early 1996, under which a minority of the shares in the German telecommunications concern will be sold to raise at least DM10bn (Pounds 4bn). Out of more than 20 banks vying for the lead foreign role, Goldman Sachs has emerged as the favourite to become global co-ordinator. As with the recent DM1bn partial privatisation of Lufthansa, the German airline, the bookbuilding method of selecting long-term quality investors from those keener on short-term gains will be used. The Lufthansa issue, led by Dresdner Bank, was heavily subscribed. For the much larger Deutsche Telekom issue - the state-owned telephone monopoly's total value is put at some DM60bn - separate regional consortiums are also planned to accommodate US, European and possibly Japanese investors. The choice of Goldman Sachs to head the international placing would irritate some non-German European banks which feel one of them should have this role, as Deutsche Telekom is a European concern. UK merchant banks with experience of international flotations have taken part in presentations, or 'beauty contests', in Bonn. They include SG Warburg, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Kleinwort Benson, National Westminster Bank, NM Rothschild and Robert Fleming. The other US banks which put submissions to the postal and finance ministries in Bonn - the official announcement will come from the former - include Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Salomon Brothers. Leading Swiss and French banks have also been involved. Because of tough global competition in investment banking, Deutsche Bank said on Friday it was putting its non-German investment banking activities in London. It will combine them with those of Morgan Grenfell, its UK merchant bank. International privatisations are among the areas in which the German bank wants to build up its strength.</p>

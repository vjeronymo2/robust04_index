			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;For sole community hospitals, 90 percent;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For urban hospitals with at least 100 beds that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a disproportionate share patient percentage of at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20.2 percent or that received more than 30 percent of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net inpatient care revenues from State or local governments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for indigent care, 80 percent;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For all other hospitals, 70 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's reasonable inpatient capital-related costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current regulations also provide that total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated payments under the exceptions process in a year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not exceed 10 percent of total estimated capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payments (exclusive of hold-harmless payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for old capital) for the same fiscal year. As we stated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the August 30, 1991 final rule, we will revise the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment percentages during any subsequent transition year,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if necessary, to ensure that exceptions payments do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceed the 10 percent limit. It has not yet been necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reduce the original minimum payment percentages to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 10 percent limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final rule for the prospective payment system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for capital-related costs, we stated that we would carefully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor the impact of the capital prospective payment system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to determine whether ``some type of permanent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions process is necessary and the circumstances under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which additional payments would be made (56 FR 43409).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the publication of the final rule for the capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment system, several commenters have urged us  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide special protection for hospitals that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertaking major renovation or replacement of aging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities during the decade of the transition. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters have pointed out that, unlike hospitals that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertook major renovation or replacement during the 1980s,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many hospitals that undertake capital replacement or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renovation projects during the transition do not qualify for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the protection for old capital or obligated capital during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the transition. In addition, unlike hospitals that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertake major capital replacement or renovation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decade after the transition period, such hospitals have not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had an opportunity to accrue capital prospective payments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fund the projects. We are aware of a number of major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects, scheduled for completion later in the transition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that could therefore not be included as old or obligated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital, and that involve major replacement or renovation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aging facilities. In the design of the capital prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment system, we have made every effort to consider the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances of hospitals for whom the transition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment poses special difficulties. We agree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the commenters that hospitals that need to undertake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major renovation or replacement projects during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transition face special difficulties merely because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timing of their projects. We do not believe that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare program should guarantee to underwrite every major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program of replacement or renovation of capital assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, under certain circumstances we believe that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair to provide special protection, through the exceptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, for hospitals that find themselves in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances cited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the exceptions categories identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, we are therefore proposing at &sect;412.348 to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special protection for some hospitals that are undertaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major projects to renovate or replace aging plant during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transition period. This special protection, which will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a 70 percent minimum payment level for up to ten  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years beyond the transition period, will be available only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the following classes of hospitals:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Sole community hospitals that have a current ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than or equal to of 1.75 in the exception year;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Urban hospitals with at least 100 beds that either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have disproportionate share percentages of at least 20.2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent or receive at least 30 percent of their revenue from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State or local funds for indigent care, and that have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current ratio less than or equal to 1.75 in the exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Hospitals with a combined inpatient Medicare and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid utilization of at least 70 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the hospital must meet an age of asset test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, if applicable, receive approval for the project from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State or local planning authority. If planning approval is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not required, an urban hospital must demonstrate either that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) that does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have an overall average occupancy rate less than 80 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or that its capacity is no more than 80 percent of its prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity (in terms of bed size).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that this exception should apply only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals that have previously been identified for special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection under the Medicare program (that is, sole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community hospitals or large urban hospitals that serve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disproportionate shares of indigent patients), or that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy utilization by beneficiaries of the Federal health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The average hospital utilization by Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiaries is approximately 10 percent. Hospitals with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60 percent Medicare utilization can reasonably claim high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare utilization rates. We have therefore determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, aside from certain sole community hospitals and large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urban disproportionate share hospitals, this special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception should be restricted to hospitals with combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare and Medicaid utilization of at least 70 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also requiring that sole community hospitals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large urban disproportionate share hospitals must have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current ratios of less than or equal to 1.75 in order to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible for this special exception. We do not believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals that do not have high Medicare and Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilization should be eligible for this special exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless they are financially vulnerable. The current ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is perhaps the most widely used measure of hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liquidity. It is defined as the number of dollars held in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current assets per dollar of current liabilities. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher values reflect a stronger short-term financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition. A current ratio of 2.0 or better is a common  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital target for financial performance. We therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that a current ratio of less than or equal to 1.75  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a sufficient indication of financial stress to qualify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for special protection under the exceptions policy. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current ratio can be determined from information available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the Medicare cost report (HCFA 2552&hyph;92, Worksheet G,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lines 11 and 43).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

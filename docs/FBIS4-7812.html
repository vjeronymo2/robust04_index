			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Knin, 6 Apr (TANJUG) -- In western Slavonia, both  sides [Krajina Serbs and Croats] today started to withdraw heavy  weapons 10 or 20 km, Officer Branko Opacic from the Serb Krajina  army's general staff told TANJUG.    The withdrawal -- envisaged by the Zagreb cease-fire  agreement -- had been delayed because of a misunderstanding  concerning the interpretation of a number of clauses of this  agreement, but all problems were resolved on the spot by joint  commissions.

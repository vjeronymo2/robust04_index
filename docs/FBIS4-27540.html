			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  carries an article by Yi Yong-tok, vice-chairman of the Central  Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea  [LSWYK], under the headline "Strengthening Education of Youth  and Children is Consistent Policy of Our Party."    The article says:    The lifeline of the revolution is maintained by the new  generation and the destiny of the country is decided by it. The  destiny of the party and the revolution largely depends on the  education of the youth and children, the new generation.    From early days the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] has paid  deep attention to firmly training the new generation, attaching  importance to the education of the youth and children.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il indicated the road of  the movement of the Korean youth and children conforming to the  development of the revolution at the stage where the cause of  modeling the whole society on the chuche idea is being realized  and powerfully organizations of the WPK, the LSWYK and the  childrens' union to follow this road.    The question of the education of the youth and children has  been successfully solved in Korea under the wise guidance of the  party.    The 8 million youths and children are demonstrating their  stout spirits and noble traits as the dependable successors to  the revolution and living and striving with the resolution to  lay down their lives as rifles and bombs in case of emergency.  This clearly proves the vitality of our party's policy of  education of the youth and children.    To strengthen ideological education among the youth and  children is an urgent demand of our developing revolution and  the obtaining [word as received] situation.    The imperialists and reactionaries of the world are getting  more desperate in their maneuvers to isolate and stifle the  DPRK, the socialist fortress. They are trying to disarm the  youth and children ideologically in executing their  anti-socialist strategy.    The historical experiences and lessons of the socialist  movement teach us that the destiny of the socialist cause  largely depends on the ideological education of the new  generation.    Only when we better educate the young men and women, the  most  active and influential unit of the society, and the school  children, the future of the motherland, can we firmly defend  Korean-style socialism and successfully carry forward the  revolutionary cause of chuche to accomplishment.    The vice-chairman elaborates on important questions arising  in the education of the youth and children in the present times  such as education in revolutionary tradition, class education  and socialist patriotic education.</p>

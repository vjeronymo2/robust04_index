			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kril: "Election of Three Members in the </F> First Round Means Defeat for the Republican Party"]    [Text] Nine of 23 legislative seats are already occupied.  The "New Wave" Association was the most successful. From now  on, its five members -- I. Yukhnovskyy, V. Pynzennyk, I.  Koliushko, and M. Kosiv -- will represent Lvov Oblast in the  Supreme Council. The Ukrainian Republican Party, however,  sustained a defeat in the first round of parliamentary elections  -- none of its candidates won a legislative seat. Also defeated  was its leader, M. Horyn, who lost to his former colleague S.  Khmara. Mr. Horyn believes that the fact that only three  "Republicans" qualified for the second-round election is a  humiliating defeat for the party. In his words, other parties  fared better "thanks to the destructive idea of fighting with  Mafia, employed by Russia's Zhirinovskiy some time ago."    The slogan "Strength, Order, and Wealth," trotted out by the  Ukrainian Popular Army-Ukrainian National Self-Defense during  its campaign, failed to win much support among the electorate.  Out of nine candidates proposed by the above organizations,  only two will continue to fight in the second round.    In spite of an aggressive campaign, candidates from the  so-called Ukrainian National Socialist Party (not registered  officially, by the way), who ran in almost every electoral  district, found themselves "off the board." Obviously, the  electorate was a bit confused by their slightly extravagant  uniform, including black shirts with swastikas. People could  have also associated them with the "brown shirts..."    Among those who failed to garner a sufficient number of  votes  on the first try were L. Skoryk (23.4 percent) and I. Kalynets  (18.7 percent). A. Holub, member of the Communist Party of  Ukraine and "Pravda" correspondent, was the only journalist who  made it to the second round. So far, the most successful Rukh  members were L. Tanyuk and Ya. Kendzyor. Five more will have to  brace up for the next round. Their rivals are primarily  independent candidates and members of the Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists.    The highest turnout on 27 March was primarily reported from  rural areas. However, both city and rural residents are anxious  to know one thing: Will the new legislators justify the hefty  funds that the state paid -- from taxpayers' pockets, naturally  -- to stage the elections?</p>

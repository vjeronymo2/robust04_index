			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Long View: Rewards of playing safe TAKE LESS risk and earn a higher return? It is not in the textbooks. If the opportunity does occur for an extended period it is a sign that something is badly wrong. Just a year ago sterling interest rates fell by half a percentage point to 10 1/2 per cent, which at the time seemingly represented just another step in a long decline. But base rates have managed only another half-point fall in the past 12 months, amid post-election euphoria. They have recently appeared more likely to rise than to fall further, though the market's immediate fears were soothed by Thursday's move to shore up sterling by borrowing DM20bn. The phase of continuous double-digit sterling interest rates now goes back more than four years. It has been a wonderful period for cautious depositors in bank and building society accounts who even now are receiving something like 7 per cent net of standard rate tax. In fact, it is often better at present to invest in money funds that are plugged more directly into money market rates. But even though the High Street deposit rates may have dropped a little over the past year, the rate of inflation has fallen by more, from 5.5 to 3.7 per cent, so the real rate of interest has actually gone up. This is not what is supposed to happen in recessions, when money ought to become cheap. We have broken the textbook rules again. There is a colossal distortion of the financial system. Interest rates are being held high in order to suppress inflation and prop up the sterling exchange rate. One consequence is that the reward for risk has disappeared. According to the magazine Money Management Pounds 1,000 invested in a Halifax account over the past five years would have rolled up to Pounds 1,490 today, for a standard rate taxpayer. In 1987 pounds that is only Pounds 1,090 but it still represents a positive real return. However, Pounds 1,000 committed to the average unit trust would have shrunk to Pounds 914 (Pounds 670 in terms of the original money). Now, you can argue that such sums based on share prices just before the 1987 crash are freakish. Moreover the high costs of unit trusts have distorted the comparison. If you had invested directly in the stock market, on the basis of the All-Share Index, and you ignored costs but allowed for standard rate tax on dividends, Pounds 1,000 five years ago might be worth Pounds 1,070 today. Still better, suppose you shrewdly waited to invest until after the crash. Pounds 1,000 in November 1987 might now have grown to perhaps Pounds 1,375. No wonder the unit trust marketing men are waiting eagerly until the effect of the crash drops out of their five-year performance figures. But this still does not beat the risk-free deposit performance. Nor does it show up very well against government securities. Over the past five years Pounds 1,000 invested in long-dated gilt-edged (again, ignoring costs) would have accumulated to some Pounds 1,400. This is in stark contrast to the historical pattern: over the past 75 years or so, pre-tax returns on equities have exceeded those on gilts by 6 per cent a year on average. There need be no mystery about the strange trends in the investment markets. High interest rates have supported the sterling exchange rate, which has reduced the returns from overseas investment. Domestically, profitability has been suppressed so that dividend growth has not only slowed down but is now going into reverse. Those depositors are sitting pretty in all this. But all around us we can see the damage that is being done. Depositors are being paid more than most borrowers can possibly afford, especially when the beleaguered banks are trying to jack up their margins. Businesses by the thousand are being bankrupted. Between 1m and 1.5m home buyers, mostly young, are technically insolvent with 'negative equity'. A clash of the generations is looming. The 'woopies', the well-off older people who traded down in the housing market in the late 1980s and banked the net proceeds are enjoying a double payoff, with an income bonus to add to their capital windfall. But no nation can expect to lure its young people into financial ruin and get away with it. Double-digit interest rates have persisted in the UK for more than four years now, ever since Nigel Lawson, in the early summer of 1988, realised that he had problems more serious than a tendency for sterling to rise above DM3. But while high interest rates can provide valuable short-term shock treatment, as a long-term therapy for an over-indebted economy they are ultimately destructive. They must lead to a collapse of asset values and the failure of the financial system. The precise timing of any change of approach may depend on external factors such as the French referendum on Maastricht and the ups and downs of German interest rates. But a sharp and sudden policy reversal is inevitable in due course. The British Government will come to regret its decision to enter the ERM without applying direct measures to force an almost immediate pay and price adjustment, and without a strategy for controlling the inevitable shakeout in the property market. This week Norman Lamont has again failed to intervene in the domestic economy and has relied on rigging the exchange rate. As for investors, they can begin to anticipate the return of conditions in which risk is once again rewarded. But the government can continue to buy time if it is unconcerned about the cost; and the past couple of months have shown that bad investment timing can be punished severely. For the moment, if you have a comfortable nest-egg returning 10 per cent gross you may reckon that the Bundesbank is still your friend. UK inflation, you may calculate, could be no more than 2 1/2 per cent over the next 12 months. Enjoy your good fortune so long as it lasts.</p>

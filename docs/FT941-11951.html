			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Major rebuffs Tory right on cabinet changes Mr John Major threw out right-wing demands for changes in his cabinet line-up yesterday in a move calculated to restore some of his authority over the government. However, the government's difficulties continued to mount as Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, prepared for a retreat today on the controversial police bill and Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, admitted that senior ministers were 'beleaguered'. It also emerged that the cabinet will rush through approval tomorrow for reports from five pay review bodies giving 1.5m public sector workers pay rises of between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent. Downing Street is understood to be 'relaxed' about the reports, which will be funded by efficiency savings to circumvent the cash freeze on the government's pay bill announced in the budget. Buttressed by support from mainstream Conservative MPs, Mr Major left little doubt about his anger at the Tory right's demands. A delegation of MPs from the right-wing 92 Group emerged chastened from Mr Major's Commons office a few minutes after arriving to demand urgent changes. The prime minister was particularly angry about publicity given to the meeting, which suggested that he was being offered terms for his survival as leader. Friends of Mr Major said the talks broke up only two minutes after the arrival of the deputation, led by Sir George Gardiner, the 92 Group chairman. The right put a brave face on its defeat, insisting that the meeting lasted nearly 10 minutes, and claiming it had been 'deferred' by agreement with Mr Major. 'We did not feel it was a brush off by the prime minister,' Sir George said. However, Mr Major's robust response was applauded by centrist and left-wing supporters. 'This was the prime minister exercising a firm grip on government,' said one. It was also welcomed by right-wing MPs who believe that the government's difficulties are rooted in the prime minister's failure to exercise authority over the Conservative party. 'We have seen another side of the prime minister,' said Mr David Evans, an independent-minded right-wing member of the executive of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers. Mr Major's robust action will quell speculation about an early reshuffle, which most MPs now believe will be delayed until after the local government and European parliament elections in May and June. It will also seriously undermine the influence of Sir George, who was widely regarded as a right-wing power broker until he lost his place on the 1922 executive last year. Conservative MPs were heartened by Mr Major's unusually aggressive performance during Commons question time, when he angrily dismissed criticism of the sale of Rover to BMW from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. However, senior ministers admit that the government still has a lot to do to restore its authority. Mr Clarke said on BBC radio that the prime minister was 'getting criticised very unfairly at the moment'. Howard yields to critics, Page 7</p>

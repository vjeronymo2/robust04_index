			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: IBM and Microsoft settle PC software dispute IBM and Microsoft have reached an agreement on software licensing and patent royalties that resolves a long-running dispute over personal computer operating system software. The agreement between IBM and Microsoft has been dubbed a 'divorce settlement' because it ends almost two years of acrimony which began when the companies chose different paths towards the development of a new generation of PC software. IBM and Microsoft had worked closely together since IBM chose Microsoft's 'DOS' program for its original PC 12 years ago. The companies went on to collaborate in the development of a new operating system, called OS/2. However, the first version was a flop and Microsoft chose to pursue development of its own 'Windows' program while eventually dropping its efforts to improve OS/2. Windows has since become become a huge success, with sales of over 10m copies. IBM, which continued work on OS/2 alone, recently launched a much improved version of the operating system which, according to IBM, is selling strongly although in smaller numbers. Microsoft is expected to launch a new version of Windows, Windows Net Technology, later this year, that will compete head-on with IBM's OS/2. Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chief executive, has been scathing in his criticism of IBM, while IBM executives, although more restrained, have been unable to hide their annoyance over the embarrassing split. The companies have now agreed to license each other to use IBM's OS/2 and Microsoft's Windows programs until the end of 1993. The companies have also entered into a long-term patent licensing agreement. Other terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but Microsoft is believed to be paying IBM about Dollars 20m for rights to the computer giant's extensive patent portfolio, which includes basic software technology. Microsoft is the first large software company to reach a patent cross-licence agreement with IBM, raising the prospect that IBM may seek fees from other software publishers. The battle between Microsoft and IBM has caused confusion among PC buyers and throughout the PC software industry, so the resolution of the dispute will benefit all, the companies claimed. 'With these agreements behind us, we will both be free to continue with our individual business strategies to meet our customers' needs,' said Mr Lee Reiswig Jr, the IBM executive in charge of personal computer software. Mr Bernard Pache, the new chief executive of Groupe Bull, the loss-making French computer manufacturer, yesterday confirmed the company's strategic alliance with IBM. The US group is paying FFr540m (Dollars 7.51m), or FFr48 a share, for a 5.68 per cent stake in Bull.</p>

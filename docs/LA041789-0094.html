			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Canadians to Bid for Jerusalem Post: Canadian investors headed by Charles  Bronfman and British publisher Robert Maxwell will make a joint bid for the  Jerusalem Post, Israel's English-language daily, a spokesman for the two said.  Bronfman's Claridge group and Maxwell, chairman of Maxwell Communication Corp.,  are bidding for the controlling 55% stake in the left-leaning Post, owned by a  subsidiary of Israel's troubled Koor Industries. The Maxwell-Bronfman group,  refused to disclose the amount of the offer to be submitted today. The Post  does not make a profit and its daily circulation of about 28,000 is among the  smallest of the secular Israeli newspapers but it is read by government  leaders, diplomats, the foreign media, English-speaking Israelis and  Palestinians and visiting Jews. A weekly international edition reaches 60,000  readers.  </P></p>

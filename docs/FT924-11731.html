			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Witnesses afraid to speak out about mass grave A ROMANIAN prosecutor appealed yesterday for witnesses to come forward with information on a mass grave containing scores of bodies being excavated in woodland near Bucharest, Reuter reports from Bucharest. 'We have difficulties in our investigations. People are afraid to talk to the prosecutor ..We are willing to receive any helpful information,' Mr Adrian Vartires, the prosecutor of Bucharest said. Mr Vartires was referring to a grave dating from the communist era at Caciulati-Snagov, about 40 km north of the Romanian capital, where scores of bodies, possibly victims of the communist secret police, have been discovered. In the period from 1949 to 1951 some buildings in the area were used as a base of the dreaded Securitate secret police. Romania suffered one of eastern Europe's harshest communist dictatorships from 1947 to December 1989 when Stalinist ruler Mr Nicolae Ceausescu was deposed and shot in a bloody uprising. Only Mr Ceausescu and a few cohorts were tried and sentenced for abuses. No thorough official probe has been conducted by post-1989 governments into communist atrocities, and many former senior communists remain in positions of power. Dr Viorel Panaitescu, manager of the Bucharest Forensic Institute, said a first group of 28 skeletons which had been examined showed they were men and women aged 13 to 65 when they died, 30 to 40 years ago, between 1950 and 1960. This would have been during the 16-year rule of Romania's first communist leader Mr Gheorghe Gheorghiu Dej, Ceausescu's predecessor, who used brutal methods to crush all opposition. All the bodies were buried only 40-50 cm below the surface with no trace of coffin wood, cloth or clothes, and four of them showed evidence of having been shot at very close range with a 7.63 mm calibre gun, he said. 'It is strange the skeletons are in such an advanced state of decay. The moment you take them in your hand, they fall apart. It is possible that after death some caustic substance was poured over the corpses,' Mr Panaitescu said. 'The area being in a wood, it is hard to believe that wild animals did not smell the bodies and try to dig them out,' he said.</p>

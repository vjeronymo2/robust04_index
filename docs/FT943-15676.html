			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Russia loses confidence of oil majors Western oil companies attempting to operate in Russia are now scaling back or freezing their operations in the country and even warning of pulling out completely - citing high taxes, restrictive export quotas, bureaucratic delays, and in-fighting and continuing hostility from Russian production associations to their attempts to exploit the vast resources in Siberia and other regions. Though there have been some encouraging agreements, western executives say the conditions do not permit major investments. A range of medium to large projects are now frozen or in doubt. These include: An agreement signed three years ago by Elf Aquitaine to explore reserves in the Volgograd and Saratov regions. This has been stuck in negotiations between local, regional and federal authorities - an impasse which has meant that no exploration work has yet begun. Mr Daniel Lefebvre, the French project manager, said: 'So far it has proved impossible to work in accordance with legal practice. We hope that it will become clearer by the end of the year.' An agreement negotiated by the German company Deminex - a subsidiary of Veba  -also to exploit reserves in the Volgograd region - is delayed because of a lack of guarantees on investment and a fixed tax regime and 'clear commitments to transport the product', according to Mr Fritz Wenzel, a Veba vice-president. A Russian-US joint venture at the Chernogorskoye field in Nizhnevartovsk, in the Tyumen region, is now under threat because the agreed amount of oil to be exported has not been forthcoming, and the largest part of a Dollars 84m (Pounds 55.2m) loan put up by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation has not been disbursed. A senior executive connected with the project said yesterday: 'The problem is the high tax structure and the inability of the government to enforce the reduction of the export tax as promised. 'One arm of the government is trying to enhance tax revenues any way it can and the other is promising reductions to get investments.' The fields in the Tyumen region, still by far the biggest producer, are now encountering severe problems from flooding - but the oil associations are reluctant to invite in western companies in any other capacity than suppliers of technical assistance. Meetings between western European oil executives and officials of regional associations in the town of Surgut earlier this week showed that the Russian producers were deeply reluctant to admit there was a need for the western companies and the executives were confused about how they might find ways to co-operate. Mr Victor Deshura, chief engineer of Surgutneftegas, a regional production association, told the oil executives this week that 'our problems are not just about investment. I don't believe companies should come in here and try to solve our problems. The intellectual level of our own people is high enough.' The region has already repelled efforts by, among others, BP to set up production projects - and seems likely to continue to do so. At the same time, Russian production continues to fall rapidly - as wells go out of production because of flooding or exhaustion, and none are brought in to replace their lost output. The Petroleum Information Agency said yesterday that production in the first six months of the year stood at 145.5m tonnes - 85.5 per cent of last year's level.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / International Company News: Nynex to reduce staff by 'several thousand' Nynex, the Baby Bell telephone company serving the north-eastern US, plans to cut 'several thousand' jobs within three years. However, it denied reports that up to 22,000 of the 69,000 in its telecommunications division would go. It has already shrunk its payroll by about 13 per cent in the past two years. Nynex said the company had made it clear that it intended to reduce its costs by between 30 per cent and 40 per cent before the end of 1996. The company has yet to put a figure on reductions required. Most national and regional telephone companies have been cost-cutting or restructuring to survive an increasingly competitive environment. Nynex is likely to face opposition from telecommunications unions over its plans to reduce its workforce. Yesterday, the president of the Communications Workers of America said the union would not tolerate any plan which forced employees off the payroll. In 1989, a dispute over wages and benefits led to a strike at Nynex that lasted 17 weeks.</p>

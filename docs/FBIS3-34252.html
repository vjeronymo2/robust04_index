			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with King Husayn upon his return from a tour </F> abroad by correspondent Kassab Samawi in Amman on 4 February --  recorded]    [Text] [Samawi] Sir, would you tell us first about your  trip to the United States. Are you satisfied with the results  of this visit?    [Husayn] Praise be to God. Personally, my medical results  are very satisfactory, according to what doctors told me. I  need another checkup after six months, and then an annual  checkup, as is the case with anybody. Praise be to God, the  results are good. On the official level, my meetings with the  U.S. President and the U.S. Administration were useful and  addressed all important issues in this region. I felt, indeed,  that there is resolve and determination to crystallize the  concept of participation and turn it into joint action to reach  the required results and achieve a just and comprehensive peace  in this region. In our visit to Croatia, naturally, I was very  happy to meet with the youth of the homeland while performing a  great duty of peacekeeping as part of the international  peacekeeping forces there. They have won the respect, love, and  appreciation of everybody, all the parties for which they are  providing security and a decent life. I believe it is a source  of pride for us to know that we are the second largest force in  the peacekeeping troops there, after France. This is a major  role played by Jordan. This is not strange for this good  country, in terms of its aspirations and objectives to see  people live in freedom, dignity, and security, wherever they are.    [Samawi] Your Majesty, we observed that during your talks  with the U.S. Administration, there was a focus on bilateral  relations. To what degree has the United States shown  understanding of Jordan's needs, in terms of foreign  indebtedness and inspection at al-'Aqabah Port?    [Husayn] As a matter of fact, the results were satisfactory,  and I felt that there is understanding and resolve to see warm  relations once again. The word warm has been overused, but I  mean to have good, strong relations, as they were one day, and  perhaps stronger than in the past. There is a sure desire for  support and backing on the part of the President and the  Administration. It might take some time, but I believe the  results will be satisfactory, God willing.    [Samawi] After the Arab-American summit meetings and in  light of this flurry of activity on the peace process, are we  close to achieving peace?    [Husayn] I cannot say for sure that we are that close to  achieving peace, but I believe that the process is serious and I  hope that we will see progress on all tracks in the coming  phase. Naturally, I do not know everything about what happened  in Davos, but we have to learn about all the details. There  could be difficulties or obstacles from time to time, but I  believe these could be overcome if everybody wants to achieve a  peace that future generations accept.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Upton may take legal action over Reject buy Upton &amp; Southern, the department store group, said yesterday it was considering legal action not only against some former directors of the Reject Shop but also against its financial advisers. Upton said on Tuesday that the financial and trading position of Reject Shop, the household goods retailer it bought in February, was materially worse than represented at the time of the deal. That news sent Upton's shares plunging by 12p to 14p, and they fell a further 2p yesterday. Upton is contesting the valuation of the Reject Shop's inventory stocks at the time of the acquisition. It said yesterday that about one third of the expected stock was found not to be there. 'We expected the cupboard to be fairly empty but not bare,' it said. Upton's lawyers, Nabarro Nathanson, and auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand, are studying a report by Mr Ian Steven, its finance director, to decide whether to institute proceedings against 'certain former directors' of Reject Shop. The company is also considering action against the Reject Shop's accountants Stoy Hayward and stockbrokers Smith New Court. Smith New Court had no comment yesterday. Mr Jeffrey Gould, Upton's chief executive, declined to disclose how due diligence was conducted before the deal or how the problem had arisen. 'Once you get involved in the company and you understand it a lot more, these things become more apparent to you, rather than on the outside.' Upton said part of the difficulty lay in the need for confidentiality in quoted company deals. In order to avoid market rumours information from the other side had to be accepted. 'You're dealing with public companies, both should be ethical and give true valuation.' Mr Gould said he did not regret the purchase. The former Reject Shop stores still represented 'an opportunity', but the less than expected value of their stock had set back his turnround plans by six to seven months. Upton bought Reject Shop in a Pounds 2.5m all-paper deal in March. This week it said a cash shortage of about Pounds 2.75m had resulted from the worse than anticipated financial and trading position.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Reed Elsevier may buy airline guides REED ELSEVIER, the inter- national publishing and information group, has signed a letter of intent to purchase Official Airline Guides in a deal worth Dollars 425m (Pounds 275m). The move came on the same day as the company, owned jointly by Reed International and Elsevier, reached an agreement to acquire at least a controlling interest in Editions Techniques, the French legal publishers. No price was disclosed but it is believed the agreement would value Editions Techniques at around Pounds 75m. These are the first two planned acquisitions to be announced since Reed International and Elsevier merged at the beginning of this year. One of the reasons behind the merger was to increase the combined group's ability to take on international acquisitions. However, the OAG letter of intent, signed with Price Waterhouse, the joint administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation, is non-exclusive and is being seen as a way to find out whether Reed Elsevier, which already owns ABC airlines guides, would be qualified to bid under anti-trust legislation. 'There's a long way to go yet. This is just getting into the paddock,' one of those close to the negotiations said yesterday. Mr Alan Jamieson of Price Waterhouse said yesterday: 'If a better bid comes forward we are free to accept that bid. If we have no better bid we are happy to move to contract at that price.' The assets on offer, which include travel magazines as well as an airline information service, are similar to those bought by Mr Robert Maxwell from Dun &amp; Bradstreet for Dollars 750m in 1988. The deal, which is subject to further due diligence, does not include Standard Rate &amp; Data Service. Reed Elsevier will argue that putting together OAG and ABC will allow the business to compete better with the electronic systems now being operated by many airlines. Any deal will be subject to approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act. Mr Guy Lamming, media analyst at stockbrokers James Capel said last night that both deals looked good for Reed Elsevier. 'OAG looks cheap with operating profits of Dollars 44.547m in 1992,' said Mr Lamming who added a higher rival bid was still possible. If the OAG deal goes ahead the acquisition will be by Reed Travel group, a subsidiary of Reed Elsevier. Editions Techniques is the largest general legal publisher in France with a workforce of 500 people and sales last year of around Pounds 48m. Its best known publication is the series Juris Classeurs which covers most aspects of law and includes 80 titles in 400 volumes. The family-owned company also owns the medical publication Encyclopedie Medico Chirurgicale. The size of Reed Elsevier's ultimate stake in the company will depend on further negotiations with members of the family. Lex, Page 20</p>

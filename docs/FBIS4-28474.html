			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article; part two of series entitled </F> "Bureaucrats and the Coalition Government": "Argument Over  Possible Action Against North Korea Intensifies"]    [Text] "Could you please spare me a few minutes? I have  something to tell you." At the beginning of April, a senior  Foreign Ministry official dropped in on Tomiichi Murayama,  chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], at his  office, which is located in the members' office building. The  Foreign Ministry official left shortly after briefing Chairman  Murayama on the growing crisis over the DPRK's alleged nuclear  weapons development program.  <H5>  The Bitter Experience of the Gulf War Is Ever-Present in the </H5> Minds of the Bureaucrats    Two weeks later, during the process of hammering out a  policy  platform for the new coalition government, the SDPJ and the  Shinseito-Komeito [Japan Renewal Party-Clean Government Party]  bloc were strongly divided over the question of how far Japan  would be able to cooperate should the United States decide to  impose sanctions on North Korea ahead of a UN resolution.    Takeo Nishioka, who was waiting for the outcome of the  negotiations inside the Diet building, explained the sentiments  of Shinseito coleader Ichiro Ozawa and of his allies as follows:  "The fact that Japan was unable to take prompt action during the  Gulf war remains in everyone's heart. If possible,  crisis-management legislation should be drafted," he said. (At  that time, Nishioka was the leader of Kaikaku No Kai, a group of  former members of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] who are  closely aligned with Shinseito.)    "Although we made every effort to explain the situation, the  SDPJ did not understand at all," the senior Foreign Ministry  official said disappointedly. "There is a great possibility  that Japan might be forced to take some action against North  Korea in the near future. When the time comes, we do not want  to see politicians disputing basic points," he added.    In May 1991, shortly after the end of the Gulf war, a U.S.  delegation led by Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz  came to Japan to hold discussions with senior Japanese Defense  Agency officials and with LDP members. When [Foreign Minister]  Koji Kakizawa, who at that time was chief of the LDP's National  Defense Division, explained to the U.S. side that "Japan will  continue to contribute to activities based on UN resolutions," a  senior U.S defense official said with a glum look, "Does this  mean that Japan will only be able to repeat what it did during  the Gulf war should hostilities break out on the Korean  peninsula?" Senior Defense Agency officials, who attended the  meeting, took these words seriously.    Since the end of March 1994, each political party has been  holding a series of informal meetings to study the DPRK issue.  Foreign Ministry and Defense Agency officials, who are unable to  forget the bitter experience of the Gulf war, volunteered to  join these meetings as lecturers.  <H5>  Bureaucrats Are Making Steady Progress in Their "Study of </H5> the North Korean Issue"    On March 30, the day before the UN Security Council issued a  statement urging North Korea to accept full-scale international  inspections of its nuclear sites, the LDP held a joint meeting  on issues related to Northeast Asia. At the meeting, Shunji  Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's General  Foreign Policy Bureau, stressed that the government's basic  stand is "to seek a resolution of the crisis concerning the  DPRK's suspected nuclear program through dialogue." However,  at the same time he added, "By employing different scenarios,  the ministries and agencies concerned are checking on what Japan  can or cannot do within the existing legal framework."    According to high-ranking government officials, the  ministries and agencies concerned are not examining possible  measures with the object of "preparing for an emergency arising  from trouble on the Korean peninsula" but rather they are just  doing this as part of their "study of the North Korean issue."  They have been making steady progress in compiling possible  measures that might be taken against the DPRK -- restrictions on  bilateral trade through a government ordinance on trade  controls, and a regulation from the Finance Ministry restricting  the flow of funds from Korean residents in Japan to North Korea.  The possibility of assisting a U.S. naval blockade is also  being examined. Some documents compiled by the Defense Agency  even refer to Japan's participation in the U.S. Theater Missile  Defense plan as "an option having a psychological effect on  North Korea," although there is controversy over this subject,  which includes the problem of collective self-defense.    Meanwhile, shortly after assuming his post in the Hata  administration, Foreign Minister Kakizawa said that Japan needs  a public debate on reinterpreting the Constitution regarding the  notion of collective self-defense.    Although the DPRK's intentions are still unclear and  although  the UN Security Council has not yet decided on a response, the  belief that Japan will take action against North Korea is  growing because of the support for this by both bureaucrats and  politicians.    Officials at the prime minister's official residence in  charge of the DPRK issue feel apprehensive about such a  situation. "Seen from a diplomatic viewpoint, it is undesirable  to hold such discussions in this way, because our neighboring  countries may make various conjectures about this. The study of  possible actions should be pursued quietly," they said.    "Japan's cooperation on sanctions is very important.  However, if Japan reinterprets the Constitution for that  purpose, the new interpretation will remain valid even after the  North Korean issue is settled. So, we have mixed feelings," the  first secretary at the South Korea Embassy said when he was  asked about the fact that there is a belief within the Japanese  Government that Japan should participate in an economic  blockade, even by reinterpreting the Constitution. "All the  words that Japan has been using to apologize for its actions  during the war were a mere pretense. Japan is expressing regret  just because it wants to become a permanent member of the UN  Security Council. I was swayed by such misgivings when I heard  the remarks of ex-Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano regarding the  1937 Rape of Nanjing," the secretary added.  <H5>  Bureaucrats Have the Question of Permanent Membership on the </H5> UN Security Council on their Minds    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata clearly expressed his intention  to seek a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. "If you  want to push for a permanent seat, this is the time to start  lobbying," Yoshio Hata, Japan's former ambassador to the United  Nations, stressed when he called on Prime Minister Hata at the  beginning of May. Meanwhile, Sakigake [Harbinger], which  strongly favors minimal involvement by Japan in global affairs,  opted out of the ruling coalition. As a result, bureaucrats  have become more aggressive over diplomatic and security issues.</p>

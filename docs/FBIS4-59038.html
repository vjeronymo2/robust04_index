			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 6, IRNA -- A Central Bank advisor after  reviewing the current economic developments, has said that Iran  which has a population of 60 million, last year earned dlrs 7  billion through exports and this means that many capacities have  been created in the country.    Dr. Kashani said at the joint assembly of the Chambers of  Commerce of Iran and Germany, last night that it is true that  the country and the banks over the past two years faced delay of  payments but for this loss during the past four years more work  was done than predicted in the first 5-year plan. The average  growth of 8.1 per cent gnp is a good sympton of what the country  has gained, he added.    He said in the year 1367 (1988-89) Iran imported 4.5 to 5  million tons of wheat every year while this figure in the years  1371 and 1372 (1993-94) decreased to 2.5 million tons.    The importation of almost four million tons of iron and  steel  in 1367 was changed to the export of one million tons of these  materials in 1372, according to Kashani.    Referring to the fact that the capacity of oil production in  the country has reached from 2.5 million bpd in 1367 to 4.5 bpd  last year, he said Iran's five-year development plan has proved  it success with less than 500 foreign experts, and the growth of  its capital formation has reached 23 per cent of GNP.    Another official, Allahyari, said in the same meeting that a  committee had been set up at the office of the economic affairs  deputy at the presidential office, involving the Ministries of  Economy and Finance, Commerce, the budget and planning  organization and the Central Bank to control the level of the  country's foreign exchange commitments.    He expressed hope that Iran and Germany will make progress  in  cultural areas also in view of their good relations in the  economic and trade fields.    Head of the Chamber of Commerce 'Ali-Naqi Khamoushi said the  relations between Iran and Germany were never severed even  during the imposed war (1980-88).    He said certain mischievous hands were trying to mar the two  countries' good relations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a military source, on 3 May, the U.S.  imperialists deployed from overseas bases for mobile operations  several tens of fighter planes and lethal equipment in South  Korea. Following this, they waged a provocative joint aerial war  exercise aimed at a northward invasion.    That day, F-15 fighter-bombers, FA-18 pursuit-assault  planes,  AV-8 vertical take-off and landing assault planes, KC-135  refueling planes, which were flown in from U.S. Pacific bases,  were deployed for mobile operations at the bases of the U.S.  occupation air force in South Korea.    That day, too, C-141 and C-130 transport squadrons carrying  numerous troops of aggression and lethal equipment flew into  South Korea one after another from overseas bases.    In accordance with the integrated operational plans of the  U.S. Pacific Area Air Force Command and Naval Command, a joint  aerial war exercise of a northward invasion was frantically  waged, centered on the areas over Tokchok Island, Yoju,  Chongson, and Muju that day.    Put into this frantic war exercise were airplane squadrons,  which had come for mobile operations from overseas bases, and  about 450 fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes,  reconnaissance planes, and armed helicopters belonging to the  U.S. occupation air force in South Korea and to the puppet air  force.    Within the system of this war exercise, KC-135 refueling  planes conducted midair refueling for about 50 F-16 and F-15  fighter-bombers which were flying around for a joint aerial war  exercise of a northward invasion, using an area over the sea off  Kunsan as an operational arena.    This war exercise, sputtering the fire of a war [chonjaengui  pulshiga tuingguinun], was a reckless playing with fire aimed at  promoting the practical cooperation between the overseas-based  air squadrons, and the U.S. occupation air force in South Korea  and the puppet air force and at increasing the capabilities for  an actual warfare with a succession of surprise strikes against  strategic sites in the northern part of the Republic with the  support of midair refueling planes.    In the meantime, the South Korean puppets ran wild in a war  exercise of a northward invasion in an area near the Military  Demarcation Line, right in front of our nose.    On 3 May, the puppet Army's tank group deployed in Kumpa-ri  in Paju County fired about 20 shells at Hapo-ri. The puppet  Army's large-caliber gun units, which had held firing positions  in Mago-ri of Yonchon County, Yongsan-ri of Paju County, and  Yulli-ri of Chorwon County of South Korea's Kangwon Province,  fired some 70 shells into the areas adjacent to the DMZ, thereby  showing off a war frenzy.    On the same day, some 10 (?500)-MD armed helicopters, which  had been mobilized in the air over Paju, Yonchon, and Chorwon of  South Korea's Kangwon Province, instigated a war atmosphere by  frantically waging an exercise of missile strikes and support  for ground attacks.    The reckless war maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the  South Korean puppets, which are becoming graver day after day,  prove that the rascals are running along the path to  confrontation and war, running counter the peace and easing of  tension in Korea.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IOWA SKIPPER FACES 'CRUEL BUSINESS OF ACCOUNTABILITY';  </P> <P> 'ADMIRAL'S MAST' PROCEEDINGS TO DETERMINE NAVY CAREERS OF CAPTAIN, EXECUTIVE  OFFICER  </P> <P> It is a tradition as old as sailing ships and as uncompromising as the sea  itself: Skippers are held accountable for what happens on their watch. And,  whether they are sleeping in their staterooms or issuing orders on the bridge,  everything that happens while they are at sea happens on their watch.  </P> <P> The U.S. Navy, its traditions tempered by 20th-Century concepts of justice, has  devised gradations of punishment and provided the accused with legal counsel  and avenues of appeal. But, when an inquiry ends, in the words of a 1952  editorial often quoted by naval historians, then "comes the cruel business of  accountability."  </P> <P> This is what awaits Capt. Fred Moosally, the skipper of the battleship Iowa. In  the four-month inquiry after the disastrous April explosion of the Iowa's No. 2  gun turret, investigators found a welter of management, training and personnel  deficiencies in the operation of the Iowa's 16-inch guns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Blamed for Accident  </P> <P> Although investigators concluded that the deficiencies "did not cause the  accident or contribute to the loss of life," Moosally and the Iowa's executive  officer, Cmdr. John P. Morse, will be judged at an "admiral's mast."  </P> <P> The investigation determined that the blast in all likelihood was caused by the  "intentional intervention" of 24-year-old Gunner's Mate Clayton M. Hartwig, who  is believed to have placed a detonating device between two sacks of gunpowder  in the breech of the turret's center gun.  </P> <P> Citing Moosally's "otherwise outstanding performance," the Navy's top brass  concluded that neither he nor his executive officer should be subject to  court-martial or relieved of his command. But the mast proceedings could result  in letters of admonition, or, in a more severe move, letters of censure that  could dog both officers' careers into retirement.  </P> <P> "In all probability, Capt. Moosally's career is over," said Eugene R. Fidell, a  Navy-trained Washington attorney who regularly handles military justice cases.  But Fidell and several former Navy skippers said the proceedings will be  closely studied, as the Navy struggles to uphold the iron doctrine of  accountability while bringing it in line with the realities of modern life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Upholding Naval Tradition  </P> <P> "These investigations of the Navy's more administrative or management failures  offer a late 20th-Century paradigm for the Navy as a human institution, a form  of human activity," said Fidell. "What they tell us is that personal  responsibility is still expected. It's a lovely picture of the continuity and  the meaningfulness of naval tradition, even in the space age."  </P> <P> In a statement issued Thursday, Moosally acknowledged the burdens of his rank.  </P> <P> "I am responsible for everything that happens aboard my ship, and I have no  excuses for the problem areas that were found aboard Iowa during the  investigation," Moosally said.  </P> <P> The Navy investigation disclosed that the Iowa's center turret was an  administrative shambles. Among the "systemic deficiencies" cited, no formal  schedule of assignments was maintained, and sailors working in sensitive safety  positions were not certified to carry out their jobs. Amid the remains of the  47 victims of the turret blast, investigators found forbidden spark-producing  items, such as rings and cigarette lighters.  </P> <P> Moosally's superiors faulted the skipper and his executive officer for relying  too heavily on outside inspections and subordinates' reports on the operation  of the 16-inch guns.  </P> <P> "While delegation is expected and encouraged, proper execution of doctrine and  directives is the responsibility of the commanding officer," wrote Adm. P. F.  Carter Jr., commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command. "Accountability is  the core value in the measurement of performance."  </P> <P> It is a tradition that has no parallel elsewhere in American society. Cabinet  secretaries and business executives rarely resign in disgrace and are seldom  fired over the mistakes of distant subordinates. But, for Navy skippers, who  have unparalleled authority on the open seas, it comes with the territory that  a promising career can be ruined in an instant by the missteps of a young and  inexperienced crew.  </P> <P> "In our business," said one senior Navy officer, "the commanding officer is  always responsible."  </P> <P> Capt. Glenn R. Brindel, skipper of the Navy frigate Stark, was drummed out of  the Navy after an Iraqi Exocet missile slammed into the ship's side in May,  1987, killing 37 sailors. Brindel was blamed for the ship's failure to defend  itself against the incoming missile, and it was no excuse that he was in his  cabin at the time the missile hit.  </P> <P> Neither does death exonerate the skipper. The captain of the U.S. minesweeper  Hobson, Lt. Cmdr. William J. Tierney, was held accountable by a Navy board of  inquiry when his ship turned sharply into the path of an aircraft carrier  during night maneuvers in 1952, even though Tierney was one of the 176 sailors  who drowned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Must Answer' for Deeds  </P> <P> "The captain of a ship, like the captain of a state, is given honor and  privileges and trust beyond any other men. But let him set the wrong course,  let him touch ground, let him bring disaster to his ship or to his men, and he  must answer for what he has done," the Wall Street Journal said in a subsequent  editorial.  </P> <P> At least Tierney was awake. In 1969, preparing for a dawn exercise, Cmdr.  Albert S. McLemore of the destroyer Frank E. Evans went to bed and turned  command over to a junior officer.  </P> <P> While McLemore slept, the Evans collided with an Australian aircraft carrier  during night maneuvers, killing 53 of its crew. McLemore was nevertheless held  accountable and was punished with a general court-martial, a letter of  reprimand and the withdrawal of points needed for promotion.  </P> <P> But while the Navy's tradition of accountability appears to have withstood the  tides of ages, it has not been isolated from political currents. Many believe  that, in recent years, especially, political factors and the changing nature of  warfare have threatened to erode the old order.  </P> <P> As political leaders increasingly call on the Navy and Marines to conduct  operations in the twilight between war and peace, some experts believe that the  iron doctrine of a skipper's accountability inevitably will lose its bite and  its meaning.  </P> <P> After then-President Ronald Reagan pronounced himself accountable for the 1983  truck-bomb explosion at the U.S. Marine compound in Lebanon in which 241 U.S.  Marines and sailors died, many Navy traditionalists grumbled that no commander  had been made to walk the plank for military deficiencies in the operation.  </P> <P> Last year, in what many considered to be a notable exception to the rule of  accountability, a Navy board of inquiry stopped short of recommending  disciplinary action against Capt. Will C. Rogers III, the skipper of the Navy  cruiser Vincennes. Rogers' ship shot down a civilian Iran Air jetliner on July  3, killing all 290 people on board.  </P> <P> Instead, the board called for a letter of reprimand for the ship's operations  officer, who relayed inaccurate information that led Rogers to conclude that  the approaching aircraft was an F-14 fighter, not an A-300 Airbus.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Actions Called Justifiable  </P> <P> Immediately after the downing of the Iranian airliner, Reagan and Adm. William  J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pronounced the captain's  actions justifiable. Then-Vice President George Bush traveled to the United  Nations to defend the action. Navy officers widely believe that those early  statements put substantial pressure on investigators to prove Reagan and Crowe  right.  </P> <P> In the wake of the Iowa explosion, Navy officials were quick to defend the  recommissioned World War II-vintage battleships as safe, modern warships -- a  factor that many believe may have led investigators to discount safety-related  explanations in lieu of the theory that Hartwig intentionally caused the  mid-Atlantic blast.  </P> <P> But the Iowa investigation carried none of the international political  implications of the Vincennes incident or the bombing of the Marine barracks in  Beirut.  </P> <P> As a result, experts maintained that the Navy was able to reimpose its values  and reassert the hoary captain's law.  </P></p>

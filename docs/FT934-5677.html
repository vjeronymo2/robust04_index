			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Arts: Bartoli triumphs again - Concert All around the world there must be music-lovers discovering a fondness for 'arie antiche' that they never knew they had. The simple, catchy, innocuous little tunes of Scarlatti and Caccini, Cesti and Caldara could be on countless pairs of lips as Cecilia Bartoli's popularity grows ever wider. Anybody who frequents vocal recitals knows these songs. They are the ones that come at the beginning of the programme, before the singer has warmed up, and then get forgotten. At least they used to be. Bartoli, in her desire to sing Italian songs which are right for her voice and her sense of style, has adopted them as ideal material, lavishing upon them all her very considerable art. Suddenly they seem trifles no longer. Almost all the first half of her Wigmore Hall recital on Friday, accompanied by Gyorgy Fischer, was devoted to 'arie antiche'. There is a secret to singing these miniatures. If they are to be treated as the Italian equivalent of art-songs, then every subtle inflexion and change of colour must sound as if it was only thought about the moment before. Bartoli, with youth on her side (she is still in her 20s), makes them as fresh as if the ink was still wet on the page. The expressive colours in this mezzo voice are ravishing. Most of the time we hear it in comedy, but an aria from Vivaldi's Bajazet showed it can be turned no less winningly to pathos. At the end somebody near the front called for this item to be repeated as an encore and it was just as moving the second time round. Some delightful songs by Mozart and Bellini in the second half were sung with the same degree of imagination, though by this point one might have been feeling the need for something stronger. That was supplied with the aria Qui la Voce from Bellini's I puritani - usually for soprano, but performed here as adapted by the composer for the mezzo Maria Malibran. To bel canto, as to everything else, Bartoli brings her own personality, singing off the words in the aria, shaping the cabaletta for limpid beauty, when she of all singers might have chosen to dazzle us with her speed and agility. A move by Cecilia Bartoli into the operas of Bellini and Donizetti would be a fascinating prospect.</p>

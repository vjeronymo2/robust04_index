			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Social Movement Secretary Gianfranco </F> Fini by Stefano Brusadelli; place and date not given: "The  Flame Is Back"]    [Text] "Of course. If it were up to me, I would have  Zhirinovskiy come to Italy, just like 'Arafat came when -- if I  remember correctly -- he was a wanted man. Of course, I would  not go to meet him, because in my opinion he is not a man of the  right." In his study on the via della Scrofa, bursting with  Italian flags like the office of a head of state, Italian Social  Movement [MSI] Secretary Gianfranco Fini smiles, pleased. It is  almost as if he wants to gauge the effect of his answer. He  began with that and continued -- evoking the shadow of Russia's  fascist leader, who has just been expelled from Bulgaria and  rejected by Germany -- by painting the unseen portrait of the  Great Right which he dreams of presenting at the next elections.  A surprising picture, with some paradoxical features: It is  virtually a complex of civil liberties advocacy, solidarism, and  Third Worldism.    [Brusadelli] Why is the leader of the Italian right  disowning  the leader of the Russian right?    [Fini] I repeat: Zhirinovskiy is not of the right. He is not  a nationalist like me; he is an imperialist. He has latched  onto a feeling that has been present in the Russian people since  Czarist times, a feeling which communism heightened.    [Brusadelli] Yet it is proving difficult to place  Zhirinovskiy anywhere outside the right.    [Fini] He is a product of the decline of the former USSR. He  is a complex of a number of typical Russian impulses, such as  the desire for a strongman and anti-Semitism, all of which is  supported by a powerful military caste.    [Brusadelli] So which European right-wing movements do you  like?    [Fini] That is not easy to answer. There is no international  organization for the Right because there is no ideology of the  Right. In my opinion, the Right is the concrete response to  everyday problems. However, those of us in Strasbourg are in a  mixed group.    [Brusadelli] A situation of isolation....    [Fini] We are working to introduce the MSI to other European  political forces. I would exclude out of hand any link with  neo-Nazis. With them there is the insurmountable discrimination  of racism, whereas we are rooted in solidarity.    [Brusadelli] Try to describe an MSI proposal for an  international policy.    [Fini] The agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis  marks a major opportunity for Italy, as well as a major problem.  Germany is concentrating on investments in the east. At this  juncture, Italy should contrast the German choice and encourage  Europe to concentrate on the Middle East market. For us this  would present a twofold advantage: It would slow down  immigration from that area and would have faster economic  returns via oil. Moreover, southern Italy could really take off.    [Brusadelli] Great, but we will have to see what [League  leader] Umberto Bossi thinks of this....    [Fini] That is true. He is thinking of an Italy coupled to  the German locomotive, while I am thinking of an Italy steeped  in the Mediterranean.    [Brusadelli] So there will be no agreement with Bossi?    [Fini] We agree on tax protest, crime, and bribe city. But  we have nothing in common on European policy, the national  identity, and the issue of solidarism.    [Brusadelli] What do you mean by solidarism?    [Fini] We are aware of the duty of solidarity, not only  between individuals, but also between rich and poor regions.    [Brusadelli] And when you want to drive out non-European  Community citizens, where is the solidarism then?    [Fini] I have just presented a proposal aimed at improving  their conditions -- but in their own countries, not here in  Italy where nobody can ensure them a decent quality of life.    [Brusadelli] Tell me what you would have to hear from Bossi  in order to reach an agreement.    [Fini] That Italy is one and indivisible and that the  Italian  people is a single people -- without [League ideologue] Miglio  and Rocchetta saying the opposite thing the next day.    [Brusadelli] Will you see Bossi in the next few days?    [Fini] He is currently talking to [Judge] Di Pietro --  something that will certainly not happen to me.    [Brusadelli] Do you, like your mayors, feel that [Fininvest  President] Berlusconi is the ideal ally?    [Fini] He has the merit of not using smoke screens in  politics.    [Brusadelli] Would you like to see him in the Palazzo Chigi  [government seat]?    [Fini] I do not think he wants to go there, and besides it  would not be a solution. During a period of reconstruction, it  is politics which should lead the economy, not vice-versa.    [Brusadelli] Would it be better to have [Pact for Italy  leader] Mario Segni at the Palazzo Chigi?    [Fini] He is the leader of those who are pushing for reform.  Today he is the anti-PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]  candidate. At the local elections he supported the PDS  candidates.    [Brusadelli] So, at the end of the day, the moderate front  risks remaining without a candidate to lead the government.    [Fini] I think that at the end of the day neither of the two  fronts will manage to agree on a candidate.    [Brusadelli] It also seems that the MSI has been somewhat  sidelined....    [Fini] I am not someone who longs to enter good society.  However, I will not be accused of being the person who sabotaged  an agreement. I am certain about one thing: Without us, the  anti-PDS pole will lose.    [Brusadelli] Will the anti-[Christian Democratic Party  Secretary] Martinazzoli secessionists end up in the National  Alliance?    [Fini] We will not say no to a dialogue with them. However,  let us be clear: There is no room in our house for people under  investigation.    [Brusadelli] What will the National Alliance's symbol be?    [Fini] We are working on it. We are certain that the [MSI  symbol] flame will be part of it. The MSI will be the most  conspicuous component of the Alliance. I will give you an  example: In Rome, out of 24 candidates, about 15 will be from  the MSI.</p>

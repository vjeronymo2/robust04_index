			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by reporter Gan Cheng (3927 2110): "The Fate of </F> the Last Three-Tier Government of Hong Kong"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 28 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The first  part of Chris Patten's constitutional reform package was adopted  by the Hong Kong Legislative Council on 24 February.  Immediately after this, London and the Hong Kong Government  simultaneously made public an abstract of the contents of the 17  rounds of Sino-British talks and the remainder of Chris Patten's  constitutional reform package was published in the government  gazette. The package will be submitted to the Legislative  Council for examination and discussion on 9 March.    The opportunity for resuming the Sino-British talks on  constitutional reform has now been completely destroyed. It  will be difficult to find a mechanism for the convergence of the  Hong Kong constitution around 1997; the arrangements for a  through train have thoroughly vanished; and the opportunity for  Sino-British cooperation on Hong Kong's constitutional  development is equivalent to zero.    This is something that the Chinese side is extremely  unwilling to see. The Chinese side has repeatedly said: As far  as the Chinese side is concerned, the door to talks is wide  open, but the prerequisite is that the British side must  withdraw the partial constitutional reform package that has  already been submitted to the Legislative Council. The British  side, however, is bent on confronting the Chinese side to the  very end and on deviating farther and farther away from the road  of cooperation.    Although Chris Pattern is still putting on a show and has  said that the possibility of reopening dialogue with the Chinese  side on the constitutional issue of Hong Kong has not been ruled  out, he has started to tear down one of the supports of the  mansion that will soon be returned to its owner, while at the  same time saying that he is willing to cooperate with the owner  to construct a taller building. By acting this way, he himself  may be the only one cheated in the end. The Chinese side and  the people of Hong Kong have ears as well as eyes. Their eyes  will not miss any of Chris Patten's damaging moves.    According to Chris Patten's way of doing business, he will  exert himself to the utmost to promote -- in accordance with his  constitutional reform package -- the election of the three-tier  councils in 1994 and 1995 in a bid to extend Britain's colonial  influence beyond 1997. Although the voice of opposition within  the Legislative Council is not low, it will not be too difficult  for Christ Patten to affix the seal with his hand.    However, the Chinese side has repeatedly reiterated that,  without an agreement between China and Britain, any  constitutional reform package adopted by the Legislative Council  of Hong Kong will not be accepted. The Chinese side will  certainly dissolve and reorganize Hong Kong's three-tier  councils on 1 July 1997. This means that the three-tier  councils to be elected in 1994 and 1995, the birth of which  Chris Patten is unilaterally expediting, are bound to be  short-lived. The Legislative Council to be elected in 1995 can  only last 20 months.    Britain must return Hong Kong to China in 1997, and by that  time China will certainly have restored its sovereignty over  Hong Kong. This is a fact which no one can change. The  three-tier councils of Hong Kong to be elected in 1994 and 1995  without an agreement between China and Britain are only one part  of the British Hong Kong constitutional structure, and their  terms of office are provided for by the British Royal  Instructions and the relevant regulations. Following the end of  the British rule over Hong Kong on 30 June 1997, the Royal  Instructions and all other relevant laws, being in conflict with  the Basic Law, will certainly become invalid, and all the  three-tier councils of the Hong Kong Government will be  dissolved at that time. The Chinese Government will reorganize  the constitutional structure on 1 July 1997 in accordance with  the Basic Law and the decision of the National People's  Congress. This is very natural.    Although Chris Patten has clung to his course, he and the  British Government have absolutely no chance of changing the  fate of the last three-tier councils of the Hong Kong  Government. Percy Cradock, former foreign affairs adviser to  the British prime minister, pointed out that, because the talks  broke down, the British Government will have no say about the  blueprint for Hong Kong's future development.    Recalling the experience of the previous Sino-British talks  on Hong Kong's future, Percy Cradock pointed out that the  British side was in fact in an inferior position, while the  Chinese side was in an overwhelmingly dominant position.  Therefore, one of the ways to work together with China is to  avoid confronting the tough with toughness and to hold talks and  discussions.    In commenting on the results that were achieved in the  Sino-British talks on Kong Kong at that time, CPC elder Deng  Xiaoping once pointed out, "What is the reason behind the  success of the talks on Hong Kong? It was not due to the  special skills of the participants from our side, but was  primarily because our country has developed over the past few  years and has become a prosperous and flourishing country, a  country with strength, and a trustworthy country. We pay  attention to trustworthiness, and we keep our word."    Chris Patten is doomed to failure because he is ignorant  about China today. His understanding of China and even Britain  seems to be identical to that of some people in 1840.</p>

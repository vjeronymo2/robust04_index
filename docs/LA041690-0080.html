			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'DAVID BROWER,' 'PROFIT' FOLLOW EARTH DAY THEME  </P> <P> Stewardship of the planet Earth can take many forms. Hewing to this week's  Earth Day theme, PBS devotes two documentaries tonight to close-up looks at  environmentalists in action, but the portraits could hardly be more different  in tone.  </P> <P> "For Earth's Sake: The Life and Times of David Brower" (9 p.m. on Channels 28  and 15, 10 p.m. Channel 24) sketches the career of a traditional  environmentalist who has been compared to Thoreau and John Muir in the scope of  his dedication to saving nature from the ravages of industrial development.  </P> <P> "Profit the Earth" (8 p.m. on Channels 15 and 50, 9 p.m. on Channel 24, 10 p.m.  on Channel 28) introduces a new group of activists who break through the old  stereotypes of "bad-guy" industrial polluters -- insisting that we can't afford  to clean up the Earth -- versus "good-guy" environmentalists retorting that we  can't afford not to.  </P> <P> The new activists have abandoned the confrontational tools of protest and  lawsuits to work within the economy, seeking creative ways to reshape the free  enterprise system so that everybody wins. "The new environmentalists,"  proclaims the narrator, "are giving the word 'profit' a new meaning."  </P> <P> In juxtaposition, the two shows present an effective snippet of contemporary  history at what seems to be a pivotal moment of change.  </P> <P> David Brower, now 77, who has headed both the Sierra Club and Friends of the  Earth, is the quintessential model of an Industrial Age environmentalist,  waging battles to save lakes from being dammed and redwoods from being  destroyed. John de Graaf's documentary captures both the personal passion of  the man ("the environment was all he wanted to talk about at the dinner table,"  says his son) and the grandeur of the wilderness Brower has spent his life  protecting.  </P> <P> In contrast, "Profit the Earth" focuses on men and women who are replacing the  traditional "battle" language and tactics with problem solving. They are  environmental entrepreneurs, a diverse and fascinating lot whose common trait  is the ability to view old problems with new perspectives.  </P> <P> Two of the new environmentalists are economists with the Environmental Defense  Fund. In California, Zach Willey is completing a complex plan for thirsty Los  Angeles to buy surplus water from farmers instead of diverting it from Mono  Lake. In Washington, Dan Dudek is lobbying for an emission-trading provision in  the Clean Air Act that would "make industry a partner, not a foe," in cutting  acid rain emission by allowing industries that fall below the government-set  pollution limit to sell its leftover allotment for a profit to another  industry.  </P> <P> Some businesses are small scale: Gene Anderson of Seattle who runs a reusable  cloth diaper service, but realizes that disposable diapers are a major  contribution to the nation's landfill problem, is recycling disposable diapers,  sanitizing the plastic and marketing it for new products.  </P> <P> Others are large: At Minnesota's 3M Company, which manufactures 60,000 products  and accounts for 2% of the nation's industrial pollution, a stringent program  for redesigning products and recycling has cut 450,000 tons of pollution and  saved a half a billion dollars in 15 years. "Profit the Earth," produced by the  Nebraska ETV Network, does not pretend that the new environmentalists have a  handle on solving the planetary crisis. But it does focus on an emerging energy  and optimism.  </P> <P> "I don't think we have tapped a millioneth of our potential as a society," says  Dan Dudek. That's not a bad message for Earth Day.CONNIE KOENENN  </P></p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow follows bonds lower after Thursday's rally Wall Street A BRIEF SPURT in equities faded quickly yesterday morning as stock prices reeled under the influence of a plunging bond market, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 50.98 to 2,920.17 on moderately heavy volume of 175m shares, after climbing 40.25 to 2,971.15 on Thursday in a rally which was propelled by computer-driven program trading. Declining issues led those advancing by 1,123 to 462. The broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 7.51 at 375.74. The weight of new supply in the Treasury market, accumulated during the refunding week, depressed bond prices and the Treasury's 30-year bond tumbled 1 9/32 in late trading to 97 27/32 , yielding 8.32 per cent. There was little reaction to April's producer price index, which rose by 0.2 per cent, even after stripping out food and energy. Westinghouse was one of the most active issues, following a 19m share offering of the stock priced at Dollars 26 1/2 on Thursday. The stock slid 1/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 yesterday. An initial public offering of 6m shares in Haemonetics, a manufacturer of blood processing systems, prompted heavy trading in the stock, which was quoted at Dollars 23 3/4 . Fairchild jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 9 3/8 in heavy trading on reports that a bid for the aerospace products company was imminent. In April, Fairchild turned down an unsolicited bid of Dollars 14 a share from the UK's Mountleigh Group. American Express dropped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 24 amid concern about the impact of the company's First Capital Holdings life insurance unit on group earnings. American Express said it would take a second quarter pretax charge to earnings of about Dollars 144m related to its investment in First Capital after California insurance department yesterday issued a cease and desist order limiting First Capital's activities. American Express has reduced its stake in First Capital to 28 per cent from 44 per cent. Duracell, the battery manufacturer whose shares were floated at Dollars 15 on May 8, eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 21 in active trading after the company reduced its first-quarter net loss. The secondary market was unable to withstand the sell-off and in late trading the Nasdaq composite was off 4.39 at 493.42 after advancing more than 1 point in the morning. Cisco Systems dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 3/4 in unusually active trading after the company turned in third-quarter net income of 37 cents a share against 13 cents a year ago on higher sales. Apple Computer rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 51 1/2 in anticipation of a new version of its operating system software for its Macintosh computers which is expected to be unveiled on Monday. Repligen slid Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 12 1/8 in heavy volume. An issue of 2m shares was priced at Dollars 12 1/2 on Thursday. Canada TORONTO stocks followed a steep slide in the Dow and US bonds. The composite index ended off 14.73 points at 3,489.79. Declines led advances 257 to 253 on volume of 23.3m shares. Canadian companies listed on Wall Street were among the heaviest hit. Seagram fell CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 112 7/8 , Northern Telecom lost CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 42, Canadian Pacific eased CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 20.</p>

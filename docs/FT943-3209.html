			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Simply take one celebrity. . . - Neil Buckley examines Sainsbury's recipe for a successful TV campaign The formula is simple, yet seductive. A celebrity voice you recognise, but cannot always place, describes a simple recipe, over pictures of beautifully chopped ingredients sizzling in a pan. Once taste buds and curiosity have been tantalised, the camera pulls back to reveal the celebrity. Former UK chancellor Denis Healey's recipe for scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, and opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa's farfalle pasta with Parma ham have all featured in what J Sainsbury, the UK's biggest food retailer, says is its most successful series of advertisements. Some 55m cards detailing the recipes have been picked up by customers in Sainsbury's stores. Moreover, the ads have often created markets for new products. In May 1992, Sainsbury sold 30,000 cartons of creme fraiche; the following month, after ads showed actress Catherine Zeta-Jones using the product to make fresh fruit brulee, it sold 1m cartons. The ads have also increased sales of more familiar products. The latest  - former tennis star Sue Barker's turkey and apricot bake, launched last week  -resulted in sales of 74 tonnes of turkey strips, 22 times the normal weekly sale. Last year, Sainsbury bought all available supplies of Italian pesto sauce to meet demand following actress Zoe Wanamaker's recipe for tagliatelle with bacon and pesto. Anthony Rees, Sainsbury's marketing director, says increased product sales were originally a by-product of the adverts, launched in May 1991 as a 'strategic' campaign to enhance Sainsbury's name and reputation. Trial campaigns explicitly emphasising Sainsbury's perceived strengths of quality and reliability, heritage and tradition, had produced negative reactions among viewers. When David Abbott, chairman of Sainsbury's ad agency Abbott Mead Vickers, thought up the recipe theme and persuaded a friend, television presenter Selina Scott, to front the first one, Sainsbury liked the ad but did not think it met the brief. Customer research proved otherwise. 'We discovered the way to convince people was not to tell them anything,' says Rees. 'People could pull out of the ad what they wanted to.' Even more significantly, the ads fulfilled a 'strategic' and 'tactical' role, enhancing Sainsbury's name while persuading shoppers to buy products by the trolleyload. Rees says they have more than justified the estimated Pounds 30m spent on the 17-ad series. Sainsbury has moved away from advertising in women's magazines for new product launches, tying these instead to an appropriate TV recipe advert. That is one reason why recipes are not, whatever viewers may think, celebrities' own. They are devised by Sainsbury's recipe department, with help from cookery writer Delia Smith. Dishes must be 'aspirational' (mozzarella pasta penne is fine; spaghetti bolognese is not); 'achievable', even for novice cooks; and 'affordable' - less than Pounds 2.50 per person. They must look appetising at every stage of preparation. Plans for a Tiramisu recipe evolved into mascarpone and lime torte because Tiramisu looked a soggy mess in the early stages. That attention to detail and the finely judged camerawork are reasons for the ads' success, says Winston Fletcher, chairman of the Advertising Association. 'Recipe adverts are a bit of a cliche,' he says. 'What Sainsbury has done, through the style, the esoteric ingredients, the tone of voice, is to update the formula.' The food, says Rees, is always the real star of the commercial. The celebrity adds intrigue and promotes trust among viewers. Rees adds there is little sign so far, of customers growing bored and several more ads are planned.</p>

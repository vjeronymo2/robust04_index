			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Parliament Debates the Economy: Policy under fire from former chancellors FOUR FORMER chancellors of the exchequer united in the Lords yesterday to criticise the government's alleged lack of leadership in handling the recent sterling crisis. Two - Lord Howe and Lord Jenkins - called for the swift return of the pound to the European exchange rate mechanism. There were repeated cautions against the dangers of allowing speculative capital to flow unrestricted on foreign exchange markets and repeated calls for Mr Norman Lamont to resign as chancellor. In surprisingly friendly early proceedings, there were also stern warnings that the euphoria which greeted the return of floating exchange rates in certain quarters would prove seriously misplaced. In the hardest-hitting speech of the day, Lord Healey, the former Labour chancellor, said it would be 'far better' if Mr Lamont left office since his credibility had been 'destroyed'. He also castigated leading Conservative figures for their 'unfair' attacks on Germany. It was depressing that the government had chosen last week to incite 'the worst form of xenophobia'. Arguing that a single currency would not be possible without 'a degree of convergence guaranteed by a single political authority' he warned that Britain would be 'unable' to return to the ERM if the government did not make significant changes in its economic policies. In perhaps the staunchest defence of the ERM from a former chancellor, Lord Howe - the Tory who played a crucial role in Britain's joining the mechanism  -called for sterling to re-enter it 'as soon as prudently possible.' Last week's events - though a serious setback - did not even 'seriously diminish the case for a European Monetary System,' he said. A floating pound meant Britain would be 'more not less exposed'. Lord Callaghan, the former Labour premier who resigned as chancellor over devaluation in 1969, added his voice to calls for sterling's prompt restoration to the ERM, saying devaluation was not 'an easy way out'. Condemning the recent speculation by 'barrow boys' whom he described as 'front men' for respected banks, he advocated an excess profits tax of 'about 100 per cent' for such currency deals. Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the former Labour chancellor and Social Democratic party leading light, warned that the turmoil on foreign exchange markets might bring forward the date upon which the 'core' ERM participants moved to a single currency. If it did, Britain should not endeavour to 'obstruct' the move. Lord Cockfield, a former European commissioner, argued that the importance of Maastricht had been overstated because all the key policies enshrined in the treaty were already part of EC law or policy. Failure to ratify the treaty would not stop the single currency from going ahead, he said. Its purpose was to 'dot i's and cross t's' Hitting out at speculation by 'frenetic young men' in the foreign exchange markets, he warned that the pound would become 'par excellence the speculators' counter' if a single currency materialised from which sterling was excluded. For Labour, Lord Cledwyn, blamed Britain's predicament on the 'lack of coherent political leadership' and the government's apparent blindness to 'gathering clouds'. The blame for 'one of the most costly misjudgments of the century' rested 'on the cabinet table at Number 10 Downing Street,' he said. The prime minister and the chancellor had 'dithered in a crisis' with leadership 'conspicuous for its absence.' Opening the debate for the government, Lord Wakeham said he did not think sterling could readily return to the ERM without dealing with the problems that had been 'thrown up.' In the mean time, monetary policy would be guided by 'a range of indicators'.</p>

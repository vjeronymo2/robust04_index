			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Observer: No joking Lord Hanson needs to get a new joke book. Despite the notable absence of his old chum Lord White, who is stuck in bed with bronchitis, Hanson's polished annual meeting was only marred by the staleness of some of the peer's jokes. Take the one about his visit to an old people's home in his native Huddersfield. The noble Lord was chatting to a 'delightful' lady resident and asked her if she knew who he was. 'No,' she responded, 'but if you ask that young lady at the desk she'll tell you.' Surely, Lord White could have phoned across a few better jokes from his Los Angeles hideaway.</p>

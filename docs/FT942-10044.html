			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: London Clubs for USM with expected price tag of Pounds 150m London Clubs International, owner of the Ritz Club and five other London casinos, is seeking a quotation on the USM. The group is expected to be valued at up to Pounds 150m. It will be making a Pounds 30m placing, of which Pounds 25m will be placed firm with institutions. The balance will be subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. Mr Alan Goodenough, chief executive, said yesterday the group would seek a full listing next year. It was going through the USM because the management had only two years' experience of the company, and Stock Exchange rules require three years. The change of management followed a police raid in 1991 under the Gaming Act, just days before the group's planned flotation. The Gaming Board issued new licences in autumn 1992. The flotation later this month is expected to raise Pounds 27.5m of new money, which will be used to pay down debt incurred under the 1989 management buy-out from Grand Metropolitan. The pathfinder prospectus shows that in the 51 weeks to March 27 the group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 14m, compared with Pounds 9.1m in the 53 weeks to April 6 last year. Pro forma pre-tax profits for the latest period are shown as Pounds 23.1m. Turnover was Pounds 146.4m (Pounds 143.7m). The six London casinos accounted for Pounds 123m of the turnover. The group, which also owns casinos in Europe, Egypt and operates on cruise ships, wants to use its management skills to expand overseas. Principal shareholders include Ellerman Investments, Legal and General and Standard Chartered. The management have about 8 per cent of the equity, which will fall to about 3 per cent after the flotation. Sponsor to the placing is Samuel Montagu and James Capel is broker.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG GAME SPLITS A TEXAS TOWN;  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL: PERENNIAL STATE POWER ODESSA PERMIAN HIGH HAS BEEN PENALIZED  AFTER A RIVAL, ODESSA HIGH, TURNED IT IN FOR PRACTICING OUT OF SEASON. THEY  PLAY TONIGHT.  </P> <P> If there was any doubt how important high school football is in Texas, listen  up.  </P> <P> The price of crude oil reached $40 a barrel this week, which should make the  West Texas town of Odessa delirious. That's the kind of news that could snap an  oil town's depression, which is just about what Odessa has been in for the  better part of a decade.  </P> <P> But that's not the important news in town. No sir, not when the town's two high  schools, Odessa High and state champion Permian, meet tonight in their annual  game. Not when Permian has been portrayed in a new book as a football program  seeped in a win-at-all-costs mentality that overrides education. And especially  not when Permian has been banned from this year's playoffs because Odessa's  coach told state authorities about Permian's illegal summer practices.  </P> <P> Odessa is in the midst of a furor that is tearing the community asunder, the  local paper contends.  </P> <P> Odessa High Coach Jerry Taylor is being reviled as a traitor, and school  officials are begging students to stay calm. It's anyone's guess what will  happen tonight at the sold-out game, but authorities are taking no chances.  Police are expected in force.  </P> <P> H.G. Bissinger, the author of the book on Permian, "Friday Night Lights," had  planned a book signing in Odessa on game day, but canceled after he was  threatened by Permian boosters. Locals say Bissinger made a good call.  </P> <P> "There are some real fanatics out there who don't appreciate their football  season being messed up like this," said Kathy Wilson, an Odessa native. "People  out here take their football seriously."  </P> <P> Permian plays in a $6-million football stadium equipped with Astroturf and  19,500 seats. Coveted season tickets are willed from one generation to the  next. Junior high teams run Permian plays so often that they're second nature  by the time the kids reach high school. All of which may be the reason Odessa  High is known for its vocational training programs, and affluent Permian High  holds five 5-A state football championship trophies.  </P> <P> Odessa High hasn't beaten Permian in the annual intra-city game in 25 years.  </P> <P> "Permian is a machine," said Taylor, who says he got tired of what he calls a  "flaunting of the rules" by the Permian coaches.  </P> <P> In August, after witnessing what he said were numerous rules violations by  Permian, Taylor complained to the state scholastic authorities. After hearings  last week, two Permian coaches were suspended for two games and the school was  barred from the playoffs.  </P> <P> "We contend we did not violate any . . . rules, and if we did it was a complete  misunderstanding of how the rules should be interpreted," said a still-fuming  Permian Coach Tam Hollingshead. Hollingshead maintains that the summer  practices were voluntary, and that the coaches were only present to protect the  athletic equipment.  </P> <P> School district Athletic Director John Wilkins, who oversees the football  programs at both schools, likened the penalty to "giving life imprisonment for  stealing a pack of gum at the 7-Eleven."  </P> <P> Gerald Treece, a 1963 Permian graduate and assistant dean of the South Texas  Law School in Houston, is attempting to overturn the ruling on grounds that  Permian was denied due process during the hearings.  </P> <P> Others have already taken the matter into their own hands. Cars parked at  Odessa High have been plastered with Permian High School State Champion bumper  stickers. Across town, Permian students found their cars shoe polished with  obscenities demeaning "Mojo," a school nickname for the Permian football  program.  </P> <P> "I think it stinks," said Odessa-native Wilson, an Odessa High graduate whose  son attends Permian. "The boys shouldn't be punished for something adults might  have done."  </P> <P> Alberto Byington, a member of the committee that imposed the penalties, said,  "We need to send a message to all coaches in the state that this type of  activity will not be tolerated."  </P> <P> Taylor says he has received nasty phone calls and notes, even car bomb threats.  </P> <P> "Since I was the messenger, people blame me for splitting the town, but my  personal opinion is this thing was self-inflicted by Permian," he said. "There  is a feeling on Permian's part that they're invincible, that the rules are for  other folks but not them. It was a severe punishment, but it had to be to get  their attention."  </P> <P> Permian and Odessa High both have 2-1 records.  </P> <P> "It's going to be a war," predicted 16-year-old Chad Sandell, a former Permian  player. "Anyone wearing Odessa High red is history, on the field or off."  </P></p>

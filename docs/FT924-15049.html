			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Raine falls sharply to Pounds 13.5m PRE-TAX profits of Raine Industries, which earlier this year acquired struggling housebuilder Walter Lawrence for Pounds 28.5m, fell by third to Pounds 13.49m during the 12 months to the end of the June. Despite the sharp fall Raine stood by its promise to pay a maintained final dividend made in March when it acquired Walter Lawrence and separately raised Pounds 33.5m from shareholders in a 2-for-7 rights issue. Mr Peter Parkin, chief executive, said that Lawrence had made a Pounds 500,000 loss in the three months to the end of June but was now back in the black and was expected to make a healthy contribution to profits in the current year. Shareholders will receive a 4p final dividend making a 6p (5.9p) total for the year, just covered by earnings of 6.1p (10.3p). Mr Parkin, who becomes executive chairman in November, said that an increase in group turnover from Pounds 352.1m to Pounds 363.6m was due entirely to the first-time contribution from Walter Lawrence. The acquisition was bedding down well. Raine's housing land bank, of 5,865 plots, now had an average purchase price of Pounds 11,400 - equivalent to 17 per cent of the average sales price of Pounds 68,200 of one of the group's homes. Mr Parkin said few other housebuilders would be able to boast such a low land cost to sales ratio. Even so, group profits from housebuilding fell from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 7.3m. He added that there was still no sign of any pick-up in the UK housing market despite the lowering of mortgage interest rates. Contracting profits fell from Pounds 6.68m to Pounds 4.48m but this was after a Pounds 1.7m loss from commercial property operations. Construction of social housing rose by 31 per cent to 670 units which helped restrict the fall in contracting profits. More disappointing were the results from the Plumb's interiors contracting business where profits fell from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 1.3m. The division would have made a Pounds 500,000 loss but for the contribution from Raine's 70 per cent owned German subsidiary. Group borrowings remain tightly under control with net debt of Pounds 40.8m  -excluding non-recourse, off- balance sheet debt of Pounds 11.8m - equivalent to gearing of just over 34 per cent. COMMENT Raine possesses some quality businesses even if the sector in which they operate is having a disastrous time. Low land costs, helped by the Walter Lawrence acquisition, leave the group well placed to take advantage of a recovery (if any) in the housing market. Disposals and savings arising from the acquisition could generate Pounds 10m to Pounds 15m of cash in the current year reducing gearing to about 25 per cent. Contracting is under pressure but still delivered margins of just over 3 per cent, excluding property losses. This is better than many other contractors can boast. Plumb is having a hard time of it but like housing should be one of the first to benefit from recovery. If things go wrong Raine can always sell the US housing business acquired along with Walter Lawrence. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.5m, giving same-again earnings and total dividend of 6p, would put the shares on a prospective pe of 14 and yield of 10.6 per cent. It is one of the very few buys in the sector. See People</p>

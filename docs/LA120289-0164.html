			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INDICATORS POINT TO SLOWDOWN IN OCTOBER  </P> <P> The government's chief economic forecasting gauge signaled a slowdown in  October, but other evidence suggested that lower interest rates will keep the  economy from toppling into a recession.  </P> <P> The 0.4% drop in the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators  announced Friday fits in with the consensus among analysts that the final  quarter of this year and the first three months of 1990 will see weak growth at  best.  </P> <P> "The indicators are telling us what they've been telling us for some time, and  that is that the economy is continuing to expand, but at a slow rate," said  economist David Berson of the Federal National Mortgage Assn.  </P> <P> However, he and other analysts said a number of factors mitigated the  unfavorable report. The decline followed two monthly gains; most of the  weakness was concentrated in only two of the index's 11 forward-looking  business statistics.  </P> <P> And elements of the index and a separate report on October construction  spending suggest that the Federal Reserve Board's cuts in interest rates since  June are beginning to stimulate the economy.  </P> <P> Construction activity rose 1% in October, bolstered by the first gain in  single-family construction in nine months, the Commerce Department said.  </P> <P> Four of the 11 indicators were positive. Building permits increased 2.8% and  the nation's money supply, reflecting lower interest rates, expanded modestly.  Other positive signs were a slight increase in prices of sensitive materials,  indicating increased demand, and an upturn in business capital investment.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the National Assn. of Purchasing Management, which tracks the  economy through a monthly survey of its members, said Friday that the  manufacturing economy weakened in November for the seventh straight month and  at a faster pace than in September and October.  </P> <P> October's overall drop in the leading indicators, which was expected by most  economists, followed gains of 0.3% in September and 0.6% in August. Both gains  were revised in the report to reflect a slightly better increase than earlier  reported.  </P> <P> For the first 10 months of 1989, the index has fallen five times, risen four  times and remained unchanged in one month.  </P> <P> The various changes left the index at 144.6% of its 1982 base of 100. That  represents a 0.4% decline at an annual rate for the year so far, compared to a  3.8% gain in the first 10 months of 1988.  </P></p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: British Telecom British Telecom had good reasons for giving way to the regulator Oftel. The pricing regime of inflation minus 7.5 per cent is tough, but with BT's scope for cost savings, not impossibly so. Given that, the risk of going to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission was simply too great. The market may now take heart from the stability this agreement will bring. In current conditions even reduced earnings prospects can seem attractive when combined with a strong balance sheet. There is also much to be said for leaving others to fight your battles. Privatised companies may feel that regulation is becoming too autocratic and interventionist, but they can rely on such issues being raised by the MMC's investigation of British Gas. The differing routes chosen by BT and British Gas highlight which can more easily cope with pricing restrictions.</p>

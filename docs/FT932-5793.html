			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Letter: Road tolls should release funds for investment in railways Sir, Both a return to private railway operation and the tolling of motorways make sense as component parts of a new transport strategy, but the transport policymakers seem badly confused about how to fit them together. Ministers tell us that the tolls are needed to provide extra resources for road building. Meanwhile the railway infrastructure continues to be denied the extra capital required for a real renaissance, with all the talk of finance for railway expansion (if any) coming from higher fares being charged by private operators. Such a prospect will make rail travel still more unattractive vis-a-vis roads, and it has already compelled the government to promise concessionary fare protection and tight fare regulation under pressure from understandably nervous backbenchers. This whole policy sequence needs to be put into reverse. Railway privatisation should be an opportunity to drive down sharply the cost of rail and freight travel. This means investing in new rail infrastructure on criteria comparable to those used for roads. This in turn would begin creating the business conditions for the new franchisees in which much higher and more competitive rail services could be delivered, and expanded on both new and disused lines. Then and only then will the pressure on roads start easing. The new money raised by motorway tolls should release funds for this benign and coherent purpose - not for accommodating still more refugee traffic from ever more expensive railways.

It was a "marvelous visit which our delegation greatly  appreciated," Savage said at a news conference. The Canadian  official was accompanied by a large group of businessmen from 17  firms from the important Canadian Atlantic region.    During the visit, which the prime minister termed as "very  successful," several trade agreements were reached and  enterprise projects with Canadian capital were drafted in the  areas of industry, agriculture, tourism, and services.    "From our viewpoint, and that of the delegation, the trip  was  very advantageous and it was really worthwhile," said the  Canadian politician, who won the post of Nova Scotian prime  minister for the Liberal Party last May.    Savage, a medical doctor who is the first Canadian  provincial  prime minister to visit Cuba in 17 years, described Fidel  Castro as a "hospitable, very vigorous" man and a politician  "with a vast knowledge and with a wide range of topics to  discuss.    "It was a fluid, light, and interesting conversation which  we  enjoyed greatly," the Nova Scotia prime minister added.    Meanwhile, Dr. Patricia Lane, president of Lane Environment  Ltd. consulting firm, told PRENSA LATINA about her satisfaction  with the meeting with Fidel Castro, during which she was  "greatly impressed," she said.    "I have known and met with many outstanding politicians and  I  have worked in many countries, but I have never met a world  leader with so much knowledge about the environment and  sustainable development," the businesswoman said.    Her company agreed to work in association with the Cubans in  the development of ecological tourism, a form of tourism that is  currently gaining popularity in the world, "to which Cuba has  much to contribute because of its wealth of natural resources."</p>

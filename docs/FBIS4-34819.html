			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 23 Jun (AFP) -- The Ecuadoran Court of  Constitutional Guarantees (TGC) unanimously declared on Thursday  the unconstitutionality of the controversial Agriculture  Development Law, which was approved on Monday of last week,  after which thousands of Indians began blocking roads and  highways.    TGC President Carlos Jaramillo said that on this occasion  the  Constitutional Court of the Supreme Court, the first appeals  court and the definitive court on constitutional matters "will  not have any pretext to challenge the TGC resolution, because  this court has six legally appointed members."    The leftist Democratic People's Movement (MPD) asked the TGC  to declare the controversial law unconstitutional. The  Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) did  the same on Tuesday.    The resolution is aimed at totally suspending the law, which  was hastily approved by right-wing deputies, as well as by  deputies from the ruling party, who control the Ecuadoran  parliament. The law was finally signed by the rightist head of  state, Sixto Duran Ballen, who is in his seventies.    The resolution was handed over to the MPD and Conaie, as  well  as to the president. The case documents were also turned over to  the Constitutional Court of the Supreme Court so that it may  issue its final ruling, which cannot be appealed.    The Indian protests left a total of at least five peasants  dead, and beginning early Wednesday morning the Army cleared the  Andean and Amazon highways of the barricades that had been  erected there, which had paralyzed the country's transportation  system for 11 days causing a shortage of food in the cities.</p>

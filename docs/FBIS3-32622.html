			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The government today decided to open the doors of  Juanchaco to show just what the U.S. soldiers are doing there.  Miriam Ortiz confirmed that military exercises are being  conducted and they are running two weeks behind schedule.    [Ortiz] Today, as the State Council is posing serious  questions about the president's having permitted the entry of  foreign troops without permission, the doors of Juanchaco opened  up and a new perspective appeared on the presence of U.S.  soldiers here. The minister of defense said these troops did  not come to the country to build a school and a health center.  He said they came to conduct military engineering exercises.    [Defense minister] Pardo also said that there has been  disinformation regarding this case.    [Begin recording] [Ortiz] Was the president of the Republic  also misinformed?    [Pardo] Why?    [Ortiz] Because he did not know that the presence of the  U.S.  soldiers here...    [Pardo, interrupting] No, no. What happens is that they have  tried to build up a case here. Things have been blown out of  proportion. The president appoints some officials. He appoints  a minister of defense or any other portfolio so that the  minister exercises the duties. [end recording]    [Ortiz] The minister also said he does not agree with the  opinion of the State Council, adding that if this judgement is  allowed to advance, it will pose a danger to international  cooperation. He explained that as part of this practice, 163  U.S. military engineers are building this health center with  four rooms and a school with four classrooms, all for $100,000.    [Begin recording] [Ortiz] What we are all wondering is why  has the work been delayed?    [Admiral Jose Ignacio Rozo] First, because of the winter.  Even though January is a summer month, it rained a great deal.  [end recording]    All climatic and topographic difficulties in which the  Americans wanted to carry out this type of engineering exercise  have been found in this part of the country. It rains every day  in Juanchaco. But paradoxically thanks to the rains the work is  running two weeks behind schedule.    [end recording] [U.S. Army Captain Clark] We've had some  problems with the weather.    [Ortiz] When will you leave?    [Capt. Clark] When the work has been completed. [end  recording]    [Ortiz] For their personal security, these soldiers are  carrying 132 MA-16 rifles and 10 9mm pistols. In addition, they  are being guarded by 60 Colombian soldiers.    During this visit, it was also learned that there is a  second  part of these exercises scheduled for 1995, which has been  postponed for the time being.</p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Five more pits expected to attract bids BIDS are likely for all five redundant British Coal pits covered by today's deadline for applications for mining licences from private-sector companies. The mines are among 19 pits no longer wanted by British Coal because demand for coal has declined. They form the second tranche to be offered for licence. Among the first group of four pits, there was only one bid to continue mining. That was made by RJB Mining for the mine at Easington, County Durham. Two other pits were the subject of offers for use of the land and facilities. The second tranche, comprising Rossington, Markham Main, Bevercotes, Clipstone and Betws, is considerably more attractive, and some of the five are likely to attract rival bids for mining. Although RJB Mining is not revealing how many pits it is going for, it has said in the past that it is interested in Bevercotes, Clipstone, Markham Main and Rossington. Mr Malcolm Edwards, British Coal's former commercial director, is likely to lead bids for Markham Main and Rossington. Betws in south Wales is attractive because of its high-quality anthracite coal and could attract several bidders. Ryan International is among the companies to have examined its potential. Some bidders face a snag - a law preventing private-sector operators from employing more than 150 miners underground. Several proposals are thought to involve the use of considerably more manpower. The government is being pressed to change the law before next July when privatisation legislation is expected to reach the statute book. Mining companies that opt to bid for the pit licences are being asked to pay a Pounds 50,000 bond. The other 10 pits are being advertised separately.</p>

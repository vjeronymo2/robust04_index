			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESCUED DOGS FACE AN UNCERTAIN FATE;  </P> <P> ANIMALS: A ROSEMEAD WOMAN LAVISHED CARE ON THE PETS BEFORE SHE DIED, BUT NOW  THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THEIR KEEP.  </P> <P> Josephine Forman never could say no to a mutt in distress.  </P> <P> The 64-year-old Rosemead woman took them in by the dozens, even though it  strained her modest Social Security income.  </P> <P> She boarded the dogs at a nearby kennel, where she received a discount for  grooming and feeding the dogs herself.  </P> <P> But Forman died in December, and 26 of the mixed-breed dogs she saved from the  streets are once again facing the pound.  </P> <P> Before she died, she specified that the dogs should go to Artis Rose of San  Diego, a longtime friend who shared her love of animals. Since Forman's death,  Rose has made the 220-mile round trip to the kennel several times a week to  groom and feed the dogs. She has paid half of this month's rent, but says she  doesn't have the money to pay the rest.  </P> <P> Joe Warren, owner of the Astro/All Star Kennel in Rosemead, who had been  charging Forman $500 a month instead of the regular $5 a day per dog, said he  will turn the dogs over to animal regulation authorities soon.  </P> <P> "What am I supposed to do with all these dogs?" Warren asked. "As long as she  was here to clean the dogs and pay the rent, I was happy. . . . These dogs have  to be cleaned . . . every day and I just can't do it by myself.  </P> <P> "I'm not a mean person," Warren continued. "All I want is money to take care of  these dogs or someone to take them away."  </P> <P> At Temple City Animal Control, the nearest such facility, young, healthy dogs  are kept for a week or so in the hope that someone will claim them, said  supervisor Bill Hart.  </P> <P> Older, sickly dogs are put to death immediately, he said. Forman's dogs average  between 7 and 8 years old, but one is 16, Rose said.  </P> <P> When Forman was alive, she received assistance from Animal Alliance, which has  offices in West Los Angeles and Woodland Hills, whenever she ran short of money  for dog food.  </P> <P> "There were many times when she would call us and she was hysterical because  she had no money or food for the dogs, and we tried to help her as much as we  could," said Leeta Anderson, founder of Animal Alliance, which is devoted to  rescuing animals in need. "She really cared about these dogs."  </P> <P> Rose has taken three of the dogs into her own home, and one of Forman's  neighbors agreed to take six others. Twenty-six of Forman's dogs remain at the  kennel.  </P> <P> "It is a horrible situation," Anderson said. "The man (Warren) has a business  to take care of. He can't just keep these dogs forever. On the other hand, we  have these creatures that need to be taken care of."  </P> <P> Anderson is contacting other animal rescue organizations to mobilize help for  the dogs. But she says the best solution would be for people to adopt the  animals and "let them live out the rest of their lives."  </P> <P> The people who knew Forman say the dogs were her entire life and it was her  last wish to see them taken care of.  </P> <P> "She really loved these dogs," Rose said. "She always had dogs, even when she  lived in an apartment."  </P></p>

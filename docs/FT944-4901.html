			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Virgin Islands closure to reduce alumina surplus Virgin Islands Alumina Corporation (Vialco) will shut its refinery in the West Indies for at least a year taking between 600,000 and 610,000 tonnes off the market. Analysts said the alumina (aluminium oxide) market would still remain significantly in surplus in 1995. 'But the closure might change sentiment a little and allow some producers to pass on in higher prices some of the cost increases they face,' said Mr Tim Armstrong, at the CRU International consultancy organisation. Glencore, the Switzerland-based international trading organisation that indirectly owns Vialco, blamed market conditions for the temporary closure, which takes affect by the end of this year. While not disclosing Vialco's production costs, Glencore admitted the plant was not breaking even at present alumina prices. The plant would be kept 'in operational readiness'. Mr Armstrong estimated that there would be a 600,000-tonnes alumina surplus next year, despite the Vialco closure. The alumina market is suffering because about 1m tonnes of western world aluminium capacity has been shut down in the past year following the international trade agreement between some of the major producing countries. A further 300,000 tonnes has been cut in Russia.</p>

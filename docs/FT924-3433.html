			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Letter: Balkan questions for the west to consider Sir, Why is it that western powers, particularly Britain, need the Organisation of Islamic Conference to make them realise what has been so painfully obvious for the last 18 months? Why do western powers need mass starvation in Bosnia, unchecked ethnic cleansing by the Serbs and the decidedly close threat of involvement by countries such as Iran to wake up to the reality of the Balkan problem? Why is it so easy to send 30,000 US-led troops to Somalia when the Bosnian tragedy is infinitely more dangerous to world peace? Why can the British government not look at the European map, work out the consequences of conflict between Serb-supporting Greece and Bosnian-supporting Turkey and act like the world power it claims to be? Apart from all these questions there is the undisputed fact that a communist-led terror regime has shown violent aggression towards the internationally recognised territory of an independent sovereign neighbouring nation.

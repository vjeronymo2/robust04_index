			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Jobs go in Coats thread merger BRITAIN'S BIGGEST thread maker is to be created by the merger of Coats Viyella's J&amp;P Coats division with English Sewing, which CV acquired last May, when it bought Tootal after a bitter takeover battle. This will lead to the loss of 350 jobs. The new company Coats Ltd, which comes into being on April 6, will have annual sales of Pounds 60m and take about 40 per cent of the UK thread market. The job cuts are mostly at J&amp;P Coats manufacturing operations at Paisley, Scotland. Mr Nick Kershaw, managing director of the merged company, said yesterday that staffing across Coats Ltd would be down to 800 within a year. J&amp;P Coats is the junior in the partnership, with about 17 per cent of the UK market. The combined company will account for about 7 per cent of Coats Viyella's worldwide thread sales. The merger will take place a few days after Coats Viyella publishes its results for 1991 on March 27. The figures will be closely watched by analysts because they will include eight months of trading after the merger with Tootal. Coats Viyella is expected to have made pre-tax profits of about Pounds 108m, a slight improvement on 1990. It has already shed some jobs since the merger, but cuts would have been higher in the thread division had Tootal not closed two spinning mills at Belper and Matlock in Derbyshire in March 1991 with the loss of 220 jobs. Mr Kershaw said that these job cuts had helped efficiency. More than 90 per cent of Coats Ltd's products are made, dyed or finished in the UK at plants in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Enderby, Leicester. Its main competitors in the UK are Leicester-based Donisthorpe, owned by DMC, the French textile group, and Oxley Threads, a family-owned business in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.</p>

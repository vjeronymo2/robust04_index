			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An approved application is an application listed in the first column of table I. Moreover, the student must send the application to the address of the organization whose application is being used. Thus, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FASFA) printed and distributed by the Department must be sent to the FAFSA processor in Iowa City, forms printed and distributed by the College Scholarship Service (CSS) must be sent to CSS, forms printed and distributed by the American College Testing Program (ACT) must be sent to ACT, and forms distributed by the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) must be sent to PHEAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a student submits an electronic application under EDE, that application must be received by the Department's central processor prior to midnight (Central Daylight Savings Time) on May 2, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (For purposes of this notice, this deadline means that a student has all of May 2, 1994, to apply.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the balance of this notice, the first application submitted by or on behalf of a student shall be called an ``original application.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Applications of Students Receiving ``Dependency Overrides''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 480(d)(7) of the HEA, a financial aid administrator (FAA) may determine that a student qualifies as an ``independent student'' as a result of unusual circumstances even though the student does not qualify as an independent student under the other criteria in section 480(d). This determination,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using what is known as ``professional judgment,'' results in a ``dependency override.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an FAA makes a dependency override with regard to a student, the student must submit an original Correction Application to the Federal Student Aid Programs after that application has been specially coded for the dependency override and signed by the FAA. If the student attends an institution that participates in EDE, the institution may electronically transmit an original application or a Correction Application, coded for the dependency override, to the central processor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a student has not submitted an original application, the deadline date for the submission of a Correction Application for a dependency override is May 2, 1994. If the student has submitted an original application, the deadline date for the submission of a Correction Application is August 1, 1994. (For purposes of this notice, this deadline means that a student has all of August 1, 1994, to apply.) Applications submitted electronically must be received by the central processor prior to midnight Central Daylight Savings Time on the applicable deadline date. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB Control Number Application: 1840&hyph;0110)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

In some cases, the agency receiving the original application may request additional information. In other cases, the student is responsible for initiating a request to the agency to consider additional or alternative information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table I of this notice lists the addresses to which additional forms and information, known as transactions, must be sent and the deadline dates for the receipt of those transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following explains each type of transaction:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

The student must include on the Correction Application all the information necessary to process that application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a student has misreported his or her dependency status, or if that status has changed after the student submitted an original application for reasons other than a change in marital status, the student must submit a Correction Application with the correct dependency status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Correction Application may be obtained (1) from an FAA or an Educational Opportunity Center counselor, (2) by writing to the addresses listed in table I, (3) by writing to Federal Student Aid Information Center, P.O. Box 84, Washington, DC, 20044, or (4) by calling (800) 4 FED AID. The Correction Application must be returned to one of the addressees listed in table I and received at that address no later than August 1, 1994, unless the Correction Application is submitted as an original application, in which case it must be received by May 2, 1994. A Correction Application submitted electronically under EDE through the electronic application process must be received by the central processor prior to midnight (Central Daylight Savings Time) on August 1, 1994, unless the Correction Application is submitted as an original application, in which case the correction application must be received prior to midnight (Central Daylight Savings Time) on May 2, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

The student must return the SAR to the appropriate address listed in table I, and that corrected SAR must be received at the appropriate address no later than August 1, 1994. If the student attends an institution that participates in EDE, the corrected SAR may be transmitted electronically to the central processor. That SAR must be received by the central processor prior to midnight (Central Daylight Savings Time) on August 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: SCA sells hydroelectric arm for SKr11.45bn SCA, the Swedish forestry group, yesterday sold its hydroelectric subsidiary Bakab to the Swedish energy group Sydkraft for SKr11.45bn (Dollars 1.88bn). The deal will substantially reduce SCA's borrowings and strengthen Sydkraft's position in the European power industry. Explaining the background to the disposal, SCA said its need for owning hydroelectric power sources had been reduced as it shifts from energy-intensive raw pulp production to using recycled fibre for its growing range of value-added wood-based products. SCA added that it would net SKr6.7bn from the sale and as a result reduce its long-term debt to SKr8.69bn from SKr17.77bn, while increasing its equity/asset ratio from 29 per cent to 47 per cent. SCA built up its large debt burden in the past few years in a corporate acquisition spree through Europe, including the Pounds 1.05bn (Dollars 1.84bn) purchase of Reedpack in 1990. In an attempt to reduce borrowings, SCA has already sold several subsidiaries, including the pulp machinery company Sunds Defibrator, and mortgaged half of Bakab's assets to the Swedish government-affiliated National Pension Funds. That mortgage will be transferred to Sydkraft as part of the preliminary agreement. The Bakab sale will also enable SCA to renew its acquisitions thrust as well as finance current capital investment programmes. The takeover by Sydkraft of SCA's hydroelectric facilities, which are in the mountainous northern Swedish region of Norrland, will take place at the beginning of 1993 with an initial payment of SKr7.95bn followed by five annual payments of SKr700m each. Sydkraft said its acquisition of Bakab will improve its competitive position as the European electricity market becomes deregulated, providing increased opportunities to sell power across national borders. Sydkraft plans to provide electricity to the German power group Preussen Elektra, which acquired a 10.5 per cent stake in Sydkraft last year. Bakab accounted for about 9 per cent, or SKr1.10bn, of SCA's 1990 total invoicing. The addition of Bakab's hydroelectric resources will also reduce Sydkraft's dependence on nuclear power as its main source of electricity generation. SCA said the deregulation of the electricity market in Sweden and the European Community and the opening of borders within Europe had led 'to a quickly changing situation' in the power sector.</p>

The three countries had planned to hold the investigation in  mid- January, but had to postpone the plan because of  differences of opinion over cost sharing, they said. The  problems were resolved recently.    The area for investigation will be the East Sea off  Hokkaido,  where the Russian Far-East fleet said it dumped nuclear waste in  October last year.</p>

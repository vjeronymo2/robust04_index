			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Arts: Abbey keeps the world at bay - Architecture In 1950 the Ordnance Survey published a map of monastic Britain which gave the names and locations of the 900 monasteries and nunneries of the pre-Reformation country. It is hard for us to imagine the holocaust of destruction that followed King Henry VIII's suppression of the monasteries and today it is difficult to conceive of a Britain that in some ways must have been like Tibet - a land full of monks and nuns, even in its remotest corners. It was, I think, Sacheverell Sitwell who said that the great monastic ruins of England were the equivalent of Cambodia's Angkor Wat or Egypt's Abu Simbel. They seem as dead and defunct as those places because the ruins are not even corpses but skeletons, with no traces left of the souls and minds that once inhabited them. Even the most remarkable of all the monastic remains in England, Fountains Abbey, demands a feat of imagination to evoke the nature of the monastic lives that were followed there. The problem, even in as remote and beautiful a place as Fountains Abbey by the River Skell in Yorkshire, is that the remains of England's abbeys have been secularised at least once in their long lives. Fountains' first secularisation came at the dissolution; its second in the 18th century when John Aislabie and his son laid turf in the fields around the abbey and incorporated the ruin as a picturesque fragment in their new landscape gardens. In this century, the remote and silent abbey ruins and the adjacent landscape park of Studley Royal have been drawn closer still to the secular world by waves of visitors and their cars. In 1983 the National Trust bought the Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal estate, acquiring not just the 18th-century landscaped water gardens, but also the most complete Cistercian abbey in Europe. The Trust also acquired a problem of the most sensitive kind. It was not just a matter of how to restore and care for the estate, it was also a matter of preserving the extraordinary atmosphere while coping with more than 300,000 annual visitors. It is the combination of landscape and architecture that makes Fountains Abbey special. There are two aspects to this. When the monks of St Mary's Abbey in York begged their superiors to remove them from the laxity of town life in 1132, their archbishop selected Skelldale because it was 'a place remote from all the world, uninhabited, set with thorns . . . fit more for the dens of wild beasts than the uses of mankind'. To this aspect of remoteness must be added the approach of the 18th-century landscapists, who reduced the abbey ruins to picturesque features while elevating the entire estate into a vision of the sublime imagination. The National Trust has continued the development of the estate by planning for the reception of visitors in ways that remove the worst aspects of the visibility of car parking and allow more rewarding circular walking routes. But the most important element is the new visitors' centre that has now been opened after years of delicate treading of the planning tightrope. The saga is in many ways a story of our times. The amount of local, regional and national negotiation needed to build a centre that is, itself, dedicated to the enhancement of the whole estate in retrospect seems almost unbelievable. But the concerns were the correct ones; many people felt that the greatest Cistercian abbey in Europe, in its wild valley, should be sacrosanct. The selection of the architect was a vital part of the process and the Trust's choice of Edward Cullinan and Partners was brave and inspired. The choice of site to allow the invisibility of the centre from the abbey was also important, but this did not mean that the centre should be designed as a shy and retiring creature lurking secretly in a remote meadow. The National Trust has taken the appointment of architects very seriously and at Fountains Abbey the opportunity to add something of quality from the late 20th century was rightly considered to be important. The result of this act of patronage is a remarkable new building located as an incident in the entire landscape plan of the estate. The visitor approaching from the new road now sees new axial views of the pinnacled spire of William Burgess's High Victorian St. Mary's Church (built by the pious Marchioness of Ripon in the 1870s). Aislabie's grand avenue, focused on the distant view of Ripon cathedral, is another new, fine view. After a sharp turn away from the obelisk of 1815 the road brings the visitor to the new centre. The initial view of the centre, which will be very different when the new trees have grown, is something of a surprise. Cullinan's design is both vernacular and flamboyant. Dry stone walls root the building to its site, steeply pitched sandstone roofs and dramatically curved flying, lead roofs seem to want to carry it to heaven. The architectural language is original, owing more perhaps to Tolkien than to ecclesiastical towers. As the centre is built around a courtyard, which opens at an angle on to a dramatically foreshortened view of the top of the great abbey tower, the echoes of the cloister are present without being over emphasised. Inside the centre Cullinan displays his conviction that structure and the construction process should be expressed. The steel frame can be seen beneath the timber roofing joists, bolts and dowels are also visible throughout. The sense of an architect playing with a parts kit is emphasised by the architect's decision to utilise a colourful, even childlike palette on elements of the timber ceiling (in the restaurant, the sensation of being in the hall of a rather progressive new primary school is only just avoided). But the architectural jollity is refreshing and the centre should indeed have a sense of both pleasure and education. I enjoyed the frisson of an architectural experiment, admired the marriage of materials, and appreciated the air of anticipation provided by the siting and landscaping of the centre. I know from the time I have spent on the National Trust's architectural panel how hard it is to achieve the balance between the undisturbed silence of historic places and the need to provide for large numbers of visitors. Honeypots mean bees. At Fountains Abbey the new hive is a highly skilled creation.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Some Everton holders get the blues over rights issue Shares in Everton, the English football club, were on offer in Liverpool yesterday at Pounds 2,750 each - well short of the Pounds 4,000a share rights issue which the club will launch at a special general meeting on July 26. 'Anyone who takes up their rights at Pounds 4,000 when they can buy on the open market at Pounds 2,750 will be absolutely bonkers,' said Mr Philip Oakell, a stockbroker with Tilney &amp; Co in Liverpool, who owns two shares himself. 'I shall definitely not be taking up my rights,' he added. 'You can count me out too,' said Mr Mike Dyble, co-founder of the BDH advertising agency in Manchester, who has three. 'You get almost nothing for being a shareholder anyway,' said Mr Tony Tighe, a Manchester public relations consultant, who paid Pounds 300 each for his two shares in 1986. 'I spent Pounds 208 on my season ticket yesterday - a 5 per cent discount - but this club is so mean to its shareholders you don't even get a cup of tea at the AGM.' Mr Brian McGain, Liverpool managing partner of Moore Stephens, the accountancy firm, is one of the more substantial small shareholders, with 17 shares. 'I disagree with the way it is being done,' he said sadly. 'If the club wanted to raise money it could have pitched the rights issue at below market price and pleased a lot of us. But this way will just squeeze out the little guys and dilute their holdings.' Mr Dyble, who was part of consortium organised by Mr Bill Kenwright, the theatrical impresario, which hoped in vain to take over the club, agreed. 'It has had to be done this way so Peter Johnson can put nearly Pounds 10m into Everton and ensure the money goes to the club, not to shareholders,' he said. Mr Johnson is chairman of Park Food Group and the man who rebuilt Tranmere Rovers - Merseyside's third football club after Liverpool and Everton - both financially and on the field of play. He has one Everton share and will definitely be taking up his right to one more. He also hopes to buy the other 2,499 new shares in the issue, which he is personally underwriting to buy his way into the Everton chairmanship so he can play boardroom football on a bigger stage. He left for a long weekend in the south of France yesterday to make himself unavailable. There are 2,500 existing Everton shares, although Professor Tom Cannon, former director of Manchester Business School, true-blue Evertonian, and another member of Mr Kenwright's failed bid team, thinks 200 are 'dead' - untraceable after their owners died and failed to carry on a longstanding Scouse tradition of turning them into heirlooms. He believes a few people will take up their rights to try to spite Mr Johnson by ensuring he does not get more than 50 per cent of the club. 'Some people will never forgive him for being a self-confessed Liverpool supporter. They will see it rather like making a pact with the devil,' Prof Cannon said. Control of what will actually happen is in the hands of the Moores family, the death of whose patriarch - Sir John Moores, founder of Littlewoods and the football pools - precipitated the struggle for control of Everton last year. They own more than half the existing shares and have basically agreed to let Mr Johnson take control, although it is thought they are likely to manipulate their own take-up of rights to ensure they keep a 25.01 per cent block-ing minority at any future AGM. Mr Johnson plans to build bridges: Mr Kenwright will become deputy chairman and one of his allies, Mr Arthur Abercromby, will join the board. So will Mr John Suenson-Taylor, son of Sir John's daughter, Lady Grantchester, herself the Moores family's main negotiator with Mr Johnson and Mr Kenwright. What will happen to the share price after the rights issue fails and Mr Johnson sweeps in? 'It will hold,' says Mr Oakell, who is Tilney's expert on the football indus-try. 'This offer values Everton at about Pounds 20m, which is half the market capitalisation of, say, Arsenal, another unquoted club of similar pedigree. If Johnson can pick Everton up the way he did Tranmere Rovers, the value should eventually double. The shares could become very valuable indeed,' Mr Oakell added. Provided, of course, Everton eventually floats on the Stock Exchange - the Moores family's likely blocking minority will be the deciders of that.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTC" newscast] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister Rafael Pardo was at the airport  when he learned about the release of Carlos Upegui [a member of  the Reintegration Commission]. This was the last news he  received before leaving for the United States.    [Begin Pardo recording] The release of Dr. Upegui was the  result of a very persistent effort, especially by the Army.  Fortunately, he is safe and sound and will be able to join his  family very soon. [end recording]    Despite the successful operation--which dealt a heavy blow  against the guerrillas--Pardo said the number of kidnappings  have increased for one specific reason: the unconstitutionality  of certain decrees of the Antikidnapping Law.    [Beginning Pardo recording] We have said this could pave the  way for those who want to commit kidnappings, that they would  face fewer obstacles and restrictions; unfortunately, we see  that kidnappers have increased their actions. [end recording]    Rafael Pardo went to Houston to undergo a medical checkup,  which will allow him to continue with his recuperation. He  hopes to be back in Colombia in February to resume his job as  defense minister.</p>

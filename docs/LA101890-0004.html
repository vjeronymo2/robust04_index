			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COST OF LAWYERS  </P> <P> In response to University of Texas economist Stephen Magee's statement (Oct. 8)  that due to the plague of lawyers, each new lawyer produced by our law schools  costs the U.S. economy $1 million a year in generating spurious conflict:  </P> <P> I have been an attorney for eight years. I have cost the U.S. economy $8  million and I am ashamed.  </P> <P> The solution is for me to get out of the business. Get out and stay out. I am  willing to remain conflict-free at a cost to the government of only a $500,000  per year subsidy not to practice law. If a dispute arises at any point during  the period of subsidizing, I promise that I will see you in court.  </P> <P> CYNTHIA BRACK  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

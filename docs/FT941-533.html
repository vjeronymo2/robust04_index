			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Krajina ceasefire talks progress: European News Digest Croatian government officials and leaders of Krajina, the breakaway Serb state, yesterday made headway in crucial talks on a ceasefire, which Serb leaders said could avert another war in the region. Negotiators held out the hope that the two sides might reach an agreement late last night. Speaking by telephone from the Russian embassy in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, where the two sides met for the second time in a week, Mr Slobodan Jarcevic, foreign minister of Krajina, said: 'The chances are 50-50 that we reach an agreement. The atmosphere is very tense, but so much is at stake.' However, the two sides remain far apart in their political demands. Serb leaders, backed by the Yugoslav army, are insisting on independence for their breakaway state, carved out during a six-month war, while the Croatian authorities are pressing the international community to bring Krajina, which cuts Croatia in two, under Zagreb's control. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has reportedly suggested trading parts of the Serb-held land in exchange for the phasing out of UN sanctions on what remains of Yugoslavia.

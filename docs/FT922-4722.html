			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Siebe If nothing else, Siebe's full-year figures are confirmation of the striking success of the Foxboro acquisition. In little more than 18 months, Siebe has taken Foxboro from persistent losses to operating margins of almost 17 per cent. In its first full year, it has contributed a net Pounds 13m to cash flow after all expenses. Partly as a result, the group as a whole has more than retrieved the drop in earnings at the interim stage. Although business in the current year has proved a touch disappointing, Siebe continues to expect a second-half upturn. However impressive it is that Foxboro should already be at a pitch of efficiency, the obvious question is how far the shares can now go on outperforming. At 739p, the multiple is a touch below the UK industrial average, but so is the yield. Siebe is fully established as a remarkable company. It may be due for a lull just the same.</p>

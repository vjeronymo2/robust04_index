			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SPANISH LOTTERY AWARDS CHEER TO A FEW  </P> <P> Roars of joy erupted and millions of dreams of wealth were shattered today as  Spain's Christmas lottery, the world's richest, showered $800 million on a few  winners.  </P> <P> Mesmerized ticket-holders listened for three hours as nervous orphans sang out  the lucky numbers in a live radio and television broadcast.  </P> <P> The country was at a virtual standstill until it was announced that number  61714 had won El Gordo ("the Fat One"). The $104-million first prize was  divided among 80 tickets with that number.  </P> <P> Euphoria exploded and champagne corks popped in Paiporta and Tarrancon, two  towns of 15,000 that shared in the bonanza.  </P> <P> "I won 50 million pesetas ($430,000)," incredulous teen-ager Jorge Alcantara  told a radio station. "I don't know what to ask Santa Claus for."  </P> <P> Vicente Piles, the man who sold the lucky tickets in Paiporta and kept one for  himself, won 10 million pesetas. The former mayor of the city of Lerida who  shunned sharing a ticket with his centrist colleagues on the City Council lost  out on their prize of half a million dollars.  </P> <P> In Cartagena, workers of a liquor factory toasted their $1-million prize with  their own product.  </P> <P> Bank managers and car salesmen were preparing to descend on the lucky towns.  Newspapers published special issues with the list of winning numbers.  </P> <P> But all over the country, millions sadly tore up their tickets, hoping for  better luck next year.  </P> <P> Spaniards spent a staggering $1.08 billion -- an average of $28 per person --  on the Christmas lottery, a 171-year-old tradition.  </P></p>

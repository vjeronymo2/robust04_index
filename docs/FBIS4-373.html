			<p>BFN     [Text] In Rwanda, the situation is threatening to get even  further out of hand. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels  have left their positions in the north of Rwanda and are  advancing on the capital, Kigali. It is reported that the  rebels have crossed the buffer zone agreed to in the cease-fire  in March of last year. It is said that in some places they have  engaged with government troops. Our correspondent Else  Temmerman is now in the north of Rwanda and sends this  eyewitness report:    [Temmerman] The RPF's advance toward the capital, Kigali,  started last night. There is fighting in various parts of the  buffer zone. Artillery explosions can be heard as far away as  here in Mulindi. The fighting is especially fierce on the main  road to Kigali. There are reports that the rebels are now at a  distance of 35 km from the capital.    RPF Vice President Patrick Masinpaka said here in Mulindi  that the main aim of the operation is to reinforce the 600 UN  troops being held prisoner in the parliament buildings in  Kigali. Second, the RPF wants to help the United Nations  restore order in the capital.    We have decided to fight this clique, RPF leader Paul Kagame  said here this morning on the local radio. We regard everyone  standing in our way as conspirators with the murderers and we  will treat them accordingly.    The rebels say they are surprised by the cease-fire mediated  by the United Nations. We have no knowledge of such an  agreement, the vice president said here.    The RPF also opposes the new interim government. It is a  government installed by the United Nations. It is based on  nothing and, therefore, is not legally valid, the vice president  said.    The RPF also says that it will cooperate with foreign troops  if they want to evacuate their nationals.    How strong will be the opposition by the government army,  and  what the international community -- and especially the French --  will do, remain open questions.

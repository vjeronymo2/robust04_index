			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Saudi Arabian merger will create biggest oil concern SAUDI ARABIA is to merge its two main oil companies creating the largest integrated oil concern in the world, the kingdom said on Monday. Samarec, the kingdom's refining and marketing arm, will be merged into the oil production company, Saudi Aramco. 'It will give the company more energy to look at expanding outside Saudi Arabia and compete head-on with the oil majors. Its potential power as a joint company is profound,' said Mr Robin West, who runs Petroleum Finance Company, an energy consulting group in Washington. Saudi Arabia is looking to expand its downstream outlets for oil through deals in Europe and Asia as well as continuing to expand its production capacity beyond 10m barrels a day. The company's drive to become involved in the industry worldwide will put it into direct competition with multinational oil companies such as Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon. Aramco is already the world's largest exporter with current output of 8m b/d and current production capacity of 9m b/d. The company is also custodian of the kingdom's 295bn barrels of proven oil reserves. Samarec will bring to the merger 1.23m b/d refining capacity from three wholly-owned and three joint venture refineries in Saudi Arabia. This will take the joint company into all stages of the oil industry: production, refining, transport and marketing. Saudi officials said the merger came at the request of Mr Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, who has been looking to streamline the nation's oil industry for some time. Before the move Samarec (Saudi Arabian marketing and refining company) ran the country's three domestic refineries at Jeddah, Riyadh and Yanbu and was the Saudi partner in joint venture export refineries with Mobil at Yanbu and Shell at Jubail. Saudi Aramco already runs the Ras Tanura refinery - the world's biggest with capacity of 520,000 b/d until a fire in 1990 cut output to around 290,000 b/d. The newly augmented Saudi Aramco will continue a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) to Dollars 15bn expansion plan, set to raise Saudi oil production capacity to a sustainable 10m b/d by next year from present levels of around 9m b/d.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / EC social policy has impact on employers THE European Community's social agenda has had a significant impact on employers and unions in Britain in spite of government hostility to many parts of it, according to a report from the Policy Studies Institute. The report says unions are increasingly integrating ideas from the 1989 Social Charter into collective bargaining and strengthening links with other unions in the EC. It says employers are reviewing differing working conditions in their organisations across the EC so as to be able to respond to comparison claims from UK unions. The report says unions and employers have been largely reactive to the EC's social agenda and have played only a small role in setting it. Trade Unions and Employers in the Single Europe.

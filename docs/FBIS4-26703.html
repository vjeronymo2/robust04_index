			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 24 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Economic  Affairs on Friday [24 June] urged Taiwan business people to cut  imports of Japanese consumer goods to help trim Taiwan's huge  trade deficit with that country. Taiwan's trade deficit with  Japan hit a record U.S.$14.42 billion in 1993, and the deficit  is expected to top U.S.$15 billion this year.    A ministry official urged Taiwan importers to diversify  their  sources of imports and to help promote domestic-made goods they  would normally buy from Japan. Ministry statistics show that  increasing salaries here combined with fewer import restrictions  and the popularity of Japanese goods have worked to boost  Japanese imports year after year. Last year, 34 types of  Japanese goods were imported to the tune of U.S.$10 million each  -- mostly electrical appliances, food additives, hygiene and  beauty products, film, and video games.    The ministry official said a field study of Japanese imports  found that products that are no longer popular in Japan may  still sell in Taiwan for more than two or three times the cost  of similar Taiwan products. He said some domestic importers  even import Japanese foodstuffs whose "use-by" dates have  expired, banking on their popularity here to turn a brisk profit.</p>

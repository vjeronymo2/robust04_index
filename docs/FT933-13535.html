			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Monks wants TUC to do less but better: The likely new general secretary should be able to turn rhetoric into action MR JOHN MONKS is due to emerge today as sole candidate for general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, one of the toughest jobs in the country. Toughness is something he seems to have in abundance. Mr Monks, TUC deputy general secretary and a former personnel manager, has been scarcely visible in the shadow of his boss Mr Norman Willis for the past nine years. But in that time he has grown in stature as a manager and acquired a coldly realistic view of the trade union movement's real influence. In a confidential document on the future of the TUC presented to the general council last week he said that the organisation's 'limited effectiveness' in channelling national worries about pit closures and unemployment 'raises questions about the need for a reappraisal of the role of the TUC'. The simple answer is that the TUC should do fewer things more effectively. But that has been a commonplace of union discussion for years without any substantial action being taken. Mr Monks, unlike his predecessor, means business. He is expected to announce today that the general council has agreed to his proposal for a weekend summit, possibly at the Cranfield School of Management, to hammer out a programme of action on focusing the TUC's work. One insider said: 'For too long the union barons have talked about focusing the work of the TUC while at the same time complaining that the organisation is not doing more of everything. John will not let them get away with that.' Mr Monks is the son of a parks superintendent. He went to school in Manchester's Moss Side district before gaining a degree in economic history at Nottingham University. He worked for two years as a management trainee with manufacturing giant Plessey in Surrey before joining the TUC in 1969. The TUC now employs 150 people, after a 20 per cent staffing cut driven through by Mr Monks last year, and soaks up about Pounds 10m of trade union funds. In return it provides some services to its affiliated unions, representing 7.3m workers, and acts as the labour movement's civil service, running nine committees of the TUC general council and producing documents on most of the big public policy issues of the day. Mr Monks and many of his senior colleagues believe it should now concentrate on a few key areas such as Europe, health and safety, pensions and labour law. They also want the TUC to become a more politically neutral lobby organisation, expert in all matters relevant to the workplace. Mr Monks is particularly interested in human resources management and the rapid changes in the UK labour market which he believes could be eroding the concept of the 'steady job'. In his report he says: 'Significant TUC resources are devoted to sustaining and servicing structures rather than pursuing clearly defined objectives that have been agreed at the political level . . . Within committee agendas not enough progress has been made at focusing on the key priorities. Too much resource is consumed in preparing for meetings, and not enough on following through decisions.' Much the same could be said of most bureaucracies but the TUC has been suffering a more rapid decline than most. Mr Monks cannot reverse that decline, which shows no sign of abating in spite of an improved public standing. Nor can he change government views which range between hostility and indifference. But he can ensure that the TUC is more effectively run and can hope to influence those affiliates most in need of help. Mr Monks, who was a protege of former TUC leader Len Murray in the 1970s, is not a man bursting with new ideas and will not be a star performer on TV and radio. But in the world of the union movement his competence could make a big difference.</p>

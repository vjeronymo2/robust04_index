			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov gave a news  briefing today on the results of the meeting of the Supreme  Military Council. He announced that the figures given in the  mass media on cuts in the army's strength are incorrect and  imprecise.    Aleksandrov also signed an order transferring 87 officers  from the Defense Ministry and the economic sector to the  reserve. The officers in question are over 57 years old and  have completed 20 years of service. The minister explicitly  stressed that no cuts will take place in the Bulgarian Army, but  only retirements.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Jobs and growth to dominate talks Rising unemployment and poor short-term prospects for economic growth in Europe will dominate the agenda when European Union finance ministers meet in Brussels today. Talks will focus on how to carry out prescriptions in the Delors White Paper on employment and growth which were approved at the Brussels summit last December. Greece, which chairs the talks today, has pledged to make the White Paper the centrepiece of its six-month presidency. But its efforts will be complicated by the ideological faultline within the EU over how best to generate growth and improve competitiveness. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, is expected to urge his partners to follow the British model and improve labour market flexibility. As in a recent speech in Paris, Mr Clarke will reject accusations that such steps have undermined the UK welfare state. But other member states remain wary of moves which could provoke labour unrest at home. France, which has seen violent protests by fishermen, farmers and airline workers in recent months, will point to its policy of encouraging public and consumer spending to spur its faltering recovery. The opening debate among ministers will be televised.</p>

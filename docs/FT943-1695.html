			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / EU launches debate on new rules for IT: Talks open today on how the single market will cope with the surge in information technology A crucial debate on the future of the European single market opens in Germany today as ministers launch talks on how to handle the expected explosion in information technology. The outcome will shape the development of information services such as interactive television, computer-learning and electronic banking across the European Union, areas still seen as the missing link in the single market. The argument today revolves around whether existing rules on the free movement of goods and services and mutual recognition of other countries' rules can provide the right framework for investment in information technology or whether there is a need for supra-national regulation. Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the European Commissioner responsible for the single market, is expected to argue that present legislation is adequate in most areas and that there is no need for a centralised European regulatory authority. Four areas - the protection of intellectual property rights, data protection, encryption and media concentration - have been pinpointed as needing special attention and legislation is being prepared. However, this week the European Commission backed away from proposals to harmonise laws on media ownership, worried that European-wide action could trigger a backlash among member states. The debate on the future of the service sector has also revealed an ideological faultline inside the commission. Officials responsible for the single market believe that too much regulation risks fragmenting the market and creating an inflexible environment for investment. However, an action plan stemming from a report by Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, on the information society, talks of the need to establish an authority at a European level. 'Whilst fully respecting the subsidiarity principle, the commission will launch in-depth studies to examine institutional aspects and to see which activities at present exercised by the member states and the commission might be entrusted to such an authority,' says the report. Those responsible for industry and telecommunications in the commission are said to be uneasy about seeing the information society develop in a relatively unregulated fashion. However, they deny there is any difference within the commission about how best to proceed, arguing that the way ahead is laid out clearly in Mr Bangemann's action plan, and that the most pressing need is to present industry with a consistent approach. Another argument is over how much emphasis should be put on protecting consumers of the new services offered by the information superhighways against the providers. 'We want to achieve an internal market in information services,' said an official from the directorate responsible for the single market. 'To do that, you need to have a balanced approach that takes into account all groups involved - industry, users, rights holders and consumers - and not just industry.' The debate comes as officials and ministers, generally satisfied that goods are moving freely around the community, have realised the need to focus on the potential economic benefits from the free movement of services, particularly information services, across the borders of the 12 member states.</p>

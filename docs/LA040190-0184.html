			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOST VIEWERS WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE  </P> <P> Most Southern Californians won't be able to see the new HA! comedy channel when  it begins today. Symptomatic of the difficulty that new cable ventures face  getting off the ground these days, only one cable system in Los Angeles and  Orange counties is carrying the service: Century Cable -- and only in the areas  of West Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Marina del Rey.  </P> <P> Paragon Cable, which serves Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Westminster,  Fountain Valley, Stanton, Rossmoor, Los Alamitos, Midway City and parts of  Anaheim, has signed up to carry HA! but it won't start for a month or two, and  will only be available initially for 12 hours a day, sharing channel space with  another, as-yet-undecided programming service.  </P> <P> Neither of the major cable systems in San Diego has picked up HA! yet either.  </P></p>

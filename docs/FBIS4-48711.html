			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carmel Rickard] </F>   [Text] Serious political wrangles between the IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] and the ANC over cabinet positions has left  Kwazulu Natal, one of the country's poorest, most violent and  least developed provinces, effectively ungoverned and unable to  begin implementing much-needed reconstruction projects.    Natal ANC officials put some blame on the hardline approach  of IFP President and National Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu  Buthelezi, who meets with President Nelson Mandela in Cape Town  today in an effort to sort out the squabbles. ANC provincial  leader Jacob Zuma will also be in Cape Town today, and it is  understood he will meet with Mr Mandela on the same issue.  Provincial premier Dr Frank Mdlalose of the IFP and Mr Zuma,  with their respective advisers, will have talks on Tuesday about  the problem.    ANC sources say that until the stalemate is sorted out, the  province will not be delegated its powers under the  Constitution. Pretoria will continue to hold its powers in  trust, and Kwazulu Natal will be effectively powerless.    ANC sources said the force of Mr Buthelezi's presence at  regional level could become so significant that the province  would end up with "two premiers", Mr Buthelezi and Dr Mdlalose.    Among grievances listed by Mr Zuma was Dr Mdlalose's  handling  of cabinet allocation. Initially he announced Mr Zuma would  have the post of social welfare, but this was changed --  according to Mr Zuma, without warning or consultation -- to  public works and auxiliary services. Mr Zuma also complained  that the ANC was not given the deputy cabinet position on  police, which it wanted. "Completely excluding the ANC from this  portfolio will never work."</p>

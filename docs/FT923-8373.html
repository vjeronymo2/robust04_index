			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Letter: No advocate of floating pound Sir, Your leader, 'Each-way bets in the market' (August 1) states '. . . the hints in this country from the new director-general of the CBI and the chairman of ICI, to take the two most prestigious examples, suggest realignment or even a return to independent floating (of the pound) as preferable'. Certainly I have called for concerted action within the ERM to secure lower interest rates. But at no time have I advocated floating the pound, or supported a unilateral devaluation of sterling. Indeed, all recent CBI statements have explicitly rejected that option. Howard Davies, director-general, Confederation of British Industry, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU</p>

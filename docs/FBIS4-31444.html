			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 5 (BTA) -- At a late-night session  yesterday the 41st congress of the Bulgarian Socialist Party  (BSP) approved a draft programme entitled "New Times, New  Bulgaria, New BSP", which will form a basis for the party's  programme. It will be further developed and the final version  will be submitted for all-party consultations in the autumn  prior to its adoption, the congress decided after heated debates.    The congress also adopted the basis for a BSP election  platform and assigned the Supreme Council to revise the draft  bringing it "in line with the ideas and prospects of a  left-of-centre agreement".    "Bulgaria is heading for early parliamentary elections in  the  grip of a grave economic and social crisis," says the draft  election platform approved at the congress. The final version  of the document will be drawn up for the new elections. The  party sets itself three aims for the post-election period: to  create a new climate in political and social life, to apply a  new economic reform model, and follow a comprehensive policy of  social protection of the population. In his report to the  congress BSP leader Zhan Videnov spoke in favour of the same  goals.    According to the draft platform, the Socialists are in  favour  of national consensus, against ethnic confrontation, for  Bulgaria's single-nation character and territorial integrity.  They support socially-oriented mass privatization and will work  to halt the drop in output, to reduce unemployment and return  the land to its former owners, after which land plots will be  consolidated through voluntary cooperatives.    The BSP is in favour of goodneighbourly relations with all  Balkan countries, for an active and independent policy, absolute  neutrality in the Yugoconflict and total integration into the  European structures.    The draft document covers aspects of social life, including  crime control, the reform of the judiciary and the welfare of  young people.    The draft programme approved at the congress was prepared by  the Centre for Strategic Studies headed by Alexander Lilov. An  ad hoc committee under BSP leader Zhan Videnov made additions to  the draft document. It describes the BSP as "a mass party of  labour, intelligence, initiative and creativity". As a national  party the BSP declares itself in favour of ethnic tolerance  within the unified Bulgarian state. BSP policy is based on  social democracy, a resolution on the draft programme says.    The Socialists will work for the evolutionary modernization  of Bulgarian society and state that they are open to valuable  and progressive philosophical and political achievements of  modern science and civilization. Different ideological trends  coexist freely in an atmosphere of tolerance in the BSP, the  draft programme says.    The Credentials Committee reported, however, that only 30 of  nearly 800 delegates represented ideological trends distinct  from the mainstream.    The motion of the ad hoc committee that the programme be  adopted in the autumn provoked heated debates in an otherwise  smooth proceeding. Many speakers urged that the congress adopt  the programme. The motion for an all-party consultation was  carried by 310 votes to 221.    Speaking to BTA reporters, the author of the draft Alexander  Lilov ruled out the possibility of great changes to it in the  next three months. It was on these grounds that delegates voted  against the all-party consultation. Lilov said he had voted for  it and declined to explain what he had in mind when he said from  the rostrum that it was against the interests of some circles in  the party leadership to adopt a new programme.    Today the delegates decided that congresses will be convened  once in four years. According to the new statute, the congress  will elect a new Supreme Council. From among its members it  will elect a new leader, controlling committee and  editors-in-chief of the BSP "Douma" daily and the "Novo Vreme"  journal. The congress accepted Andrei Loukanov's motion that  the chairman of the controlling committee should be elected by  the committee itself and not by the congress. According to the  statute under discussion, the BSP symbols are a red flag with  the acronym BSP, a red rose and a five-pointed star.    For the first time the statute envisages that the Supreme  Council will include one delegate from every constituency,  elected at a general meeting of the chairpersons of the local  party councils.    The congress, continuing behind closed doors late into the  night, will elect Supreme Council and leader by secret ballot.  There are two likely candidates for this position: Zhan  Videnov and Alexander Marinov, leader of the Sofia party  organization. Former leader Alexander Lilov, now strategist of  the party, strongly denied having ambitions for the post. Most  observers and delegates see Videnov as the more likely choice.</p>

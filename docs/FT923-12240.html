			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / The Italian auction begins: Privatisation has suddenly been put at the top of the agenda The cream of Italian business and finance was seduced into rising at the crack of dawn last month by the prospect of a day on board the British royal yacht, Britannia, with the excuse of a conference on privatisation. After being welcomed with 1950s tunes from a Royal Marines' band, the audience was given a hard-nosed sell of the City of London's services. The arguments were impeccable: Italy possessed the biggest state sector in Europe and an impossibly large budget deficit - ergo, privatisation was the most effective means of reducing the role of the state and releasing resources. The City was there to help. At one stage, however, a distinguished Italian financier very politely said that the gentlemen from London were wasting their time. Things were different in Italy, and privatisation an unreal dream. Yet now the new government has unexpectedly placed privatisation at the top of the agenda. 'I am creating a machine that will be forced towards privatisation,' Prof Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, told the FT last week. Since then, the four principal public entities - IRI, the main state holding company, ENI, the oil concern, ENEL, the electricity authority, and INA, the insurance institute - have been converted into joint stock companies under the tutelage of the Treasury. In turn two super-holdings are being set up, with the Treasury as the initial shareholder, which will house these four entities and other state assets, principally the banking groups BNL and IMI. The super-holdings, with initial assets of L60,000bn (Pounds 27.7bn), will be responsible for what could become the biggest state sell-off in the European Community. Certainly, the prime minister intends to change radically the corporatist culture of a benign state subsidising industry and deeply involved in every aspect of economic life, which has been a feature of the country's development since the early days of Mussolini in the 1930s. Already, Efim, the third-largest state holding, with 37,000 employees and activities that span aluminium, aerospace, defence and transport, was last Friday put in the hands of a special administrator charged with winding it up. 'You begin by saying you are in year zero, and you should reduce the role of the state as much as you can,' says Prof Amato. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that Italian state-controlled companies employ 15 per cent of the non-agricultural labour force, and account for 20 per cent of added value and 25 per cent of fixed investment; the state also controls two-thirds of the banking system. In spite of growing pressure from EC partners and the deteriorating state of public finances, the previous Andreotti government dithered over such a move for nearly a year and, only three weeks ago, was talking of limiting the change to ENI, giving the group 60 days to complete its change of identity into a joint stock company. The Amato government has moved so fast and kept its plans so tight that the managers of the companies concerned were largely in the dark. According to Prof Giuseppe Guarino, the industry minister and one of the leading figures in the privatisation plans, there are two principal lines of action. The first is to provide the government with room for manoeuvre, free of the political parties. This explains the control of the state entities being placed in the hands of the Treasury. Until now the boards of state companies have been appointed through deals struck by the leaders of the parties in government, to ensure that their own party patronage is taken care of. Thus the Christian Democrats have always had the lion's share, followed by the Socialists - IRI has traditionally had a Christian Democrat president, ENI a socialist. In tandem with removing control from the party bosses, the government needs to obtain quick finance to plug the widening 1992 budget deficit, equivalent to more than 10.5 per cent of gross domestic product. To this end, the two super-holdings will issue convertible bonds or warrants to be underwritten by a consortium of banks. A 45 per cent ceiling has been placed on private ownership of the holdings. But Prof Guarino insists no ceiling has been placed on the sale of shares in the operating subsidiaries of those companies in the super-holdings. He also adds that no sector is sacrosanct. The finances of the companies are so parlous that a large-scale divestment may well be necessary. The resultant pattern of ownership may be incompatible with the government's desire for a Germanic model of commercial bank influence over the corporate sector. The prime minister himself says the bottom line is that the state has no more money to offer the many companies in need of recapitalisation and debt relief - and even if it had, the EC would not permit old practices of state subsidy and grant. The second aim is to buy time in which to reorganise the existing operating companies under the holdings and to decide a rational order of sell-offs. Prof Guarino recognises that this will take about three years because it will entail issues of industrial strategy and reorganisation, plus tackling the question of debts. IRI's debts alone are now close to L60,000bn. This process of reorganisation need not interfere with existing plans for flotations of companies and banks held by IRI and ENI. For instance IRI's telecommunications holding, Stet, has begun to cut its stake in Sip, the telephone utility, to obtain funds. ENI is at an advanced stage in preparing to sell tranches of Agip and Snam, its oil and natural gas units. The immediate task is to decide who will manage the super-holdings and the nature of their respective boards. 'To be credible, we will need competent people who can demonstrate they are not puppets of the parties,' said a foreign merchant banker. The government also has to decide quickly on the composition of the super-holdings. Should ENI and ENEL be lumped together as a single energy-based super-holding, and should such a group include IRI? And should the other super-holding comprise exclusively banking and financial interests, ie INA's insurance activities, along with the Treasury-controlled BNL and IMI banking entities? Logically this broad division into energy/industry and financial/banking would necessitate hiving off IRI's huge banking and financial interests. The division by activity could enable privatisation to proceed more rapidly, especially as the banking sector is better placed than other sectors for sell-off (parts of the banking sector have already been privatised). The sceptics still remain to be convinced that the government has not bitten off more than it can chew. Their objections are part political, part financial. Thus state investment - an important instrument for development, especially in the economically depressed south - has often been determined by political factors. By contrast ENI has expanded under the entrepreneurial ethos of the late Mr Enrico Mattei, whose skills demonstrated that energy-dependent Italy could develop a dynamic state company capable of securing a portion of its oil and gas supplies through innovative exploration and production deals overseas. The politicians have also come to rely upon generous state benefits as a means of ensuring social consensus as well as funding large party machines that in turn deliver votes. State control of television, the airlines, railways and the banking system have permitted formidable patronage. Yet with a fragmented party system, a revolt of the electorate in the north in favour of clean government and better services, the political side of Prof Amato's problems may be lesser than they appear at first glance. More complex are issues of management and industrial relations. Privatisation brings into play the whole question of industrial relations which perforce must challenge overmanning, illogical distribution of plant and unnecessary factories. Overmanning could be as high as 20 per cent in the public sector. Industrial peace meanwhile has been bought until now by a combination of generous pensions, well-paid lay-offs, padded payrolls and politically directed investment. The threatened closure of a factory whether in the private or public sector provokes a chorus of protests and inevitable backtracking, especially in vote-sensitive areas such as the south. Over the past decade industry has lost 778,000 workers, but these have been covered either by early retirement or by moving into services. However, the slowdown of the past 18 months, greater competition and higher costs have put at least 200,000 jobs at risk, according to CGIL, the main union confederation. The union leadership recognises that the old forms of militancy no longer have much support among its members and that Italy is entering a new climate of industrial relations. Much therefore depends on the outcome of tripartite talks with the employers and government, currently in progress on a new structure for wages and employment. Finally, there is the domestic financial market. Currently, 75 per cent of savings are in Treasury paper, financing the state debt. So long as interest rates are high and tax breaks are favourable to Treasury bonds, the public has little incentive to buy shares in privatised companies, especially when Italy has such a poor record of protecting minority shareholders. The stock market itself is a victim of the public's propensity to buy Treasury bonds, but it is also small because it has failed to modernise and encourage Italian private companies to use the bourse. The market's capitalisation is only Dollars 125bn, one-eighth that of London. Launching even one large issue like that of the bank San Paolo di Torino for L1,525bn earlier this year poses enormous problems in drumming up investor support. This suggests that the government has to give priority to speeding up modernisation of the financial system as a whole - not least to encourage international investment which will be needed to absorb a sizeable slice of the privatised offerings. The international financial community has to be given incentives to buy into Italian stocks, both through greater freedom to operate on the ground and through attractive guarantees of what is on offer. Take the example of ENEL, the electricity authority. Foreign groups have shown great interest in its potential. But at the moment tariffs are blocked and the first thing investors are demanding to know about a new ENEL is its tariffs structure, because only on this measure can they base yields. The task ahead is thus a minefield of difficulties and the initial positive moves will need to flesh out a flimsy framework.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                ITALY: PRIVATISATION SHAKE-UP  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Relative size of public enterprises  ------------------------------------------------------------------- The corporate profile 1991  -------------------------------------------------------------------             TURNOVER      PROFITS/     NET      DEBITS    EMPLOYEES             Lire bn        LOSS      ASSETS     Lire bn                           Lire bn    Lire bn  ------------------------------------------------------------------- IRI         79,450          -315     1,874      61,000     407,160 ENI         50,883        +1,081    16,300      23,298     131,250 EFIM         4,566          -867     2,000       8,500      37,000 ENEL        27,000          +211    15,500      32,170     108,000 INA          5,353           +20     3,945                   1,436          (premiums) IMI         47,000          +312     5,566                   3,700 BNL        110,788           +82     6,010                  25,840             (loans)  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): One-stop help shop - Plans to speed up the development of a UK network of advice centres When Roger Stretch decided to buy some hi-tech laser machinery for his family-owned metal working business, he realised he would need a Department of Trade and Industry grant. Casting aside a long-held suspicion of consultants, Stretch approached Business Link Birmingham, which he was told had become a one-stop-shop supplying advice and support to business. 'I am basically using the Business Link to sort out the paper work for me and let me get on with running the business,' says Stretch, managing director of Mackenzie Tools &amp; Production, a Birmingham-based metal working company which employs 45 people. Birmingham was the first of the Business Links to open its doors - quickly followed by Leicester and Congleton - but the aim is to offer the service throughout the UK. Within three years, the DTI hopes about 70 large and 130 smaller Business Links will be set up, all providing one port of call for businesses wanting the support services now supplied by a multitude of organisations. To speed their development, Michael Heseltine last week increased the budget for the roll-out of the Business Link brand from Pounds 3m this financial year to Pounds 17m next year. The idea of bringing the diverse sources of help for business under one roof has gained strong national support, particularly from the business community itself. That said, there are still problems to be overcome before the network extends across the country. In theory each Business Link office is meant to be a partnership between the local Training and Enterprise Council, local authorities, chambers of commerce, enterprise agencies and the DTI, all of which provide different forms of support. All will have to subsume their identities beneath the Business Link flag. Each Link will structure its services as it sees fit but the range will be similar. Business Link Birmingham, for example, offers advice, counselling and support covering eight areas; exporting, sales/marketing, quality, team development, property, management/finance, technology and legal/regulation. The problem is that in some areas the chambers, Tecs and local authorities are finding the idea of forming a partnership easier than actually putting it into practice. Some Tecs, for example, are trying to be too dominant within the partnership and are incurring the DTI's censure; in other areas chambers of commerce fear they may lose traditional sources of financial support once the Business Links become self-funding in three years time. The strain has already proved too much at Business Link Leicester which last month parted company with its chief executive. 'Everyone is digging their institutional heels in and worrying about their long-term sources of income,' says Brian Wright, chief executive of the London Enterprise Agency and a member of the Business Link London steering board. Partners have to be prepared to lose some power, control and local identity if the Business Link concept is to have widespread success. Under the careful watch of Heseltine, a great believer in removing the disconcerting confusion for businesses seeking support, the DTI is determined that these turf battles do not dilute the Business Link product and turn it into just another provider of services. Bids for Business Link contracts from places like Thames Valley, where there is a strong chamber of commerce beside a strong Tec, are therefore progressing well. By contrast, government approval of Business Links appears to have been withheld in some of the home counties, where, for the moment at least, there is a lack of strong partners for the local Tecs. One pressure that might lead to stronger partnerships is local demand from businesses for what Business Link can offer. Alun Dow, chief executive of Birmingham Business Link, is in no doubt that this demand exists. 'The majority of the enquiries have been a general interest in seeing what we can do,' he says. In the first nine weeks, his switchboard received 3,800 enquiries. From these contacts his personal business advisers - in Birmingham's case a network of 55 independent consultants who behave like general practitioners  -will be conducting more than 340 diagnostic reviews. They make the first contact with clients and, if necessary, refer them to specialist consultants. So far 100 Birmingham companies have been passed on in this way: they pay a fee subsidised by the Business Link for the service they subsequently receive. Business Link support has also shifted perceptably away from an earlier focus on the smallest companies, many of which had no realistic chance of growing. Business Link Congleton, for example, is willing to support sizeable companies like Airbags International, a subsidiary of Electrolux of Sweden. Eighteen months ago, the Congleton company which makes safety airbags for Ford, Saab and BMW, was about to embark on a manufacturing programme that would increase its workforce from 30 to 200 people. It realised it needed help handling the growth in its labour force and the transition from what was effectively a research and development company. It turned to South and East Cheshire Tec - now a partner in Business Link Congleton - for an Investors in People programme which helps companies achieve a nationally agreed standard for training and developing staff. 'Business consultants came in to look at the company to see where we were hoping to get to and to look at the people we have employed and to match them with our development goals,' says Ewen Guy, Airbags' personnel manager, who was also sceptical of consultants who would not help implement their advice. 'The Tec helps implement the programme; that is one of the main reasons we took the Tec route.' One danger of casting their nets this wide is that the quality of diagnosis and advice may not be maintained. There may simply be a shortage of adequately qualified consultants trained in Business Link's approach. 'The personal business advisers will have to be paragons of all the virtues,' says Wright. 'I wonder about the sheer volume they can get through.'</p>

During the last round of negotiations on March 1-2 at  Lohusalu resort near Tallinn, Russia withdraw its earlier  commitment to pull out its forces by August 31, 1994 and  neglected to offer another date for negotiations. Yesterday the  Foreign Ministry of Estonia announced that Estonia had accepted  Russia's offer to resume negotiations despite "numerous and  often vague statements from the Russian part on breaking off the  negotiations".    Svirin said that at the last round of negotiations "new,  unexpected moments came up" and the Russian side had to think  the situation over" to work out their position. [quotation marks  as received]    The next round will be held in Moscow on April 5-6.    Commenting on the possible Estonian-Russian summit, Svirin  said that it was extremely important, but declined to enlarge on  the topic, saying only that it had to be prepared very  thoroughly in order it to be "epochal" in the difficult  relations between Estonia and Russia.</p>

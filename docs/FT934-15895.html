			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Brussels may prosecute UK over television curbs THE European Commission is one step away from prosecuting Britain in the European Court of Justice for imposing too many controls on foreign satellite and cable television broadcasts into the UK. The Commission has written to the UK government giving it two months to comply with the EC's 'television without frontiers' directive or face court action. Brussels is considering sending similar letters to France, Italy, Belgium and Spain accusing them of various potential breaches of EC law. Italy, for example, is said to have ignored the obligation to separate advertising from normal programmes, while Spain has not implemented the legislation at all. The Commission is understood to be worried that the principle of a single 'passport' for satellite and cable TV broadcasters is being undermined by some EC countries' attempts to impose additional regulations on foreign broadcasters. National officials have replied that the original directive was confusing and ambiguous. They point out that all 12 member states were accused of breaching the directive when the Commission first threatened court action a year ago. The main complaint against Britain is that foreign satellite and cable broadcasters have to get a licence from the Independent Television Commission in the UK, even if they have already been authorised by another member state. But at the same time, companies transmitting to member states outside the UK do not have to comply with British law and, according to the Commission, could escape EC regulation. The directive, in force for two years, sets minimum standards on advertising and to protect children from broadcast pornography and violence. EC states can impose stricter standards on their broadcasters but cannot hamper cross-border TV services from other countries if they meet the minimum rules. Britain has also come under scrutiny from Brussels for granting a licence to the recently launched TNT &amp; Cartoon Network, a US-owned film and cartoon satellite channel. France, resisting the spread of US-made films and TV programmes across Europe, has outlawed TNT &amp; Cartoon Network. Belgium has followed suit. They believe it does not meet the EC requirement that broadcasters devote a majority of transmission time to 'European works'. Sky defences breached, Page 4</p>

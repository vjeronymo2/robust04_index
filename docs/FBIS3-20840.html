Alarming news has arrived from Montenegro that  the exchange rate in transactions between banks and businesses  is one German mark to 1.5 dinars.    Since mostly Serbian firms have been involved in grey hard  currency transactions, panic has spread in Montenegro that large  amounts of hard- currency would be taken out of the country.  Since the introduction of the new "yugodinar," the Albanians in  Kosovo have disregarded the official exchange rate of one dinar  to the German mark and demanded two to three dinars to one mark.    The spreading instability has raised the possibility of the  beginning of an end to the economic stabilization program.  Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic met hurriedly with the  Serbian and Montenegrin prime ministers and Dragoslav Avramovic,  architect of the program, who in the meantime had become  governor of the National Bank. They have decided that the  official exchange rate must be strictly enforced. They have also  agreed that high prices for utilities and services present a  threat to the anti-inflation measures and will therefore have to  be reduced.    Avramovic has still faith that the new dinar, called the  "avram," will maintain its value and that he will be able to  resist the pressure to print more money. Some people suspect  that the dinar has lost value because new money has been printed  out of fear of strikes, including a strike by workers at an arms  factory in Kragujevac. Street dealers, who for the time being  are engaged in smuggling cigarettes, say that they will soon  return to a more profitable business -- buying and selling  foreign currency in the black market.</p>

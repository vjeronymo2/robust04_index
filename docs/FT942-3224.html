			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (11): Soaring popularity - John Williamson reviews the facsimile market Thomas Cook Holidays, the long-haul arm of the giant travel company, makes extensive use of facsimile to service its network of 363 agents and communicate with numerous overseas hotel groups and representative offices. Like many other high volume users, the company has found that a value-added fax service - in this case, BT's 'FeatureFax' - can take the sweat out of getting its messages across. With an estimated 46bn pages of information sent and received in 1993, fax is now the world's most important text-based messaging technology. The popularity of the medium is based on its ability to handle a free mixture of handwritten or printed text, graphics and photo images. It also helps that terminals conform to a set of international standards to guarantee any-to-any message transmission, and that the operation of a fax machine requires only basic manual dexterity. According to an AT&amp;T estimate, 15 per cent of business telephone calls are now fax calls. In some respects, however, fax has become a victim of its own success. Traffic levels are now so high in some industries that people have to queue to use machines, and called numbers are often engaged. Manual fax operations can also be laborious for businesses which have to circulate the same information to hundreds or thousands of destinations and installing banks of additional fax machines and telephone lines to spread the load can be prohibitively expensive. Servicing a large fax mailing list and verifying the success of individual message delivery can be a logistical nightmare. Value added tax network operators offer a variety of solutions to the problems faced by businesses. 'Broadcast' fax involves users such as Thomas Cook sending a document with a distribution list to the operator's service centre. Computerised facilities then forward the document to servers controlling hundreds of fax machines which in turn transmit the document virtually simultaneously to all the intended recipients. This kind of service usually generates an individual header for each fax, automatically retries engaged numbers and provides a transmission record for the customer. Another value-added offering is 'store-and-forward,' with customers specifying the time of document delivery. This enables texts to be held over in a computer for transmission at off-peak call charging periods as well as delivery of individual messages at pre-arranged times. Both broadcast and store-and-forward fax save time and money, and release a user's fax machine to receive urgent incoming messages. Newer services include 'follow-me,' in which travelling business executives dial into a fax centre to have their messages re-routed to different locations; and fax-on-demand, in which information is retrieved from a database in fax form by callers using a telephone keypad to specify the type of information required. Fax recognition is similar but employs special software to interpret requests for information from marked-up standard forms or typed text. In Japan, a centre for innovative fax systems, personal fax retrieval services have been established for some time. In these systems, a caller uses a public fax machine to lodge a message in a numbered electronic mailbox for subsequent retrieval at any fax machine designated by the caller a correspondent. According to Vans Markets Europe, a continuously updated market research report by the UK's Ovum telecoms consultancy, the supply side of the European value-added fax market is characterised by the involvement of two distinct types of company - the public telecommunications operators (PTOs) and the niche suppliers. Ovum says the market leader in 1992 was Cable &amp; Wireless with an estimated 16 per cent share of the business. Other big suppliers in that year were AT&amp;T, whose EasyLink pioneered valued-added fax service in the region at the beginning of the decade, and BT, Onisourco, Italcable, France Cable at Hadio, Deutsche Telekom and Sprint. While the larger niche players operate their own X25 pocket data networks, their smaller counterparts rely on the public switched telephone network (PSTN), in some cases simply re-selling PTO services. The niche suppliers hail from a variety of backgrounds. Some, such as Vital and Graphnet, have their origins in data-coms and messaging. Others, such as Ascom and Comwave, started out as telecom equipment makers. In the short term, the commercial prospects for value added fax in the region look bright. Ovum estimates European service providers earned about Ecu36.3m in 1992 - a figure that is projected to grow twelve-fold to Ecu436m by 1997. The market has four main drivers: the present day ubiquity of fax machines; the relatively high price of 'smart' fax machines which replicate some of the services of the value-added operators; keen competition in the market; and the desire of large fax users to cut costs. However, high levels of growth are unlikely to be sustained indefinitely. A challenge to third party fax services is evident with X400 e-mail, already preferred by many multi-site users for internal communication. More serious competition will arrive in the form of integrated electronic messaging. An example is the addition of fax gateways to local area networks. Such technology eliminates the inefficiency of converting electronic output to paper before its electronic transmission over fax lines.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Frankfurt's future as a financial centre boosted: Kohler package will fill the regulatory gaps MR Horst Kohler, state secretary in the German ministry of finance, yesterday delivered what his government promised almost exactly a year ago: a package of concrete proposals to improve the standing of 'Finanzplatz Germany', Germany as a financial centre. 'This is a breakthrough for Finanzplatz Germany's international competitive position,' said Mr Kohler, 'and it should secure jobs and income in this fast-growing sector'. He acknowledged that the current regulatory environment in Germany is not up to international standards, to the detriment of the country's entire financial service sector. He spelt out the details of a new law which will introduce a centralised regulatory body for Germany's securities markets and make insider dealing a criminal offence for the first time. The draft law - likely to be on the statute books early next year - comes after 12 months of 'behind the scenes' negotiations between Bonn and the Lander which are currently responsible for policing financial markets on their turf. Bonn's broad aims were spelt out in a 'concept' paper written by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, last January. At the core of the proposals is the new supervisory body, to be called the Bundesamt fur das Wertpapierwesen. This will be a federal body, independent of existing banking regulators, which will employ at least 100 people. It is not yet decided where it will be based: market participants want it based in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, but it may end up in the eastern part of Germany for political reasons. The new body will be the German equivalent to the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, the powerful regulator of the US securities markets. It will represent Germany on the international stage in dialogue with other regulators. Within Germany, working together with the Lander and the country's eight stock exchanges, it will police the following three areas: The new anti-insider dealing law. Mr Kohler did not disclose a definition of this offence, but warned that penalties would be tough, ranging from fines to imprisonment. A set of new rules designed to encourage disclosure and transparency on the German equity markets. At present, German companies are only obliged to disclose stakes in other companies when they reach 25 per cent, in contrast to a 3 per cent threshhold in the UK. The disclosure threshhold will be lowered to 10 or possibly 5 per cent. This rule could have an important impact on German companies: secret stake-building is at present widespread. A set of 'rules of conduct' for participants in the securities markets. This will spell out in precise terms professionals' obligations to their clients. Professionals will be obliged to separate their own investments from those of their clients. The package of measures comes just after the founding of the Deutsche Borse AG, a common holding structure for Germany's fragmented stock-exchanges which came into being at the beginning of the year. Both moves show Germany's determination to intensify its challenge to London and other European financial centres, a determination shared by legislators as well as market participants. Once the new measures are implemented, they are are likely to enhance Frankfurt's standing in the eyes of international investors and lead to profound changes in the conduct of securities business at home.</p>

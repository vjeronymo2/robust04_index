Managers Have Difficulties in Acquiring the  Results of Outside Research    Technology transfer is discussed mostly in highly  abstract terms. Meanwhile, establishing viable connections  between enterprises in need of technology and institutions  engaged in research involves hard work and when contact is not  made, it is because of conflicting goals.    KARRIERE, 26 Nov 93. First the good news: the Federal  Republic, with its 20,000 industrial research enterprises, 102  industrial research consortia, over 300 colleges and vocational  colleges, 16 large-scale research facilities, 66 Max-Planck  Institutes and research groups, and 47 Fraunhofer Institutes,  remains as before a leading research post worldwide. German  basic research is the world's best.    The bad news is that much of what the German researchers in  all these institutes, laboratoria, and colleges develop and  invent goes to waste. Valuable results get covered with dust in  libraries without a follow-up with practical research and  development or product development. Cooperation between state  research facilities and economic management is very poor.    At the same time research-intensive sectors are going  through  a deeper than average crisis. Forces which once stimulated  growth are now becoming road blocks. Paul Krueger, Federal  Minister of Research, has recognized this and calls for an  "innovation initiative". His primary point of departure would be  improving the contacts between science and economic management.  Previous conferences, says Krueger, did not yield any concrete  results.    Apart from the political dialogue among a handful of top  managers who for years have kept in touch anyway, the question  arises as to what possibilities there are for R.&amp; D.  management  in enterprises to secure the transfer of know-how from science  to industrial practice. One obvious solution often resorted to  in the past is personnel transfer. The training of German  researchers is everywhere said to be excellent.    There is, however, a negative indicator: in 1992 there were  279,000 experts engaged full-time in R.&amp; D. and thus 17,500  fewer than in 1989. The trend is further downward. Christoph  Beckmann, Chair of Technology Management and Marketing professor  at the Technical College in Darmstadt, can explain this: "More  and more people are being trained, but the domestic economy  cannot absorb them." Thus while nominally budgets have  increased, even more than in proportion to the output, personnel  has not been enlarged. "Today two thirds of budgets for R.&amp;  D.  cover personnel costs."    Prof. Hans-Joachim Queisser, an internationally recognized  physicist at the Max-Planck Institute of Solid-State Research in  Stuttgart and long-time adviser to the Ministry of Research in  Bonn, is not any more able to place his science disciples in the  domestic economy. "Industry rather tries to let its people here  go. So does Siemens, which has handed over its entire  superconductor research to the Jena University."    So far 30 of the Queisser staff have gone to Japan. "Here  they do not have a chance, because European industry has given  up entire research areas. The Japanese meanwhile envy us our  sprouting talent and come running to drain it away."    There would still remain the possibility of short-term  personnel transfer, perhaps on a project basis. Dr. Roland Vogt  of the Bremen University, where a model experiment regarding  stimulation of technology transfer was initiated, had polled  college placement offices and found very few opportunities of  short-term transfer to business available to scientific workers  and college teachers. The appropriate assistance programs  offered in Bremen and in North Rhineland - Westphalia were found  to remain almost entirely unutilized.    While the direct personnel track is evidently not effective  enough, there would still remain the possibility of intensifying  the cooperation with research institutes. According to the data  supplied by the founding consortium, the national economy has in  1992 spent about 56.2 billion DM on R.&amp; D. in West Germany.  This  sum was split into 50 billion DM for domestic R.&amp; D. and 6.2  billion DM for outside research.    It is obvious to Queisser why R.&amp; D. managers, faced  with  heavy personnel costs, do not try harder to farm out their  research: "An industry which could utilize our research is  almost nonexistent in Germany. We have no industry which  produces personal computers, none which produces flat-panel  displays, and none which produces laser diodes for modern  compact-disk record players. The task of the Max-Planck  Institutes is to do basic research. And while these Institutes  would be partly financed by industry, there are not enough  possibilities of converting this kind of research into something  practical: "There are no industrial users in need of it."    Dr. Tom Sommerlatte, managing director of "Europe" at the  Arthur D. Little business consultants sees it otherwise: "The  Max-Planck Institutes are developing future technologies, but  have no way to communicate what products these will yield.  Enterprises then face the results of these developments with  amazement and not knowing what to do with them."    And within an enterprise, continues Sommerlatte, the same  barrier has to be overcome again: "Indeed, the R.&amp; D. manager  speaks the language of the Max- Planck Institute so that  marketing people and technologists can not understand one  another either." Today most enterprises, moreover, are run very  much on the cost efficiency track: "Employees therefore are  concerned more about their job security than about future  products."    Probably the best interaction of domestic and outside  scientific research has been achieved by managers of the  chemical industry. Some successes have also been achieved in  machine manufacture and processing technology. On the whole,  however, shortage of personnel makes it extremely difficult for  industry to keep being informed.    Prof. Erich Staudt, director of the Institute of Applied  Innovation Research at the Bochum University, asserts: "The  R.&amp;  D. departments lead their own lives almost completely insulated  from the outside world."    "This is particularly true of the R.&amp; D. workers in the  middle-class economy" adds Queisser: "They cannot even send  their people to attend lectures. Sessions on the subject of  transfer, once well attended, are today not being held any more.    Says Sommerlatte: "It would be important that our natural  scientists and technologists develop an understanding of  industrial management and ask themselves what products the  results of their research could yield." It is precisely from  this point where Martin Schaettgen, business manager of the  "Inno" Ltd in Karlsruhe, takes off. He advises research  institutions on the possibilities of their better cooperation  with industrial enterprises.    The problem, he agrees, lies essentially with the  researchers. "It is not easy for R.&amp; D. managers to make the  contact" suggests the adviser. "In Karlsruhe alone there are at  least 18 institutions which offer a technology transfer. Very  few good ones are among them. The national economy is  consequently confronted by a jumble of most diverse completely  unstructured information."    It is very expensive, says Schaettgen, to have an enterprise  itself set up such a transfer post of its own and to establish  contacts via patent data banks. The most serious problem  Schaettgen sees, however, in the great reluctance of researchers  to cooperate.    Says Schaettgen: "The manner in which a research project is  managed differs fundamentally from project management in  industry. The cost and time awareness is entirely different, as  is also the definition of a good result. To the R.&amp; D.  manager a  good result is a product which functions and is soon available  at an acceptable cost. From the researchers point of view, it is  a result which he or she can publish. The researcher is  recognition-oriented, the manager is result-oriented."</p>

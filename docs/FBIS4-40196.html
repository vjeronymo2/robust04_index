			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Blagoveshchensk [center of Amur Oblast], 14 Jun --  Boris Yeltsin is concerned that a region of such rich natural  potential as Amur Oblast should be living off subsidies from the  federal budget. The Russian president stated this today on his  arrival in Blagoveshchensk.    Replying to a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent,  Boris  Yeltsin said that the Amur Oblast administration chief had  visited him recently and they had put their heads together over  how to revitalize the region. The president said that one of  the aims of his trip to Amur Oblast and the Tuva Republic was to  study the potential of these regions with a view to identifying  measures to help extricate their economies from crisis.</p>

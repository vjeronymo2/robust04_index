In a letter UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Ghali received  yesterday, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said this  aircraft violated Iraq's airspace on 26 January and on 7, 15, 25  February, flying over vast Iraqi areas after which it left the  Iraqi airspace for its base in Saudi Arabia. He explained that  these four violations raised to 196 the number of violations by  this aircraft.    Al-Sahhaf added: While condemning and denouncing these  unjustified violations of our airspace, we stress the constant  Iraqi position that this aircraft is used for purposes other  than those specified by the Security Council and that its  activity harms Iraq's sovereignty and security.    Al-Sahhaf continued: We emphasize Iraq's constant request  for employing Iraqi means in the Special Commission's work  instead of foreign means in order to exclude the possibility of  using the latter for purposes that harm Iraq's sovereignty and  security. Your correct assessment of this aircraft's nature and  real task was published in THE NEW YORK TIMES on 16 November  1993, in which you said: I do not want a James Bond spy aircraft  at the United Nations. This assessment requires that the United  Nations should immediately reconsider the use of this aircraft  in violating Iraq's airspace in a way that conflicts with the UN  Charter's objectives and principles which call for respecting  the equality and sovereignty of all UN member states.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei turns positive as region falls back Index-linked buying by investment trusts lifted share prices and the Nikkei index closed higher for the first time in five days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average ended 75.80 to 20,037.90 after a low of 19,870.09 in the morning and a high of 20,075.81 in the afternoon. Selling by institutions and arbitrageurs depressed prices following an overnight fall in the Chicago futures market. Investment trust buying and small-lot purchases by foreign investors later absorbed the sales. The Topix index rose 0.49 to 1,614.91 but the Nikkei 300 fell 0.18 to 296.34. Gainers led losers by 553 to 467 with 163 issues unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.36 to 1,333.63. Volume was 360m shares, down from Wednesday's 425m, as most investors remained inactive ahead of today's end of the March account. Volatility on the bond market also kept investors away from stock investments. Mr Rod Smyth, strategist at Baring Securities, said that the situation now was similar to 1987, when Japanese bonds followed global bond markets down. Since cyclical shares outperformed the interest rate sensitive shares in 1987, he advised a move into cyclicals from financials. A rise in commodity prices, such as cotton and copper, supported textile and non-ferrous metal stocks. Nisshinbo Industries, a textile company, rose Y40 to Y1,120 and Fuji Spinning gained Y34 to Y564. Dowa Mining advanced Y16 to Y560 and Sumitomo Metal Mining Y13 to Y914. Fuji Heavy Industries, a financially troubled car manufacturer, was the day's most active issue rising Y12 to Y413. Mounting expectations of better earnings attracted investors, although some car makers lost ground on profit-taking, with Toyota Motor down Y10 to Y2,020 and Honda Motor losing Y10 to Y1,740. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 2.32 to 22,173.10 in volume of 194.6m shares. Roundup The pendulum swung back, mostly reflecting interest rate worries, bond market declines and profit-taking. HONG KONG took profits ahead of an expected rise in domestic interest rates today, the Hang Seng index ending 144.78, or 1.5 per cent lower at 9,320.75. Brokers said that many positions were futures-linked. Turnover shrank from HK8.15bn to HKDollars 7.01bn. The Jardine group stayed under pressure on its decision to delist from Hong Kong, the parent easing HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 48.25 while its affiliate, HK Land, lost 40 cents at HKDollars 21.40. Cheung Kong dropped HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 39; it showeda 56 per cent jump in 1993 net profit after the close. KUALA LUMPUR fell 1.6 per cent, giving back a good part of Wednesday's gains on renewed selling which reflected a new KLSE rule covering stockbroking firms, and the length of their clients' purchase positions. The KLSE composite index closed 16.43 lower at 983.52. KARACHI took a technical correction after rises for six consecutive sessions, and the KSE 100 index fell 38.74, or 1.5 per cent to 2,622.57. BOMBAY fell in low volume, still reeling under the impact of a ban on carry forward trade and a broker default, and worried further by the prospect that tainted shares involved in a two-year old securities scandal might be attached by the income tax authorities. The BSE index dropped another 45.35 to 3,681.47. NEW ZEALAND dropped mainly on a weaker domestic bond market, the NZSE-40 index closing 33.91 lower at 2,174.81. Telecom was the biggest loser on the day, down 19 cents to NZDollars 5.31, and brokers suggested profit-taking. Turnover was NZDollars 66m. AUSTRALIA, similarly, blamed the bond market, and subdued overseas equities as the All Ordinaries index closed 11.1 lowerat 2,169.8. Turnover was ADollars 627m.</p>

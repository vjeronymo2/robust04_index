			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Schoolmaster's majority frees his tongue - Some Budget musings from backbench sage Terence Higgins WITH A harsh UK recession that refuses to bend to the political cycle, and Tory MPs with small majorities beginning to sweat, these are testing times for backbench loyalists, even of the stature of Mr Terence Higgins. The dutiful, respected chairman of the Commons Treasury select committee is a barometer of backbench opinion amid the increasingly frenzied pre-election campaigning at Westminster. His standing makes any criticism of the government, and his suggestions for the Budget, all the more powerful. As MPs returned yesterday from the Christmas recess, he called on the government to inject a 'fiscal stimulus' into the economy by allowing local authorities to spend some of the receipts accumulated from the sale of council houses. Such steps have been advanced by the Labour party but Mr Higgins, a former Treasury minister, says it would have to be a strictly time-limited bonanza, through fear of jeopardising government control over expenditure when solid economic growth re-emerges. If there is scope for tax cuts in the Budget, he said Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, should raise allowances so fewer people pay tax - rather than a straight cut in the basic rate. The impact, he believes, would not be felt until after the election anyway. His pet argument is that the inadequacies of economic forecasting should mean Treasury ministers regularly using the Budget and the autumn statement for both expenditure and taxation decisions. Like ministers, he is cautious about the prospects for recovery but insists that it is underway. 'I think it is beginning to start now,' he said. An 18,500 majority, such as he holds at Worthing, certainly helps keep a cool head. But it is not in Mr Higgins's nature to be unduly rebellious or to court publicity. Respected by Labour and Tories alike for his seriousness and economic expertise, he knows that the damage inflicted by a political spat with the Treasury would be measured in votes. Mr Higgins's reputation at Westminster is for greyness, conscientiousness and a distaste for rocking the boat. He is not a politician's politician. Despite a low public profile, he has been tipped as the next Speaker of the Commons. Such a cautious, dutiful approach can only earn the respect of Mr John Major. It is not the only similarity. Both are acolytes of Mr Iain MacLeod, under whom Mr Higgins served in the early 1970s. Mr Higgins is a confidant of the prime minister and was an active member of his campaign team during the 1990 Tory election leadership. He describes himself as 'rightwing' on economic issues, 'more progressive' on social issues. The difference with Mr Major, which probably explains why he has not been offered a ministerial post under the new regime, is generational. Mr Higgins is 63 - although he displays the fitness of the former Olympic runner that he is. With beaked nose and triangular chin, he sometimes looks, colleagues on the Treasury select committee say, like an embarrassed schoolmaster controling recalcitrant children. The committee is known for its idiosyncratic membership, including adherents to almost every economic theory. He is a 'thoroughly decent chap,' said one MP. 'A more interesting person would do the job far less well,' said another. Committee reports have been critical of the Treasury. It warned of the dangers of recession well before ministers conceded the possibility and told them that it would be longer and deeper than they expected. Yet Mr Higgins likes his committee's reports to offer 'persuasive criticism'. He writes the first draft himself, and even after amendment they are often strongly his work. His consensus-itis irritates some colleagues. Mr Brian Sedgemore, maverick Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, has attacked him for not speeding its investigation into the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Mr Higgins insists that the timetable was agreed by the whole committee. The Commons select committee system is 'enormously close to my heart', he said. Set up under the government of Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1979, he said it might be her most lasting achievement. 'The Falklands war will recede into history, trade union reform may become embodied in our legal framework but hopefully we will still have a departmentally related select committee for many years to come.' He thinks carefully about the constitutional role of MPs, describing himself as a 'Burkeian' in which an MP is a representative, not a delegate of his constituency. Hence he can vote against capital punishment in spite of the almost certainly less inhibited views in his affluent, but sleepy, seaside constituency. His parliamentary longevity gives him an air of experience and level-headedness. Besides the Treasury committee, he also chairs the Commons liaison committee, which links all the departmental select committees. He also serves on the executive of the 1922 committee of backbench Conservatives. To get involved in murky world of modern electoral politics is, thus, perhaps somehow out of character. Hence he is believable when he says his concern about Budget measures is over the long-run impact on the economy. 'I don't see this in terms of the election at all,' he says.</p>

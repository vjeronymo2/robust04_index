			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN;  </P> <P> BURT'S TEAM MIGHT PLAY CATCH-UP TO OTHER SPORTS;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: NORTHRIDGE COACH STUCK PLAYING IN DIVISION II, BUT NCAA PLAN COULD  SERVE TO ELEVATE HIS PROGRAM'S STATUS.  </P> <P> For nearly two years, football has been the "but" end of the Cal State  Northridge athletic program.  </P> <P> "Beginning in the fall of 1990," it was said repeatedly, "Northridge will begin  competing at the NCAA Division I level in all sports but football . . ."  </P> <P> That situation could change within the next few years. Through no choice of its  own, Northridge may, in effect, be forced into Division I football.  </P> <P> At the NCAA's annual convention in January, delegates will consider a plan that  would require football-playing Division I schools to compete in that sport in  one of three classifications -- Division I-A, Division I-AA or the proposed  Division I-AAA.  </P> <P> Should such an arrangement be approved, it would force the Division II Western  Football Conference -- of which Northridge is a member -- to disband. Five of  the WFC's six members either are or will be competing in Division I by the fall  of 1991.  </P> <P> That would leave Northridge with five choices:  </P> <P> * Play Division I-A football (e.g., the Big West Conference).  </P> <P> * Play Division I-AA football (e.g., the Big Sky Conference).  </P> <P> * Enter Division I-AAA and play the equivalent of what is now NCAA Division III  football.  </P> <P> * Keep football as it is and return the rest of its teams to the Division II  level.  </P> <P> * Eliminate football.  </P> <P> The last three options are not considered viable by school officials. For  starters, Northridge would not qualify for Division I-AAA status because the  scholarship limit that has been proposed for that level is 20. A state-system  school such as Northridge likely would exceed funding for that number in  non-athletic financial aid alone.  </P> <P> "We couldn't live with that," said Bob Burt, CSUN football coach.  </P> <P> The same could be said for options four and five. Slinking back to Division II  would be a public-relations disaster and eliminating football altogether would  contradict the school's stated mission of keeping athletics on par with  burgeoning programs in fields such as business and engineering.  </P> <P> Stepping up to 1-A or 1-AA level would not be cheap. A bigger stadium and a  larger scholarship budget would be required.  </P> <P> Among NCAA stipulations for a Division I-A independent in football is that the  school play in a stadium with a capacity of at least 30,000. Northridge already  has plans for such a facility as part of its University Park expansion project.  </P> <P> That leaves a scholarship increase as the most substantial hurdle CSUN must  clear. Northridge has 24 athletic scholarships for football, which it slices,  dices and distributes -- usually in increments of $1,000 -- among about 70  players.  </P> <P> Counting other need-based financial aid, Northridge will distribute the  equivalent of about 35 scholarships for football this season. The NCAA maximum  for Division I-A is 95. In Division I-AA, it's 70.  </P> <P> However, if university presidents have their way -- and there is every  indication that they will -- scholarship levels in both Division I-A and I-AA  will be reduced at January's convention. The new Division I-A maximum is  expected to fall by 10 or 15. The Division I-AA limit may drop to as low as 50.  </P> <P> The formula for CSUN's competitiveness at a higher level is a simple one, Burt  said.  </P> <P> Scholarships plus stadium equals success. "If we have both of those, then I  think it's a very sensible move for our university to make," he said.  </P> <P> Burt imagines a Pacific 10 Conference school such as Stanford playing  Northridge in a modern 30,000-seat stadium filled to capacity.  </P> <P> "It's a growing process, but it can be done," he added, recalling that San Jose  State once defeated both Cal and Stanford in the same season. "If we had a  stadium and were consistently competing on a good level . . . You have to  envision the kinds of things that are possible here."  </P> <P> Until that happens, Burt says he will simply ignore the Division II label the  football program carries.  </P> <P> "When we line up to play (Cal State) Long Beach or (Cal State) Fullerton or  Northern Arizona it doesn't make a damned bit of difference what division we  are," Burt said. "If we beat them, fine. If we don't, well, that's not good  whether we're Division I or II.  </P> <P> "We're in a conference. We have a chance to go to a playoff. We have a  conference championship to shoot for. What division it's in doesn't matter."  </P></p>

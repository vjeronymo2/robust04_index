This has just been established by an  authoritative opinion poll. More than nine out of 10 people (92  percent) stated that this is why they are going to vote. The  competition among the various parties is still wide open,  however, because more than a third of the voters (33 percent)  have still not decided who is going to get their ballots. This  poll did not include partisan political questions--in contrast  to two others that show that the African National Congress (ANC)  is going to win by a wide margin. (Report below)    The poll, which was conducted by three American  institutions--the International Republican Institute, the  National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, and the  Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies--shows that most  South Africans fear political violence and crime. But the  enormous gulf that exists between the various population groups  is also evident from the survey, which consisted of a total of  2,352 interviews conducted throughout the country between 19  August and 26 September. Of these, 1,250 were conducted with  blacks, 301 with whites, 450 with coloreds, and 351 with  Indians. The homelands, self-governing regions, and rural areas  were included. Some of the results of the poll that was made  public this weekend include:     -  A total of 75 percent of the respondents said that  right-wing extremists are going to unleash a war in the  country;    -  Most South Africans are of the opinion that their lives  are going to improve after the election. Only 8 percent of  whites share this opinion as opposed to 73 percent of  blacks;    -  Most of the people who are hopeful about the future are  less well-off and a large majority of those who are under 35  years of age (59 percent). Less than half of the older people  are optimistic;    -  There are great differences between whites and  blacks in regard to 13 questions put to them. Of the 13  questions, the two groups agree on only one issue: that South  Africa's foreign trade is going to improve. Most blacks believe  that eight of the 13 problems will get better after the  election, as opposed to whites, who believe that the situation  in 12 of the 13 cases is going to get worse;    -  A full 80  percent--primarily blacks and whites--say they will "very  probably" vote, as opposed to Indians and coloreds, who are not  as eager;    -  The greatest concern is over political violence,  crime, and the economy. About one-third of the respondents said  that political violence is sometimes justified;    -  Men and women  differ a great deal on this issue, however. Some 72 percent of  women say there is never a justification for political violence  in contrast to 63 percent of men. For the most part, it is the  younger men who feel this way. There are significant differences  among blacks. Some 53 percent of Xhosas said that violence is  sometimes necessary, as opposed to only 18 percent of Zulus;    -  Black people are hopeful about the election in contrast to  the  feelings of whites that can be summed up as "anxious." Coloreds  are hopeful for the most part as well, while Indians' feelings  can best be summed up as "perplexed."    1    Question: How do see your life in the next few years?    Responses: Overall: Better 61%; worse 18%;  same 17%    Blacks: Better 73%; worse 10%; same 13%    Whites: Better 29%; worse 47%; same 21%    Coloreds: Better 57%; worse 16 %; same 23%    Asians: Better 49%; worse 23%; same 19%</p>

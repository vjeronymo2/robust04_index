"Cooperation is a two-way street," Woerner told a group of  journalists ahead of next week's North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation summit expected to define the alliance's relations  with its former Soviet bloc foes.    Woerner reiterated that NATO, which has agreed to bolster  military ties with Russia, was trying to support the democratic  and economic reform efforts of President Boris Yeltsin.    "He knows that, of course, cooperation with the West  requires  full respect for not only human rights domestically but also the  sovereignty and independence of neighbouring states," the NATO  chief said.    Concern about Russia's direction has heightened since the  suprisingly strong showing by ultra-nationalists in last months'  parliamentary elections. But NATO analysts said there were  worrying signs even before.    They cited Moscow's insistence on protecting  Russian-speaking  minorities abroad, its slowness in withdrawing troops from the  Baltic states and its drive to become the main peacekeeper in  the former Soviet republics.    Woerner said that while NATO wanted to cooperate with  Moscow,  its policy "to a certain extent is influenced by what happens in  Russia, by the substance and also by the language of those who  are responsible for policymaking."    The summit is expected to adopt a U.S. proposal that would  offer limited military cooperation with NATO's former Cold War  enemies but not the automatic promise of alliance membership.    Russia is strongly opposed to its one-time satellites  joining  NATO. Woerner reiterated that while Moscow would have no veto  over the alliance's decisions, its interests would have to be  considered.    "We have to satisfy the security needs of the countries of  Central and East Europe and we have to build a Euro-Atlantic  Community which does not exclude, but includes Russia," he said.    "This can be done in a carefully measured evolution over  time."</p>

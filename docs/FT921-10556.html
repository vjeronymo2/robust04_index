			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Steel deal worries German industry GERMAN industry and stock markets expressed disappointment yesterday at the 6.35 per cent pay award for steelworkers as the implications of the pay deal announced on Monday sank in. Economists warned that the Bundesbank would keep monetary policy tight, while the country's leading steelmaker, Thyssen Stahl, said the deal would cost the company DM100m (Pounds 34.7m) this year. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the powerful IG Metall union, deepened the depression with a declaration that the settlement would act as a 'guideline' for his 4m engineering members, negotiations on whose pay starts next month. Mr Hans Karl Schneider, chairman of the group of independent economic advisers to the government known as the 'five wise men', said the steel industry would find it very hard to live with the result. Rationalisation and job losses would follow. The IfW world economic institute in Kiel claimed the Bundesbank would respond with 'a restrictive monetary policy'. However, no changes in interest rates are expected at tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting; the Lombard and discount rates were raised by an unexpectedly high half a point in December. In Munich, the Ifo institute said the steel settlement was too high, though it would not tip the economy into recession. A lower pay deal would have made it simpler for the central bank to ease policy later in the year. It expected no further monetary tightening, however. Most economic forecasts for this year have been based partly on the assumption that pay awards would average 5.5 per cent. The weekend bargain, reached after steelworkers voted overwhelmingly for strike action, suggests employers will have to dig deeper. The steel package comprised an all-round 5.9 per cent increase and a one-off payment of DM175. In the light of the deal and Mr Steinkuhler's stance, assumptions on pay increases have been increased to 6 per cent. The Dax stock market index fell 12.61 yesterday and closed at the day's low of 1,674.6. Motor manufacturers, while relieved that a strike had been avoided and that steel deliveries would continue, were concerned that the 5.9 per cent basic award should not apply to the engineering sector. Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, head of the metalworking industries' trade association, said wages had to be related more closely to productivity.

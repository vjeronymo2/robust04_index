			<p>BFN     [Text] Tyre, Lebanon, June 3 (AFP) -- A Hizballah  guerrilla was killed and a Fijian peacekeeper wounded in a  pre-dawn clash Friday in south Lebanon, the spokesman of the UN  Interim Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL] said.    The fighting broke out when Hizballah guerrillas refused to  have their vehicles searched for weapons at a Fijian checkpoint  in the Tyre region near Israel's self-declared "security zone"  in south Lebanon, Timor Goksel told reporters.    Shooting broke out during which a Hizballah guerrilla was  killed and a Fijian soldier wounded, he added.    Sporadic gunfire also targeted three other Fijian positions  in the Tyre region but there were no casualties, the spokesman  said. [passage omitted]</p>

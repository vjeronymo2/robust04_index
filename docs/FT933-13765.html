			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / 'Leak' warning on data transfer THE INLAND Revenue Staff Federation is to write to the 50 largest UK companies warning them that the imminent transfer of 40m computer records to the private sector could result in leaks of confidential information. The campaign follows this week's warning from Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, that new laws were needed to tackle the established black market in personal financial and credit data held on computers. Mr Clive Brooke, the general secretary of the IRSF tax inspectors' union, said that the protection of personal data on state computers was not being addressed by the government in its plans to contract out Whitehall work. He will warn companies that the safety of computer files held by the Revenue  -and 'highly secure due to Civil Service standards and traditions' - cannot be guaranteed once the government awards a 10-year contract for its computer operations to one of two US bidders. 'The contract will mean the transfer of 40m computer records on UK companies, firms, partnerships and individual taxpayers' records away from the civil service and into the private sector,' he said. There was not even a guarantee that the files or processing would remain in Britain. The information technology division, which employs 2,700 staff, is the largest division to be contracted out within the Revenue. Mr Brooke said that civil service standards have up to now been effective in protecting of the confidentiality of computer files. Only 'occasional' inadvertent slips by temporary staff had resulted in leaks of information such as Mr Norman Lamont's credit card details from the National Westminster Bank. Several companies due to receive the warning from the IRSF yesterday indicated that they were confident that the right safeguards would be implemented by the company that won the contract.

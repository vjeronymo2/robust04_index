			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / SNP debates economy THE Scottish National Party yesterday used its annual conference at Perth to tell the government: 'We told you so.' Ms Fiona Hyslop, one of the party's Treasury team, said that when sterling entered the European exchange rate mechanism two years ago, the SNP said its value had been set too high and would destabilise the ERM. Speaking in an emergency resolution condemning the government's economic policy, she accused the Conservatives of having no economic policy. 'It is important that economic policy should be done by design, not by accident,' she added. She said the SNP was the only party that had consistently called for devaluation in the past few months. Delegates passed a resolution calling for a separate Scottish exchequer and minister of finance at the Scottish Office to operate a separate economic policy for Scotland. The emergency resolution also condemned the Labour party for giving 'wholehearted support' to government policies. Mr Iain Lawson, SNP industrial spokesman, blamed the Scots themselves for their economic difficulties. He accused Scots of having a 'Bugs Bunny mentality'. 'Whenever anybody dangles the carrot of an easy option in front of the Scots, we go chasing for that carrot,' he explained. He blamed Scots for having lost control of Scotland's natural resources. Mr Lawson said opponents had mocked arguments that a Scottish pound would be more secure than sterling and that Scotland's export-led economy had no balance of payments deficit. 'We have managed to lose our oil, our gas, our steel industry, our mining industry,' he said. 'Anything of any value in our country has been systematically ripped out and moved south.' Delegates also passed a resolution calling for a reform of pension law to prevent a repetition of the Maxwell pensions scandal. It proposed changes including prohibiting employers borrowing from occupational pension funds, providing for employee and independent representation on pension boards, and obliging employers to obtain the consent of employees before taking contributions 'holidays'.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Russia's teetering MMM slashes fund price Russia's MMM share fund teetered on the edge of oblivion yesterday as it slashed the redemption price of its shares from the last quote of Rbs115,000 (Pounds 37) to Rbs1,000, sending investors streaming into Moscow's commodities exchange in desperate attempts to sell their paper. In the early evening an estimated 25,000 angry shareholders gathered round MMM's headquarters in a dowdy Moscow suburb. They blocked off the multi-lane Varshavskoye Chaussee and attacked the policemen guarding the building. Riot police were in reserve, in and around the building, but were not deployed. Mr Sergei Mavrodi, MMM's elusive head, issued a written statement in the early afternoon saying the price cut was temporary and that 'in two or three months the price will return to Rbs100,000 or more. We are simply taking economic measures to force shareholders to wait and hold on to the shares for two or three months'. Mr Mavrodi, in the anti-authoritarian style he has adopted in recent days, blamed the government for the plight of the fund and the 10m citizens he claims as shareholders (other estimates put the number at 2m-5m). The Russian government has recently questioned MMM's solvency. Mr Mavrodi said: 'We've been stopped on the eve of a super breakthrough, after which Russia could have become the richest country in the world and Russians - MMM shareholders - wealthy people.' He said that allegations made by the finance ministry and tax inspectorate that MMM was a classic 'pyramid scheme', in which the purchases of new shareholders fund the profits of the old until expansion stops, were 'absolutely false'. The crowds around the MMM headquarters were generally phlegmatic before the evening outburst. Most of their anger appeared to be directed more at the government than at MMM, which they were reluctant to blame. Mr Mavrodi's statement referred to the 'panic' created by the government a week ago, when it first issued warnings about the scheme. In the conditions created by the statements, 'it is useless to continue buying shares back from the shareholders . . . it can only lead to the bankruptcy of the company,' the statement said. However, the company's press office said that 32 of its sales points in Moscow were working yesterday, buying shares at Rbs950 and selling at Rbs1,000. On the street, the buying price stood at around Rbs6,000 and selling price at around Rbs10,000. The company's apparent collapse, after months of Russia's biggest television advertising campaign, has revealed huge gaps in securities and investor protection law. But the authorities were also unwilling or unable to use what law exists, or to issue warnings until the fund had millions of shareholders. Many of these say they have invested much of their savings in what has turned out to be Russia's latest false dream. The affair has not yet affected the currency market, where the rouble has remained stable against the dollar for some days. The Possessed, Page 9</p>

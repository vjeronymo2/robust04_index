			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / People: Labour leader in the shires The shire counties of England and Wales now have a Labour chief. Dennis Pettitt was yesterday elected leader of the Association of County Councils, by the councillors who took office in last month's electoral landslide against the Conservatives. Pettitt is the only Labour party member ever to have held the post, which he also held briefly between 1988 and 1989 when no party had overall control of the ACC. A 67-year-old, and leader of Nottinghamshire county council since 1979, Pettitt is likely to use the weight of his experience to build more co-operation between the local government associations, and also present more coherent alternatives to the central government. He can be expected to play down the sharp divisions with the Association of District Councils, revealed by the reorganisation of boundaries by Sir John Banham's Local Government Commission, in favour of a more coherent front. Pettitt is a Birmingham man by birth, and spent 10 years in East Africa, working in the lift industry, before settling in Nottinghamshire. His deputy, who had been seen as a potential rival for the post, will be Josie Farrington, 52, a Lancashire county councillor since 1977. Also a Labour representative, she is president of the Council of Europe committee for culture, education and media, and is working on establishing a local radio station in Croatia. Farrington was Labour's candidate in the Ribble Valley by-election of 1991.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FADE TO BLACK  </P> <P> For the TV viewers who prefer to see the classic movies in black-and-white, the  solution is very simple. Just turn the color knob on your TV set to the extreme  off position. Presto, instant black and white! I tried it the other night on a  colorized classic and it worked great.  </P> <P> Randolph C.

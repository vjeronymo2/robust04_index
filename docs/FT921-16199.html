			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Rome extends Hanoi aid ITALY, the first EC country to drop a US-led trade embargo against Vietnam, said yesterday Rome would give Hanoi Dollars 70m (Pounds 38.4m) in new grants and soft loans for 1993 and 1994, Reuter reports from Hanoi. Mr Gianni de Michelis, Italy's foreign minister, said at the end of a one-day visit to Hanoi that the aid, which follows Dollars 140m granted to Vietnam in 1990-1992, would be used mostly to develop telecommunications and electricity. 'We are opening the way, paving the way for the other European countries,' Mr de Michelis said. 'We thought the time was ripe for changing the European position.' In December 1989 Italy broke ranks with other western countries by offering Vietnam the Dollars 140m aid package.</p>

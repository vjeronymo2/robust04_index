			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (25): 'Without Lloyd's, all this would have gone' - Despite recent losses, a Scottish landowner will continue to be a Name, as he struggles to keep up his family home / Serious Riches WHERE THE river Girvan bends along the three-mile drive up to Blairquhan castle in the Scottish Lowlands, you catch the first glimpse of the stone Tudor mansion on its fern-green perch. Sheep graze at the foot of the castle's drawing room, and, from inside the calm of its Thai silk-covered walls, you watch the Girvan winding its way between the gentle hills and into the woods. The beauty is not entirely down to nature but to the energies of the Hunter Blair family, which has lived in Ayrshire since the 12th century. Sir David Hunter Blair commissioned both the construction of the neo-Tudor castle and the diversion of the Girvan as part of a redesign of the landscape in the early 1800s. His great great grandson, Jamie Hunter Blair, estate manager, Lloyd's Name, chairman of the Historic Houses Association in Scotland, vice-chairman of the Scottish Historic Buildings Trust, former Christie's agent and 'eligible bachelor', has inherited this 'pile', which is the source of his wealth yet also threatens to sap it. Like many of those who still retain their family seat, he feels like one of an endangered species. 'To keep a place like this, you have to be seriously rich, and most people are not; which is why these historic houses are going at such a rate,' says Hunter Blair. Four of the eight most important historic houses in south Ayrshire are for sale, he says, and have been on the market for at least a year while their condition deteriorates. 'The HHA (this month) is publishing a survey of what's happened in the last three years to all the houses that have been sold and it's very depressing reading, because once they have been sold, and fall out of the family's hands, they tend to get sold again and again.' Hunter Blair's inheritance includes a maintenance fund for Blairquhan castle and its 500 acres of parkland. The fund was valued at over Pounds 390,000 after the death of his father, Sir James Hunter Blair, in 1985. 'The income is barely enough to keep one gardener going, and so far we've resisted the temptation to use the capital,' says Hunter Blair, who believes the government is short-sighted in its policy towards preserving Britain's historic homes. Maintenance funds are trust funds dedicated to the benefit of, and repairs to, a heritage property. Although they are free of inheritance tax, they attract income and capital gains tax. For several years, the HHA has argued that they should be exempt from both. Sir David acquired the original castle and land as a result of his father's successful Edinburgh banking career and fortuitous marriage. Hunter Blair's own flirtation with banking was not a success. After taking a degree in history at Oxford, he went, at his father's suggestion, to what is now Hill Samuel. After two years, the bank called him in and asked him whether he really thought his future was in banking. He then went to learn about estate management on an estate owned by the Duke of Buccleuch, Britain's largest landowner, and has been involved in managing the family estate ever since. Hunter Blair estimates that it costs roughly Pounds 100,000 to keep the house going every year. The maintenance trust is one way of helping towards the costs, but the traditional activities of farming, forestry and letting farms are no longer the solution. Hunter Blair 'lost more money than you would believe' in farming. 'All that was left was the chance to have income from visitors,' he says. The estate has six holiday cottages, which are booked for up to six months in advance. From such small but encouraging signs, the decision was made to hire out the castle itself for income. There has been a shift away from chasing rich Americans towards corporate hospitality, which Hunter Blair has found to be a more reliable form of income. Companies which use the house for conferences include Scottish Enterprise, Caledonian Paper and BPCC, the printing company. Under the terms of the maintenance fund, the house is open to the public for 25 days a year, but the amount raised is tiny - only Pounds 2,846 last year - while the income from hiring out the house last year was Pounds 66,418. How is the shortfall made up? 'In the past, Lloyd's has been a very great help in bridging the gap between income and expenditure,' said Hunter Blair, who has been a Name since 1959. 'In the good old days we were doing very well.' Lloyd's provided a reliable and valuable flow of income - Pounds 17,000 in 1971, Pounds 26,000 in 1980 and Pounds 56,000 in 1989. However, Hunter Blair suffered losses of Pounds 71,000 in 1991 and Pounds 56,000 last year, and he expects his reserves to be cleared out this year. He is far from bitter, and has no intention of leaving Lloyd's. 'I'm still very grateful to Lloyd's, and I believe my agents when they say things are going to improve. Without Lloyd's this place would have gone,' he said. The losses have had an impact on his own portfolio, managed by Murray Johnstone. Three to four years ago, the portfolio stood at Pounds 350,000; it is now down to Pounds 225,000, of which the Lloyd's deposit element is Pounds 175,000. Murray Johnstone has put the maximum investment each year into personal equity plans, which it runs as an integral part of the portfolio. The Pep portfolio itself stands at Pounds 50,000. Hunter Blair, who says he has never had much aptitude for, or interest in, money, has been happy to leave investment decisions to Murray Johnstone. The only time he intervened was to suggest buying shares in Christie's, the auction house, for which he used to be the Ayrshire representative for many years. 'It's the only time I've suggested anything to them. They kept saying they aren't low enough, but since they've bought them, they've done very well,' he says. 'The other thing I've got is that my grandmother very kindly left me a big trust,' says Hunter Blair, who is the life income tenant of the trust, which is also managed by Murray Johnstone and is worth about Pounds 500,000. It is invested in blue-chip companies such as General Electric, British Aerospace, BTR and British Gas. Three or four years ago a small percentage of the fund was put into the income shares of split-capital investment trusts, such as Jos Holdings, to meet the need for additional income. Most of the fund is invested in the UK, though there is a holding in the Pacific rim through Murray Johnstone's own Scottish Asian fund. Hunter Blair shared his father's love of art, and the two built up a collection over 30 years of Scottish colourists, including works by Cadell and Peploe. Some of the paintings have increased 100-fold in value. 'They were bought because we liked them, and the capital appreciation has been an unlooked for bonus,' says Hunter Blair. Other investments included a number of with-profits endowment policies from Equitable Life, which matured two years ago when Hunter Blair was 65 years old. There are debts: the estate has run up an overdraft over the years of Pounds 190,000. 'You'll never really get enough for a place like this. But you just have to keep trying.' He has some life insurance but no pension to speak of since, as he readily admits, he does not need one thanks to his grandmother's trust: 'If I didn't have this place, I'd be frightfully well-off, wouldn't I?'</p>

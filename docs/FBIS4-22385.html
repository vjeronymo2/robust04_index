			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olha Burda: "Piemonte May Indeed Not Be...Where </F> They Have Found It"]    [Text] Donetsk--In opening the pages of POST-POSTUP  to a debate occasioned by the article of Mariya Kara  (POST-POSTUP No. 6, 1994) "Piemonte Appears Not To Be Where They  Were Looking for It. It Appears That the Fate of the State Will  Be Decided in These Elections by East Ukrainian Pragmatism," the  editorial office considers it necessary to comment on the  articles published. Having read the article of our Donetsk  correspondent Olha Burda on the electoral prospects of the  Donbass, which is published below, we did not notice any  particular differences between the views of journalists from  Lvov and Donetsk on the situation in the Donbass. Incidentally,  Mariya Kara wrote her article after a lengthy assignment to  Donetsk and Lugansk Oblasts. Apparently the debate was brought  on by the title of Mariya Kara's article, which maintains that  in these elections the fate of the state will be decided by East  Ukrainian pragmatism. In putting this judgment at the beginning  of the article, the editorial office has deliberately proceeded  to switch that which is desirable for that which is real because  it still firmly insists that pro-Russian separatism in that  region may only be overcome by East Ukrainian pragmatism. It may  be too weak yet, but for now no alternative to it is  apparent.    It might be that from the beautiful "far-away" Halychyna it  is indeed easier to see the colors with which the steppes of  Donetsk shine and play. It might also be that precisely due to  its geographic remoteness it is not quite visible that the  Donbass is primarily a much more politically aggressive Donetsk  area over which a new dawn, most likely that of a red color yet  again, will break at any minute. It appears very much as if this  region--whose votes brought in Kravchuk for Ukraine and which  has helped to form the "group of 239"--has not learned anything  anyway, even from its own mistakes. This means that the Donetsk  area has a great many prerequisites for arriving at the new  parliament on the old Red wagon.    So, about the prerequisites. During the blissful time of  stagnation, the Communist Party organization of Donetsk Oblast  was inferior only to those of Moscow and Leningrad in terms of  numerical strength. Even without joining the imeni Comrade  Symonenko Communist Party of Ukraine, the faithful "Leninists"  have not disappeared. At present they live here and win  victories here--by numerical strength, involvement, discipline,  and communist solidarity. Reared by the totalitarian system in  the spirit of boundless obedience, they will certainly come to  the elections and give their votes in favor of a system under  which they had a life and plenty of food and even drink.  Likewise, we should not ignore the fact that the Donetsk area is  the "richest" in retirees. While for the most part utterly  apolitical, they will, after standing in overnight lines for  their retirement benefits, turn out for the elections, after  all, in order to pragmatically vote...certainly, not for an idea  but for the past with the 12 ruble retirement benefits,  degrading but stable and delivered to their homes by the state.    Unlike the young people of Halychyna, who are patriotically  aware, those in the Donetsk area will simply ignore the next  election. It is precisely to the apolitical stance and the  "I-don't-give-a-damn" attitudes of old and young people that an  oblast referendum which nobody needs apart from Boldyrevs and  Gurevychs and a handful of state officials is geared--the  referendum on the need to introduce in the territory of Donetsk  Oblast and the entire Ukraine the state Russian language along  with Ukrainian and to have Ukraine sign the CIS Statute as a  full-fledged rather than associate member, as well as on the  feasibility of the federal-land arrangement in Ukraine.    Now about the candidates. If we turn to preelection  statistics, it is hard not to notice that out of 562 candidates  for deputies, 52 are members of the Communist Party of Ukraine  and 30 are members of the Socialist Party of Ukraine. However,  this is not yet all, because one can have communist views  without carrying a party membership card in one's pocket. An  analysis of the composition of deputies in just one district by  Valentyna Protsenko, chairman of the regional organization of  the People's Rukh of Ukraine, testifies to this quite  convincingly. In addition to two documented communists and one  socialist, the following are running among 14 of her opponents:  the former first secretary of the Krasnoarmeysk City Committee  of the Communist Party, Vasyl Sapunov, a former employee of the  city committee and rayon committee of the party, Oleksandr  Denisov, attorney Volodymyr Loban and Prosecutor Leonid  Zakharov, who defended and improved the socialist system, and  the former leader of the Youth Communist League of the highest  rank, Volodymyr Butko, who have been nominated by voters and  labor collectives. The independent Yuriy Kotov comes out with an  openly communist program, whereas leaders of the Independent  Trade Union of Miners engage in propaganda for the former party  organizer from the imeni Stakhanov Mine, Volodymyr Ivanov, whom  they themselves not so long ago evicted from his party suites.  So, the communists are not sitting idly by. Petro Symonenko  himself, having moved for the preelection period to the rural  Krasnoarmeyskiy District, is confidently forging the future  victory. He has a good team of kolkhoz and rural council  chairmen who intimidate people conditioned in the spirit of  boundless trust and respect for the bosses with the horrors the  Rukh people will commit on coming to power. The prospect of a  sausage shortage and a lack of opportunity to steal even a liter  of milk from a kolkhoz cow is the most effective. Thus, in the  future elections the principle that brought Kravchuk to power  will work (especially in rural areas): "The lower strata follow  the top echelons," that is, the people will vote for the bosses'  candidate.    Readers of POST-POSTUP know enough about the activities of  the current and (which is quite possible) future pragmatists  from the Donbass--acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy,  Deputy Prime Minister V. Landik, and Chairman of the State Coal  Industry Association M. Surhay--in order not to attach to these  activities particular hopes for the revival of Ukraine.  Seventy-four candidates representing local councils and  executive structures and 14 former people's deputies who are  running yet again and whose chances are good inspire little  optimism on this score. After all, yet another principle can  work on which a different segment of the Donbass electorate has  already elected Kravchuk at one point--"They already have work  experience" (for now, it is not important what kind of  experience). The pragmatism of the Donbass rises to its heights  in the position of the candidate from the Labor Party, Mykola  Azarov, who, not concealing his sympathy for Zhirinovskiy,  stated somewhat simply on television that "the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] should be judged by its actions  rather than its words." It would be good if after such "actions"  someone is still around to judge.    There also are pragmatists of a new type, a small group of  entrepreneurs, on the candidate lists. The proletariat of  Donetsk is burning with class hatred for some of them, who have  gone into business for a short time in order to flee "after  reigning for their own 100 rubles-worth." Another segment, those  who have gone in whole hog and for a long time to come and can  see well beyond their own noses, provokes hatred from another  social stratum and risks being shot, as very recently did  Valeriy Slyusarev, an entrepreneur from Artem who has invested a  fortune in his unfortunate countrymen. In Torez, a person was  shot who was supposed to be the campaign agent of entrepreneur  Valeriy Nazarov, a candidate for deputy. Although the future  indeed belongs to new honest pragmatists, such as Oleksandr  Opryshenko (president of the public joint-stock company  Medita-Ukrayina), Petro Tsekhmister (director of the Kamyanka  Shakhtarska private mine), and Stanislav Melnyk (director of the  RDK Helso), for now they are too few to influence the overall  picture of elections in the Donbass, even if they are elected.    As we try to see the color of the future dawn over the  steppes of Donetsk, we should know the colors of candidates from  the GKU [Civic Congress of Ukraine], the Slavic Unity Party, the  Peasant Party of Ukraine, and the Labor Congress of Ukraine, to  say nothing about the socialists-communists. The main point is  not to overestimate, after all, the ability of the Donbass  electorate to learn from its mistakes, because regular polling  of the residents of Khartsyzsk by a sociological group (over  several weeks) has not given grounds for optimism: One-third of  the voters will give their votes to communists. Consequently,  "although the people of the Donbass are not Korean, they are  intimidated by the Rukh people, democrats, and nationalists to  such a degree that for another 30 years they will not want to  live like people and will firmly stay on the path of Lenin."</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / When the centre does not hold: Russia's military action in Chechnya threatens its own insecure democracy, says John Lloyd President Boris Yeltsin presents the Russian military intervention in Chechnya as a simple affair. It is the taming of a rebellious republic that is unequivocally a part of the Russian Federation. General Dzhokar Dudayev's election as Chechen president in the autumn of 1991 was illegal; he has since declared an illegal independence; he has ignored all Russian legislation; groups of paramilitaries have been armed who have no right under Russian law to bear them; he has in the past few weeks called his nation to war against Russia. These acts are sufficient in any state to justify intervention. In Chechnya, they are compounded by allegations of organised criminals freely operating on Chechen territory, the diversion of vast amounts of oil, the non-payment of any taxes, drugs smuggling, arms trading and civil strife. Mr Boris Fyodorov, former deputy prime minister and leader of the Liberal Democratic Union, one of the few liberal politicians who supports Mr Yeltsin's order to intervene, puts it more succinctly than the president has yet managed to do: 'I look at it this way  - Chechnya is part of Russia: in Chechnya the constitution and the laws of Russia are not enforced; in Chechnya, for the past three years, illegal armed groups have threatened and kill Russians. In the light of these facts, the central authorities must, sooner or later, re-establish order.' Most of Russia's liberal reformers and democrats have not seen it that way. The two main liberal parties, Russia's Choice and Yabloko, are violently against military action (though with some dissent among members). Mr Yuri Kalmykov, the liberal-leaning Justice Minister  - himself from a North Caucasian people, the Cherkessians  - resigned because of an early disagreement with the course of policy towards Chechnya. Mr Leonid Smiryagin, a presidential adviser, is also threatening resignation. Most of the liberal press is against the president's policy (though there are splits here too, dividing the newspapers). These liberals do not, in the main, support Chechen independence: instead, they fear for Russian democracy. For Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of Russia's Choice; for Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of Yabloko; for Mr Otto Latsis, Russia's leading liberal columnist; for Mr Sergei Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma's (lower house) defence committee, the threat is clear: it is of an authoritarianism that bases itself on the need to prepare the country for war against its enemies. Mr Yavlinsky, with a talent for the striking phrase, puts it thus: 'If the country is drawn into a protracted war, the national-patriotic forces will become the regime's natural base.' Already Mr Yavlinsky's warning carries evident force. The major party in the Duma supporting the president is Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party. Mr Yeltsin is enjoying vocal support from old and bitter foes from the days when he was seen as the leader of the democrats, such as Mr Alexander Nevzorov, the rightwing nationalist TV star. Increasing pressure is being put on the media  - whose approaches have been diverse, in some instances courageous and probing over the Chechen affair  - to conform. Pressure is especially strong on the independent NTV channel, owned by the Most financial group whose head, Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, has already been the target of a raid by Mr Yeltsin's private guards. The dwindling band of radicals in the government met last Thursday to discuss the progress of reform and, inevitably, Chechnya. It included Mr Anatoly Chubais, the first deputy prime minister, and Mr Sergei Vasiliev, deputy economics minister. While they oppose the intervention on political grounds, they also see it as a disaster for the economic reform process. Rbs1,000bn has already been promised to revive the republic's economy, and the cost of the military operation is already running into the hundreds of billions of roubles. More seriously, they fear that the military budget will almost certainly be greatly increased as a reward to the army for fighting a dirty war in the Caucasus. Power has already drifted away from the parliament and ministers towards Mr Yeltsin's bloated administration since his deliberate humiliation of the cabinet after the crash of the rouble in November. It is now moving further into the circle of ministers, aides and advisers who take a tough line on Chechnya and much else. Most of the important decisions are taken by the Security Council, which liberal commentators routinely liken to the Communist party politburo that ruled the former Soviet Union. It includes the ministers of defence and interior affairs as well as the director of the Federal Intelligence Committee. Its secretary, Mr Oleg Lobov, is a tough conservative close to Mr Yeltsin for many years. The man Mr Yeltsin has chosen to be in day-to-day charge of the Chechnya issue, Mr Nikolai Yegorov, a former chief administrator of the Krasnodar region, is in a similar mould. The liberal figures in the administration are isolated. Mr Chubais, nominally joint number two in the cabinet, is fighting a lonely and exhausting battle to keep economic reform on the rails and cannot involve himself on Chechnya. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, chose to resign from Russia's Choice when it criticised the president's policy on Chechnya and has since defended it in forceful terms. Mr Sergei Kovalev, Mr Yeltsin's special representative for human rights  - who flew to Chechnya to negotiate with General Dudayev over the weekend at the time when an attack was most likely  - has strongly criticised Mr Yeltsin. With declining influence, he may soon have no job. But it is not a simple matter of liberals against conservatives. The liberal critics have been joined by military figures who do not have a liberal reputation, such as General Boris Gromov, the last Soviet commander in Afghanistan and deputy defence minister, and General Alexander Lebed, the commander of the 14th Army in Transdnestria, the Russian-speaking part of Moldova. On the ground in Chechnya, General Ivan Babichev, commander of a motorised division, refused to advance to Grozny in the face of civilian opposition. TV interviews, including Russian ones, have presented officers and ordinary soldiers openly questioning the need for the intervention and even expressing their determination not to fight. But if the army begins to divide over such issues, it may soon begin to take sides in Russia's political quarrels. Mr Fyodorov taunts his liberal colleagues with having nothing to suggest to address the theat to the state's integrity that Chechnya presents. However, the use of force could provoke a long and murderous anti-Russian war in Chechnya and perhaps further afield  - with the Russians being seen as anti-Moslem, the religion of most of the Chechens. With some 18m Moslems in Russia, that would pose even greater threats to the country's territorial integrity. Mr Yeltsin, in moving to safeguard his state's integrity, has threatened it further. He has made many mistakes: he moved very late; he shifted from neglect of the situation to violent threats with nothing between; and he clumsily sought to use the Chechen opposition as Russian proxies. However, he and Russia may be facing an intractable problem  - that of a member republic of the federation that in no circumstances will give up the independence it claims. It is not yet clear what comes after force.</p>

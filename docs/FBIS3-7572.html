In reply,  Hosokawa denied the report, saying: "It was a complete surprise  to me. I am greatly annoyed by that report." When asked about  the current situation in which many reports have been circulated  on the issue of forming a new party, Hosokawa said, "I cannot  answer the question because I am devoted entirely to official  business."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wg: "Horizontal Drilling and `Frac' at Nearly </F> 5,000 Meters' Depth"]    [Text] Celle--For the first time in Germany, the technology  of horizontal drilling, combined with multiple hydraulic  fracturing of deposit rock at a depth of almost 5,000 meters is  being used for a natural gas drilling project. As reported by  Mobil Erdgas-Erdoel GmbH, the operator for a consortium, work is  beginning in the next few days on the Soehlingen Z-10 project in  northern Lower Saxony, in the vicinity of Rotenburg (Wuemme).    The goal of this technically innovative, expensive method is  profitably to exploit a natural gas deposit with extremely thick  rock and correspondingly low penetrability. In the event the  project should be successful, this combination of two techniques  would open up new prospects for natural gas exploitation in  Germany.    At the Soehlingen gas field a 1,000-meter-long horizontal  stretch is being drilled and equipped with pipe at a depth of  4,800 meters in the approximately 100-meter-thick main sand of  the new red conglomerate geological formation. Along this  stretch, at intervals of 200 meters, vertical, about  15-millimeter wide cracks will be produced. They are made by  squeezing in a special fluid under extremely high pressure  ("multiple hydraulic fracturing").    The cracks stretch in elliptical form about 200 meters  horizontally and 100 meters vertically into the rock at the  deposit. In order for the cracks not to close up again after  this so-called "frac" treatment, high-tensile ceramic sand is  pressed in along with the fluid, which remains as support in the  cracks and keeps them permanently open.    The combination of horizontal drilling process and multiple  fracturing of the rock is to produce clearly better "drainage"  and thus enable satisfactory production rates. Horizontal  drilling and "frac" methods are basically known techniques, but  what is new is their combined application based on a difficult  initial situation, which is marked by great depth, high  pressures, and temperatures as well as the extremely low  penetrability of the rock.    Heavy drilling equipment from Itag Tiefbohr GmbH is being  used, with a special drive unit. The bore hole will be a total  of 6,100 meters deep. The drilling time is expected to be about  six months. The subsequent work operations will take another one  and a half months.    With the new combination of techniques, the companies  involved--BEB Erdgas and Erdoel GmbH (30 percent), RWE-DEA AG  (30 percent), Wintershall AG (10 percent) and Mobil  Erdgas-Erdoel GmbH as drilling and mining operators (30  percent)--expect profitably to develop a large proportion of the  already proven natural gas content in the deposit.</p>

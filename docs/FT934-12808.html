			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: High prices are strangling energy-intensive UK manufacturing Sir, Both Michael Smith in his article 'Fears of more pit closures increase', and the Leader 'Cutting Coal' (both October 19) failed to make the important connection between the predicament of the coal industry and the unique and untested electricity market structure that the government imposed when electricity was privatised. As is well known, there is a growing surplus of coal-fired electricity generation capacity. The marginal cost of base-load electricity generation on this capacity is less than 1.5p/kwh, yet new generation capacity costing about 2.8p/kwh is being approved, built and prospering within the 'market'. How is this possible? By exercising their dominant market power within a highly artificial market structure National Power and PowerGen have been able to raise electricity prices far in excess of costs, thus creating headroom for the construction of electricity generation plant using natural gas - the cheapest form of new generation plant. As a consequence, the UK's asset of large efficient coal-fired power stations fuelled by increasingly competitive UK coal is now being squandered, and energy-intensive manufacturing industry is being strangulated by high electricity prices which have increased by up to 70 per cent since electricity was privatised. It is truly demoralising to see how slowly the government is acting to rectify these self-inflicted wounds - particularly at a time when economic recovery appears to be faltering and there are severe problems with the balance of trade and the public sector borrowing requirement. It has taken two years of intensive lobbying by large electricity consumers for the Department of Trade and Industry even to acknowledge that there is a problem; and it seems increasingly likely that the government will rely on Offer to refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission as its agent in effecting a solution. If this were to happen, it is likely to be mid-1995 at the earliest before any material changes will emerge, by which time the manufacturing base will have been further debilitated, and few coal mines will be left in production. The government has the power to act now in the national interest to arrest the artificial decline in the use of coal for electricity generation, and to reform the electricity market so that the declining costs of coal in efficient base-load stations are reflected in internationally competitive prices to electricity-intensive manufacturing industry. In essence these were the recommendations of the trade and industry select committee in its report of January 1993, which was largely ignored by the government. Now that the adverse consequences for the coal industry and electricity consumers are clearer we can only hope that the government will listen and act.

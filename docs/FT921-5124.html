			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Forth Ports set to raise Pounds 35m THE GOVERNMENT is ex-pected to raise Pounds 35m through the Stock Exchange flotation of Forth Ports Authority, the trust port operator on the Firth of Forth. The share offer for the port - the seventh biggest in the UK in terms of the volume of cargo handled - will open on March 12 and close on March 18. The sale is the only public flotation so far in the privatisation of the trust ports. It was boosted this week by the decision of the Scottish Office to negotiate a lease on a Pounds 35m building in Leith, the port of Edinburgh, which will be developed on port land by a subsidiary of Forth Ports. Some 1,400 civil servants will move to a 290,000 sq ft building from New St Andrew's House in the centre of Edinburgh, which has been found to contain asbestos. The Scottish secretary and top civil servants will remain in nearby St Andrew's House. Forth Ports operates the ports of Leith, Grangemouth, Burntisland, Kirkcaldy, Methil and Granton. Much of its activity involves chemicals and crude oil. Turnover last year was a record Pounds 32.4m. The directors of Forth Ports decided to attempt a flotation to ensure its management team remained intact, something which might have been threatened if it had been privatised. The government, which gave its permission in January, will take the proceeds. Last year Forth Ports made pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.6m. With the capital reconstruction, which involves converting current cash balances into gearing of 34 per cent, the company would have had pro forma results of Pounds 6.2m pre-tax profits, earnings per 50p share of 13.42p and net assets of Pounds 32.7m. The directors see prospects for growth from a generally stable level of activity, although turnover will fall this year because of a decline in orders for British Pipe Coaters, which treats pipes at Leith. British Linen Bank, the merchant banking arm of Bank of Scotland, is offering 27m 50p ordinary shares likely to be priced at about Pounds 1.30 each. A further 3m shares, making 10 per cent of the company, will be reserved for employees.</p>

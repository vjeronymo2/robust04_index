			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Arts (Openings): Lucerne The Lucerne Festival has broken off some of the shackles of convention since Matthias Bamert became director in 1992. This year's programme, starting on Wednesday, includes a 70th birthday tribute to avant-garde Swiss composer Klaus Huber, a street-music festival and a series of events breaking the rules of traditional concert form. But the festival's main attraction - next to its beautiful lakeside setting - continues to be its enviable line-up of front-rank orchestras, conductors and soloists.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Central American presidents agreed to present a  common front at the upcoming Ibero-American summit to be held  13-14 June in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. This was stated on  Monday by Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro upon her return  from Costa Rica where she attended President Jose Maria  Figueres' inauguration.    The five Central American presidents, taking advantage of  their presence in San Jose, held a mini-summit in which they  also agreed to continue with the integration process. President  Chamorro also highlighted the importance of consolidating  democracy in our countries and she said that Costa Rica is an  example of democracy in the world. To consolidate democracy,  President Chamorro stressed, peace and understanding must be  achieved by all Nicaraguans. Farmers must be able to plant their  crops, she said. Chamorro added that an army and a police force  are necessary to protect citizens.    When questioned on an ultimatum issued by the U.S.  Government  to Nicaragua to solve the property problem, President Chamorro  said: I do not think it is an ultimatum, rather I believe it is  a cutback in aid to all nations so that the U.S. can asses their  respective situations. She added that she does not accept  pressures from any government, but she acknowledged that the  property problem must be resolved. For this, however,  cooperation is needed from citizens occupying homes that do not  belong to them, she noted.</p>

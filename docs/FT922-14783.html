			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Keynes here, how can I help you?: The election is over - a new prime minister has formed a coalition. But who will advise him how to pull Britain's economy out of the mire? He dials a long-forgotten number . . Lord Skidelsky, biographer of Keynes, overhears the conversation PRIME MINISTER: Can you hear me? John Maynard Keynes: I can hear you perfectly; the difficulty may lie in you hearing me. PM: No doubt your mind has been on other things since you . . . er . . . left us. JMK: We have an excellent newspaper service up here. The Financial Times is delivered every day. PM: Well, then, what am I to do? JMK: I thought you would ask me that. I do not envy you your task. You would not be in your present pickle had your predecessors used the telephone more frequently. PM: I must tell you that many people down here blame you for what you call 'our pickle'. You taught us that governments could always spend their way out of depressions. We tried to do that. As a result we got high unemployment and rising prices at the same time. JMK: I left you with an organised method for thinking about particular problems, not a machine for blind - or political - manipulation] PM: It's always the politicians who get blamed . . . JMK: The economists have been just as bad. They thought you could do everything by demand, and completely neglected supply. PM: But you told them that] JMK: Nonsense. You have obviously never read my General Theory. I taught that when there is heavy unemployment, an increase in spending can raise output and employment. But how the increase is divided between higher output and higher prices depends on supply conditions - the state of the labour market and the amount of capacity. I made certain assumptions about these things, which were perfectly valid in the 1930s. Only a lunatic, or someone whose common sense had been destroyed by econometrics, could suppose that these conditions would stay the same. If, for example, wage increases absorb the profit potential of expansion, you will simply get a rise in prices. PM: But you were well known to be indifferent to inflation. JMK: Wrong. I taught that capitalism requires stable prices, and that the future will not be like the past. Had you remembered these two things you would have been able to apply my theory properly. PM: I am not blaming you. But we must start from where we are now. JMK: Where you are now is that unemployment is approaching 3m and prices are still rising by 4 per cent a year. You have lost control over your interest rates and your exchange rate, the world economy is on its back, and your budget deficit is set to have inflation roaring away again. PM: Thank you . . . JMK: You made the fatal mistake of joining the European Exchange Rate mechanism before you had got your costs under control; exactly the mistake Churchill made when he put Britain back on the gold standard in 1925 - a decision I opposed. Fixing your exchange rate may be convenient; it should never be used to force wage adjustment. Any attempt to do so will always cause a fixed exchange rate system to break down. PM: Does that means that we will have to devalue? JMK: Some general realignment is probably inevitable. I have always believed that you have got to do the best you can in the situation in which you find yourself. So I will take the existing external constraint as given - just as I accepted the fact of the gold standard. You have made one good decision. PM: What is that? JMK: You have formed a National Government. That was only sensible in the conditions of a hung parliament. But it is also essential for what has to be done. PM: Which is . . .? JMK: The first thing you must do is to knock out inflation. It is the continuing rise in wages and prices which makes the expansion of demand such a risky business. A policy aimed at reversing a fall in prices, such as I recommended in the 1920s and 1930s, cannot achieve its effect if prices are rising. So you have got to say frankly to the trade unions: 'There is no hope of a sustainable recovery in output and employment unless inflation is brought down to zero and kept there. Either we can intensify unemployment through a policy of high interest rates. This will eventually slow the rate of increase in money wages, and thus in the cost of living. This has been the policy pursued over the last three years. But it is a hateful and wasteful policy, and brings no guarantee of improved employment. Or we can try to secure, by agreement, a one-year freeze on wages and salaries, followed by a year of severe restraint. It should take two years to achieve stable prices. The choice is yours. Can we agree a National Treaty to achieve this?' PM: Suppose this could be done, and the policy works. How would you stop wage pressure from building up again in year three? JMK: Believe me, it is much easier to keep inflation at zero than to bring it down to zero. Except in abnormal conditions, inflationary wage pressure is always induced by inflationary expectations. Eliminate the inflation, and you stop the wage-push. I predict that the first country in Europe to get its inflation rate down to zero will be able to keep it there. But of course, I would use the technique of the National Treaty to try to secure all kinds of improvements in the machinery of wage-bargaining. And you should certainly be prepared to put up taxes if prices showed a tendency to rise. PM: Of course, if it could be done . . . JMK: The beauty of the scheme is that if you could get inflation down to zero, Britain would be poised to regain the financial leadership of Europe. Sterling would replace, or at least join, the Deutschmark as the anchor currency of Europe. You would regain control over your own interest rates. The balance of forces in Europe would be entirely different. Here is a robust national response both to those who run to the Bundesbank to protect them against the alleged rapacity of the British worker, and to those who whine about German monetary imperialism. As you see, all my old patriotism stirs when I contemplate the decadence of the British capitalist class. PM: What can I offer the unions in return? JMK: First, a national commitment to eliminate inflation, backed by the authority of a National Government, would have an extremely favourable effect on business expectations. In the breathing space afforded by the wage freeze certain measures can be taken to expand demand, in addition to those already in the pipeline. There is some scope for an old-fashioned public works programme which would employ unskilled labour at a wage only moderately in excess of the current dole. My rough calculation is that 500,000 could be taken off the unemployment register fairly quickly, at very moderate cost, and without any risk of inflation. Incidentally, you should persuade your Labour colleagues to abandon the silly idea of a minimum wage, which is nothing but a tax on employment. In the long run you will have to put right the catastrophic failure in your system of education and training, unless 10 per cent of the working population are to be permanently forced to scrounge for a living, and the rest confined to a level of performance well below their capacity. PM: But is there not a limit to how much a country can do for itself? As you said, the world economy is flat on its back. We need an international recovery to get our exports going again. JMK: There I agree with you. Since the war the capitalistic system has been kept going by heavy armaments expenditure and the endless stimulation of wants by advertising and easy credit. The first factor is now coming to an end, and the second is highly fickle. Indeed, consumption demand has become almost as psychological as investment demand. Not only does this make the system even more unstable than it was in my day, but it has been obvious for two decades now that these artificial devices have been unable to maintain anything like full employment in the developed countries, except in moments of excitement. However, you now have a heaven-sent opportunity to revive the animal spirits of entrepreneurs. PM: What do you mean? JMK: Think back to the 19th century. A major source of demand for capital goods came through the opening up of new lands, with their requirements for transport systems, port and harbour facilities, agricultural machinery, energy, and so on. By the end of the 19th century this frontier had closed, and the Great Depression was in large measure a consequence of this closure. That is to say, the stock of capital goods had increased relatively to the demand for them, so that their marginal efficiency fell. Now the frontier has re-opened. PM: I do not follow you. JMK: I am referring to the collapse of Communism. The larger part of the capital stock of the former Soviet Union was built up to satisfy the demands of the military, regardless of cost and efficiency. It cannot be converted to peacetime uses, whether for export or private domestic consumption. No increase in agricultural production is possible if they go on designing tractors like tanks. The capital stock is mostly obsolete. Technically speaking, the real demand for capital for the purpose of producing for private consumption has risen enormously relative to its supply. But for the foreseeable future much of the new capital equipment will have to be imported from the West, and Russia cannot pay, since it has nothing to export in return. Russia will not be able to borrow from bankers or private investors for some time to come. The risk is too great. The situation offers an unparalleled opportunity to jolt the Western world out of depression by re-equipping the former Soviet Union, entrenching the new world order by strengthening free institutions there, and in the long run producing a permanent expansion in world trade. But you must start by artificial assistance on a substantial scale, and trust the business will run itself afterwards. PM: What is to be done? JMK: The experts are talking about IMF quotas, stabilisation loans, balance of payments support, humanitarian aid, and so forth. Something much more imaginative is needed. I propose that a consortium of the G7 countries grant the former Soviet Union and its satellites a credit of about Dollars 100bn per year for two years, the money to be expended on purchases of capital goods from the donors, in agreed proportions, to promote agricultural production, and the renovation of their transport system and factories, with the purpose of relieving immediate hardship, and encouraging export later. The great attraction of this scheme is that it would set up an external demand on the capital goods industries of the West which would allow a simultaneous expansion of exports, the counterpart of which would be the import surpluses of the former Soviet system. It is the same combination of self-interest and altruism which inspired the Marshall Plan. Had the West lifted its sights and done this in 1922, as I proposed, the whole of the Bolshevik nonsense could have been avoided. Instead all they could talk about was Tsarist debts. You must not fail a second time. PM: You have given me considerable food for thought. JMK: I wanted to tell you about my vision of the good life. But that will have to wait. I have an appointment with my beloved Paracelsus. After that I leave for a galaxy many billions of light years away. We have had to impose direct rule on a planet there: they have been much more incompetent than you are. So you see, I am as busy as ever. But to be alive up here is very heaven] Lord Skidelsky is Professor of Political Economy at Warwick University.

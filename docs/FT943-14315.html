			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Building optimism marred Doubts about the strength of the housing market recovery are clouding an otherwise positive picture of improving prospects for the construction industry, the latest quarterly survey from the Building Employers Confederation shows. The survey, published yesterday, raises concerns about employment in the industry, with evidence of emerging skills shortages, in spite of the large number of job losses in the recession. The report shows increasing confidence of growth in the next year among a rising number of companies. A significant proportion of companies expect to employ more people over the next few months. It also indicates an upturn in the level of construction activity in the second quarter of this year, with more companies working at a higher level of capacity than in the first quarter. More than one-third of companies reported increased output in the second quarter  - the highest proportion since the second quarter of 1989. The upward trend of inquiries about new work was confined almost entirely to the private sector, however, as public sector inquiries for new schools and hospitals fell in comparison with the first three months of this year. Sir Brian Hill, BEC president, said: 'If the present uncertainties in the housing market reflect consumer confidence in the economy as a whole, this is indeed worrying.' He expressed concern about shortages of skilled workers, particularly bricklayers and carpenters. 'We have a major task ahead of us in stepping up training and also attracting back into our industry some of the many skilled people who have left it,' he said.</p>

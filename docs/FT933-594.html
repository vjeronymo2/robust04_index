			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Cavallo lifts capital market hopes - The implications of Argentina's pensions reform ARGENTINA'S pensions reform, which the senate approved last week, could eventually channel Dollars 3bn a year into local financial markets. The approval is an important victory for economy minister Mr Domingo Cavallo in his battle to modernise the economy. The reform is aimed at revitalising the financial system, as well as improving pension benefits and reducing the cost to the state of its pay-as-you-go pension scheme. One US banker said: 'For the first time, we can think about creating a local capital market. For the first time in many years, companies will get access to long-term local capital, which reduces dependence on foreign capital.' The new system, partially modelled on Chile's private pension scheme, offers contributors a choice between opening individual retirement savings accounts managed by private companies, or remaining in the state-run system. In addition, the state will continue to provide a basic pension for all contributors. This basic pension will be funded out of payroll taxes and fixed percentages of value-added and income taxes. Employers will pay 16 per cent of wages to fund the basic state pension, two percentage points less than at present. The reduction is aimed at making corporate Argentina more competitive. Employees will pay 11 per cent of wages either to privately managed funds or to the state fund managed by Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), the country's biggest commercial bank. Employees presently pay 13 per cent of wages into the government social security system. Baring Securities of the UK estimates that private pension systems will hold assets of Dollars 30bn by the end of the century. A maximum of 50 per cent of assets can be held in equities or government securities while up to 40 per cent can be invested in corporate debt or bank certificates of deposit. Baring expects fund managers to begin investing towards the end of 1994, with cash flowing mainly to fixed income rather than equity investments. The private system will be supervised by a government regulator. Independent credit rating agencies will monitor each fund's portfolios. Administrators will also contribute to several emergency and reserve funds. The government believes it can finance its continuing commitment to pensioners covered by the old state-run system by cracking down on social security evasion, which is estimated to be running close to 50 per cent of contributions. The pension reform is one of Argentina's most radical and controversial economic changes. There is a deeply-rooted belief among politicians that pensions should not be used to profit the private sector and should remain with the government. As a result, BNA has to provide pensions with a government-guaranteed dollar-linked yield. BNA is also exempt from the 1.5 per cent commission charged by private fund managers, who claim that this will make it difficult to compete with the BNA-run scheme. However, foreign bankers believe that the state sector's reputation for inefficiency will push plenty of potential clients towards the private sector. There is concern that the guaranteed yield on the state scheme would represent a significant financial liability in the event of a currency devaluation. The government plans to alter this requirement when it draws up detailed regulations.</p>

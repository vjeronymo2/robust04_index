			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TORRES CALLS FOR RENEWED WAR ON GANGS IN EAST L.A.  </P> <P> Flanked by mothers who have lost sons to gang violence, state Sen. Art Torres  on Thursday called for more money and resources to combat rising gang activity  in East Los Angeles, where gang experts predict that as many as 30 homicides  could occur this year, compared to none in 1988.  </P> <P> The Democratic lawmaker, in whose district the largely impoverished and  unincorporated Eastside is located, blamed the increased gang activity on the  diversion of federal, state and local funds and resources to other gang hot  spots, principally South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But Torres, careful not to stir up the race question when it comes to gangs,  did not ask that the resources, which have gone to largely black sections of  South-Central Los Angeles, be returned to the Eastside. Instead, he asked for a  parity on how moneys are spent.  </P> <P> "It's like the homeowner who has a leaky roof or a washing machine that doesn't  work," he said. "What do you fix first? East Los Angeles is in a crisis with  gangs."  </P> <P> Torres pointed out that about $4.4 million in gang-prevention funds have been  allocated since 1982 to South-Central Los Angeles, while the Eastside has  received roughly half that amount.  </P> <P> That point was emotionally driven home by members of Concerned Parents, a group  formed 16 years ago as a support group for Eastside residents who have lost  sons and daughters to gang violence.  </P> <P> "When I read my son's letters when he was in the Marines, I still cry," said  Margaret Gomez, whose 38-year-old son, Sam Chavez, was killed in a drive-by  shooting early this year.  </P> <P> "I miss the hugs."  </P> <P> East Los Angeles has been a traditional breeding ground for Chicano gangs, with  some groups tracing their beginnings to the 1920s and 1930s. When gang-related  homicides in East Los Angeles reached what was then considered an all-time high  -- 24 in 1978 -- increased resources and moneys turned the tide to the point  where no homicides were reported two years ago.  </P> <P> Today, with cocaine-fueled gang activity virtually out of control elsewhere,  much of anti-gang agencies' resources have been diverted. For example, the  intervention staff of Community Youth Gang Services in the Eastside was cut in  1988 from 11 to two, partly because it was believed that the area's problem was  solved.  </P> <P> But last year, 11 gang homicides were recorded in the area -- generally bounded  by Indiana Avenue on the west, the San Bernardino Freeway on the north,  Atlantic Boulevard and Garfield Avenue on the east and the Santa Ana Freeway on  the south.  </P> <P> So far this year, 18 gang-related killings have occurred in East Los Angeles.  An estimated 260 gang-related killings have been recorded in the city of Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Torres called on private corporations as well Los Angeles County, the Los  Angeles Unified School District, the state and other public agencies to finance  gang-prevention efforts and parenting programs to fight growing gang violence.  He praised the parenting program offered by the Soledad Enrichment Action  program, financed by Catholic Charities, as a good way to help parents steer  sons and daughters from gangs.  </P> <P> He also said he would introduce a measure in January that would set aside 5  cents from each sale of a gun in California for gang-suppression purposes.  </P> <P> Experts in the gang-prevention field said it was not clear whether a diversion  of resources back to East Los Angeles is a good idea since some positive  results in South-Central Los Angeles have been reported.  </P> <P> Steve Valdivia, executive director of the East Los Angeles-based Community  Youth Gang Services, said increased intervention by his agency in two areas  targeted by the Los Angeles Police Department -- the 77th Street and southeast  patrol areas -- has produced a 40% drop in gang-related homicides in the last  year.  </P> <P> "The embers were going in East L.A. but the fire was raging in South-Central,  so we moved," Valdivia said. "I'm not wanting to make the same mistake (by  going back to the Eastside). The numbers will come back once we leave.  </P> <P> "I've taken a lot of flak in East L.A., believe me."  </P></p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fiat sees recovery after record L1,800bn loss Fiat, the vehicle and industrial group, yesterday issued preliminary figures for 1993 pointing to one of the biggest annual losses in Italian corporate history. However, Mr Gianni Agnelli, the chairman forecast that the group would break even in the current year. Buffeted by the steep decline in demand for cars and the heavy costs of servicing its growing borrowings, the company is set to report a net loss of about L1,800bn (Dollars 1.06bn) when full figures are released in May. The scale of the setback, marking the first consolidated loss for the group in its 95-year history, virtually rules out a dividend payment on its ordinary shares. In an interview late last year, Mr Agnelli, chairman, said he hoped it would be possible to pay holders of the group's non-voting savings stock, but indicated he would not recommend a dividend for ordinary shares. Fiat's pre-tax loss would have been about L2,000bn but for the sale of its 47 per cent stake in La Rinascente, the big retailing group. The disposal created a gain of L500bn, reducing the loss to about L1,500bn. However, after taxation on profitable operations, the net group loss will be about L1,800bn for 1993. In spite of being 'at the lowest point of the crisis, both for the company and the country', the chairman forecast the recovery. The bullish prediction has been based partly on strong demand for its new Punto small car, unveiled in November. About 200,000 Puntos have been ordered so far, with about a third of the demand coming from abroad. Fiat confirmed its commitment to its ambitious investment programme, noting that about L9,000bn - 16.8 per cent of sales - had been spent on fixed assets and research and development in 1993. Overall sales, adjusted for the Rinascente disposal, fell by 1.7 per cent to L53,700bn. Group debt rose to about L5,500bn on December 31, from L4,466bn at the end of 1992. However, the total would have been far higher had it not been for the group's big rights issue announced in September. Fiat gave no breakdown for losses in individual sectors, which will not be revealed until later this year. In making the bullish forecast, the group indicated there would be no large asset disposals, implying that the recovery would come from the group's core car and truck operations, currently its heaviest loss-makers. Turnover in cars, Fiat's biggest single source of revenue, fell by 11.3 per cent to L24,350bn last year, while sales of trucks dropped by 11.5 per cent to L7,120bn. Fiat SpA, the parent company, which derives its income from dividend payments from its subsidiaries, is expected to report a modest profit of between L50bn and L100bn for 1993, against earnings of L507bn in 1992.</p>

The briefing told correspondents about  details of the detention of five terrorists on the eve of 2  February near the Kazan cathedral.    In the words of head of the service department's division  against terrorism Aleksandr Kuznetsov, the detained, some of  whom participated in the October 1993 events in Moscow, prepared  an armed attack at a Petersburg police station. The attack was  expected to seize arms to be later used in an attempt upon the  life of Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak and an attack at the  Moscow government house. The information is taken from  materials of the Petersburg counter-intelligence service.    According to mass media reports, the individuals were  detained right after their attack at the sentry-box of the Zarya  scientific-production amalgamation, where they seized five  revolvers and 2,000 cartridges.    Kuznetsov did not comment on political hidden motives of the  terrorists' actions in the interests of the investigation.  However, he said intentions of the group, whose youngest member  is 39 years old and the oldest is 47, were serious.</p>

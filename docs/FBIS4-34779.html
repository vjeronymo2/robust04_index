			<p>BFN     [Text] The march planned by the Association of Young  People's Power of Haiti [AJEPOPOA] has been canceled. The march  against the embargo, which should have taken place today, 23  June, will not occur. AJEPOPOA Secretary General Jude L.  Jean-Jacques justified his decision to cancel the demonstration  citing the discovery of a plot hatched by diplomatic mission  members in Port-au-Prince.    [Begin Jean-Jacques recording, in Creole] Those teams have  decided to create mass confusion. They are even considering  dropping explosives on this occasion and creating panic in  several areas of the capital. We are taking this opportunity to  denounce it and say that this plan will not work. [end recording]</p>

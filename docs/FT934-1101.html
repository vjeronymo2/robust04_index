			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BTR expands battery side with Dollars 21.4m acquisition BTR, the industrial conglomerate, has acquired the US Industrial Batteries business of Gates Energy Products for Dollars 21.4m (Pounds 14m). The business is a market leader in pure lead battery technology used in maintenance-free standby batteries for the data processing and telecommunications industries. It has annual sales of about Dollars 33m and employs 400 people at its manufacturing plant in Warrensburg, Missouri. The deal marks a further withdrawal from the batteries market for Gates Energy which earlier this year sold its nickel-based rechargeable battery business to Ralston Purina's Eveready Battery company. Five years ago BTR's subsidiary, Hawker Batteries, bought Gates Energy's plant in the UK. Yesterday Mr John Richardson, head of BTR's batteries group, said he expected the pure lead battery technology, developed and patented by Gates, to give BTR a long-term competitive edge. The acquisition is the second recent US purchase by BTR. Earlier this month it announced the agreed Dollars 820m purchase of Rexnord, an industrial manufacturer based in Milwaukee.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (14): No longer a Cinderella sector - Mass storage devices Mass storage has always been something of a poor relation to other, higher profile forms of information technology, but the arrival of the CD-Rom (compact optical disk with a read-only memory) has improved its status. Now, with the advent of multimedia - the latest technology which incorporates text, graphics, sound and video - the CD Rom is set to come into its own. Multimedia needs huge quantities of fast, cheap mass storage, something CD Rom can provide. The CD-Rom combines a high capacity for data storage with reasonable (and improving) data retrieval times, reasonable writing speed and a cheap platform for publishable data. Compact disc technology is now well known through the wide use of the laser-based CD players found in most hi-fi systems, which use the same basic digital data storage system. Two of the three types of CD-ROMs will affect the development of multimedia. The first is the read-only CD-Rom. This is an increasingly popular form for applications for both consumer and business to business users. Those applications can include general business packages, such as word processing, spreadsheet and databases. Here CD-Roms are far more cost-effective and convenient than floppy disks. One CD-Rom has space for several programs, whereas anything up to 20 floppy disks may be needed to carry instructions for one program. Program installation is therefore easier, and the disks have enough space to provide demonstrations of other programs so users can experiment. If they decide to buy the application, the supplier will give them the information to unlock the rest of the program. CD-Roms are also useful for publishing databases and companies such as Microsoft have not been slow to see the information and education possibilities. Encyclopedias, reference works and art collections are just three areas now available on database. The second CD-Rom to affect multimedia is the magneto-optical rewritable disk. This is similar to the magnetic floppy and hard disk, as data can be written and rewritten on it. Its advantages are again a high capacity and low cost but its slow writing and reading speeds compare unfavourably with magnetic disks. The technology is continuously being improved. Drives for the popular 5.25 inch diameter disks are now being replaced by drive units capable of running cheaper and smaller 3.5 inch disks. Furthermore, access times to the stored data are now down to 300 milliseconds and below, and manufacturers are moving the digital signal processing from 16-bits to 32-bits, which will improve the access times and data throughput. Double-speed drive units now transfer data at 1.2 Megabytes a second, but the quad-speed units currently being developed should bring this up to around 4.8 Mbytes/sec. Because CD technology combines high storage capacity and high data transfer rates with low unit costs, it is particularly suitable for use with graphics-based applications such video imaging and animation, which are integral to multi media but need large storage capacity. A single, whole-screen four-colour video image can take up as much as 2 Mbytes of space if uncompressed. so the storage needed for a typical video clip makes the standard magnetic disk an expensive solution. Other forms of mass storage will still be used for other existing areas. Magnetic media in the form of both floppy and hard disks continue to dominate the online storage marketplace, while tape drives, particularly the Digital Audio Tape are making inroads into the data archiving market. As multimedia evolves beyond its origins in entertainment and education, it is likely to change the way we think about and use data. Developing this technology will need huge amounts of data in a cheap, accessible and reliable form. For storage capacity, access speeds and cost, the compact disk in all its forms seems unlikely to be equalled for some time.</p>

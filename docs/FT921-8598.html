			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Receiver in last ditch effort to fly Compass THE receiver of Compass, the failed Australian domestic airline, Mr Ian Ferrier, announced what appeared to be a last ditch effort to get the company flying again. Mr Ferrier told a Sydney press conference that another fledgling local airline, Southern Cross, was negotiating to take a 75 per cent stake in Compass and inject about ADollars 60m (Pounds 25m). He has given Southern Cross two weeks to cement a deal. The airline crashed into receivership late last year, stranding about 125,000 holiday season ticket holders. Mr Ferrier has estimated Compass is facing a ADollars 171m deficiency in funds if it is liquidated and a ADollars 45.2m deficiency as a going concern. The difference largely reflects the company's liability to ticket holders and aircraft lessors.</p>

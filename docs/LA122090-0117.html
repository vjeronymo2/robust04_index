			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> CITY TO HELP FUND WATER SUPPLY STUDY  </P> <P> The city of Port Hueneme agreed Wednesday to contribute $31,500 to a water  pipeline study to make sure the city receives its rightful share of any state  water piped to Ventura County.  </P> <P> The United Water Conservation District, acting as the lead agency for  communities it supplies with water, asked Port Hueneme and other cities and  agencies to contribute to the study. It will examine the environmental impact  of building a proposed pipeline and explore other ways to tap into the state  water system.  </P> <P> So far, the cities of Santa Paula and Fillmore have agreed to help finance the  $300,000 environmental study undertaken by Casitas Municipal Water District and  the city of Ventura. Casitas and Ventura have sought to spread around the cost  of the extensive study.  </P> <P> Port Hueneme officials agreed to take part in the project's development to keep  their claim to the city's annual state water allotment of 2,100 acre-feet, said  Jack Duffy, the city's public works director. An acre-foot of water is what a  typical family of four uses in one year.  </P> <P> Over the years, the City Council has supported studying ways to import state  water to improve the quality and quantity of the city's water supply,  Councilman Dorill Wright said.  </P> <P> Another alternative under consideration is attaching the city to the  Metropolitan Water District. Such a move could cost Port Hueneme $5 million to  $7 million, excluding the cost of any water delivered.  </P> <P> Dick Velthoen, Port Hueneme's city manager, said the city's share of the  proposed pipeline costs could be $20 million to $23 million. Once the city  knows firm costs for each project, the City Council will choose which option  could most efficiently get the city its needed water, Wright said. Either  alternative is going to be expensive but will improve the city's water quality  by blending cleaner state water with area ground water, city officials said.  DONNA DOWLING  </P></p>

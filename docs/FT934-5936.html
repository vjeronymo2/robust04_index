			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Israelis kill another Hamas leader Less than 48 hours after killing the military commander of the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist group in Gaza, Israeli forces yesterday shot dead another leading Hamas militant. News of the death of Khaled Zer was suppressed yesterday by the Israeli military censor, presumably in an effort to avoid further infuriating Palestinians angered by Wednesday's killing of Imad Akel, commander of the Izzedine al-Qassem military wing of Hamas, of which Zer was also a member. Jerusalem police sent reinforcements to the Temple Mount yesterday morning, where 20,000 Palestinians gathered for Friday prayers, and extra troops were deployed, too, in the Gaza Strip. Although there were reports of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops, the violence was tame by comparison with Thursday's disturbances, in which one man was killed, another critically wounded and more than 30 others hurt. Israeli officials said Zer had been shot dead after seeking to escape his Israeli pursuers early yesterday in the village of Surbaher outside Jerusalem. They said a rifle was found by his body. Military sources said he had been involved in the murders of two Israeli soldiers and a civilian. The Israeli army also released news last night that troops shot and killed another Palestinian militant, Salim Sabah, several days ago. Sabah is alleged to have killed a Jewish settler in the West Bank earlier this month. This spate of killings of 'wanted' Palestinian militants underlines the determination of the Israelis to track down the most extreme opponents of the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord, in advance of its scheduled implementation on December 13. But the intensified Israeli military activity is causing growing hostility to the accord among Palestinians, while Hamas leaders, far from being deterred, are vowing to avenge the deaths by kidnapping and murdering Israeli soldiers in the coming days. Against the backdrop of escalating hostility, Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in a television interview that he did not regard December 13 - the date agreed by Israel and the PLO for the start of Israel's troop withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho - as 'sacred'. It was important to ensure that all the autonomy issues were completely clarified before the deal was enacted, said Mr Rabin, 'even if it takes a little longer'. In retort, at a press conference in Oslo, the PLO leader Yasser Arafat insisted: 'I don't think we are in need of more time, if there is a will. . .There is no reason to delay implementation of what we've signed.'</p>

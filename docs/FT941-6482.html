			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ITV companies to merge sales Carlton Communications says it intends to integrate its airtime sales operation with that of Central. The move marks the start of reorganisations among advertising sales houses following the series of ITV company mergers. The new sales operation following Carlton's takeover of Central will be led by Mr Martin Bowley, sales director of Carlton Television. Until now, Central's airtime has been sold by TSMS, a joint venture with Anglia Television. But Anglia in turn has been acquired by MAI, which controls Meridian Broadcasting, the ITV company for the south of England. The Department of Trade and Industry has insisted as a condition of agreeing to the takeovers without a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that no sales house should have more than 25 per cent of the television advertising market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- Chairman of the ethnic  Hungarian Egyutteles movement Miklos Duray told CTK today he did  not understand the Slovak Government's effort to get from  Budapest official guarantees for the inviolability of the border  from Budapest, as the question of Central European borders was  already solved after World War Two.    "I cannot understand why it is necessary to insist on the  demand for the recognition of the border," Duray said in an  interview with CTK. He stressed that Slovakia was a successor  to the former Czechoslovakia, and therefore all post-war  agreements concluded by Czechoslovakia were valid. Duray said  the fact that Hungary had confirmed the present border in its  international agreement with Ukraine was due to the difference  between Slovakia and Ukraine. The latter is not successor to a  defunct state.    Duray welcomed the Sunday meeting between the Slovak and  Hungarian premiers, Jozef Moravcik and Peter Boross, in  Komarno-Komarom, a city located on both sides of the two  countries' common border.    "It is correct that bilateral problems can be solved even  without an international agreement," Duray said. He also said  it was important that the new Slovak government, unlike the  cabinet of Vladimir Meciar, did not make the opening of new  border crossings conditional on the signing by Budapest of a  readmission agreement on the return of illegal immigrants.  "Although it is impossible to know the result of the second  round of the parliamentary elections in Hungary beforehand,  Boross's government will remain in power by the end of May,"  Duray said. Moravcik and Boross have concluded only a verbal  agreement, he said, but added that he believed that the  Hungarian foreign political line would be preserved after the  elections.    He said he saw the signing of an agreement on the prevention  of double taxation and creation of a mixed governmental  commission for ethnic minorities as the most urgent goals in  Slovak-Hungarian relations.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rule 8.11 provides for exercise limits on stock index warrants analogous to those found in stock index options and states that such limits are separate and distinct from any exercise limits that may be imposed by the issuers of stock index warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rule 8.12 requires that the trading halt provisions in Rule 7.11 shall be applied to trading in stock index warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon Commission approval of the foregoing amendments, the Exchange proposes it will only file rule changes for specific warrant issues where there is no corresponding option or warrant on the same underlying broad based index already listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ. Accordingly, when a listed option overlies a particular broad based index, the Exchange proposes it be able to list warrants on that index without further Commission review and approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants will require that no more than 20% of the securities in the underlying index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign securities or American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the PSE and the primary exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Furthermore, Commentary .01 to Proposed Rule 2.16 provides that stock index and currency warrants listed on the Exchange prior to SEC approval of this filing shall continue to be governed by those provisions of the Exchange's rules that were applicable to such warrants prior to approval of this filing. Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in index or currency warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Telephone conversation between Michael Pierson, PSE, and Stephen M. Youhn, SEC, on December 5, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). The Exchange proposes that the ``20% test'' be applied in the same manner as that contained in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34157 (June 3, 1994), 59 FR 30062 (June 10, 1994) (Commission approval order allowing the expedited trading approval of certain narrow-based index options). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it will facilitate transactions in securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change imposes a burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

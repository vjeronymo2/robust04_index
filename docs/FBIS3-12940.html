Describing Islamabad  raising the human rights issue in Kashmir at Geneva as totally  uncalled for, Mr. Narasimha Rao said that Pakistan has no locus  standi other than that of an aggressor.    The prime minister said the government will carry out the  mandate of Parliament expressed in its unanimous resolution in  letter and spirit. He was replying in the Lok Sabha today to  the marathon debate on the motion of thanks to the president's  address. The house later adopted the motion by a voice vote  after rejecting all opposition amendments. Mr. Rao regretted  that the basic question on Kashmir has taken a back seat and  peripheral issues like human rights have come to the fore. He  said the Parliament resolution reflects the determination of the  nation to protect the territorial integrity of the country, but  the house should go into further details so that the world must  know what our Parliament thinks about the issue.    Amid thumping of desks by the treasury benches, Mr. Rao said  that the export of terrorism by Pakistan into the Kashmir valley  should stop and the government is determined to do it. He said  the development efforts in the valley will be intensified and  details will be given to the house later. The prime minister  dealt with wide-ranging issues including Ayodhya, Dunkel draft,  economy, rural development, and reorganization of states.    On Ayodhya, he appealed to the members not to be agitated  any  more as the Supreme Court is seized of the matter. He said once  the apex court gives its opinion, action will be initiated  taking the house into confidence.    On reorganization of states, the prime minister said he is  not in favor of opening the Pandora box. However, specific  schemes have to be initiated to remove imbalance in development.  Referring to the situation in the northeast, he said the  overall situation has improved and special attention is being  paid for the development of the region. He pointed out that for  the first time in 40 years, Mizoram has representation in the  council of ministers.    Turning to the Dunkel draft, the prime minister declared  that  the farmers' interest will not be compromised and on the other  hand the agriculture exports will get a boost.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Husni Mubarak at the opening of the </F> National Dialogue Congress at the Presidential Palace in  Heliopolis, Cairo--live]    [Text] In the name of God, the Compassionate, the  Merciful. Brothers and sisters, members of the National  Dialogue Conference. This important gathering is a great event  where Egypt's citizens of various political trends and party  affiliations are meeting to formulate through their national  dialogue an integrated Egyptian concept that will strengthen the  march of democracy, throw light on the priorities of national  action in this important phase of our history, and draw for  Egypt a modern image defining the features of its future with  the beginning of the 21st Century.    It is of great significance that this important gathering is  meeting under the banner of Egyptian patriotism. This gathering  contains representatives of all society's forces and political  currents. They will take part in free and clear discussions of  Egypt's problems and hopes, eschewing their personal interests  and rising above party ambitions. Their only motive and correct  goal is to formulate a scientific and objective formula that  will define for Egypt the position it deserves in a world  witnessing difficult changes in which there is no place for the  weak.    Our meeting here today under the banner of Egyptian  patriotism and at the beginning of a congress in which are  participating this distinguished elite of the spheres of  culture, thought, politics, and economics proves to all that the  area of agreement that can encompass all these ideas is much  bigger than our points of disagreement. This is because our  national feeling takes precedence over any party affiliation and  because in our modern age we are facing more complicated  problems for which it is difficult to find correct solutions in  the absence of an integrated and comprehensive concept that  links politics and science in an objective way that rules out  prejudgment, rigid stands, futile one-upmansship, and insistence  on specific views that do not take into consideration the facts  of the situation or the possible capabilities or the necessities  for compatibility with a new age in which values and concepts  have changed.    Politics is no longer an easy task that can be pursued by  one  individual, regardless of how great his capability and  efficiency. It has become an integrated system of work the aim  of which is to optimally balance the interests of all the  sections of the people in order to satisfy them by enhancing the  society's resources, expanding the base of participation,  instilling enthusiasm in individuals, and making intelligent  political decisions through a scientific appraisal of the  dimensions of situation and its problems.    The National Dialogue Congress was formed to achieve this  objective. Taking part in this congress are a mighty selection  of politicians and party leaders, professionals, university  professors, think tank specialists, representatives of  professional associations and labor unions, members of the  Specialized National Councils, bankers, economists, and  businessmen. In the absence of such figures, political dialogue  would be a futile Byzantine debate, long on rhetoric, short on  reality and insight.    Brothers and sisters, my abiding belief has been and still  is  that despite the diversity and multiplicity of political views  in the national arena, we have enough in common to achieve a  national reconciliation based on the agreement of all parties on  the country's supreme interests.    We may disagree on the pace of economic reforms, but we all  agree on the need to open the door, with no restrictions or  obstacles, to our national financial participation in  development projects. Increased national investment means more  job opportunities, less unemployment, and a growing and  self-reliant economy.    We may disagree on the pace of political reform, but we all  agree that a multiparty system, fair elections, wider popular  participation, a fair and independent judiciary, freedom of  opinion and of the press, and an improved human rights  environment are the underpinnings of true democracy. Our  democracy should protect itself from those groups that defy  legitimacy and desire to undermine Egypt's stability and  democracy.    We may disagree on the order of some of the national  priorities, but we all agree on the need to confront the groups  of violence and terror in a firm way that safeguards the  stability of the homeland and respect for legitimacy. We agree  to preserve national cohesion and social peace, aware as we are  of the danger involved in ignoring the social dimension of  development.    From this perspective, brothers and sisters, I called for  the  formation of a preparatory National Dialogue Committee. My aim  was to unleash initiative, to initiate a dialogue of the minds,  and to have all the legitimate and democratic forces participate  in a comprehensive national dialogue. The task of this dialogue  is to digest the harvest of the years, evaluate the  accomplishments of the present, draw up the path of the future,  and illuminate our passage into the 21st Century.    The objective of the dialogue was to obtain an accurate  assessment of the priorities for national action in light of the  prerequisites of the comprehensive development. The objective  behind the dialogue was to enable us to organize and promote the  effectiveness of the capabilities of the Egyptian human beings,  energies, and resources so that they could confront the  challenges of a new era. Furthermore, the objective was to  ensure the broadest participation in drafting the political  decisions and at finding sound solutions to the problems of this  society.    We have not put any preconditions to the dialogue  preparatory  committee. But we requested that the participants open-mindedly  realize the nature of the challenges facing Egypt and that they  be fully aware of the circumstances that govern Egypt's  international and regional relations. The participants should  refrain from embarking on any adventures without thinking first,  as this could harm the homeland's security and stability.    We did not want this dialogue to get caught in a vicious  circle or get lost in a jungle of new problems that could  plunder the homeland's security and stability. We did not  prohibit anyone from saying whatever he wants nor did we ask  anyone to change his ideas and opinions. But we asked everyone  to enter the dialogue with mature minds and open hearts that  could create a healthy atmosphere for an objective exchange of  ideas to safeguard the homeland's interests and preserve its  coherence.    It has always been our hope that the circle of participants  would expand to include all the democratic and legitimate  forces, that everyone would rise up to meet their  responsibility, and that everyone would drop any preconditions  for the dialogue. This would expand the arena of national  accord and promote the chances of joint action. This is because  the dialogue will lose its principal characteristic and all  justifications if any specific side, including ourselves, tries  to dictate its opinion to the others without sound reasoning  that gives them this right and privilege.    We always believed that the participation alone would create  opportunities for consensus. It is participation that could  pave the way for mutual understanding; and it is the one thing  that plants the roots of mutual confidence in the soil of  national action. We are not after booty to be shared. We have  a huge historic responsibility that cannot be the gambled on.    Some people failed to understand our call for dialogue,  thinking that we were forced into calling for it due to  pressures resulting from terrorism, violence, or other issues.  But reality was bigger than that, because the issue of  terrorism was only one of many factors prompting the honest  national call, which aims at convincing the opposition that it  is part of the ruling body, that it must shoulder part of the  responsibility, and that its ideas can be given appreciation and  consideration as long as they reflect the national conscience  and as long as the regime is prepared to accept its views  because they reflect a broad national accord.    These were the dialogue's aims and motives. However, it  seems that there are those who have miscalculated and imagined  matters differently.    Brothers and sisters, members of the distinguished  conference. This important gathering could not have taken place  without good preparation. The preparatory committee has made  efforts that deserve thanks and compliments. It has completed  important working papers that organize the method of work in  this conference of yours and its three committees. I thank the  committee for the enormous efforts it made throughout four  sessions that fully gave all its members a chance to put forward  their views and proposals. I also thank all those who  participated and contributed their efforts and thought in the  work of the preparatory committee. Participation means  acceptance of responsibility. It means respect for the rules of  the dialogue. It means giving the correct opportunity for  deepening the exercise of democracy.    The fruits of the committee's work was a good example of  democratic action because it enabled all views to be expressed  clearly. The representatives of the participating parties  expressed their parties' views with complete freedom. The  representatives of professional associations expressed the views  of their establishments on the many problems and issues of  national work. All the participating public figures expressed  their various views without intervention or guidance.    The committee's work did not stop at giving a chance to all  members to express their views in a democratic atmosphere and  with a feeling of responsibility. It also contained an honest  and accurate record of all the committee members' proposals and  recommendations. Your honorable congress will discuss and adopt  these recommendations. The points of disagreement and agreement  on all topics under discussion must be made clear to all. This  is because national consensus is the sound guideline for  arranging these recommendations according to their priorities  and for implementing their contents.    The preparatory committee's recommendations encompass all  national action issues, including economic reform, political  reform, and society's basic problems of developing Egypt's  manpower capability. Society must become more capable of  confronting the challenges of the coming age.    In many of these issues, it was clear that there was an  overwhelming tendency reflecting a kind of national consensus.  In other issues, there was a limited tendency that did not  reach limits close to unanimity or majority of views. I believe  all these issues will be discussed by your honorable congress so  that it will rearrange their priorities in a way that takes into  consideration the homeland's supreme interests and the degree of  national consensus enjoyed by these recommendations. Your  congress must also take into consideration the effect of these  recommendations on society's cohesion and unity; their social,  political, and economic cost; and their suitability for  application and implementation under our local conditions and  international developments in general.    I do not wish to volunteer my opinion on a number of  important issues raised by the dialogue preparatory committee so  as not to hamper the free and smooth progress of dialogue in  your congress.    However, I would like to assure everyone that we will  receive  the recommendations of this congress with an open mind and will  take into account every recommendation emanating from national  consensus, so long as it accords with the general national  interest.    We want this conference to be the right starting point for  comprehensive work in which all political, democratic, and  legitimate forces, all of society's forces and institutions, and  every citizen will take part. Our task, briefly stated, is to  match rights with obligations, reconcile aspirations with  abilities, and preserve social cohesion.    We have to admit that the true power of any society rests on  a strong economy driven by a nation fired with enthusiasm and  eagerness for participation. We also have to admit that we are  at the threshold of an era in which information and science are  the decisive factors in national success.    I implore God Almighty to guide our steps onto the path of  righteousness, to endow us with objectivity and enlightenment,  to let the light of faith permeate our course of reform, and to  grant us the gift of harmony, cohesion, and solidarity. May  peace be upon you and the mercy of God. [applause]</p>

"If the discussion takes place I shall personally oppose  it",  he told TASS on Thursday.    Gaydar, who is the leader of the Russia's Choice  parliamentary group, recalled that his bloc had already proposed  to the Russian president to keep the existing parliament  building, known as the "White House", for the new legislature.    "The position of the bloc on the given issue did not  change",  Gaydar said.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Raw materials of a promising deal: The swapping of ICI's fibres unit for Du Pont's acrylics businesses raises questions about ICI's development Sir Denys Henderson, the chairman of ICI, was in good humour yesterday as he announced he was swapping his fibres operations for the acrylics businesses of Du Pont, the US chemicals group. The thought that Pounds 250m in cash would also make its way to ICI as part of the deal added to the width of his grin. 'This is the first significant deal achieved through my swap-shop idea,' he explained. 'Chemical companies need to be as imaginative as possible as they seek to restructure their operations.' Nevertheless, the move raises questions about ICI's longer-term ability to develop its businesses. The deal follows a fundamental reappraisal of the operations that began in September 1990. The company's reshaping, Sir Denys insists, was already initiated before Lord Hanson's conglomerate took a 2.8 per cent stake in the company last May. ICI realised it had to cut costs to remain competitive. Since the reassessment, Sir Denys's management team has been skilful at restructuring and disposing of businesses. During the past 20 months observers estimate ICI has sold off nearly Pounds 1.5bn of assets. These include its fertiliser business, soda ash and lime interests, and salt operations. At the same time costs have been slashed. Since January 1990, more than 14,000 staff have been cut. Sir Denys says the company has adopted a strategy of concentrating on businesses that are either global or highly profitable. The fibres businesses at the centre of yesterday's swap fitted neither criteria. The history of ICI's involvement in fibres is long and unhappy. The decision to pull out follows protracted struggles to make the unit profitable. Fibres contributed significantly to the materials division's losses of Pounds 14m during the last quarter of last year. A combination of a long-term shift in the fibre customer base from Europe to Asia, combined with the recession, finally convinced Sir Denys to sell. For more than 20 years the company has been grappling with increasing competition from the Far East. The problem has been that ICI's operations have been based mainly in Europe where its customer base has been shrinking. As textile manufacturers have increasingly shifted to low labour-cost areas in Asia, so fibre-manufacturing has been set up there. Between 1970 and 1991, the European share of the world man-made fibres market shrunk from 31 per cent to 18 per cent, while production outside the US, Europe and Japan has increased from 24 per cent to 54 per cent. ICI has responded to increasing Asian competition by pulling out of areas where it would be forced to compete purely on price. During the late 1980s it made the difficult decision to stop making polyester, which the company invented. Instead, ICI concentrated on high-performance nylons for home furnishings, carpets and clothing, such as ski-wear, all sectors where it believed it could command a premium. In 1988, the fibres operations generated profits of Pounds 53m. But while premium clothing and household products were successful during the late 1980s, by the recessionary early 1990s they flourished less well. Mr Scott Davidson, managing director of ICI Fibres, estimates demand for nylon fell 20 per cent during 1991 alone. Most European manufacturers are still running their plants at 80 per cent capacity. Caught by falling demand, ICI fibres management slashed costs. Nearly 1,000 jobs were cut in 1991 and a further 800 were planned for this year. The division's headquarters at Harrogate was closed and replaced by an office in Brussels with only 20 staff. In spite of such cost-cutting efforts, Sir Denys decided that the fibres operations could no longer be considered as core businesses. In February, when Sir Denys announced last year's full-year results, he warned that rationalisation at the fibres unit had been insufficient to improve margins. Sir Denys said yesterday that ICI could not afford to expand its nylon businesses to the US and Asia, or update its plants in Europe. 'We have to be truly global,' said Sir Denys. 'And we just couldn't justify the additional investment needed to do that in fibres.' He added that the cost of environmental measures in the UK and Europe had been far higher than expected since the mid-1980s. Certainly, ICI could not afford to compete with Du Pont. Mr David Williamson, Du Pont's European president, estimates his company has on average recently spent a total Dollars 500m a year on updating plants. It has announced a Dollars 1bn nylon plant for Singapore and plans to spend Dollars 10bn over the next decade on nylon production elsewhere. Du Pont, the world's largest manufacturer of nylon, believes it can make a better job of the fibres businesses than ICI because it can afford to spend money on them. The deal meets two of its strategic goals, according to Mr Williamson. It reinforces one its core businesses - nylon - while at the same time extending its reach in Europe. Du Pont had little previous presence in the European nylon market, says Mr Robin Anson, managing editor fibres and textiles publications at the Economist Intelligence Unit, the market research group. 'In this business size has become critical.' Du Pont will become the leading supplier of nylon in Europe with about 25 per cent of the market, according to the company. It will be competing with other suppliers such as BASF of Germany, France's Rhone-Poulenc and Akzo of the Netherlands. Sir Denys said yesterday the swap was not an indictment of ICI's fibres management. He pointed out that other European companies were restructuring their operations. Last month Rhone-Poulenc and Snia of Italy merged their staple fibre and polyamide carpet yarn operations. He said managers had struggled to bring the businesses to sustained profitability. Many of ICI's businesses are now facing difficult conditions. The management, which has succeeded in making disposals, must now prove it can expand its businesses organically. A key test will be how it handles the new acrylics businesses which fit Sir Denys's strategic perfectly. ICI will be transformed from number three to the world's leading manufacturer of acrylics - used, for example, for windows and bathroom furniture - with production and sales of Pounds 500m a year in the US, Europe and Asia. Dupont's acrylics businesses had sales of Dollars 300m in the US, where they were second to Rohm and Haas, the American group. ICI's confidence in the business is demonstrated by the doubling of capacity in the UK and Taiwan. Although profit margins have historically been between 15 and 20 per cent, they are presently depressed by the global recession. Meanwhile, disposals of petrochemicals and plastics businesses are probably in the pipeline. The danger is that Sir Denys could find the company he chairs might one day no longer merit inclusion in the chemical industry's first division.</p>

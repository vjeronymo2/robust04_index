			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE: "Enlargement -- Another Failure Hits </F> the Twelve: European Union on Brink of Crisis"; as released by  Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 22 Mar (BELGA) -- The foreign ministers of  the Twelve have once again failed in their attempt to reach  agreement on the adjustment of the voting rules within the  Europe of the Sixteen, thereby leaving the European Union (EU)  teetering on the brink of a serious crisis, which could entail  the very nature of European construction being called into  question.    Meeting for the umpteenth time in Brussels, the ministers  had  to concede that there was a complete stalemate in their attempt  to reconcile the point of view held by the British and Spanish  with that of the other 10 member states on the adjustment of the  blocking minority within the Council in light of the accession  of the four new states. This furious debate will be postponed to  the informal Council meeting of the Twelve, which will take  place in Ioannina (in northern Greece).    That meeting will constitute the "final chance" to reach an  agreement. In order to respect the date of accession of the four  candidates, planned for 1 January 1995, the European Parliament  (EP) must give its "assent" no later than during the May plenary  session, because that is the last plenary session before  Parliament is dissolved prior to the June elections.    Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes does not hold out much  hope for the prospect of a solution being found between now and  the weekend. "Unless a miracle occurs in Ioannina, enlargement  will be postponed indefinitely, and the EU will suffer a severe  loss of credibility, both internally and externally," he said  during a news conference. Mr. Claes alluded in particular to  the lack of comprehension and disappointment on the part of the  four candidate member states faced with the recantations of the  Twelve, and to the risk of a sanction by European voters during  the upcoming European elections.    "Without wishing to overdramatize the situation, we must not  underestimate the importance of this incident, which is calling  into question the functioning of the very Community itself," he  added.    "The very functioning of the Union is at stake: If the bar  set for making decisions is raised, then the Community will  merely become less efficient. Moreover, it could call into  question the very nature of European construction, which would  then be diluted, rather than consolidated," explained the  Belgian foreign minister.    The United Kingdom and Spain are still rejecting the  mathematical adjustment of the blocking minority from 23 votes  out of 76 to 27 votes out of 90 upon the accession of Austria,  Finland, Sweden, and Norway. In so doing, the respective  national governments in Madrid and London are seeking to retain  the possibility of three countries blocking a decision.    The Spaniards are prepared to accept a blocking minority of  27 votes except in cases where a minority of 23 votes is formed  by three countries totaling at least 100 million inhabitants, a  proposal Mr. Claes deems inappropriate: "The demographic  approach requires more detailed examination. What about a  minority of less than 23 votes constituted by two large  countries comprising 120 million inhabitants or more?" he asked.    London and Madrid have rejected all the compromise proposals  presented up to now. The Union's Greek Presidency proposed  adjusting the blocking minority to 27 votes, while providing for  some form of conciliation with a view to reaching a consensus if  a bloc of 23 votes is formed with a view to opposing a decision  on a major topic.    Such a solution is feasible for the 10 other member states  subject to the fixing of a "strictly limited deadline" and "with  legal or institutional commitment," underlined Willy Claes.    This position is irreconcilable with the British demand that  the need to reach a consensus within an unlimited period in the  event of a minority falling between 23 and 27 votes be included  in a protocol annexed to the Maastricht Treaty and ratified by  the EP and the national legislative assemblies of the Twelve.    "The founding fathers of Europe showed us the way, and we do  not intend to make concessions on principles as fundamental as  these. The Belgian Government flatly refuses to make concessions  on institutional management," continued the Belgian foreign  minister.    According to him, European Commission President Jacques  Delors has now intervened in the debate, threatening to "draw  all possible personal conclusions if we have to make  concessions that go too far" on this issue.</p>

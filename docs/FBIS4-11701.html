			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Pinhas 'Inbari: "An Open Declaration or a </F> Secret Commitment"]    [Excerpt] Although the talks between Israel and the PLO on  defense for the Palestinians attracted the most attention this  past week, one should also take note of the contacts which the  U.S. peace coordinator, Dennis Ross, conducted in Damascus  rather than in Tunis. Washington is considering the chances of  bringing about a breakthrough on the Palestinian track, but real  achievements in the near future are possible only in the talks  with Syria.    This week I met with some of the members of the Israeli  Arabs  delegation, led by Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, who  had just returned from a visit to Syria. By the testimony of  the delegation members, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'  specified Damascus' position on the way in which a breakthrough  in the negotiations with Israel can be achieved.    Al-Shar' said that Syria adheres to the formula of full  peace  in return for a full withdrawal from the Golan, but is prepared  to discuss with Israel all the conditions the latter will  present on the road to implementing the formula, so as to  reassure it on security issues. At the same time, Syria refuses  to specify the components of peace now since it does not trust  that Israel indeed wants true peace.    Syria is offering Israel two options for the acceptance of  the formula. The first option is an open, official declaration  by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin that Israel is willing to  withdraw from the Golan in return for full peace. If Rabin  openly declares the acceptance of the Syrian proposal, the road  will be open to a historic summit between al-Asad and Rabin.    The second option, in case Rabin prefers not to declare  Israel's readiness for a withdrawal openly, is for a secret  Israeli commitment to be relayed to the Syrians. Itamar  Rabinovich, the head of the Israeli delegation to the talks, can  convey such a commitment to his Syrian counterpart, Muwaffaq  al-'Allaf, together with Israel's position on the security  arrangements. A secret commitment to withdraw from the Golan in  return for full peace will complete the formulation of the joint  Israeli-Syrian declaration of principles and will embark on the  talks between the two countries on the road leading to peace.    What interest does Syria have in establishing peace with  Israel? The members of the Israeli delegation to the  negotiations got the impression that Syria's economic situation  is reasonable. Furthermore, Syria emerged from the economic  crisis which had plagued it, and its citizens currently enjoy  economic prosperity. In theory then, Syria's condition is good  and it has no reason to want a change. This is also the message  the Syrians tried to relay to the members of the Darawshah  delegation: "We are in no rush; we are waiting patiently."    The Syrians indeed have a feeling of self-confidence which  enables them to pose maximal opening demands. At the same time,  the decision by the Syrian leadership to prefer economic  development obliges it, of necessity, to turn to a road of peace  and to help the Israeli Government to promote a new Middle East  based on econmy. The suspicious Syrians show great hostility  toward the ideas of a new Middle East presented by Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres, claiming that Israel intends to take  over the region economically. Still, when the two countries  agree on the framework of bilateral peace and Syria joins the  multilateral talks, many of its fears on this issue will surely  dissipate. Syria boycotts the multilateral talks which discuss  regional cooperation indeed, but it is still following, via  France, all those details raised in the talks which concern it,  such as the regional roads network in which Damascus is supposed  to feature prominently.    It is clearly understood in Syria that if the Israeli  Government does not make real progress in the peace talks this  year, then a right-wing government which may emerge from the  ruins of the present process will bring the war tension back and  this will result in new economic deterioration in Syria. The  Syrians are also troubled by Israel's nuclear capability, and  want to take advantage of the peace talks in order to safeguard  themselves from this aspect of Israel's power.    Syria's name has so far been linked with radical forces in  the Middle East. Nevertheless, following its policy in Lebanon  may point to new trends which can also influence its policy  toward Israel and its position on the Palestinian question. The  invitation extended to Darawshah's delegation too indicates that  Syria is shifting the emphasis to those who represent the  moderate mainstream. [passage omitted]</p>

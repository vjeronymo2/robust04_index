			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Second-quarter loss for Equitable Life parent EQUITABLE Companies, the parent group of Equitable Life, the fifth largest US life insurer, reported a second-quarter after-tax loss of Dollars 17.6m in the wake of heavy losses from real estate investments. The result, however, was still a big improvement on the Dollars 212.6m loss incurred at the same stage of 1991. Yesterday's results cover the period before Equitable was transformed from a mutual to a stock company by last month's Dollars 392m stock-market flotation. The group had to take an extraordinary Dollars 25.9m charge to cover the cost of the demutualisation, which meant the final second-quarter net loss for Equitable was Dollars 43.5m. The primary factors for the losses on Equitable's insurance investment portfolio were additions to valuation allowances and write-downs in publicly traded securities, which over the past six months have totalled Dollars 131.7m, although they were partly offset by investment gains of Dollars 61.8m. The bulk of the investment losses was for valuation allowances set aside for mortgages. Equitable said problem commercial property mortgages at June 30 represented 7.5 per cent of the commercial portfolio, up from 4.4 per cent at the end of 1991. After the write-downs and additions to valuations, Equitable's insurance units had an after-tax loss of Dollars 43.7m in the April-to-June period, against a Dollars 218.5m loss in the 1991 second quarter. Equitable's investment businesses segment, which includes the brokerage firm Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, contributed after-tax profits of Dollars 48.9m, almost double the contribution of a year ago.</p>

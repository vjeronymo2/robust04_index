			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: GE to buy Lindner German lighting unit General Electric of the US yesterday said it would purchase Lindner Licht, the lighting subsidiary of Lindner, the German-based light-bulb maker. The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, follows the collapse of a planned merger between Philips Lighting (Netherlands) and Lindner after Germany's Federal Cartel Office rejected the takeover on the grounds that it would strengthen Philips's dominant position in the German market. 'This acquisition of Lindner provides GE with the opportunity to expand our business in the strategically important German market,' said Mr Charles Piepler, head of GE Lighting Europe. GE said it hoped to increase its market share in Germany from 9 per cent. Lindner holds a 6 per cent share of the lighting market. Last year's turnover of the German lighting bulb market totalled DM600m (Dollars 375m). Lindner, which will sell its licensing brand, trademarks and distribution facilities to GE, yesterday said the GE purchase would help expand the company. 'GE will provide the necessary resources and lighting expertise,' said Mr Horst Hochreuther, managing director of Lindner. The announcement confirms GE's determination to increase its global presence in the lighting market.</p>

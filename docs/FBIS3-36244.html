A senior official of the Russian Space Agency who had taken  part in the talks told Interfax that "the two sides agreed to  use the draft compiled by Russian experts as the basis for  further negotiations."    A protocol was signed, listing the issues on which full  agreement had been reached and those on which talks had to  continue. In particular, no agreement has been reached on which  country's legislation should apply in the station and which  country's law enforcement agencies will police there and the  town of Leninsk.    The official emphasized that the Kazakh negotiators needed  more time to analyze the Russian offer of an amount to be paid  for use of the launching pads.    He did not rule out the possibility that the talks would be  continued in Almaty, the Kazakh capital.    Meanwhile, officials in the Kazakh embassy told Interfax  that  the status of Baykonur was likely to be discussed when the  presidents of the two countries met in Moscow on February 11 and  12. Nursultan Nazarbayev will have a stopover in Moscow on his  way to the U.S.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Australian hero sheds villain image: Keating has broken shackles of Labor's mistakes AUSTRALIA'S re-elected Labor prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, must feel a little like Superman. For 15 months, since he took over from Mr Bob Hawke, Mr Keating has been shackled by past mistakes. On Saturday, with one bound, he was free. As treasurer (finance minister) until March 1991, Mr Keating was one of the most unpopular politicians in the country, widely blamed for triggering the 1990-91 recession through mistaken handling of monetary policy. His image nosedived further after he successfully challenged in December 1991 for the Labor leadership, bringing a premature end to the career of Mr Hawke, Labor's longest serving and most popular leader. Mr Keating has spent much of his time since then trying to refashion his image by airing a diverse range of emotive issues designed to show that his vision for Australia embraces more than effective economic management. In the process he has wooed Aborigines with promises of reconciliation with white Australia, nationalists with promises of republicanism and a new flag, and parents with a campaign against television violence. He has also cleaned up his language, largely eschewing colourful phrases such as 'scumbag' which were well-received by parliamentary colleagues, but notoriously unpopular with voters. He has been unable, however, to do anything about the level of unemployment, which rose to 11.1 per cent of the workforce or more than 1m people during the campaign. Until late on Saturday night, there was almost unanimous agreement among opinion pollsters and commentators that the government's economic record would hand a narrow victory to the opposition Liberal/National Party coalition. But neither the opinion polls nor the pundits had picked up a late swing to Labor as voters heeded repeated warnings by Mr Keating that the opposition's radical taxation and industrial relations policies would lead to chaos. Much of his campaign was based on the dubious claim that the coalition's proposals for a goods and services tax (GST), similar to the European value added tax, would cause an irreversible change in the Australian way of life. Mr Keating also scored a significant victory in the last two days of the campaign with an attack on the coalition's plan to deregulate the labour market, which he claimed would open workers to exploitation. When all the votes are counted, Labor seems likely to achieve a majority of between seven and 17 seats in the 147-seat House of Representatives, compared with six in the last parliament. Even the bottom end of the range would represent a startling victory against the odds, especially as Labor appears likely to become the first government since 1966 to increase its vote at a general election. For the coalition, the result is a disaster comparable to the British Labour party's failure to wrest power from the Conservative government in last year's UK election. Mr John Hewson, leader of the Liberals, the coalition's dominant partner, said he would fight on. However he said the coalition would drop the GST proposal and establish a wide-ranging policy review, suggesting that the conservatives may take some time to recover their direction. For Mr Keating, the election was the final act in a two-year transformation from villain to hero. His victory gives Labor a fifth successive term in government and suggests that the party is close to achieving Mr Hawke's vision of it as the natural party of government. At the least, Mr Keating has far exceeded the expectations of Labor MPs, who made him leader in the hope that he would contain the scale of what most saw as inevitable defeat. The signs are that Mr Keating intends to take full advantage of the circumstances of his victory, which could make him an unusually powerful Labor prime minister. The new government's priorities will be to encourage economic recovery and complete the wide-ranging structural reforms begun under Mr Hawke, such as the tariff reduction programme.</p>

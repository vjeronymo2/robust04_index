			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: GPA deal tests lease-backed financing A NEW source of finance for aircraft leasing may soon be available to airlines, if an asset-backed transaction being prepared by GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing group, is successful. GPA has mandated Citicorp to arrange an issue of Eurobonds backed by aircraft leases, according to market sources. The deal, expected to total Dollars 500m, is believed to be the first securitisation of aircraft leases structured as a public offering. In securitisation, assets are removed from a company's balance sheet, repackaged as bonds or notes, and sold to investors through a special-purpose vehicle. Mortgages, car loans and credit card receivables are among the assets now commonly securitised. If the market proves receptive to the GPA deal, the structure is likely to be imitated by airline companies. Many are in need of new sources of funds since conventional leasing finance has become increasingly hard to come by. The securitisation of leases will allow airlines to raise funds from the bond markets, which most cannot access in their own right because of their poor credit quality. The Dollars 500m transaction will be be divided into five tranches. The first will be a Dollars 200m issue of senior fixed-rate Eurobonds. They will have a five-year bullet maturity, which means they cannot be repaid in advance. The risk of pre-payment inherent in many asset-backed securities is a strong deterrent for many European investors. The second tranche will consist of a Dollars 200m issue of senior floating-rate Eurobonds, also with a fixed term of five years. Both tranches will be offered publicly, and priced to offer a premium to existing classes of asset-backed debt. A third tranche totalling Dollars 70m will be structured as a private placement of amortising floating-rate notes. The remainder will include Dollars 30m of mezzanine financing and Dollars 100m of equity. Lockheed and Amerigon formed a partnership to convert unused aerospace facilities at Lockheed's Burbank Airport plant into headquarters for Calstart, a government/private sector consortium being formed to create an electric vehicle and advanced transportation industry in California, Reuter reports.

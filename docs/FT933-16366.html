			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Travel: Colombia's more acceptable face WITH A grunt of pain, the fakir lay back on the bed of rusty nails. On his chest, four be-suited businessmen balanced precariously, with nervous smiles. It was lunchtime in the business district of Bogota, and the small crowd of secretaries and clerks applauded and dropped coins into the hat passed around by a ragged boy. When the fakir got stiffly to his feet, his back was livid with the impressions of nails; here and there, I could see a trickle of dried blood. Colombia is always full of surprises. In Bogota, the morning rush hour resembles that of a prosperous city in northern Spain. Grey-suited workers walk purposefully to their offices among tower blocks in the downtown area. Yet, at midday, when the street corner magicians, fakirs and quack medicine peddlers set up shop, the mixture of Indian faces and dress quickly dispels any illusions of a European city. Not far from the teeming commercial centre, tucked under one of the mountains that tower over Bogota, lies the Quinta de Bolivar. The lovely country house, with rooms opening on to a verandah shaded with bougainvillaea, was donated by grateful citizens to Simon Bolivar, who finally freed Latin America from the Spanish empire. Renowned for his ability to cover miles on horseback over Colombia's tortuous terrain to harass the Spanish, Bolivar was known as Iron Arse by his admiring supporters. Within 15 years, he had routed the Imperial armies, and in 1820 created the Gran Colombia comprising Ecuador, Venezuela and Colombia. But internal rivalries ended Bolivar's dream, and the grand alliance fell apart a few years later. Bolivar died, broken-hearted, in 1830. Travel anywhere in the country and it is easy to understand why he was held in such awe. At an altitude of 2,600 metres (8,515 ft), Bogota is one of the highest capitals in the world. Roads leading from the city wind over spectacular passes of the Cordillera Central. I left early one morning in an ancient and cossetted 1962 Chrysler. The driver, Antonio, a trim man in his late 60s, had shown me the engine of the car with pride before we set off. Highly polished, a crucifix presided over the spotless compartment where the six-cylinder motor ticked silently. 'They made these cars too well,' he said, proudly, flicking a duster over the chromed manifold. Our destination was the Monasterio de la Candeleria, an Augustinian seminary in the Andes. We climbed past labouring trucks crowded with Indians on their way to market, and then descended through the broad pastures of several rich haciendas to Villa de Leyva. A pretty village of low white-walled houses tiled in red, it was a favourite resting place for Bolivar to escape from the sombre climate and political intriguing of Bogota. With a balmy, year-round temperature of 18'C (65'F), it is still a popular weekend resort for wealthier Bogotanos. The seminary lay tucked in the mountains, 90 minutes' drive across a semi-desert. The monks were at lunch, the only cafe closed, but Antonio provided refreshment. At the touch of a button, two tiny nozzles under the dashboard dispensed red wine or aguardiente, a local anisette made from coconut. We sipped and waited for the bell to ring announcing that the monastery was open. Finally, a young monk gestured us through the large, arched gateway. The cloisters were lined with flowering vines; parrots and parakeets dozed on the branches of orange trees on the wide central patio. Small groups of seminarists chatted and laughed on their way back to class, passing under stern oil portraits of their predecessors. We were shown the chapel, with an early and very bloody Christ on the cross, and then taken to a museum where the bizarre artifacts ranged from Indian arrows from the Amazon to the first jukebox to play in the high Cordillera. As we left, our guide told us he would soon be leaving the mountain calm of the seminary for one of the toughest slums of Bogota. Five hundred miles to the north of the capital, and in complete contrast to the arid plateau of the Central Cordillera, lies Cartagena, on the country's Caribbean coast. For 300 years, it was the only port for the entire continent, and the walled city was fortified heavily after repeated raids by the English in the 16th century. Still ringed with high, buttressed defences, the narrow streets offer tantalising glimpses of cool patios with fountains playing. Churches and green plazas give way to unexpected vistas of the sea through gates in the city walls. The Cartagenos are a cheerful and colourful people, mixed descendants of the Spanish, local Indians and African slaves. Their friendliness and the relaxed atmosphere of the town make it a popular holiday destination for Colombians from other major cities, particularly Medellin, where the police clamp-down on the drug cartel has put the town under virtual curfew. During lunch at a beach-side restaurant, the thud of a distant explosion sent a frisson of concern through the diners and I heard the phrase 'car bomb.' But a waiter reported that a transformer had short-circuited on a nearby electricity pylon. That night, my last in Colombia, I took a chiva tour from my hotel. The chiva, an open single-deck bus, was packed with Latin American tourists. At the back, three musicians played musica campesino, the forerunner of salsa, at high volume on a trumpet, accordion and drum. Until 3 am, we toured the nightclubs of Cartagena, drinking rum and dancing to salsa and merengue. We had started the evening as total strangers; by the end, I had addresses and invitations to visit Brazil, Argentina and Chile, and had learnt a few new dance steps. As the chiva wove back through the warm, sleeping streets, night watchmen would rise and dance a few steps until we were out of earshot. I took the last sip from my rum bottle and reflected that the major problem with Colombia was its size. Ten days had not been enough. I knew I would return soon to visit more of this remarkable country. Nick Haslam flew to Bogota c/o American Airlines.  Generally, return flights, London-Bogota, start at Pounds 442, except in high summer when they are dearer. His holiday was organised by Passage to South America, 41 North End Road, London W14 8SZ (tel.  071-602 9889). A two-week Colombian holiday - two cities, one beach resort, including internal flights, hotels and breakfast - would cost from around Pounds 1,000, says the company.</p>

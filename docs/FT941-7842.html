			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Growth figure for end of last year revised upwards Economic growth in the fourth quarter of last year was slightly stronger than previously estimated, with gross domestic product increasing by a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent, up from the earlier estimate of 0.7 per cent. Figures released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed that for last year as a whole GDP was 2 per cent higher than in 1992. If oil and gas are excluded, the rise in GDP was 1.7 per cent, down from the 1.8 per cent previously estimated. Economic output in the fourth quarter of last year was 2.6 per cent higher than in the same period of 1992. If oil and gas are excluded the increase was 2.2 per cent. Construction output, which was previously seen as flat in the fourth quarter, is estimated as having risen by about 1 per cent between the third and fourth quarters. This factor is mainly responsible for the upgrading of fourth-quarter GDP growth. The figures give a more detailed breakdown of the economy than was available in the preliminary GDP estimate, published in January. They show that stockbuilding played a substantial part in fourth-quarter growth, with the value of stocks rising by Pounds 597m. Capital spending by manufacturers was flat in the fourth quarter and 2 per cent lower than in the same period of 1992. Gross domestic fixed capital formation fell 0.3 per cent between the fourth quarters of 1992 and last year. The statistics show that one measure of inflation, the GDP deflator, is gathering pace. According to the CSO the deflator rose by 3.5 per cent for last year as a whole, the lowest annual rise since 1968. In the fourth quarter, however, the deflator rose 1.7 per cent and was 4.5 per cent higher than in the same period of 1992. The GDP deflator is calculated after subtracting the effect of import prices. Since import prices have been falling, this indicates that home-based inflation is higher than shown by other measures. Analysts differed on the importance of the deflator. Mr Robert Barrie of Barclays de Zoete Wedd said it was a sign that companies had been increasing their margins with price increases. Mr Simon Briscoe of SG Warburg Securities pointed to the poor quality of the trade statistics, which are used to calculate the GDP deflator. He said the consumers' expenditure deflator, which was growing at an annual rate of only 3 per cent in the fourth quarter, was a better indicator of inflationary pressures. One sign of improved company margins was a 22.9 per cent rise in the gross trading profits of companies last year. Profits in the fourth quarter were 26.9 per cent higher than in the same period of 1992. The gross trading surplus of public corporations rose 50.1 per cent between 1992 and last year. The CSO said this rise might have been caused by the addition of new entities to the sector, such as National Health Service trusts. Meanwhile, income from employment rose 2.9 per cent between 1992 and last year, the lowest growth rate recorded since the series started in 1948.</p>

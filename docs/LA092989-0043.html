			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Contending that a seldom-used, 200-year-old law violates their rights to equal  protection of the law, some Vietnamese fisherman filed suit in San Francisco to  stop the Coast Guard from enforcing the Jones Act, a measure forbidding  non-citizens from piloting commercial fishing boats. The lawsuit names six  former Vietnamese citizens who have been fishing in California since their  arrival in the early 1980s. Attorney Dennis Hayashi of the Asian Law Caucus  said the act was originally approved by Congress so the government could  commandeer fishing boats in wartime and had not been enforced in decades, until  the Coast Guard recently began ordering vessels back to port. Coast Guard  spokesman Lt. Cmdr. John Jaskot denied that the Vietnamese have been singled  out and insisted that the agency is simply carrying out its obligation to  enforce existing laws without passing judgment.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Confirmed information obtained by AL-BILAD says the  nuclear radiation registered periodically since the Gulf war  came from a U.S. aircraft carrier, the Saratoga.    Indubitable sources said a story that the radiation resulted  from a defect in the Israeli Dimona nuclear reactor was leaked  by U.S. circles to counter suspicions about the Saratoga by  blaming the radiation on the Dimona reactor.    AL-BILAD obtained the following story on how this radiation  occurred: The cruise missiles the Saratoga fired at Iraq from  the Red Sea previously carried nuclear warheads designed to  strike at the Warsaw Pact states. When the Gulf crisis erupted,  the nuclear warheads were removed and replaced with conventional  warheads, but the missiles were still charged with nuclear  radiation, which has been registered more than once.</p>

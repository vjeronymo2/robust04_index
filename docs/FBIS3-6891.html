The officials said China rejected Japan's  request for an increase in the number of flights to Beijing,  insisting Japan accept the same number of Chinese flights to  Tokyo's international airport at Narita.    Japan told China it is physically impossible to accept the  Chinese demand because Narita airport is equipped with only one  runway, they said.    Currently, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways operate  twice-weekly regular flights to Beijing while Japan Air System  hopes to join them.    Two Chinese airlines, which now fly into Narita, Osaka and  Fukuoka, want to increase their flights on the lucrative Narita  route, the officials said. No resumption of negotiations is  possible as long as China insists on increasing flights to  Narita, the officials said.</p>

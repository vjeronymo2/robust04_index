			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Japan's leading indicators paint a grim picture THE OUTLOOK for a recovery in depressed Japanese corporate and consumer confidence is weak, according to the latest set of economic statistics published yesterday. Japan's index of leading economic indicators stood at 40 in July, the third consecutive month in which it has fallen below 50, the dividing line between growth and decline. The index, published by the Economic Planning Agency as a measure of the outlook for the next six months, rose from 30.8 in June. Among the components pointing to a slight improvement, inventories of raw materials were down for the fifth month running, money supply rose for the fourth month, and new machinery orders rose for the first time in four months However, the index has recently proved an unreliable recovery indicator. It was well above 50 for the first four months of the year, so adding to groundless hopes that the downturn was near an end, said Mr Jeff Young at Salomon Brothers Asia. The yen's greater than expected rise is one reason why the downturn is more severe than many industrial companies had feared, even a few months ago. This was highlighted yesterday by a 14.7 per cent annualised decline in car exports last month. That was the fifth monthly decline running and the worst performance for 14 years, said the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Hopes of an export boom to China have been cut short, as Japanese car sales there only increased by 3.3 per cent in August, after having doubled in the previous seven months, the association said. Exports to the European Community fell 13.4 per cent and sales to the US were down 16.4 per cent in August. Further evidence emerged yesterday of the depressed state of Japanese consumer spending, one of the main factors in what is becoming the country's worst recession since the 1973 oil price shock. Sales at department stores and large retailers dropped 4.2 per cent in August from the same month the previous year, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry announced. This marks the fifteenth monthly fall running. However, some retailers, such as thriving discount stores, have reported signs of an upturn in September sales.</p>

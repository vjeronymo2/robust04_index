			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Petrofina plans BFr10bn asset sales and job cuts PETROFINA, the oil group which is one of Belgium's largest industrial companies, is to cut further jobs across all sectors and sell BFr10bn (Dollars 301m) of assets in an effort to improve profitability. Mr Francois Cornelis, the group's vice-chairman and managing director, told shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting that this was not be a pleasant task but would substantially improve the performance of the company. Petrofina was forced to cut its dividend this year for the first time since 1959 after consolidated profits fell by 72 per cent, from BFr16.3bn in 1991 to BFr4.6bn in 1992, hit by low crude prices and the unfavourable dollar exchange rate. At a press conference before the shareholder meeting, Mr Cornelis said personnel would be reduced by about 5 per cent this year - a cut of more than 750 jobs out of a workforce of 15,490 at the end of 1992. The number of employees has already come down from 17,131 in 1991. The cash earned from asset sales will include money already raised from the sale of shares in Tractebel, the Belgian utility company, plus the sale of undeveloped reserves in the North Sea and US reserves, which are proving slow to bear fruit. Mr Cornelis told shareholders that profits for 1993 should improve on 1992 if the price of crude oil and gas remained stable. First-half net profits are likely to be roughly the same as in 1992, when they reached BFr4.16bn, in spite of a strong improvement in refining and petrochemical margins over the last month. Petrofina has been at the centre of takeover speculation in the last few months. Shareholders approved a series of proposals aimed at strengthening the group's takeover defences.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin today urged the Russian Government to deepen the  economic reform underway in the country in a way causing less  costs.    Speaking at the extended meeting of the cabinet in the  Kremlin, Yeltsin described as "wrong" the slogan of "reform the  economy at any cost." The people may reject a huge-burden  reform, the president pointed out.    The meeting is attended by government ministers, leaders of  state committees and other federal executive bodies, as well as  Parliament chamber speakers, faction leaders and heads of local  governments.    The meeting's focus is to discuss economic performances in  1993 and reform tasks for this year.    "The government is facing most complicated tasks," said  Yeltsin.    As to the strikes in the coal-mining regions, the president  said, "it is inadmissible to delay the payment of wages for  several months. I am closely watching the developments and the  position of the labor unions."    "Of course, emergency decisions will be made, but let those  who delay the payment for coal and the payment of wages be the  first to shoulder the responsibility," he said.    The president also stressed the need to curb the growing  inflation rate, and deepen reforms in the industrial,  agricultural and financial spheres.</p>

			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Depressed sales and strong yen plague Sharp SHARP, the Japanese consumer electronics and office equipment manufacturer, yesterday blamed a 37 per cent drop in parent pre-tax profits to Y44.5bn (Dollars 405m) for the year to March on the downturn in the Japanese economy and the appreciation of the yen. Sales fell 4 per cent to Y1,153bn as Japanese corporate spending and consumption was depressed and overseas markets remained weak, the company said. Group pre-tax profits, meanwhile, plunged by 30 per cent to Y51.6bn and parent net profits fell 31 per cent to Y25bn. Audio and communication equipment in particular recorded a big fall in demand, with sales falling 16 per cent. Television and video equipment sales slid 10 per cent. Sharp was also hit by weakened demand for home electrical appliances such as air-conditioners, which were affected by the cool summer in Japan last year. The division suffered a 6 per cent fall in sales. The strength of the yen affected Sharp, which sells about 50 per cent of its products overseas. On a more positive note, the group benefited from its strength in liquid crystal displays with strong demand for its LCD panels. The company is seeking to cut costs by restructuring its operations to reduce dependence on consumer electronics. It expects these moves to help it raise non-consolidated sales in the current year by 2 per cent to Y1,180bn and net profits by 4 per cent to Y26bn. Sharp will increase its capital spending this year by 12 per cent to Y90bn and its R&amp;D expenditure by 6 per cent to Y110bn. KDD, Japan's international telecommunications operator, reported a 1.8 per cent fall in sales to Y240bn in the year to March and a 12 per cent plunge on operating profits to Y17.1bn, both hurt by the downturn in the country's economy. However, the group was able to raise pre-tax profits by 2 per cent to Y26.7bn and net profits by 11 per cent to Y15.7bn.</p>

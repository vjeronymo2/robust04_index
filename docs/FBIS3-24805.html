			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The chief of Army staff, Major General Mohamed Chris  Alli, has called on Britain and the United States to lift the  sanctions imposed on the Nigerian Armed Forces. Gen. Alli made  the appeal in Somalia when he visited the United Nations deputy  secretary general, Mr. Lansana Kouyate, as part of his tour of  areas where Nigerian troops are serving in peacekeeping  operations. He said it was an irony that the Nigerian Army,  which over the years had made immense contributions towards the  maintenance of world peace, had become a victim of international  sanctions.    The chief of Army staff said the lifting of the sanctions  was  necessary to enhance the contributions of the Armed Forces to  the United Nations peacekeeping operation. He again assured the  international community that the present administration had  commenced the process of democratization to return the country  to complete civil rule.</p>

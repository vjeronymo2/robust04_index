			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / OECD warns Russian R&amp;D network crumbling RUSSIAN research and development, once the largest system of scientific research in the world, is now in 'profound crisis', according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The report, by a group of western experts, says that many institutions are now on the verge of collapse, that the break-up of the Soviet Union has severed links between parts of the same research institutes and that young researchers are either leaving or refusing to join institutes because of low pay and morale. The rapidity of the decline in funding and projects, especially in the military sphere which accounted for more than 70 per cent of all R&amp;D, has left politicians and administrators with a huge problem of redefining priorities. The Russian Academy of Science, the most prestigious centre for basic research, has seen its budget decline by 2.5 times in real terms between 1990 and 1992. The report says that R&amp;D investment (corrected to OECD norms) accounted for 2.1 per cent of gross domestic product in 1990, falling to 1.4 per cent in 1991. Of the estimated 950,000 people working in R&amp;D in Russia (excluding space research) in 1991, 200,000-300,000 people have left the system, with further cuts expected. The 'brain drain' has, so far, not been very large - with an estimated 30,000 people leaving to work abroad since 1990. The continuing domination of the military sector, accustomed to working with large budgets and no cost constraints, means that the introduction of an innovation system based on interactions between science and the marketplace 'will be slow and difficult'. The space sector, an area of excellence, employs some 1m workers, of whom more than half were in R&amp;D. However, recent budget reductions have been substantial. The report recommends a range of changes, focusing on continued opening up of the sector to international co-operation and a reduction in secrecy.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 7, 1984, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 81&hyph;08&hyph;02 R2, Amendment No. 39&hyph;4817 (49 FR 7361; February 29, 1984), to require initial and repetitive inspections of 9th through 12th stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disks at the tierod holes in Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines. That action was prompted by cracks in the tierod holes in HPC disks that resulted in engine failures. That condition, if not corrected, can result in uncontained fractures of 9th through 12th stage HPC disks and engine failure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 30, 1984, the FAA issued a correction to AD 81&hyph;08&hyph;02 R2, Amendment 39&hyph;4817 (49 FR 35618; September 11, 1984), to include an engine model that had been inadvertently omitted from the AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since issuance of AD 81&hyph;08&hyph;02 R2, the FAA received a report of an uncontained fracture of a 10th stage HPC disk. This disk had been subjected to three previous on-wing ultrasonic inspections prior to fracture. This method has since been determined as inadequate for detecting tierod hole cracking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 8, 1989, the FAA issued an NPRM that was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (54 FR 22306; May 23, 1989), that would have amended the existing AD by eliminating the optional on-wing ultrasonic inspection of the 10th stage HPC disk, and by including an engine model inadvertently omitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has determined that the reference to the inadvertently omitted engine model was unnecessary, as the FAA had remedied this discrepancy in the August 30, 1984, correction. Also, the FAA now utilizes a revised format that supersedes existing AD's by publishing a complete document rather than only amending applicable paragraphs of the compliance section. This document, therefore, reprints the corrected AD compliance section text in its entirety for clarity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the FAA has changed the format of the proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is desirable to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 200 engines which would be affected by this AD, and the FAA has determined that eliminating the optional on-wing ultrasonic inspection would have negligible economic impact, since most operators use uninstalled tenth stage disk inspections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

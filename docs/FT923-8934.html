			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Pre-tax falls at Veba on higher turnover VEBA, one of Germany's largest industrial companies, with activities ranging from chemicals and energy to trading and retailing, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down 13.9 per cent to DM889m (from DM1.03bn) in the first six months of the year. However, turnover rose by 12.4 per cent to DM33.55bn, mainly as the result of acquisitions. Mr Kiran Bhojani, recently appointed head of investor relations at the Duseldorf-based conglomerate, explained that, but for a number of specific exceptional factors, pre-tax profits would, in fact, have risen by 7.5 per cent. Heavy depreciation associated with new investments, combined with pension provisions and provisions for the costs of redundancies in the chemicals division, absorbed a total of DM222m which was charged 'above the line' to the profit and loss account. A substantial proportion of the total would have no impact on cash flow, Mr Bhojani said. The company gave no divisional breakdown of profits, indicating only in general terms that the chemicals division - where turnover climbed by half a per cent to DM5.33bn - lost money in the first half, partly because of poor market conditions but also because of extensive rationalisation measures. There was also a 'considerable decline' in profits in the oil division, despite a 6.6 per cent increase in turnover to DM6.56bn. The company said it had been impossible to reach the prior-year level, which had benefited through special factors connected with the Gulf war. There was unlikely to be any notable earnings improvement over the course of the year as a whole in these two divisions, Veba warned. The service businesses improved total turnover by 25.4 per cent to DM15.62bn. Veba said profits here were pleasing, especially in the construction materials handling sector which profited from the construction boom in the eastern part of the country. The increase in turnover reflected the acquisition of Schenker-Rhenus, a transport company bought last year. Capital investment in the first half was DM1.83bn, up from DM1.63bn last year.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview arranged by Yang Ma-li (2799 3854 0448) and Liang </F> Chung-wei (2733 0022 0251): "P'eng Ming-min: Hope To Bring  Taiwan a Little Bit of Idealism"]    [Text] [Excerpts] From overseas critic to becoming  someone who could compete for the presidency, former Taiwan  University political department chairman P'eng Ming-min [1756  2494 2404] in a special Tienhsia magazine interview  relates the development of his thinking in the over a year that  he has been back in Taiwan and his reflections on Taiwan's  political situation.    Question: What are your impressions of Taiwan  after being back over a year?    Answer: I feel that the whole society appears to  be lawless. Whether in daily life or in the state of mind, or in  achieving goals it appears that they can be unscrupulous. Also  the whole society is pursuing money. Even the Democratic  Progressive Party (DPP) by existing in the society cannot  completely escape the influence of this social atmosphere. So,  we say that the DPP is becoming more and more like the  Kuomintang (KMT). When it was founded, the party was modeled on  the KMT. It also has a central standing committee and the  central standing committee meets on Wednesday. Even its policies  are becoming closer and closer to those of the KMT. [passage  omitted.]    Question: After you returned to the country, you  went to several places helping in the election of DPP  candidates. What did you learn from this?    Answer: All together I helped in the election of  three public officials. I am not a member of the DPP, but I  believe that if Taiwan democracy is to get on track, it is  necessary to have a relatively strong opposition party.  Following this thinking, I went everywhere to help in the  election of DPP candidates. Naturally, I could not help those  who were too lacking in image. I wanted to hear DPP audiences  and I think that at first I was relatively supportive of the DPP  and relatively interested in current events. The occasion were  all very enthusiastic, it is just that I do not know how big a  share of the people of the countryside they make up.    For example, the day that the campaign office for the  reelection of Su Chen-ch'ang, the former county executive of  P'ing-tung County, was established, more than 30,000 people  participated. The scene was so enthusiastic, but he still was  defeated. There also was the scene for Hua-lien's Ch'en  Yung-hsing. I also went twice. The scene was very moving. There  was a graduate of the chemical engineering department of Taiwan  University in his forties who had never before participated in  politics, but he ran up on the stage to help in Ch'en  Yung-hsing's election. He spoke and really moved people. I also  did not understand why Ch'en Yung-hsing later trailed the KMT  candidate by more than 40,000 votes. I think vote buying could  certainly have had an influence on the election.    There is nothing wrong with everyone's being enthusiastic  about the election. The problem is that the election turned out  this way. How many hundred million yuan must be spent to elect a  legislator? This is twisted. What meaning is there to this kind  of election? If Americans or Japanese heard that several hundred  million had to be spent to elect a Taiwan legislator, they  simply would have no way to imagine it. Moreover, this does not  help democracy in the least. However, there is a saying, when  things get their worst, they cannot get any worse, they can only  turn around, there is no where to go. I hope that the benefits  from vote buying will slowly diminish and ultimately no one will  buy votes.    Also, there is Taiwan's county executive and mayoralty  elections. Actually it is like TIENHSIA magazine pointed out  last year in its article ("Behind County Executive and Mayoralty  Elections---Contending To Grab Land Wealth," November Issue). It  is to fight for municipal planning rights and making money by  speculating on land. When I went to Tainan's Yung-k'ang County  to help in the election, I heard that a candidate wanted to  spend 1 billion. He certainly would be elected. I also heard  that the mayor of a rather large city after he was elected  looked for places to redo the municipal plan. In the 4 billion  plan, the mayor himself would take 500 million.    Question: You have sacrificed and strived your  whole life for Taiwan democracy. What are your feelings when you  see these things?    Answer: I feel that it is very ironic and very  distressing. Before I returned home, I was in contact with  several friends who often went in and out of Taiwan and had a  good understanding of Taiwan. They laughed at me and said, "Are  the Taiwan people worth the sacrifice that you are making? If  you went to see, you would know." Also once at a public lecture  in Hawaii with an audience of 300 or 400, someone stood up and  said that what I said was very right, very ideal, and very  reasonable, but if you went back to Taiwan and said these  things, everyone would laugh at you. He asked what kind of a  society is Taiwan now? He said, if you did not yield on the  road, the cars would crush you to death. Taiwan is a dog eat dog  society. I had no way to reply to him. I said to him that this  society still needs a fool saying some foolish things.    Taiwan is a society totally lacking in idealism. If you talk  about ideals, people would say that this is because you do not  understand reality. When I returned, I assumed it had a little  bit of significance, if only to see if I could arouse some  idealism. Talking this way people could think that I am too  naive, but this is exactly what I think. Taiwan's frame of mind,  character, and sentiments are all extremely low, and no one has  the ability to reflect. It is as if they cannot stop and think  and visualize themselves. Everything appears to be a sham.    Question: What should an ideal society be?    Answer: Democracy is one ideal, and establishing a  clean, fair, just, and harmonious society also is an ideal.    The pursuit of ideals sounds very far off. For example, in  pursuing democracy we will never reach perfection, but we can  gradually improve on various defects and become a society that  is a little less defective. American black people have already  been free 100 or 200 years and discrimination against black  people still has not been resolved, but it is generally much  better than fifty or one hundred years ago. Kindergarten  children have begun to have it instilled in them that they  cannot discriminate on the basis of race.    Question: Taiwan has so many problems. Where do  you think the greatest problem or the greatest challenge is?    Answer: I do not think that there is only one. I  am not an expert in environmental protection or the economy, but  both of these are very important. Taiwan's environmental  protection problem is very serious. In Taiwan I am most  concerned about food. We do not know if the vegetables and fish  that we eat are safe or not. But the average person does not  feel that the environmental protection issue is urgent. I  recently saw a report that said that Asia's environmental  pollution is the most serious, more serious than any place else.  Someone has studied Thai children's intelligence quotients.  Because of lead poisoning, they are at least four points lower  than normal children. Taiwan also could have this problem. We  should study it. I personally have always been interested in  politics. If you ask me what is Taiwan's most important issue, I  think that it is relations with the mainland. This involves our  existence. [passage omitted.]    I am very concerned as regards our stand after the  government  and society have decided to persist in safeguarding our  sovereignty. Have they thought it out extremely carefully? The  Chinese Communist policy calling for unity and calling for one  country, two systems could threaten the future existence of all  Taiwan's residents. But what is Taiwan's policy toward the  mainland? It would not threaten the Chinese Communists in the  least. So, Taiwan must be extremely careful and deal with  mainland relations cautiously.    What makes me extremely sad and uneasy is that even our  leaders often say that wherever the Chinese Communists' bottom  line is, we do not want to touch it, especially after they  issued the Taiwan White Paper. But what I want to ask is, where  is our bottom line? If we do not have a bottom line, forget  about a clear-cut surrender.    In the past, Taiwan spent several hundreds of billions every  year on national defense, and in the 1960s every year 80 percent  of the national budget was invested in national defense, buying  weapons and training a large army to fight the Chinese  Communists. But now it appears that they have leapt to the other  extreme. If they take a little action, they are afraid that the  Chinese Communists will get angry. Do we not even have the  capability to protect ourselves? Where did those large armies  run off to? When a society's basic rights are threatened,  including its sense of value, education and culture, economy,  and life style, if it does not decide to rise to its own  defense, this society is not qualified to exist. This is not  favoring war, but no matter what this determination must be  maintained. A country such as Finland only has a population of 4  million, but when it stood up to defend itself and protect its  religion, lifestyle, and concepts, even the Soviet Union had no  choice.    What I would like to ask is why people now do not identify  with this government and this place? The government's past style  did not have public trust. Everything that they said was false  and it caused people to become very cynical. As when they spoke  for several decades about counterattacking the mainland,  essentially no one believed it. As a result, it was one thing in  public and another thing in private and they could not foster  everyone's patriotism.    In January of this year before leaving the United States, I  had a discussion with Taiwan overseas students. They said that  from the time that they were small, at home they heard about  engineering fraud cases. They were used to hearing it and  believed that it was true, but they would not get indignant.  They only asked if they could profit to some extent from it.  They did not have a concept of right and wrong.    Question: So, how should it be improved? Where  will the way out for Taiwan be?    Answer: Everyone says that we should begin with  national education, and I agree. But the biggest problem is that  Taiwan does not have idealism. National leaders should no longer  engage in factional struggles, but they should arouse ideals.  National goals should be determined, whether they are democracy,  fairness, or cleanliness, you should make people feel that you  are doing something real and that leaders really mean this in  reforming the mood of society. They speak this way now, but they  do not have public confidence. No one believes them. They think  that they are speaking slogans. Perhaps President Lee Teng-hui  is too busy with many problems, but he should emphasize it more.    For example, the government speaks publicly against using  bribery to win elections, but in fact all the KMT candidates buy  votes. When they are nominated, they also look to see how much  money they have. If the upper echelon leaders speak, but do not  act, the common people can see it.    It is as if no one can see hope, even the DPP are about the  same. Unless a group has a great deal of determination, it will  be influenced by the mood of society. The DPP themselves also  acknowledge that they have been greatly influenced by the mood  of society and are slowly losing their idealism.    Question: So, what should everyone do? Where is  Taiwan's future?    Answer: Actually every problem by no means has a  specific cure, and my thinking about Taiwan's future is no  secret. First we must preserve Taiwan's present sovereignty and  seek the most suitable method to get along with the Chinese  Communists. I am not so pessimistic on this point.    [Passage omitted.]    There also is what I call "the externally oriented economy  and the internally oriented politics." The economy develops  externally and politics should not always be entangled with the  Chinese Communists. We should spare no effort to improve on  internal politics and systems. Internal improvement also is an  assurance for Taiwan and lets the whole world see improvements  in Taiwan living standard, society, and government based on the  will of the people.    Question: Is the present government not already  based on the will of the people?    Answer: What we should ask about is not form, but  content. In form we have elections, but what kind of elections?  How much does it cost to elect a legislator? In the United  States or Japan it would be unimaginable. There also are a great  many landed people who even get involved in the election to  protect their own land.    There also is the question of what the government of the  "Republic of China" indicates. Does it still include the  mainland and Outer Mongolia? A government must have a clear  definition. We should pursue a truly fair, open, and clean  society. This is our bottom line. It is not a national flag and  it is not the issue of a name. In its system the government  should do a great many things. Whether the president is directly  elected or not is not necessarily the most important. Besides  ideals there are several more practical and realistic issues.    Question: How do you place your own role? Will you  get directly involved in politics or not?    Answer: I study politics and criticize from a  political perspective. I do not necessarily want to directly  participate in political activities. My foundation has just been  established. Later we can conduct some more scholarly symposia.  As most symposia now generally seek mostly famous people to come  and talk, they very seldom ask young people to come and express  their views on the mainland issue, and environmental protection  and women's issues. So, I intend to ask many more of these young  people to come and talk about what they think after all.    Question: Since the break up of the Soviet Union,  United States-Japanese relations have changed and relations with  the mainland also have changed. What opportunities does Taiwan  have in this kind of situation? Is this beneficial to Taiwan or  not? [passage omitted.]    Answer: In the present world the most important  issue still is the economy. No matter what Taiwan's politics are  like, how much status it has internationally completely depends  on economics. The government must give absolute priority to  economics and use economics to lead politics. How do we continue  to develop the economy? Do we have this kind of power or can we  play some role between the United States and Japan? A policy  such as the southern orientation should have been promoted early  on. We should not concentrate all of our investment in the  mainland. Although I suspect that it is a little late to promote  it now, it is still good.    Question: Might you come out and run for president?    Answer: I am still evaluating and considering  that. If I really want to come out, I will need a great deal of  courage, to pay a big price, and even have a spirit of  sacrifice. But no matter what, I must make people feel that a  new era has begun with a completely different way of doing  things than in the past. The important thing for me to consider  now is whether I have this capability to change society. The KMT  president still is doing rather well. It will still be very hard  for the opposition party president to do, even if he is elected.  But basically I still feel rather comfortable being a scholar.</p>

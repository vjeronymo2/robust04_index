			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INJURED EMPLOYEE OUT OF HOSPITAL  </P> <P> The last of three men injured by a recent release of toxic gas at the Mobil  refinery was released Thursday from Torrance Memorial Hospital.  </P> <P> A hospital spokesman said Herbert Delome, a contract employee who had been  hospitalized since Monday, had recovered from symptoms of nausea, respiratory  distress and eye irritation.  </P> <P> Delome and two other employees of Serv-Tech Inc. were caught in a cloud of  vapors after an accidental release at the refinery's alkylation unit Monday  night. The other two men were released from the hospital Wednesday.  </P> <P> Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti said the release was a mixture of ammonia fumes,  which are toxic, and a nontoxic chemical compound commonly called ammonium  fluoride, which is formed by hydrofluoric acid and ammonia.  </P> <P> Carbonetti said refinery employees did not obtain samples of the cloud, which  workers described as dense, white, ground-hugging vapors.  </P> <P> The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Torrance  Fire Department are investigating the accident as a release of hydrofluoric  acid. Hydrofluoric acid is more than 15 times as incapacitating as ammonia,  according to federal safety standards. George Stein  </P></p>

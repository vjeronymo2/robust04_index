The poll, carried out in the third week of March, i.e.  after the no-confidence vote in Meciar, found that twenty-four  percent of respondents said they would vote HZDS, whereas in  January the party polled 17 percent.    The second most popular party was still the Democratic Left  Party (SDL), which is in the post-Meciar government coalition,  but its popularity has slipped from 11 percent in January to 10  today. The Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) attracted seven  percent support, the same as in January.    The remaining parties all received less than the five  percent  that would be required for participation in parliament. The  newly formed left-wing Association of Slovak Workers (SDS) and  the Slovak National Party (SNS), coalition partner in the former  Meciar government, both received four percent, as did the  right-wing Democratic Party (DS).    The new party created by ex-HZDS deputy and former foreign  minister Milan Knazko, the Alliance of Democrats (AD) was  favored by three percent of the respondents, as were the Greens  (SZ) and Egyutteles, the Hungarian minority party. One-time  economy minister and former SNS chairman Ludovit Cernak's new  party, the National Democratic Party (NDS), received the support  of one percent of respondents.    The ousted premier was also judged to be the most  trustworthy  Slovak politician by 26 percent, four percent more than in  January. Meciar shares this distinction, however, with the man  seen at least partly for his downfall, President Michal Kovac  (26 percent).    Third most trusted was current Premier Jozef Moravcik, who  rose from 4 percent in January to 18 percent in March. Peter  Weiss, SDL chairman, was backed by 12 percent, while  Vice-Premier Roman Kovac was most trusted by 6 percent. About  one fifth of those polled did not trust any Slovak politicians.</p>

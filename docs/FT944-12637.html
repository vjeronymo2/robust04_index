			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Bidders for Coal Products chosen British Coal yesterday announced the four companies it has shortlisted to bid in the second stage of the sale of Coal Products, its smokeless fuels subsidiary. It said it expected to complete the privatisation in three months. The shortlisted companies are: Anglo United, which already has a significant share of the market through its Coalite product; a management buy-in team led by NatWest Ventures; a management buy-out team led by Mr David Foster, Coal Products operations director; and Coal Developments, a company set up by Mr David McErlain, former chairman of Anglo United, and Sir Harry Solomon, former chairman of Hillsdown Holdings. Coal Products is British Coal's second-biggest non-mining subsidiary, making products including Homefire for the domestic market and Phurnacite for industry. Last year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 16m on turnover of Pounds 131m. The company estimates that it has 30 per cent of the UK solid smokeless fuel market and 60 per cent of the UK foundry coke market. It has four main plants. The shortlisted companies were selected from 10 which made preliminary offers. Final offers are due to be submitted by mid-December. British Coal and its adviser Price Waterhouse Corporate Finance will then choose a bidder with a view to competing the sale by mid-January. The government said yesterday that Pounds 200m worth of work on new technologies to burn coal more efficiently and make it more environmentally acceptable had been initiated under its clean coal technology programme. Mr Ian Taylor, technology minister, said the development of clean coal technologies was important to maintain a central role for coal in meeting the UK's long-term energy needs. The government yesterday published a report setting out its objectives in the clean coal programme.</p>

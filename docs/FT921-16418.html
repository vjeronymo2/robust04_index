			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Observer: Bundesbank politicking When Helmut Schlesinger took over the reins as president of the Bundesbank in August, his reputation as a monetary hardliner went before him. But it seems he has been finding it less than easy to establish a policy-making consensus at the fortnightly monetary policy council meetings; some of his council members are even more hawkish than he. The shock decision on December 19 to raise the Lombard rate by a full half point was apparently made against the advice of both Schlesinger and his deputy Hans Tietmeyer. Both men had favoured nudging Lombard up just a quarter of a point - thereby hoping to avoid a rumpus with Germany's foreign partners - but were overruled by the rest of the council. With the death last February of Ottomar Werthmoller, the directorate member responsible for administration, followed by Karl Otto Pohl's resignation in the summer, there has been a significant shift in the balance of power on the council. Neither has been replaced, so that the formerly seven-man central directorate has dwindled to just five, leaving Schlesinger and Tietmeyer - and the three other officials - clearly outnumbered by the 11 regional central bank chiefs, who have become greatly more outspoken and independent during the last decade. One reason for foot-dragging by the Christian Democrat-led government in Bonn is that tradition dictates it must choose at least one Social Democrat for the directorate. All the remaining five are either members of, or politically close to, parties within Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition - whereas Pohl was a social democrat. One candidate who would fit the bill to replace Werthmoller is Werner Schulz, president of the Schleswig-Holstein regional central bank. His current position is due to be rationalised away under a controversial Bundesbank streamlining plan. As well as being an SPD man he is also an ex-commercial banker - he therefore differs from most newly imported Bundesbankers by actually knowing something about running the inside of a financial institution.</p>

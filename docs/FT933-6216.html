			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Themes miss the note - Richard Fairman takes the Festival to task over its music programme / The Edinburgh Festival WHAT DOES it take to make a music festival in 1993? As the second week of the Edinburgh Festival comes to its close, the programme may look as full and varied as ever, the audiences are up, but a sinking feeling has set in. The music has simply not been strong enough. These days, image, integrity - call it what you will - is essential. Driven by the need to attract the affluent, music-loving tourist, cities throughout Europe have been starting up festivals at an unsustainable speed. Those which will survive and prosper are the ones which have something special to offer. Glyndebourne, Bregenz, Bayreuth keep to opera, where the real money is; some modestly restrict themselves to chamber music. For the other big festivals the challenge is to adapt and change - and that is not easy. Look at the problems Salzburg is encountering as it tries to re-focus its position after decades of stagnation. Everybody in Scotland can heave a sigh of relief. Edinburgh's problems are not on that scale. It is a long time since this was a festival of the rich and famous, where the music can hardly be heard for the tinkle of jewellery and the rustle of furs. Fees commanded by top artists have made the old Salzburg-style festival barely feasible any more. In most years Edinburgh makes the focus of its music programming a central theme. This is a sensible policy: it means each festival is different and events which might otherwise look uninviting take on extra relevance in the context of the overall package. This year, the second under Brian McMaster as Festival Director, there are three themes: Schubert and Janacek 'juxtaposed'; Verdi 'from first to last'; and James MacMillan 'his music in focus' - in principle, a good mix. Why, then, do I declare this festival's music to be a disappointment? There have, after all, been successes, such as the concert performance of Mozart's Cos fan tutte, the vocal recitals by Sylvia McNair and Thomas Hampson, the concert by the Oslo Philharmonic and Mariss Jansons. But these were one-off events. None of them was special to Edinburgh 1993. The Verdi theme is a non-starter. Only three operas on offer, Oberto (his earliest) in a concert performance, a modest new I due Foscari and Falstaff (his last) in a revival of a familiar production by Welsh National Opera: Verdi 'from first to last' perhaps, but with precious little in between. The retrospective of James MacMillan, Scotland's leading young composer, has probably been the most well-balanced theme. Unfortunately, the big one is the Schubert and Janacek series, and that has proved crucially flat. Each half of it looks to me an opportunity missed. So much of Schubert's greatest music lies in the area of chamber-music and song that there was the chance to put on high-class events at relatively low cost. One imagines, for example, a series of song recitals with the great Schubertians of the day: Schreier, Fassbaender, Margaret Price. In Janacek's case the fare has been variable - no operas (a serious omission), decent coverage of the orchestral works, some interesting rarities. But the BBC's Janacek Festival at the Barbican earlier this year put on just as much and performed it just as well. Here lies the nub of the problem. Day-to-day concert programming throughout the year is growing more adventurous. The Barbican's own mini-festivals devoted to Britten, Stravinsky, Scandinavian music and so on, have been so exhaustive, so far-reaching, that it is difficult for Edinburgh to go any further. What can be done? The first thing I have missed is performers who really have something to say about the featured composers. If Janacek is to be the theme, then why not Mackerras, sadly restricted here to just a couple of pieces? (His performance of the Glagolitic Mass a couple of years ago was a more memorable Janacek experience than the sum of all we have had so far.) If Schubert, then a leading string quartet; or perhaps Graham Johnson, to draw on the singers of his Schubert Lieder Edition on record. Salzburg has turned to Harnoncourt. Others have looked to John Eliot Gardiner. These are the thinking musicians who can turn a mere series of concerts into a vision. Secondly, however expensive, however troublesome, there have to be more staged productions which are unique to Edinburgh, or at least to Britain. (This year's theatre programme has forged links with Salzburg, which may be a way forwards.) In 1994 the re-built Empire Theatre will be ready, the home for the large-scale theatre and opera productions that the festival has needed for so long. McMaster, in his last post an enormously successful and imaginative head of WNO, will then have his hands tied by only one constraint - lack of money. With the Scottish Arts Council soon to enjoy more independence and a substantial sum expected from the proceeds of the National Lottery, there is the prospect of some improvement to the finances. I can think of no better investment for the future than a fund to allow one or two major stage productions at the festival each year. There is no other festival quite like Edinburgh. It should be Scotland's pride and joy.</p>

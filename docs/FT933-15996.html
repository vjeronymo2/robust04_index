			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove advances 35% to Pounds 7.6m BROMSGROVE Industries, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering conglomerate, increased annual profits by 35 per cent and yesterday reported that order books generally were improving. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.61m for the 12 months to March 31 compared with Pounds 5.64m last time, restated for FRS 3. Fully diluted earnings per share, however, were 0.8p lower at 7.75p on capital enlarged by the 1992 rights issue. A recommended final dividend of 2.75p brings the total for the year to 4.4p (4p). The results reflected the acquisition in 1992 of Thornton, which led to a near doubling of turnover in the aerospace division to Pounds 16.2m. Total turnover was Pounds 110.9m against a restated Pounds 90.1m. The aerospace division's operating profits rose proportionately and there were increases also in the marine &amp; offshore, plastics and environmental divisions. Operating profits were lower in the automotive and general industrial divisions as the markets in continental Europe weakened. Bromsgrove has grown steadily by acquisition in specialist engineering markets but this stage of its development appears to be ending. Mr Bijan Sedghi, chairman, said 'the range of activities is likely to become narrower as we concentrate upon a specialist and carefully selected operational portfolio which will form the basis of core activities.' He added that some peripheral operations could be sold in a divestment programme over the next three years. Mr Sedghi was confident about the medium and longer term but said the short term was 'still not easy to predict.' For all that, he noted that order books were improving and drew attention to plans for expansion in the Far East and the US. 'The economic conditions governing the markets in which we operate are showing signs of gentle but gradual improvement,' he said.</p>

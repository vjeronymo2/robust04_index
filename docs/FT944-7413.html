			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (8): Life offices hope for new business from pensions - The insurers: casualties are possible Bad news is proving to be good business for Italy's insurance sector, with factors ranging the funding crisis of the country's state pensions system to the war in Bosnia helping to raise profitability. However, with European-wide liberalisation and the increasing incursion of banks into the sector, competition is increasing sharply; and, despite the upturn, the industry could see some casualties in the next few years. Italy's life assurance chiefs hope that the state's difficulties in continuing to fund pension provision will mean that more Italians will turn to them for savings plans and pension policies. Already growth has been rapid, increasing by between 10 and 15 per cent over the past five years, following even quicker growth in the early 1980s. Even though spending per head on premiums has doubled since 1988, the industry remains underdeveloped by European standards. Per capita premiums of only Dollars 161 in 1991, an amount equivalent to 0.7 per cent of GDP, compared with 1.1 per cent for Spain and 7 per cent in the UK. Recent growth has been underpinned by rapid expansion of the bancassurance phenomenon, with most of the country's biggest companies forming links with banks, and a number of banks themselves forming their own life assurance subsidiaries. Banks now sell some 30 per cent of new life premiums, and are expected to increase that share to 50 per cent by the end of the century. In the non-life sector, the turmoil in the former Yugoslavia is one of several reasons why claims costs are falling. Military action is acting as a deterrent to car thieves who previously drove stolen Italian cars across that territory to the east. The epidemic of car theft which hit Italian insurers hard in the early 1990s has shifted to Germany and France as a result of the war. 'The war in Yugoslavia has closed the main door for car theft,' says Mr Pier Giorgio Bedogni, a senior executive with SAI, the country's fourth largest company and a leader in the motor business. The improvement also reflects a general economic slowdown, which has led drivers to make fewer journeys, and a decline in the number of motorists driving leased cars. Mr Bedogni says that the war campaign against Mafia-inspired violence has helped to reduce crime, especially in some southern cities where there is a military presence on the streets. The fall in claims costs is contributing to a steady improvement in non-life market underwriting results after a period of poor performance across the market at the end of the 1980s. In addition, although Italian companies have only recently been completely freed from government restrictions, premium rates have risen over the past two years. Mr Bedogni says that, following rises in the non-compulsory classes, which cover damage to the car itself, Italian motor premiums are now among the most expensive in Europe. Further improvement seems likely. Rate increases averaging 10 per cent have been introduced across the motor market this summer, following the approval of the European Union's third non-life directive. Hitherto, rates in the compulsory third-party motor liability market - which generates an estimated 45 per cent of non-life premiums - had been subject to government control. Although this should all be good news for the industry as a whole, there is general agreement that competition is intensifying and that many smaller companies, among the 300 or so which populate the market, may be unable to retain their independence. In the life sector, in particular, traditionally high margins - up to three times those achieved by more efficient French and British companies - are under severe pressure. Typically, Italian life insurers have distributed only 70 to 80 per cent of life fund investment returns to policyholders, retaining up to 30 per cent as profits. Life insurers elsewhere in Europe typically retain only 10 per cent. Companies dependent on agents or financial advisers for their sales could come under especially severe pressure, since banks are able to sell policies with significantly lower overheads. The privatisation of the Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni (INA), the former government-owned company which was partially privatised this year, should be completely in private hands by the spring of next year - a sale which will, at least indirectly, spur competition. In the past, existing Italian companies have been obliged to cede 10 per cent of premiums - and new entrants 30 per cent of premiums - to INA. In the non-life market, there are signs that Italian insurers are beginning to make more use of technology in the way they assess risks, a development which should favour those companies big enough to make the necessary capital investment. For example, although differences in rates have traditionally depended on the power of the car and where it is based, some companies are now taking into account the risk factors associated with the driver, varying charges according to age, sex and occupation. Significantly, Generali, the country's largest company, has launched a pilot direct-writing operation, selling motor insurance directly to the public by telephone along lines pioneered by companies such as Direct Line in the UK.</p>

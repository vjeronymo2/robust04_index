			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Waste Management in reshape WASTE Management, the US international environmental services company, is to consolidate portions of three of its engineering and waste handling offshoots to form a new company, Rust International. If the deal goes ahead the new concern would become one the US's largest waste handling and consulting companies. Included in the new company will be Wheelabrator Technologies' recently formed international engineering unit based in London. The move will streamline the company and form a single unit that can deliver environmental consulting, clean-up, disposal, design and construction services. Analysts say Waste Management, with projected earnings of Dollars 956m for 1992, had found its maze of semi-independent subsidiary companies was interfering with its ability to bid efficiently on contracts for government and international work. Mr. Dean Buntrock, Waste Management president, said there was a significant market emerging for environmental project management and services in the US and abroad. 'With Rust International, we create a strong financial and operations group through which we can more effectively market and deliver our services.' The new company, to be headquartered in Birmingham, Ala., will absorb Waste Management's subsidiary, The Brand Companies. Brand shareholders will have the option to receive cash for their Brand shares or stock in the new organisation. Parts of Waste Management's Wheelabrator Technologies unit will be go into Rust International, as will parts of Chemical Waste Management. Chemical Waste, which earned Dollars 101m on sales of Dollars 1.34bn last year, despite payouts for some costly environmental lawsuits, will contribute its 12 per cent interest in Waste Management International Plc to the deal, as well as its CWM Remedial Services Group. Waste Management said it expected Rust to have 1993 revenues of about Dollars 1.8bn.</p>

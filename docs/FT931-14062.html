			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Two five-year dollar offerings find favour with investors A FURTHER deluge of paper hit the Eurobond market yesterday, despite the fact that some areas of the market are overloaded due to the heavy supply so far this year. The dollar market remains in good shape, having largely avoided the oversupply and aggressive pricing apparent in some other sectors. In addition, the depth of demand for dollar bonds, with European investors increasingly positive on the currency, has meant that paper has been quickly absorbed. Two five-year offerings - a Dollars 300m deal for General Electric Capital Corporation arranged by Swiss Bank Corporation and a Dollars 250m issue for Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone via Merrill Lynch - were quickly snapped up by investors. Both deals carried coupons of 6 per cent and were considered fairly priced to yield 25 basis points and 24 basis points respectively over the comparable US Treasury. Two more borrowers tapped the Eurosterling market yesterday, despite signs that investor interest is becoming more selective. According to dealers, as much as half of last week's supply, totalling close to Pounds 700m, is yet to be placed. However, SmithKline Beecham's Pounds 100m five-year issue managed to catch investors' attention, even though the pricing was considered on the tight side, with a spread of 75 basis points over the five-year gilt. In common with most of last week's five-year paper, the issue matures towards the end of 1998. Due to the steepness of the yield curve, the spread appears more generous when compared with the five-year benchmark gilt, which matures in March 1998. However, the deal benefited from being SmithKline's first Eurosterling offering, since the name is well-liked by both UK and continental European investors. The proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating-rate dollars, and will be used to refinance US commercial paper. The financing met SmithKline's target for five-year funding of 7 1/2 basis points above the London interbank offered rate, according to a company official. A Pounds 100m issue of 10-year bonds for Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest company, was considered more difficult to place, due to credit concerns exacerbated by the long maturity. However, although Norsk Hydro's debt rating has fallen to A3 by Moody's and A- by Standard and Poor's, the US ratings agencies, the fact the company is 51 per cent owned by the Norwegian government reassured some investors. Dealers said the steep yield curve has encouraged yield-hungry investors to buy longer-dated bonds, but added they were generally focusing on slightly stronger credits. The deal was priced to yield 115 basis points over the 10 per cent gilt due 2003 and swapped into floating-rate sterling. Elsewhere, the Asian Development Bank's expected Y50bn issue via IBJ International met strong demand, particularly in Asia. The deal, priced to yield 50 basis points over the comparable JGB, was the first 10-year offering since last March, which had created pent-up demand for a new 10-year benchmark. In the D-Mark sector, the Republic of Turkey returned to the market for the first time since last July, with a DM400m, seven-year, 9 1/2 per cent issue through DG Bank. Bankers said the spread looked fair at around 255 basis points over German government bonds and the bonds sold well. Given the widespread expectation that Germany will cut its interest rates, the high yield proved attractive to retail investors. The buyers targeted included the large Turkish community in Germany and banks which will swap the bonds for floating rate assets (a process known as asset-swapping). The Council of Europe's DM200m 10-year deal showed reverse floating-rate notes for quality names can still find demand, in spite of the large volume of recent issues, said bankers. The initial coupon looked attractive at 8 1/4 per cent for the first two years, although the terms for the final eight years of 13 per cent minus six-month Libor look less so. Bankers were surprised at the appearance of Rhone-Poulenc's re-opening of a FFr1bn issue launched last November and disappointed with its terms. They had expected it to be postponed after the French government announced on Monday it would continue the group's 'on-off' privatisation by selling 6m of its shares. Lead-manager BNP agreed the terms were more aggressive than those set on the existing issue, but that the issue was targeted specifically at French retail demand. The bonds, launched at a spread of 68 basis over comparable French government bonds, ended the day trading at a spread of around 72 basis points, said BNP. By contrast, the FFr2bn five-year issue for KfW International Finance was well received, despite its aggressive terms. The issue, arranged by Credit Commercial de France, broke syndicate quickly and traded at its launch spread of 22 basis points over government bonds.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIAL 'H' FOR HEADACHE;  </P> <P> COMMUNICATION: AN ESCONDIDO COUPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE EXPANDING THEIR SMALL  BUSINESS WITH A NEW 800 NUMBER. WHAT THEY ARE GETTING INSTEAD IS A PLAGUE OF  WRONG NUMBERS AND MAYBE A HEFTY PHONE BILL.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry, you have the wrong number."  </P> <P> Janice and Joe Maples of Escondido have repeated that phrase hundreds of times  in the past month. It's a pain. But what really hurts is that the calls are  costing them hundreds of dollars and tying up their business phone.  </P> <P> The Mapleses installed an 800 number a month ago in an effort to expand their  small emergency preparedness kit business in Escondido by reaching out to  customers and distributors throughout the country.  </P> <P> "It just triples our sales when we have our 800 number, and when people can get  through," said Janice Maples, who has distributors in four states and sends out  catalogues of their emergency kits.  </P> <P> But, about the same time, New York state's Department of Motor Vehicles began  its own toll-free number for commercial truckers looking for information on  getting a commercial driver's license, a new state requirement.  </P> <P> The number of the New York information line was 1-800-CDL-INFO, but somehow the  number has been getting lost in translation with many truckers dialing  1-800-CDL-HELP, which is the Maples' number.  </P> <P> "These calls start early, early in the morning," said Janice Maples, who with  her husband distributes earthquake preparedness kits containing food, blankets  and sanitary supplies.  </P> <P> "I've had calls as early as 2:45 in the morning from a bus driver who got the  number in a bar," said Janice Maples.  </P> <P> Maples doesn't know exactly how much the mix-up has cost her, but she and her  husband guess it will be more than $1,000, and they are anxiously waiting for  the phone bill to arrive next week.  </P> <P> "We're just starting out, and this is a killer. Things are hard enough as it is  without complications like this," Janice Maples said.  </P> <P> "I know that a man from the Ryder truck line called and told my husband that  they got the number from the DMV. Even the sanitation department of New York  has been calling me."  </P> <P> Maples said she even received a call from a New York trucker saying that the  number was on a freeway billboard near the Pennsylvania border. The DMV has  heard a similar rumor, but has not found the billboard. The DMV said that they  have not used billboards to advertise the information line, only brochures and  posters.  </P> <P> For their part, DMV officials said that all brochures, packets and posters  regarding a commercial driver's license have had the correct number on it, and  that they are not at fault.  </P> <P> "We are not distributing the Mapleses' number," said George Filieau, spokesman  for the DMV. "It is conceivable that our employees confused the suffixes and in  some instances may have given (truckers) that number to call instead of the  correct number."  </P> <P> Filieau said that, once the department became aware of the potential mix-up, it  issued an electronic memo to all of its offices to alert employees that they  may have been giving out the wrong number.  </P> <P> But Janice Maples said the calls have not stopped.  </P> <P> "These people are still giving my number out, and nothing I do works," she  said.  </P> <P> And, although the DMV refuses to accept blame, at least one elected official in  New York offers evidence of the state's mistake and who feels that the DMV owes  the Mapleses.  </P> <P> "This is a total embarrassment to the state of New York," said Francis O'Keefe,  mayor of Glens Falls, N.Y., who found out about the wrong numbers from city  employees who had called the number for information after getting it from the  DMV. "I'm damned mad about it, this shouldn't happen to a small business."  </P> <P> Maples said she received more than one call from truckers in pay phones just  outside DMV offices who had gotten the wrong number from DMV employees.  </P> <P> Maples said that, even if it is just an inadvertent mistake on the part of a  handful of DMV employees, she still should receive restitution.  </P> <P> "What they said is we're sorry, that they realize that this is a mix-up and  that it's costing us money, but they can't get anyone in the upper levels to  give us restitution to us financially," she said. "Their suggestion to us would  be to get an attorney and sue."  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter to me how they got the number, the DMV is responsible for  their people. If my employees did something wrong, it would be a reflection on  me, and I would be responsible for it," she said.  </P> <P> The DMV, however, doesn't see it that way.  </P> <P> Although DMV officials say they sympathize with the Mapleses' position, they  have no plans to compensate them.  </P> <P> Legal action "in fact may be the only alternative because one of the problems  here is how can we authorize New York taxpayer money for payment to a company  that can't verify that these phone calls result from something that the DMV  did," Filieau said. "Who is going to prove that these phone calls resulted from  our employees giving out the number?"  </P> <P> Short of tape recording the phone calls, Filieau said he doesn't see how the  Mapleses could prove that the calls are coming from truckers who have been  misdirected by the DMV as opposed to truckers who may have gotten the numbers  confused themselves or who had seen the number in a different context.  </P> <P> He conceded, however, that it is likely that at least some of the calls that  the Mapleses are getting may have been the result of mistakes by DMV employees.  </P> <P> "We don't think that we've done anything wrong that requires us to compensate  them," Filieau said. "An inadvertent slip of the tongue by an employee, we  don't know that we are responsible for paying that back."  </P> <P> Mayor O'Keefe said he has tried to help by contacting the New York secretary of  state's office, which then contacted the DMV.  </P> <P> "Their response was that they got in touch with Mr. and Mrs. Maples, and  they're trying to straighten out the situation, and they'll get their money  back," O'Keefe said.  </P> <P> But the Mapleses have yet to hear from anyone in the New York DMV.  </P> <P> "They have never called us, all the communication has been one-sided, us  calling them," Janice Maples said.  </P></p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: St Modwen increases dividend despite fall ST MODWEN Properties, the Birmingham-based group with development and investment interests around the UK but outside central London, is increasing its dividend in spite of a 19 per cent fall in annual profits. Pre-tax profits for the year to November 30 were Pounds 1.71m, compared with Pounds 2.11m, on turnover down from Pounds 45.1m to Pounds 18.5m. The directors stated that in 1991 property development sales were abnormally high because of the sale of an office park in Manchester. Mr Stan Clarke, chairman, said he believed that 'property values have generally bottomed out in the regions where the company operates, and I am cautiously optimistic that during 1993 there will be some recovery.' This belief, combined with the fact that the group was now earning enough from the increased rent roll from its investment properties - Pounds 7.5m last year compared with Pounds 6.9m in 1991 - both to cover its interest rate bill and company overheads, led to the increase in the dividend. The distribution is lifted to 0.6p (0.55p). Earnings per share were 1.1p against 1.7p. Valuation of property holdings led to a 9 per cent reduction to 35p in net assets per share. The lower value of its properties, coupled with a slight increase in borrowing because of property acquisitions, pushed gearing over the last financial year up from 88 per cent to 99 per cent. St Modwen has sought in recent years to concentrate on property investment and undertake development only where sales or leasing are assured beforehand. Mr Paul Doona, finance director, said: 'We are now in a position where we make a profit without a need to rely on a development contribution.'</p>

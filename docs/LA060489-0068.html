			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AZUSA SETS HEARING ON OLD WEST PROJECT OWNED BY ITS MAYOR  </P> <P> It looks as if Mayor Eugene F. Moses will soon test the adage, "You can't fight  City Hall."  </P> <P> The city has begun public nuisance proceedings against Moses over a 2.5-acre  Western theme park, which he began building at the mouth of the San Gabriel  Canyon in the 1970s, but never completed or opened.  </P> <P> Within two weeks, there is to be an administrative hearing on alleged Municipal  Code violations at Canyon City Ghost Town. If the city's hearing officer rules  against Moses, the mayor can appeal the matter to the City Council.  </P> <P> In the end, the mayor may have to raze all buildings on the property to comply  with the code.  </P> <P> According to city staff, the ghost town lacks required use and building  permits, adequate parking and landscaping, and proper storage facilities for  materials on the site. It is also in a generally dilapidated state, according  to a "notice of violations and request for corrections" sent to Moses in March.  </P> <P> Under the city code, a property owner who does not correct such violations  would be guilty of a misdemeanor. To comply, Moses was to have bulldozed the  town or to have submitted a new precise plan for the property by last Thursday.  Before approving such a plan, the city could require a list of extensive and  costly repairs.  </P> <P> To date, no updated plans are on file, and Moses said he has no intention of  tearing down the ghost town.  </P> <P> Moses, arguing that the site does not injure the public or the city's image,  accused City Council rivals Tony D. Naranjo and Harry L. Stemrich of  instigating the action to hurt him politically.  </P> <P> "It appears I've been the target of personal vendettas of two council members  because of my political beliefs," Moses said. "It's not fair for them to do  what they're doing to me."  </P> <P> Moses said he has received an attorney's advice that his property is a "legal,  nonconforming use" approved by the county before the land was annexed by the  city in 1974.  </P> <P> </P> <P> City Council Action  </P> <P> Naranjo and Stemrich denied they initiated the action against Moses, saying  that in April the entire City Council told city staff to aggressively pursue  all such violations in the city.  </P> <P> "We said there would be no exceptions for anybody," Naranjo said. "How do we go  out in the community and tell people you have to fix yours up, but we give  council members special favors?"  </P> <P> Naranjo noted that the city has recently pursued similar abatement procedures  against former Councilman Lucio Cruz and the father of Councilman Bruce Latta,  who were forced to tear down buildings deemed public nuisances.  </P> <P> "There are constant complaints about the ghost town," said Stemrich, who noted  that the city has forced the demolition of 36 structures deemed public  nuisances since last July. "He's no different than anybody else."  </P> <P> Under city procedures, City Administrator Julio J. Fuentes will appoint a  senior staff member to act as the hearing officer.  </P> <P> This is not the first time Moses has run afoul of local government.  </P> <P> In late 1987, he fought an unsuccessful battle against the county Fire  Department over the removal of weeds from the back yard of his hillside home.  </P> <P> After receiving repeated warnings and a citation for the pace of his cleanup,  Moses paid $1,000 for county agricultural workers to perform the work. The  citation was eventually revoked.  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Gabriel Canyon Site  </P> <P> Originally intended as a smaller Knott's Berry Farm, Moses' property, at 1755  N. San Gabriel Canyon Road, contains about 16 cabins, stores and shacks  arranged to resemble an Old West town. There is also an assemblage of mostly  authentic relics salvaged from as far away as Montana, Utah and South Carolina.  </P> <P> Moses has declined to estimate how much the construction has cost him over the  years, but has said he did most of the labor himself.  </P> <P> Among the town's relics are a complete blacksmith's shop, a horse-drawn fire  wagon and pieces of Western memorabilia. However, at times, there have also  been junk cars and scrap piles visible from San Gabriel Canyon Road.  </P> <P> The property was annexed by the city in 1974, about two years after the county  gave preliminary approval for the ghost town.  </P> <P> In the mid-1970s, preliminary plans and building permits were approved, but  they lapsed when the work wasn't completed on time, according to the violations  notice, which was signed by Community Development Director Roy E. Bruckner and  Community Improvement Manager David E. Rudisel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Permitted Uses'  </P> <P> "At this point in time there are no permitted uses on the property," the notice  said.  </P> <P> Because there are no valid permits, the buildings have been declared abandoned  and, by legal definition, unsafe.  </P> <P> Last year, Moses attempted to sell the property, initiating a standard review  of city records that is required under city ordinance, Rudisel said. That is  when city officials discovered that no permits had been issued, he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, upon hearing of Moses' intention to sell the property, Stemrich in  January initiated a study on changing the zoning of all property north of  Sierra Madre Boulevard to single-family residences. Stemrich said he was  concerned an apartment or condominium project would go in on the property,  currently zoned commercial-recreational.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Zoning on Hold  </P> <P> Such zoning changes, which could make Moses's site much less valuable, have  been put on hold. The property is north of Sierra Madre Boulevard.  </P> <P> Moses, who said he did not know what the buyer planned for the site, has  claimed that the sale was killed because of Stemrich's action. He has  threatened to sue the city and individual council members.  </P> <P> Temporary county and city permits and plan approvals expired when construction  was not completed on time, according to the March memo to Moses. The mayor said  he never finished construction because the city allowed a large condominium  project to be built near his property, making an amusement park incompatible  with residential uses. "The reason it was never finalized is that they rezoned  it for condos," he said.  </P> <P> Moses acknowledged that some parts of the ghost town are dilapidated. But he  argued that, because it is not open to the public, it does not constitute a  public nuisance.  </P></p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Appointments: Logica loses Hollick An increasingly bulging schedule has prompted Clive Hollick, chief executive of financial services conglomerate MAI and labour peer, to step down as non-executive director of Logica, the computer services company. On Logica's board since 1987, the 46-year old Lord Hollick had been valued for his financial savvy - 'his sharp and open commercial mind', the company says, was a useful balance to the wisdom of the in-house computer boffins. Hollick cites competing claims on his time following his appointment as a non-executive director of British Aerospace. Sir Graham Day, interim chairman of BAe, is deputy chairman of MAI. Hollick is also being kept busy in other directions. Neil Kinnock named him a Labour peer last year, in recognition of his contribution in setting up the left wing think-tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research; and he says he intends to play an active part in the Lords. At the same time, Meridian Broadcasting, which is controlled by MAI, won the south of England franchise in last year's bidding for the re-allocation of commercial television licences; this represents a significant departure for Hollick's business interests. ***** Nicholas Walker is promoted to finance director of MAGNETIC MATERIALS Group. ***** Geoff Thomas has been promoted to sales and marketing director of BOSTIK. ***** David Daley, human resources director of MSAS Cargo International since 1986, is appointed to group personnel director of the OCEAN Group. ***** Jane Tucker is promoted to the board of BURSON-MARSTELLER London. ***** David Fitchett is promoted to finance director of WHOLESALE FITTINGS.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn -- Finance Minister Theo Waigel welcomed the  lowering of the discount rate. "With this, the Bundesbank  continues its course of gradually lowering the interest rate  level in Germany," he said in Bonn. The Bundesbank decision and  the government's consistent austerity and consolidation policy  strengthen the conditions for an inflation-free upward economic  trend. The interest rate reduction is also a call upon the wage  round partners to create favorable conditions for an economic  recovery by concluding agreements that provide stability, Waigel  said.    The German Banking Association spoke of a "decision  appropriate in the current situation." With this, the  Bundesbank continues a successful policy of reducing interest  rates step by step, without creating any confusion in the  capital market or the international financial markets. Like the  Bundesbank, the Banking Association also expects a steadying of  prices in the course of 1994. The Banking Association once  again called on the wage round partners and the financial  policymakers of the federal and laender governments to meet  their responsibilities concerning stability.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview for DAILY NEWS by Laszlo </F> Kovacs, Hungarian Socialist Party nominee for foreign minister;  place and date not given]    [Text] Budapest, 24 Jun (MTI) -- After several weeks of  coalition talks, the Socialist Party nominee for foreign  minister Laszlo Kovacs gave an exclusive interview to the DAILY  NEWS, summing up the major foreign policy trends and objectives  of the future government and describing the differences in  emphasis of the next administration as compared to the foreign  policy of the outgoing conservative coalition cabinet. Earlier  Kovacs was chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the  first freely elected Hungarian Parliament.    In the interview, Kovacs said, ``The number one objective of  foreign policy is to ensure the security of the country. The  second is to help solve economic problems of the country. This  is particularly important in the case of today's Hungary. A  third foreign policy objective is the image of Hungary in the  outside world.    ``As for the immediate priorities of the country's foreign  policy, the first is continuing the efforts to bring Hungary  closer to European integration. This is a matter of strategy.  Number two is achieving a balanced relationship with Hungary's  neighbours. This I would call a matter of urgency. The third  objective is to support Hungarians living outside Hungary in  their efforts to obtain guarantees of their minority rights and  seeing that these rights are implemented. The new government  considers this to be a moral obligation.    ``What is going to change in the relationship of these three  foreign policy priorities? In my opinion, the three priorities  are of equal importance, and there is a close interrelationship  between them. It is unimaginable, and unwise, to subordinate  any of these to the other. I think it was a serious mistake  during the past four years that relations with the neighbours  were of secondary importance as compared to the minority  question. This policy was counter-productive. Relations with  our neighbours have deteriorated, so one of the important  objectives of Hungarian foreign policy was lost in the approach  which was taken to supporting Hungarians outside the borders of  this country. If there is no dialogue, then there is no forum  in which to raise the issues of minority problems.    ``The deterioration of Hungary's relations with her  neighbours has also damaged Hungary's image in the Western  world. Thus, Hungary suffered a reduced amount of international  support for solving the minority problem. Hungarian foreign  policy had no other means to do something for the minorities  than to broadcast very critical television programmes, to send  messages to our neighbours. There is no evidence that such  programmes had any favourable effect on these countries'  policies towards the minorities. I must repeat, in summing up  my argument, that the three priorities will be observed  simultaneously.    ``The approach to foreign policy thinking will also change.  A foreign policy can only be based on the existing realities  and the actual room for manouver, on the interests of Hungary,  and on the coordination of the interests of Hungary and her  partners. In this way of thinking, there is no place for a  feeling of special mission or historical merits and grievances,  ideological or political sympathies.    ``Another thing that will change is the methodology of  foreign policy. There can be no pressuring on the other side by  threatening to reduce the level of relations. We also have to  eliminate tendencies to isolate any of the neighbours from  Europe. A condescending attitude must be out of the question.    ``When taking the initiative, Hungary must not refrain from  making gestures to build confidence. It is equally important to  thoroughly prepare high-level meetings and survey the  implementation of the agreements signed at those meetings. Such  high-level visits should not be used as occasions to give  history lessons.    ``Can we expect a six-party consensus in the parliamentary  control of the activities of the Foreign Ministry?    ``The six-party consensus has been working over the past  four  years in the basic questions of foreign policy. All the six  parties agreed on the three priorities of this policy.    ``There was no consensus, however, in the practical  implementation of policies. There were several steps and many  official statements on behalf of the government which hindered  rather than helped the realization of these objectives.    "The other problem with consensus during the past four years  was that before an important step in foreign policy, the  government had failed to consult with the opposition. It  happened quite often that opposition politicans learned about  policy decisions from the press. I think a consensus must work  differently. It is the responsibility of every government to  involve the opposition in policy-making. It is not the job of  the opposition to force it, but it is the job of the government  to allow this to happen."    As this interview is to be published in the last issue of  the  DAILY NEWS, I want to ask your opinion, does this country need  an English language public service newspaper summing up  political and economic developments from a Hungarian perspective  or should market conditions prevail?    ``It is my firm belief that for Hungary it is indispensable  to have an English language public service newspaper. Hungary  has an open society with many millions of foreign visitors, and  tens of thousands of foreign residents working here. From  diplomats to businessmen and experts, the foreign community  needs a reliable source of information concerning the political  and business processes in this country, including both the  official Hungarian standpoint and the opinions of the individual  political parties in Hungary, about public life, culture and all  aspects of this country. There are, of course, three  foreign-owned weekly newspapers in Budapest but they have a  different function. They are not public service newspapers.    ``I think such an English language paper must be fitted  into the national information system. This is a totally  unresolved task. The activities of the recently founded  National Information Bureau had catastrophic results in the past  few months. This bureau was set up last year and it was unclear  from the outset what its job should be. In practical terms, the  Information Bureau seriously impaired Hungary's image abroad.  Such an institution should not get involved in arguments with  the foreign press. It is not the job of such an institution to  side with the government in internal policy debates and there  were several other things which should not have been done by the  Information Bureau.    "The Information Bureau should give a trustworthy, objective  picture of what is going on in Hungary. There were personal  reasons behind this failure. In my opinion, the Foreign  Ministry must coordinate information about Hungary. It will be  one of my first jobs to survey the situation and to work out  proposals for changes. I think the Foreign Ministry has a  special mission in supplying information about the country. An  English language public service newspaper is thus imndispensable  for Hungary," Laszlo Kovacs, the Socialist Party nominee for  foreign minister, told the DAILY NEWS.</p>

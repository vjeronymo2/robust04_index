			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Labour takes record 39-point poll lead over Tories Mr John Major's government was last night faced with the results of a devastating opinion poll which put Labour's lead over the Conservatives at a record 39.5 percentage points and indicated a popular backlash against last week's Budget, writes Philip Stephens, Political Editor. The Gallup survey, published in today's Daily Telegraph showed Labour's support at 61 per cent - the largest recorded for a political party in Gallup's history. The previous record, 56 per cent, was set by the Conservatives following Labour's devaluation of the pound in 1967. With support for the Conservatives put at 21.5 per cent, the 39.5 point Labour lead was similarly the highest ever recorded. The snapshot poll of 1,061 voters was taken during the days before the government's defeat this week over value added tax on domestic fuel and ahead of yesterday's increases in fuel, alcohol and tobacco taxes. But 65 per cent judged the original Budget package as 'unfair' while only 23 per cent said it was fair. The poll also showed 70 per cent of voters were dissatisfied with Mr Major. The results underline that the slump in the government's popularity now goes far beyond the mid-term troubles associated with most administrations.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>   [Text] Almaty March 19 TASS -- U.S. Secretary of defence  William Perry, who is currently in Kazakhstan on a working  visit, was received in the republican Ministry of Defence on  Saturday. Mr Perry also attended a session of the joint  Kazakhstan-American committee on defence industry conversion to  civilian production.    The meetings, and the talks with President Nursultan  Nazarbayev several hours earlier, resulted in the signing of an  agreement on the conversion of the Kazakhstan defence industry  to civilian production.    The agreement is actually a supplement to the earlier  reached  accord on the dismantling of the SS-18 missile silos and ensures  an influx of an aggregate of $70 million to the republic for  defence industry conversion needs.    These documents are intended to ensure the dismantling of  combat nuclear missile systems based in Kazakhstan and convert  them to suit civilian and peaceful purposes, and additional  training of the military personnel subject to demobilisation.    U.S. businesses are to be invited to help the defence  industry conversion effort. In particular, a number of American  companies will be involved in the reconstruction of appropriate  enterprises for them to change over to the manufacture of  consumer goods.    Mr. Perry and his party are to leave for Baykonur cosmodrome  on March 20.</p>

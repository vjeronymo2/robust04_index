			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Scrip issue move buoys Burndene SHARES OF Burndene Investments yesterday leapt 110p in a thin market to 355p after the Hull-based caravan and hosiery group accompanied a 34 per cent preliminary profits increase with a sharply increased final dividend and an imaginative scrip issue. Mr David Caldow, chairman, said the scrip issue, on an uncommon 10-for-1 basis, would increase the issued share capital 'to a level which will more appropriately reflect the increased scale of the group's activities'. He said the company was concerned that its modest capital would fall foul of moves late last year by Stock Exchange marketmakers to reduce the number of stocks on their books. 'We looked at a 1-for-1, then a 2-for-1 and a 3-for-1 and thought 'Why not make a fist of it?'' The increase at the pre-tax level for the 53 weeks to October 3 - from Pounds 4.33m to a record Pounds 5.78m - was achieved on turnover ahead 21 per cent to Pounds 57.1m (Pounds 47.3m). A final dividend of 10p is recommended, lifting the total for the year by 53 per cent to 13p and maintaining dividend cover at just over three times. Despite an overall reduction in sales in the caravan holiday market, the Willerby Caravan manufacturing side together with the small mobile park operating division contributed an adjusted Pounds 3.64m to profits, up from Pounds 2.98m last time, on turnover of Pounds 48.3m (Pounds 38.6m). The Pretty Legs hosiery offshoot raised profits to Pounds 760,802 (Pounds 685,721) on turnover slightly higher at Pounds 8.57m. A merchandising division is being developed to increase distribution of the brand through retail outlets. Order books at Willerby were 'a little higher' than the same period of the previous year, Mr Caldow said, while sales at Pretty Legs were slightly higher than the comparable first quarter.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Balladur concession rejected - News in brief French union leaders yesterday dismissed a further bid by the Balladur government to blunt opposition to its youth wage legislation, as students demonstrated against the law in the university cities of Toulouse, Nancy, Lyons, Nantes and Rennes. Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, sent union leaders a draft of a new decree on the wage and training measures, but the unions said it did little more than dress up in legal language inadequate concessions that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur had made earlier. Mr Balladur promised that young people holding diplomas would be paid no less than the country's FFr5,866 (Pounds 672) a month minimum wage, and no less than 80 per cent of sectoral wage agreements. But the unions are still angry that unqualified workers could be paid only 80 per cent of the minimum wage, despite Mr Giraud's claim that such workers would only be working 80 per cent of the time with the remaining hours devoted to their training. The youth wage row comes at an awkward time for Mr Balladur who faces the first test of his popularity in Sunday's first round of voting to elect more than 2,000 local councillors around the country.</p>

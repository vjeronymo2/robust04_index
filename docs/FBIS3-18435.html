			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Herbert Schnoor, interior minister of North </F> Rhine-Westphalia: "`Then Everybody Will Stay Here;' About the  Controversy Over Croatian Refugees"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schnoor, according to the  unanimous resolution by the interior ministers of the Federal  Republic and the laender, Croatian civil war refugees are to  leave the country by the end of April. You have suddenly changed  your mind. Why?    [Schnoor] It simply won't do to send indiscriminately all  Croatian refugees back to a country marked by civil war.    [DER SPIEGEL] But you yourself have agreed to precisely this  resolution.    [Schnoor] I agreed only on condition that the Federal  Government and laender finance a repatriation program. It is to  assist the refugees in making a new start in their homeland.  Above all, we must create new housing. Only in this way can we  avoid having the Bosnian Muslims who have fled to Croatia being  driven out in turn and perhaps coming to the FRG.    [DER SPIEGEL] Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther  rejects participating in the financing of such a program. There  is no money for it, he says.    [Schnoor] The Federal Government, laender, communities--none  of us have any money. But that is no reason to simply send  people away, or to let them starve here. For me, the agreement  on deportation stands or falls with repatriation assistance. If  the Federal Government thinks it has no money for that, then I  can only call upon Mr. Kanther to revise our joint resolution.  Then everybody will stay here.    [DER SPIEGEL] And how do you intend to enforce that?    [Schnoor] I am bound by the extremely rigid Aliens Law.  Nonetheless, I can order a general halt of deportations for six  months. The crux is, however, that the refugees will be  concentrated in North Rhine-Westphalia, if the other laender  don't go along. Naturally, it will also quickly get about among  the refugees which land will not deport them.    [DER SPIEGEL] So you are not solving the problem, only  shifting it.    [Schnoor] For a longer halt of deportations I do indeed need  the approval of the federal interior minister, but not for other  stipulations of the law. Thus I still have the possibility of  examining individual cases. For example, I can instruct the  authorities dealing with foreigners to exempt hardship cases  from deportation. To me that means refugees from the occupied or  destroyed part of Croatia, and those who have found refuge with  relatives in North Rhine-Westphalia or come from ethnically  mixed families.    [DER SPIEGEL] What about deserters, whose fate will be  totally uncertain in case of deportation?    [Schnoor] I would also exempt deserters from deportation if  they can expect punishment in Croatia. If I should not come to  an agreement this week with my laender colleagues on regulations  for such hardship cases, we shall initiate examinations of  individual cases in North Rhine-Westphalia. Thereby many people  can be helped, and Mr. Kanther can't do anything about it.    [DER SPIEGEL] Foreign Ministry situation reports from the  respective crisis regions play a decisive role in the  decisionmaking by authorities and courts on the deportation of  refugees. Its content of truth is controversial. Contrary to the  recommendations of the UN refugee commissioner, the Foreign  Ministry sees hardly any obstacles to deportations to Angola, a  country where there is civil war. Does the Federal Government  want to get rid of the costly refugees at any price?    [Schnoor] I must defend the Foreign Ministry. I received  good  cooperation from the Foreign Ministry regarding refugees from  Iraq, and in the case of Kurds from Turkey I had the best of  experiences with the German ambassador in that country.    [DER SPIEGEL] At the end of January, the Berlin  administrative court stopped the deportation of a refugee from  Angola, because the judges considered press reports more  credible than the Foreign Ministry information. And Frieder  Birzele, your Social Democratic colleague in Baden-Wuerttemberg,  demands more precise information from the Foreign Ministry on  the local situation, especially in the case of Croatia.    [Schnoor] For me, the Foreign Ministry reports are only one  decision-making aid. In addition, we also rely on the knowledge  gained by refugee organizations. Certainly, the Foreign Ministry  now and then is taken in by an informant.    [DER SPIEGEL] Many Social Democrats agreed to the new asylum  law passed last year by the Bundestag only after the coalition  and opposition came to an agreement on Section 32a of the Aliens  Law which stipulates a special status for refugees from civil  wars. In the case of the Croats, this stipulation has no effect  because Bonn does not want to pay.    [Schnoor] It must not fail because of the petty souls in the  Federal Government. The Federal Government must share half of  the costs for civil war refugees; on this all interior ministers  of the laender are agreed, even those of the Christian Union  [CDU/CSU].    [DER SPIEGEL] Interior Minister Kanther is obstinate. He has  stated that there is no money, and as long as the laender do not  understand that, the special status for Croatian refugees will  not be introduced. In agreeing to the asylum law, were the  Social Democrats taken for a ride?    [Schnoor] I insist: We must breathe life into Section 32a.  If  no accord can be reached with the federal government on its  financing, we must look for other ways.    [DER SPIEGEL] But no way bypasses Kanther?    [Schnoor] Perhaps, yes. I can imagine, for example, that I  might ask the North Rhine-Westphalian finance minister to  withhold money for the refugees from those taxes which we pay  over to the Federal Government.    [DER SPIEGEL] A blocked account as a means of political  pressure? This would be a novel approach in German domestic  policy.    [Schnoor] The new asylum law has greatly restricted the  possibility of people finding refuge in Germany. The stipulation  for civil war refugees should make it clear that the FRG stands  in the humanitarian tradition of West Europe. Like many others,  for years I fought against a change of Article 16 of the Basic  Law. Only the stipulation of a special status for civil war  refugees in the law enabled me to consent, albeit with clenched  teeth.    [DER SPIEGEL] As long as there is no agreement on the  special  status, civil war refugees will continue to go through asylum  procedures.    [Schnoor] What that means is absolutely clear: They are  turned down and deported. That is the present practice which the  federal interior minister apparently has in mind as a permanent  regulation.    [DER SPIEGEL] Don't the interior ministers of the laender  make it easy for him, since the resolutions by the conference of  interior ministers must be adopted unanimously?    [Schnoor] Yes. Mr. Kanther is tricking the laender. Because  of the different interests of the laender, the resolutions  almost always are adopted at the lowest common denominator. For  extending the halt in deporting civil war refugees, Kanther  insists on the unanimous vote of 16 laender ministers. But for  his approval, actually he does not even need this assent. With  this demand he plainly diverges from the clear-cut legal  situation.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you let him get away with it?    [Schnoor] I don't intend to. I want even more. I shall make  every effort to ensure that on such an important issue as the  civil war refugees, not the conference of interior ministers,  but rather the majority in the Bundesrat must give its consent.  In the Bundesrat, a simple majority is enough to decide which  refugees under which conditions will be deported, or not.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We acknowledge that this agreement could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute a kickback under the Medicare and Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anti-kickback statute (42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7b(b)). That statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes it a felony to offer, pay, solicit, or receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remuneration with the intention of inducing the referral of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare, Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health Services Block  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grant, or Social Services Block Grant program business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Activities that come within the purview of the statute are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not subject to prosecution if they fit within specified safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harbors, as set forth in the regulation published in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  July 29, 1991 (56 FR 35952). Consequently,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an organization or individual should enter into an agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as that referenced in the December 1990 interim final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule only if the agreement does not violate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anti-kickback statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters suggested that the rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be modified so that a portion of the professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component of a screening mammogram be determined to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent the contribution of the primary care physician if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the screening mammogram is taken in the primary care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician's office but interpreted by another physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters believed that the allocation of 37 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the payment limit to the interpreting physician's role  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overcompensates that physician and ignores the primary care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician's role in furnishing the mammogram. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the Physician Payment Reform Commission report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entitled ``The Costs of Providing Screening Mammography''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocates a flat $12 for the interpretation. As an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative, the commenter suggested that the primary care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician be permitted to contract with the interpreting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician for payment at a rate less than 37 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment limit. Another commenter recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation represent 20 percent of the total fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Medicare does not pay for referrals, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exacting a fee for referrals is against the law. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified physician who furnishes the interpretation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening mammogram receives payment for the professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component of the screening mammogram. If the primary care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician furnishes neither the professional component nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the technical component of the screening mammogram, he or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she is entitled to no payment for the screening mammogram.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The apportionment of the screening mammography payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit between the professional component and the technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component will reflect the payment split for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corresponding components for diagnostic mammography under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fee schedule for physicians' services. The weights of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the factors reflect historical payment data, and we have no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason to believe that the apportionment is not appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a screening mammography procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the purchased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service limitation set forth in section 1842(n) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not apply to the technical component of a screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography procedure furnished in a primary care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician's office that customarily uses a temporary or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leased technologist because_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The technologist is under the direct control and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervision of the primary care physician and, as such,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets the common law rules for an employer/employee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship applied under the Internal Revenue Code; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The screening mammography procedure is performed under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the supervision of the primary care physician in conformance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the definition of ``direct supervision'' set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;410.32(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The purchased service limitation does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to screening mammography services because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures are not included in the definition of diagnostic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests under section 1861(s)(3) of the Act, as required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1842(n) of the Act, the statutory basis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchased service limitation. Section 1861(s)(13) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act provides for Part B coverage of screening mammography  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services, which are not subject to the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1842(n) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

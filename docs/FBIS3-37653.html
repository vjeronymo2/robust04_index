The summit is expected to be attended by Yeltsin, U.S.  President Bill Clinton, and by the leaders of Britain, France,  and Germany, the newspaper pointed out.    Yeltsin and Kohl also reached a consensus that the nascent  process of the normalisation of the situation around Sarajevo  should become a model for the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina. This  means a truce, the withdrawal of heavy guns from the areas of  combat operations, and control over the situation on the part of  U.N. peacekeepers, including those from Russia.</p>

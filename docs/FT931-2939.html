			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Spring Ram The suspension of Spring Ram's shares, for an unspecified reason, five days before its annual results raises some frightening spectres. The most benign possibility is it is having lively discussions about its ACT position after the Budget changes. The alternatives scarcely bear thinking about, coming just four months after revelations about 'serious misrepresentation and false accounting' at one of its subsidiaries. Spring Ram's directors did a good job in reassuring institutional investors that the problem at Balterley Bathrooms was a one-off lapse. The share price showed surprising resilience after the initial fall. But any further misfortune, whatever its nature, would send infuriated investors scurrying for the door. There have long been niggles about Spring Ram's depreciation policy and the accounting treatment of stocks and government grants. The fast-growing company's highly-charged culture and continued failure to appoint non-executive directors only heighten the sense of unease. At the same time Spring Ram has raised expectations to inordinate heights. If it is now about to disappoint, the recriminations will prove bitter.</p>

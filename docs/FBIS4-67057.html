			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 5 May (EFE) -- Mexican authorities have  seized a little more than 400 kg of cocaine paste and  confiscated an aircraft that flew from Cali, Colombia, to the  Cancun International Airport, a source at the Attorney General's  Office [PGR] reported today.    The drugs were discovered in a building at the airport, near  the aircraft whose range and speed, according to the PGR, make  it ideal for transporting drugs. For this reason, the plane was  confiscated and its two crewmen detained.    The authorities estimate that, considering price  fluctuations  and the quality of the drugs seized, the load would have yielded  close to 6 million doses and would have had a market value of  $50 million. The authorities said an investigation has been  opened to determine the exact origin of the drugs and the  involved of the plane's crew.    The PGR has reported that so far this year approximately 7.5  metric tons of cocaine have been confiscated in various actions  throughout the country.</p>

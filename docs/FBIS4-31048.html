			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hasan Galic from Gracanica] </F>   [Text] In the course of the night and early this morning  the Chetniks have continued attacking in the zone of  responsibility of the Gracanica Operative Group [words  indistinct] 109th Doboj Brigade. The infantry attacks were  accompanied by the shelling of our defense lines and suburban  settlements (?Glokotici), (?Prisic), Lukavica, and  (Lukavica-Rijeka). The chetniks were particularly active  between 2000 and 2200 hours when over 200 projectiles of various  calibers landed on our lines and the aforementioned civilian  settlements. This was followed by a ferocious infantry attack.  By resisting successfully this attack, our fighters have  liquidated a great number of Chetniks, who were left between the  lines and are still lying there, which says enough about the  enemy's attitude toward their dead soldiers.    The late night saw a concentration of the Serbian forces and  sporadic shelling. However, as of 0400 this morning the attacks  have intensified.    The aim of these enemy attacks is to gain control over  important elevations (?Pribevine), Oblic, and Banjic in order to  widen the security ring around Doboj. As of 0900 a general  alarm has been in force in Gracanica.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (22): Disease strikes at the heart of business - A report predicts a huge increase in deaths from Aids It may not yet be as severe as in some of its neighbouring African states, but one of the most dangerous threats to economic growth and social stability in Kenya is Aids. To the casual visitor, evidence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is limited - a TV advertisement warning, 'Say no to unwanted sexual advances; say no to Aids'; a poster with a prostitute tempting a well-dressed Kenyan, her face a grinning skull offering the prospect of death. To the policy-makers, the concern runs far deeper. A recent report prepared by the National Aids Control Programme of Kenya suggests that one in every 18 adults aged over 15 is HIV-positive. In urban areas, the proportion is twice as high at 10 to 11 per cent, or 220,000 people. It estimates that more than 130,000 Kenyans have developed Aids, and that two years ago about 730,000 people were carrying the human immunodeficiency virus that causes the disease - most of whom are expected to develop Aids and die within the next 10 years. This includes 30,000 children. The report projects that, by 2005, there could be 1.9m HIV-positive Kenyans, and that the cumulative number of Aids deaths would increase from 100,000 today to over 2m in the same period. A vicious corollary of Aids, not seen elsewhere in the world, is that the deaths caused by the disease may often be the result not of esoteric ailments but of common and highly infectious tropical killers such as tuberculosis. This not only conceals the fact that Aids may be the root cause, but also risks engendering a national TB epidemic among those not infected by the disease as well as those who are. Equally, some researchers believe that the relatively high incidence of other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and syphilis within Kenya may boost HIV-infection rates by between 10 and 100 times. One problem is that many who are HIV-positive do not know they are infected, since it can take several years before any signs develop. In the meantime, they may continue to transmit the virus to others. There is certainly some stigma to the discussion of homosexually-transmitted Aids in Africa. However, it appears that in Kenya most transmission comes through heterosexual contact, particularly in groups where the social structure has broken down: it spreads along trucking routes, in war zones and among rural migrants to cities. More controversially, some academic researchers believe there is a higher incidence of infection among uncircumcised men - a growing group representing about 20 per cent of the population. A smaller proportion may come through blood transfusion where screening systems and equipment break down, although the government insists that most blood is now screened for HIV. More worryingly, many children are becoming infected from their mothers  - either during pregnancy or through breast-feeding. Up to half of the children of infected mothers in Kenya are estimated to be infected. Those children who are not infected do not escape the effects of the disease: many will become so-called Aids orphans, being left without parents by the time they are 15. Official estimates suggest there will be 600,000 such orphans by 2000 and almost 1m by 2005. This will place additional burdens on extended families, boost demand for support services and trigger unstable social structures. Aids is beginning to have a fundamental impact on the economy more generally. Three-quarters of cases affect the most economically productive group within the population: adults aged 20-45. Companies may be threatened with survival, and agricultural systems disrupted. A study by US researchers two years ago suggested that the average cost of hospital care for an Aids patient was Ks27,200, and the average length of time in hospital far more than for other ailments at 60 days. Aids patients were estimated to be occupying up to 15 per cent of all hospital beds in the country. At current growth rates, this suggests total hospital costs on Aids Ks3.7bn by the year 2000, and Ks4.8bn by 2005 - up to half of public expenditure on all health care, and about half of all hospital beds, in a threat to provision of services to the rest of the population. Separately, a 1992 World Bank study on AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa suggested that if Aids affects the better-paid, better-educated economic elite, and consumes medical and funeral costs from savings, investment and economic growth will suffer. As to the future, the government says it estimates 'conservatively' that adult HIV prevalence will stabilise at about 9 per cent by 2000. Some practitioners remain rather more pessimistic. Dr Francis Plummer, a visiting lecturer at the University of Nairobi over many years, says: 'There is no evidence that infection rates are slowing. There is still exponential growth.' He says that surveys within Kenya suggest that education has been remarkably effective, with a high degree of knowledge of Aids. But this has not been translated into changes in sexual behaviour, except in some limited groups such as prostitutes.</p>

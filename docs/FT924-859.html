			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Honecker to stay in jail Former East German leader Erich Honecker was ordered by a court yesterday to remain in jail on manslaughter charges linked to the border shooting of would-be defectors, Reuter reports from Berlin. A Berlin court rejected a motion by Mr Honecker's lawyers to have the case dropped on the grounds that the 80-year-old communist was too ill with liver cancer to survive a trial.</p>

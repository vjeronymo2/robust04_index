			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The State Council,  China's cabinet, should set up a new top-level population  managerial department, a senior leader of the Chinese Peasants  and Workers Democratic Party (CPWDP) said today.    The proposal was put forward by Fang Rongxin, an executive  vice chairman of the CPWDP Central Committee at the second  public-address meeting of the ongoing second session of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC).    Fang is one of ten speakers addressing today's meeting.    Over the past few years, China has scored world-acknowledged  achievements in family planning, Fang said.    As a result, population growth has slowed down markedly, and  the population structure and quality has improved, he told the  meeting.    "However, China is still facing an arduous task in checking  its population from growing too rapidly," he said.    In his speech, Jiang Jingbo, a Standing Committee member of  the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, made a  five-point proposal concerning supervision over the work of the  Communist Party of China (CPC) and the government. The proposal  says:    -- CPC committees and governments at all levels should  increase their contacts with democratic parties;    -- The system under which democratic parties participate in  discussing state affairs should be further improved;    -- A system under which democratic parties exercise  supervision over government work should be established and  improved;    -- Further improve the system under which democratic parties  and persons without party affiliation assume leading posts in  governments and judicial departments; and    -- Make sure that democratic parties enjoy all rights as  stipulated in China's constitution.    Li Ganliu, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the  Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, expressed the  hope that the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan accept the CPC  proposal on direct exchanges of mail, trade and shipping and air  services across the Taiwan Straits.    The Kuomintang in Taiwan should hold talks with the CPC at  an  early date, he added.    In their speeches Li Zhensheng, a former vice president of  the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and He Jindao made proposals on  how to promote the use of agro-techniques and put a stop to  environmental pollution.    In his speech, Zhu Guangya, vice president of the China  Association for Science and Technology, emphasized the  importance of respecting science.    In their speeches, Sun Han called for efforts to expand the  rural cooperative economy, Li Yongchang stressed the need to  further promote grain production, Jin Jian proposed ways to help  various nationalities to achieve common prosperity, and Qu  Shijing aired his views on the need to develop social sciences.    Present at the meeting were Li Ruihuan, chairman of the  CPPCC  National Committee, and 11 vice chairmen of the committee.    Wen Jiabao, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of  the CPC Central Committee, State Councillor Peng Peiyun and  leaders of State Council departments also attended today's  meeting.</p>

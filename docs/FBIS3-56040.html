Interfax learned this from the leader of the Agrarian  faction, Mikhail Lapshin.    According to him, in the near future his faction intends to  prompt the State Duma to demand that the government pay its  debts to the farmers under its last year's commitments, "in view  of the catastrophic situation in farming." According to the  farmers' calculations, the government owes them about one and a  half trillion rubles, Lapshin said. "The situation in the  countryside is very hard, and it will become simply  catastrophic, unless we give the industry financial support by  the coming spring," he stressed.    With reference to the problem of electing the State Duma  speaker, Lapshin said: The Agrarian faction believes that his  candidacy should be considered in a package with his deputies.  Lapshin thinks that if a representative of small factions is  elected as speaker, his four deputies should be elected from the  four biggest factions: Russia's Choice, the Agrarians, the  Communists and the Liberal Democrats. According to Lapshin, the  fifth deputy should be elected from a faction of independent  deputies or from the representatives of autonomies.    He confirmed that his faction still intended to propose Ivan  Rybkin for the post of the speaker or one of his deputies.    According to Lapshin, at 16:00 on Wednesday the leaders of  all parliamentary factions are to meet in the State Duma  building to reach a final agreement on the candidacy of the  speaker and his deputies.</p>

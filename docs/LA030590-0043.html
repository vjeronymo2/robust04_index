			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> SANDERLING BEGINS BRAHMS SURVEY AT PHILHARMONIC  </P> <P> Aimez-vous Brahms? If so, you are not alone. And, over the weekend, at concerts  of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music  Center, you would have found sustenance.  </P> <P> Returning after an absence, Kurt Sanderling, for half a decade a popular guest  conductor on the Philharmonic podium, offered the first in a series of three  Brahms programs. The first, heard Friday night, consisted of the D-minor Piano  Concerto, with Peter Roesel as soloist, and the First Symphony.  </P> <P> Sanderling, still vivacious at age 77, has treated Los Angeles to his Brahms  First before. In April, 1986, Martin Bernheimer described the Prussian-born  conductor's reading of the work "remarkable for breadth, warmth and majesty."  Nearly four years later, that description still fits.  </P> <P> Perhaps the warmth has cooled a bit; Sanderling's approach to Brahms' structure  seems to favor analysis over spontaneity.  </P> <P> But logic and continuity make the conductor's account -- the musical view more  of an elder statesman rather than a young Turk -- eminently cherishable. In  this view, for instance, the opening movement deals less in conflict, more in  resolution. On Friday, the Philharmonic players cooperated wholeheartedly in  bringing it to life -- though without achieving the utmost in integrated sound  or rounded, post-Romantic textures.  </P> <P> Roesel's letter-perfect, lean-sounding account of the First Piano Concerto also  proved unconventional. Its musical perspective obviously was emanating from the  podium, where Sanderling held the reins, and it eschewed heroics, individual  statement and easy emotional release.  </P> <P> Indeed, Roesel's dissected performance made the solo part more an obbligato  line than the genuine protagonist of the piece. This became interesting on  several levels, but least interesting pianistically, since Roesel often treats  the instrument as a member of the percussion section, and not as a voice  capable of legato or cantante.  </P> <P> Next week: Symphonies Nos. 2 and 3.DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

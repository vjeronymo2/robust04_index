			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Big Six hit by recession and competition: Accountancy firms cut staff - Audit work suffers / Growth in insolvency work RECESSION and competition sharply reduced fee income growth in most of Britain's six largest accountancy firms, according to figures for the year to April 1992 released yesterday. Coopers &amp; Lybrand remained the largest UK firm with fee income of Pounds 577m in the year to April 30, but also registered the only absolute decline, with revenues down by 1.87 per cent. All the top firms except Arthur Andersen cut professional staff including partners by between 7 per cent and 10 per cent, reflecting the widespread redundancies in the last few months. Income from three of Coopers' divisions - audit, management consultancy and tax - all declined, while insolvency income rose by 16 per cent. But the firm said last year's reported Pounds 588m income had been adjusted downwards to Pounds 577m, reflecting difficulties in calculation after the merger with Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells. The name Deloitte was also officially dropped yesterday. Strongest growth came from Arthur Andersen, mainly as a result of a 30 per cent increase from Andersen Consulting. 'We're working with major organisations which believe there's going to be a better tomorrow,' said Mr Keith Burgess, head of the consulting arm. Touche Ross also grew sharply, with income up by 15.7 per cent. Mr John Roques, senior partner, said the increase reflected work referred from its network of firms overseas, particularly in the USA and Japan, growing consultancy work in Europe, and advice to medium-sized companies. Revenue growth in the remaining firms - KPMG Peat Marwick, Ernst &amp; Young, and Price Waterhouse - was boosted by insolvency work but struggled to beat inflation. Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner of Price Waterhouse, said audit work was suffering because of recession, overcapacity and intense competition. However, none of the firms is willing to provide details of costs or profits distributed to partners, stressing their legal status as partnerships does not require them to do so. They also argue it is very difficult to compare firms, which have different year-ends and sometimes exclude income from regions such as the Channel Islands. They say that some - particularly Andersen Consulting - operate in distinctive markets and are not direct competitors. Most of the managers in the firms suggested that the rapid income growth experienced during the 1980s was unlikely to be repeated in the near future. 'Double-digit growth will tend to be a thing of the past,' said Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young. 'We are concentrating now on managing the numbers to suit our business.'

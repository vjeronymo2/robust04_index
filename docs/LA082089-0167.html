			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> At least 45 people were killed in a 24-hour period in some of Sri Lanka's worst  political violence, official sources said in Colombo. The sources blamed an  extremist Sinhalese group for 35 deaths in Sinhalese-populated southern areas.  Six people died in clashes in the Tamil-populated north and east, where Indian  troops are fighting Tamil separatists. Chiefs of the three armed services and  the police, responding to a threat to kill their families if they do not resign  and help set up a socialist government, said soldiers and police will do their  duty.  </P></p>

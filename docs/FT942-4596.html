			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Dead or alive, incumbents do well in US primaries Results from primary elections in eight US states this week suggest that simmering resentment of Washington insiders is still not enough to reverse the strong electoral advantages of incumbency and money. The California governorship - which could play a pivotal role in the 1996 presidential election - will, as expected, be fought between incumbent Governor Pete Wilson, who won the Republican party nomination, and state treasurer Kathleen Brown, who won the Democratic primary. 'There's no more important race in the United States, I suspect, for either of the parties but certainly for the Republican party, than Pete Wilson's re-election,' Mr Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican national party, said yesterday. In the California senate election, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein will face Congressman Michael Huffington, a wealthy Texan who has spent millions of dollars of his own money on his campaigns. Members of Congress who had appeared vulnerable because of their financial or sexual peccadilloes, or their voting records, shrugged off challengers to win their party's nominations for the November general election. In southern California, Congressman Jay Kim held on to the Republican nomination with 41 per cent in a five-way race, despite charges that he illegally financed his 1992 election campaign through his own business. Congressman Ken Calvert, another Republican, won his primary with 52 per cent, although some voters were put off by his explanations of what the police had found him doing in a parked car with a prostitute. Like most other members who have been targeted by trade unions because they voted in favour of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Congressman Mike Parker of Mississippi also survived a challenge. In another Mississippi district left vacant for the first time since 1941 by the retirement of Congressman Jamie Whitten, the two leaders in each party's primary will enter a run-off election. The only incumbent ousted yesterday was Republican Governor Walter Dale Miller of South Dakota. He inherited the office when his predecessor died and was defeated in Tuesday's Republican primary by former Governor Bill Janklow. One incumbent, San Jose city councilman George Shirakawa, even won re-election by an overwhelming margin, despite being dead for more than a month.</p>

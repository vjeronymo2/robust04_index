			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: US operations help News Corp rise 15% News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's international media group, has begun the financial year with a solid rise in net earnings following strong results from the company's film and television operations in the US. News Corp yesterday announced a 15 per cent rise in net profit to ADollars 301m (USDollars 232m) in the three months to end-September, from ADollars 262m a year ago, on a 7.6 per cent increase in operating revenue to ADollars 2.99bn from ADollars 2.78bn. A 43 per cent rise in earnings from associated companies and a lower net interest bill also helped earnings. However, Australian and UK newspaper interests were flat. Most of its earnings came from the US, where operating income rose to ADollars 283m from ADollars 248m. Directors said profits from Twentieth Century Fox films had doubled in the quarter following successful releases such as Speed and True Lies. Results from the Fox television station group were also up strongly. Magazine and inserts results, where operating income rose to ADollars 74m from ADollars 70m ,benefited from higher pricing and advertising revenues. But earnings from the HarperCollins book publishing operation eased to ADollars 65m from ADollars 76m, reflecting weaker results from the San Francisco group. Operating income from UK operations fell to ADollars 65m from ADollars 75m, with directors citing the impact of The Times newspaper's price cut in June. 'Circulation at The Times now stands at 607,143, an increase of more than 37 per cent versus a year ago,' they said. 'At The Sun, circulation remains in excess of 4m copies following a 2p cover-price rise on August 22. On the advertising front, revenues are up across all titles, due to an improving advertising market and higher circulation levels.' Directors said BSkyB, the company's 50 per cent owned satellite broadcasting subsidiary (in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake), achieved a significant increase in operating profit, with total subscribers exceeding 3.6m. The company's Australia and Pacific Basin region saw the biggest segmental earnings fall, with operating income down to ADollars 40m from ADollars 89m. Directors said revenue gains had been offset by higher depreciation charges due to plant modernisation. Star TV, the 64 per cent owned satellite broadcasting subsidiary, incurred a loss. Ansett, the 50 per cent owned Australian airline, continued to increase earnings, and with BSkyB, lifted the contribution from associated companies to ADollars 106m from ADollars 74m. News Corp's direct operating income fell by 5.8 per cent to ADollars 388m from ADollars 412m, mainly reflecting last year's sale of the South China Morning Post and unfavourable exchange rates. However, currency changes also contributed to a fall in interest expense to ADollars 154m from ADollars 173m. Tax provisions took ADollars 47m compared with ADollars 39m. This excludes a ADollars 3m abnormal profit, compared with a ADollars 16m loss previously. US operations contributed the biggest share of group revenues, up to ADollars 2.2bn from ADollars 1.93bn. UK revenues eased to ADollars 469m from ADollars 471m and Australian revenues were down to ADollars 375m from ADollars 382m.</p>

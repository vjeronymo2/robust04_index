			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: GrandMet foresees end to dispute with Brent Walker GRAND METROPOLITAN, the food, drinks and retailing group, expects to settle by this summer its dispute over a Pounds 50m payment from Brent Walker for the sale of William Hill, the betting shops chain, a senior company executive said yesterday. Mr David Nash, GrandMet's finance director, said the dispute over deferred payments totalling more than Pounds 50m and Pounds 10m in interest from Brent Walker should be settled by 'mid year' with the help of an adjudicating accountant. Details of the negotiations were disclosed for the first time in GrandMet's 1992 annual report and accounts, which were circulated yesterday. The report presented the company's results in line with the latest rules issued by the Accounting Standards Board. This had the effect of increasing pre-tax profits from Pounds 902m to Pounds 925m in the year to September 30 1992. The restated 1991 results were more than halved from Pounds 950m to Pounds 448m, principally as a result of FRS 3, the new standard on the profit and loss account which virtually eliminates extraordinary items. Most of the restated figures had already been shown in a note to the company's pre-liminary results released in September, and had little effect on the share price, which closed unchanged on the day at 420p. The accounts also show that emoluments excluding pension contributions to Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, rose from Pounds 713,391 to Pounds 770,682. The value of intangible assets - such as brands - increased on the balance sheet by Pounds 60m, offset by a reduction of Pounds 32m caused by exchange adjustments. There were post-employment provisions of Pounds 113m and performance guarantees and indemnities to third parties totalling Pounds 183m. The company said it supported 'in spirit and letter' the recommendations of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance, and complied with 16 of its 19 guide-lines.</p>

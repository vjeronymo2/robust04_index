			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK indices The FT-SE Actuaries UK indices committee is grappling with a slippery subject when it tries to define a UK company. Thus far, the pragmatic yardstick that companies prepared to pay UK tax are UK companies has held up reasonably well. But the proposed structure for New Rothmans and Vendome has shown up the inadequacies of the definition. The deal is pretty clearly designed to minimise advance corporation tax problems by creating parallel UK and overseas companies which are permanently stapled together, but which also allow shareholders to select a UK or overseas dividend. Other UK companies with ACT headaches might in future be tempted to follow similar paths. Yet this problem is primarily a function of the difficulties of advance corporation tax, rather than the degree of 'Britishness' of the company. Other hard cases such as Eurotunnel remain eligible despite the vagueness which surrounds the status of dividend payments the company hopes, one day, to make. Nor, apparently, will those who make use of the government's proposed foreign income dividends be excluded from UK indices. The issue of partly split dividends where one element is a compulsory UK taxed payment remains mercifully vague. Taxation as a means of separating sheep from goats has thus probably had its day. A wider look at the issue is needed, and a useful starting point might be consideration of what investors want an index to tell them. Exposure to a local economy and corporate governance are perhaps key issues, though given the high level of overseas earnings in FT-SE 100 companies, the difficulty of designing a genuinely UK index is clearly acute.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Midlands groups see improvement Capital spending by quoted west Midlands companies remained flat in the year to June, although money spent on acquisitions rose 33 per cent. The findings emerge from the annual analysis of 133 quoted companies in the region by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. It shows the companies moving out of recession with collective pre-tax profits in 1993-94 of Pounds 2.01bn compared with Pounds 1.37bn in 1992-93. Capital spending over the period was Pounds 1.55bn, a slight increase on the Pounds 1.53bn recorded in 1992-93, but this rise came after three years of cuts. KPMG noted, however, that in the engineering sector, the staple of the region's industry, capital spending was lower than in 1992-93. Higher profitability encouraged directors to pay themselves more. After three years of little or no pay increases, the average director's pay rose in 1993-94 to Pounds 82,800 from Pounds 73,950 the year before. The average rise for employees was 5 per cent, but this included the cost of increased overtime. In the construction, motors and industrial materials sectors companies are still cutting their workforces. West Midlands Plc, annual report 1994.

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / British Coal pension dispute BRITISH COAL and managers of its pension scheme said yesterday they expected the High Court to consider within the next month a dispute over the use of part of a Pounds 1bn surplus. The government and British Coal want to recover the corporation's share of the surplus, thought to be worth Pounds 480m, by withholding payments due to the fund to cover the cost of early retirements. British Coal and the scheme said they wanted the issue sorted out as soon as possible.</p>

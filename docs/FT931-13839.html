			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tuskar accuses dissident of hindering its strategy TUSKAR, the Dublin-based oil and gas company, yesterday accused a stockbroker and dissident shareholder of trying to hinder its strategy through the hostile bid from fellow Irish resource group, Aminex. 'This approach represents another attempt by Mr John Lord to frustrate the development of Tuskar under its recently reconstructed board', a statement from the company read. Mr Lord sought unsuccessfully to oust the recently appointed chairman, Mr Duncan McGregor, at the annual meeting before Christmas. His actions followed the sale of Tuskar's last asset - a 36 per cent stake in a Colombian oil field to Coplex Resources, the Australian exploration company which failed in a recommended bid for the Irish group. Tuskar, whose shares have been suspended at 1p since August, is expected to have some IPounds 5m in the bank if Coplex chooses to pay cash in the final tranche of the deal, due in August. Tuskar said there was little merit in the hostile offer of two Aminex shares for 11 of its own. Aminex said the offer would be withdrawn if shareholders approved Tuskar's proposals to purchase a North Sea subsidiary of Bula Resources at the extraordinary meeting on February 5.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Fresh warning at Tomorrow's Leisure TOMORROW'S LEISURE, the USM-quoted hotels and leisure group, yesterday issued a second warning of losses for the year to March 31. The group, which in March said it was likely to incur a pre-tax loss of more than Pounds 1m, said the figure would be 'substantially in excess' of that amount. The shares fell 3p to 18p on the news. The second warning is due partly to a downward valuation of assets, also announced yesterday, reflecting current market conditions. In 1991-92 the group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 731,000. Mr John Roberts, a former Next director appointed chairman in February, has resigned. Mr John Sanderson, the founder, who stepped down as chairman and managing director in that reshuffle, has now become executive chairman. Mr Malcolm Powell has been replaced as managing director by Mr Stephen Lovely, a chartered accountant previously with Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Mr Sanderson, whose family has recently made a Pounds 250,000 loan to Tomorrow's Leisure, said there had been differences of opinion.</p>

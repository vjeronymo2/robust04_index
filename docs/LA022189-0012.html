			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'DARWIN, DINOSAURS' ISSUE NOT EXTINCT  </P> <P> Anyone who thinks that the debate over the teaching of evolution in our public  schools is passe should take a look at "God, Darwin and the Dinosaurs," a  "Nova" segment airing tonight at 8 on Channels 28 and 15 and at 9 on Channel  50.  </P> <P> If anything, the battle is heating up -- witness the California State  Department of Education ruling last month forcing a Christian school in Santee  to separate its creationist teachings from its science courses. Religious  fundamentalists fighting for the right to teach the biblical view of creation  have taken a new tack -- teaching creationism as a science -- that promises to  make the famous Scopes Monkey Trial look like a minor skirmish in the ongoing  war over the separation of church and state.  </P> <P> Producer-writers Thomas Lucas and Larry Engel have done a solid, balanced job  delineating complex legal and religious issues. Teachers, scientists and  religious leaders from both sides are given sufficient time to make their  points.  </P> <P> The historical information in "God, Darwin and the Dinosaurs" is fascinating  stuff, showing the incredible impact Charles Darwin's theory had on  19th-Century science and 20th-Century social movements. We are also reminded  that Scopes was convicted, that the Tennessee law stayed on the books until  1957, and that the law was used as a model in other states, and that it wasn't  until the 1950s that there was a rebirth of science teaching.  </P> <P> Although "God, Darwin and the Dinosaurs" drags a bit toward the end, it is  nonetheless an enlightening and interesting look at an emotional issue that  all-too-often devolves into name-calling arguments.

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Interest rate rise scares house buyers The housing market has been 'knocked sideways' by last month's half percentage point rise in interest rates, according to a survey of more than 200 estate agents. Some 60 per cent of agents said market activity, in terms of the number of people interested in buying, had declined since the interest rate rise. The survey published by the National Association of Estate Agents said the rise had dented the confidence of potential buyers causing a 'significant downturn in business'. Mrs Eva Lomas, the association's president, said the base rate increase, although small, had prompted a disproportionate fall in confidence. She said: 'Although interest rates are still at historically low levels, the improvement in the economy is not being translated into confidence among the public and talk about further rate rises can only make the situation worse.' The association's market trends survey for September showed a significant fall in the level of inquiries, viewings, offers and completions compared with August. Only 23 per cent of agents expected the market to strengthen before the end of the year compared with 60 per cent in August. Nearly half of all agents said that business generally had fared worse last month than in September 1993. A separate survey by the Nationwide Building Society showed that average house prices in the third quarter of this year were higher compared with the corresponding period a year ago in 10 out of 13 regions. The average UK house price in the third quarter, according to Nationwide, was Pounds 66,012, up 1.1 per cent on the second quarter and 2.9 per cent higher than a year ago. The biggest annual increases to the third quarter were 9.1 per cent in the east Midlands and 7.9 per cent in Northern Ireland. However, prices fell by 1.8 per cent in the north-west; 2.8 per cent in the west Midlands and by 6.2 per cent in the northern region.</p>

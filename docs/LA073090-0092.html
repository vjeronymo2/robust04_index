			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Walt Disney Pictures Accused of Age Bias: A suit filed Wednesday by the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission accuses Walt Disney Pictures of  discriminating against a 58-year-old executive assistant because of her age.  </P> <P> The U.S. District Court suit, filed in Los Angeles, alleges that Sheila Barnes  was discharged when a new, 36-year-old vice president of motion picture  production told her she was being replaced because of a "generation gap" that  existed between them. Barnes, who has more than 25 years of experience, was  told to report to a lower-level position into which a 19-year-old with two  years' secretarial experience eventually was hired, says the suit, which seeks  reinstatement, back pay and damages. (Filed July 24, 2990. Case No. 90-3900)  </P></p>

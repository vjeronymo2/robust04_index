			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Russian Television Network in Russian at  1725 GMT on 14 March carries its 10-minute "Details" program,  presented by Sergey Dorenko. The program is devoted to former  President Nixon's visit to Moscow.    Dorenko says it was intimated to Nixon that he could not see  Yeltsin because Yeltsin was busy. He adds that Yeltsin himself  spoke of this prior to his departure for a two-week vacation in  Sochi. Yeltsin is then shown being interviewed at the airport.  He says: "My leave simply means that my work routine is  altered somewhat. Of course you are able to have walks, to go  for strolls, to have a rest, but, at the same time, you are also  able to work.    "All the same, I am in control of the situation; I mean the  position and the state of affairs in the whole of Russia. I  monitor it constantly, as it were, not just every day, but  several times a day. Relevant leaders report to me and that is  why if anything comes up, I will fly back forthwith. However,  it is not currently thought that any upsets might materialize  and that is why I am flying in a rather calm mood.    "As for my work -- yes, all the time I work on something  serious for the future. Currently the work is this: the  mechanism of the implementation of the presidential address to  the Federal Assembly; that is to say, the address is one thing,  but the matter of its implementation point by point, especially  where the statehood dimension is concerned, and so on, and so  on, and so forth, well, there must be a schedule for this, as  you would have for a monthly day-by-day plan of action, as it  were."</p>

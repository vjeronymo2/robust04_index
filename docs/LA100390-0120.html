			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL TO TAKE TECHNICAL LOOK AT FAUVISM  </P> <P> "The Fauve Landscape: Issues of Art History and Conservation," a symposium at  the County Museum of Art on Saturday and Sunday, will address historical issues  and reveal discoveries about Fauve paintings recently made in the museum's  conservation laboratory.  </P> <P> "It was my strong conviction that it was hardly worthwhile to bring all of  these paintings from throughout the world to Los Angeles without having the  opportunity to contribute something of a technical study to the rather limited  information we've had to date of Fauve painting.  </P> <P> Hence the symposium," said curator Judi Freeman.  </P> <P> The symposium, scheduled for Saturday, 10 a.m.-6 p.m., and Sunday, 10 a.m.-2  p.m.  </P> <P> Scholars and historians scheduled to speak on Saturday include John Elderfield,  the Museum of Modern Art; Jack Flam, City University of New York; James D.  Herbert, University of Texas; John Klein, Columbia University; Michael  Parke-Taylor, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, and Inge-Vibeke  Raaschou-Nielsen, State Museum of Art, Copenhagen.  </P> <P> On Sunday, a panel of conservators and restorers will join the discussion.  Participants include Lucy Belloli, Metropolitan Museum of Art; Kristen  Hoermann, Yale University Art Gallery; Andrea Rothe, J. Paul Getty Museum;  Joseph Fronek and John Twilley, Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  </P> <P> Tickets $6 for the general public; $4 for members, students and seniors with  ID.

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Observer: Private goulash To lose one chairman is unfortunate; to lose two within a year is careless. That's the case with Hungary's AV RT state holding company, overseer of half the country's economy. Szabolcs Szekeres picked a number of fights with his political masters during his brief, four-month tenure at the top of AV RT. He condemned electricity privatisation; defied ministers by offering foreign investors the chief executive's job in the telecoms company Matav; and gave grudging support for the government's privatisation programme. The clash may also have been cultural. Szekeres was a re-emigre, a Hungarian-American returned from exile; they tend to have short public lives in today's Hungary. Szekeres' predecessor, Pal Teleki, also a re-emigre, met a similar fate last June. The government may play safe next time. Lajos Csepi, currently managing director of the State Property Agency privatisation authority, and who has impeccable bureaucratic credentials, is front-runner for the empty chair.</p>

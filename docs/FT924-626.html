			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / GM suppliers face big fines for faulty parts COMPONENT suppliers to General Motors' Saturn cars subsidiary in the US face fines at a rate of Dollars 500 (Pounds 325) for every minute of production lost through defective or mislabelled parts. The sanction is set out in a letter to all suppliers to the Spring Hill, Tennessee, plant which makes GM's Saturn range. Signed jointly by Mr Alec Bedricky, vice-president of purchasing and supplier quality, and United Auto Workers co-ordinator Mr Jerry Childers, it represents one of the starkest examples to date of the pressures now on GM - and its determination to regain competitiveness against Japanese rivals. The confidential letter, a copy of which was sent to the specialist Detroit publication Automotive News, says the fine will be invoked for any production stoppage caused by a missed just-in-time delivery, under-supply of components or materials relative to pre-agreed schedules, or sub-quality or mislabelled parts. 'Saturn has chosen to apply a flat rate of Dollars 500 per minute of lost production,' the letter says. The penalising of suppliers for production disruptions is not unknown in North America or Europe, but in the past these penalties have tended to be negotiated individually. A more formal system could set a precedent for the industry. GM refused to comment on the letter and would not say whether any penalties had been imposed since the fines regime came into effect on November 1. The Saturn plant is GM's Dollars 14bn 'showcase' venture to demonstrate that it is capable of meeting Japanese rivals head-to-head on quality and costs.

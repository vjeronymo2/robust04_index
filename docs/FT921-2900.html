			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Manufacturers' reaction mixed THE LABOUR PARTY'S shadow Budget proposals brought a mixed response from manufacturing companies yesterday. SmithKline Beecham, the UK's second-largest drug business, said: 'There is nothing in the announcement that gives any stimulation to industry whatsoever.' But Mr Kanak Bhatt, finance director of British Vita, a plastics company, said: 'A lot of Labour's ideas on revitalising industry and public-sector investment seem highly credible.' Sir Colin Corness, chairman of Redland, the building materials group, said: 'The only obvious benefit to the construction industry lies in the phased release of council-house receipts, a good thing for the construction industry and rented sector.' The Confederation of British Industry and several large companies, including ICI and BA, refused to comment. The CBI reiterated that capital allowances for investment should be raised from 25 per cent to 40 per cent, one of the shadow chancellor's proposals. The Institute of Directors called it 'a Budget for re-cycling money'. Ms Ann Robinson, head of the IoD Policy Unit said: 'It nationalises private wealth for public spending'. The IoD attacked raising capital allowances as 'fundamentally flawed'. It would 'only suck in imports of plant and equipment'. Mr John Binnie, deputy managing director of Allied Colloids, said he was sceptical about Labour's proposed Pounds 1.1bn industrial recovery programme. He said: 'Britain has tried ideas like this before and they haven't worked.' Proposals to tax the higher-paid would de-motivate senior management. Many industrialists were unimpressed by proposals to increase taxes for the higher-paid but would welcome higher capital allowances.</p>

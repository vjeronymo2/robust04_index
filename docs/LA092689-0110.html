			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NATURAL STRATEGY FOR SUCCESS;  </P> <P> SANDY GOOCH FIGURED OTHER PEOPLE MUST SHARE HER AVERSION TO CHEMICAL ADDITIVES  AND ARTIFICAL FLAVORINGS. SHE WAS RIGHT.  </P> <P> Don't tell Susan Terry that a whole-wheat Linzer torte sweetened with fruit  juice tastes as good as the white-flour-and-refined-sugar version. Like others  shopping recently at the Mrs. Gooch's natural food store in Sherman Oaks, Terry  knows what she likes -- the sugary one -- but she also knows what's good for  her.  </P> <P> Terry says of Mrs. Gooch herself: "She's done a fantastic job of upgrading the  world of health food stores."  </P> <P> Actually, plenty of Mrs. Gooch's customers see organic pastries as an example  of the elevation of health food stores to a gourmet trade. But if there's a  marketing strategy in that elevation, Sandy Gooch, 52, the founder and  part-owner of the six-store chain, doesn't like to talk about it.  </P> <P> Gooch likes to talk about how she started her Sherman Oaks-based chain of  natural food stores in 1977 after a near-fatal sip of a diet soda that laid her  out with an allergic reaction to a food additive. She likes to talk about her  mission and the Mrs. Gooch's philosophy: avoiding chemical additives,  artificial flavorings and refined sugar -- basically, a big "no" to what most  people eat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Upscale Touches  </P> <P> What's wrong with shopping at Vons or Ralph's or Lucky stores? "I don't know  that anything is really wrong with shopping" at the big supermarket chains,  Sandy Gooch says. "But if you're concerned about your health, it'll probably  take a lot longer to shop at those markets."  </P> <P> Gooch and her chief executive, John Moorman, aren't running typical  brown-rice-and-wheatgerm health food stores. Mrs. Gooch's will do about $75  million in sales this year. Sure, they sell fresh wheatgrass juice, but the  clean stores also have subdued lighting, a gourmet deli with barbecued chicken  brochettes and whole-wheat croissants and a high level of service -- the  upscale touches that have made Mrs. Gooch's popular in Sherman Oaks, Beverly  Hills, West Los Angeles and Hermosa Beach.  </P> <P> For most supermarkets, it takes moving a mountain of meat and potatoes to turn  a profit. The average profit for full-service supermarkets is a mere 1.5 cents  per dollar of sales. Gooch claims that her chain averages closer to 2 to 2.5  cents profit.  </P> <P> That may have something to do with the fact that natural foods are now more for  yuppies than hippies.  </P> <P> "The so-called baby boom is growing up and realizing they, too, get old and are  just that much more concerned with exercise and health," said Anthony Harnett,  the owner of Bread &amp; Circus, a successful $50-million-a-year chain of  natural good groceries in Boston.  </P> <P> Unsurprisingly, Mrs. Gooch's stores in L.A. are in the same places where there  are plenty of well-educated, well-to-do people, aged 25 to 50, who are willing  to spend top dollar on food. But maybe talking about marketing doesn't make for  good marketing.  </P> <P> Gooch reluctantly admits that her company studies demographics closely. In  fact, the average neighborhood or city where Mrs. Gooch's are located beats  countywide average household income figures by about 33%.  </P> <P> Gooch also doesn't like to talk about how much more it costs to shop at one of  her stores than at a regular supermarket. In a highly unscientific test, a  pre-selected list of groceries, from steak and broccoli to dish soap, recently  cost about 30% more at a Mrs. Gooch's store than at a Vons store just down the  street.  </P> <P> But Gooch said that was a fluke and estimated that a person buying basic brands  at a typical grocery store would pay only 5% more to shop for natural foods at  her stores.  </P> <P> For true believers in health food, Mrs. Gooch's has much to offer -- like  wheatgrass juice (85 cents for an ounce), a brew that Gooch claims is a mixer  for drinks and that's molecularly similar to human blood. "If somebody wants a  high, I suggest they try" it, she said. But Gooch admitted someone once told  her the taste "reminds them of doggie breath."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Simulating Junk Food  </P> <P> The trick to marketing natural food to baby boomers isn't in preaching to the  ranks of wheatgrass juice drinkers, it's in striking a fine balance between  what average customers think that they should eat and what they crave. The  lesson was driven home in 1987 to Anthony Harnett, owner of Bread &amp; Circus,  a successful natural food chain in Boston, when he tried to remove alcohol and  caffeine from store shelves on the grounds that they are both addictive drugs.  He was faced with a customer rebellion.  </P> <P> Gooch has avoided a similar rebellion by never selling alcohol or caffeine in  the first place. But she's well aware that she has to offer her customers  products that at least simulate some of the junk food that they are accustomed  to eating. "We're not saying people have to walk around with tofu and sprouts  hanging from their mouths," Gooch said. So her stores sell everything from ice  cream and cookies (flavored with fruit juices, not sugar) to carob candy bars.  </P> <P> Some big, traditional grocery chains have started imitating natural food  stores, according to Patricia Heydlauff, executive director of the National  Nutritional Foods Assn. Stuart Rosenthal, executive vice president for  marketing for the Vons Companies, Inc., says most Vons stores now sell  organically grown produce, and like Mrs. Gooch's, Vons is trying to give  customers more nutritional information -- particularly about fat and  cholesterol.  </P> <P> But with a 23% share of the Los Angeles grocery market (according to Grocery  Marketing magazine), Vons isn't looking over its shoulder. "Are we threatened  by Mrs. Gooch's?" asked Rosenthal. "No."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alexandre Garcia, from Brasilia] </F>   [Text] President Itamar Franco has said that the objective  of public service is to serve the people -- not to make the  lives of the Brazilian people even more difficult. The final  straw was yesterday's takeover of the public building that  houses the Federal Police headquarters in Brasilia.    Strategic Affairs Secretary Mario Flores said that the Army  was summoned because public disorder is unacceptable. The Army  is using heavy weapons and equipment to discourage any  resistance from the strikers, who were armed. Resistance might  have serious consequences.    A short time ago, the president of the National Federation  of  Federal Policemen said the strikers will return their arms to  the government to prove the peaceful nature of the strike.    The government claims the Army was summoned to guarantee  constitutional rights and to prevent indiscipline, the taking  over of public buildings, armed strikes, and to guarantee the  right to work.    President Franco is now meeting with Army Minister Zenildo  Zoroastro de Lucena and with Flores to evaluate the situation  and its developments.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] "Bloodshed--one's own and that of  others--is practically a natural element of an emerging  country," writes Gerard Dupuy in the 27 April Paris daily  LIBERATION. This "democratic celebration of death, both given  and received," has marked the history of the two last centuries,  he continues. However, it is as if those countries that first  invented this "bloody baptism" have distanced themselves from it  to the point of considering it a "negation of their own ideals."  Democracies, Dupuy comments, no longer want to see blood,  beginning with that of their own people. This "fear of death" is  one of the fundamental rules of the modern political contract  and can be "intuitively" understood when applied to domestic  policy. The inherent contradiction is only revealed when  crossing into foreign policy, for the principle in no way  dovetails with the most gigantic accumulation of the means of  death ever seen. However, the public's "detestation" of violence  and blood does not lead it to pacifism and the "virtues of  passive resistance." Leaders are thus confronted by a strange  demand: obtain the results of war without exposure to the damage  it entails. The Persian Gulf War was a "remarkable  interpretation" of this demand, Dupuy argues, since it aimed at  winning without risking soldiers' deaths, not even the enemies',  which were reduced to "collateral damage." The "new world order"  could thus be imagined, since it possessed the adequate  instrument for regulation. Since then, however, various peoples  "have not given up killing each other," Dupuy writes. The horror  of bloodshed has brought back the old contradictory need to use  naked force while refusing to bear its effects. The term  "cowardice" has been used a little too quickly, he adds, as if  leaders needed "courage" to send soldiers to their deaths--for  which "a good dose of cynicism is sufficient." "Cowardice" is  apparent among those who advocate an open intervention in full  awareness of its bloody consequences, because they know that  even a genuinely concerned public is not ready to witness the  shedding of its own soldiers' blood, just as it is unprepared to  bear passively the image of the violence they may have to  inflict. In reality, neither side is a coward, Dupuy concludes.  "They are powerless because of internal limitations, and  paralyzed by a contradiction no one can understand."    In his 23 April editorial in the Paris weekly LE POINT,  Claude Imbert notes the West's powerlessness in preventing  massacres around the world. While an "American-inspired sudden  burst" of NATO may temporarily erase the UN's "humiliation" in  Bosnia, it will not bring any lasting change to Europe's  inability to have those principles it wishes to export respected  at home, Imbert writes. While the French must certainly defend  their values, notably in their own country, the state cannot  ignore its limitations with regard to "international policing."  Thus, when this "cold monster" wants to impose French values on  others, it must secure the means--even if military--to do so,  "lest it offer an image of bravado." It is thus "audacious" to  affirm the "universalism of our mission," Imbert continues,  especially when the West is tolerating the death of hundreds of  thousands in Africa, where "our compassion does not suggest  peacemaking expeditions." France's "universalism," he notes,  "evaporates in the tropics," and for good reason, since "the  rice sacks seen on television destined for Somalia had to be  delivered by the military which in turn needed a state apparatus  to humanize the Somalian crisis, and that, then, implied the  restitution of a colonial order." At this point, Imbert  comments, "we silently stole away." Of course, he continues,  Bosnia is in Europe and while European interests there are more  closely engaged, it is not as if European nations would declare  war against Belgrade, given that Europe is faced with the local  populations' "rabid" desire to carve out a niche of their own.  "Our European duty," Imbert continues, is to prevent the worst  massacres and pave the way for a political settlement. The  United Nations, he writes, "can do only what a Tower of Babel  can, that is, very little." As for NATO, "it does what U.S.  public opinion dictates," and Europe, the most directly  concerned, "does almost nothing because it is a body with a  divided head and no arms." French foreign policy "circulates as  it can in this political-military maquis." Imbert asks his  readers not to condemn it, but rather condemn "our people and  our guides who for 40 years have rejected a military Europe."  "Between what is happening, what is expected and what can be  done, words should conform to acts," he concludes.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Success of youth training questioned Government training programmes for young people and their success in providing qualifications were criticised by the Unemployment Unit yesterday. The unit, which campaigns for better opportunities for young people, said previously unreleased data for 1992-93 showed that only 21 per cent of leavers from Youth Training, the training scheme for people aged 16 to 19, achieved a National Vocational Qualification at level 2 - the vocational equivalent of 4 GCSEs. Nearly three-fifths of all YT trainees dropped out early, and half of all leavers failed to get any kind of qualification or credit towards one. The unit said the poor performance was not just a consequence of the characteristics of the client group but the result of poor-quality programmes and the qualifications which were prescribed by government funding priorities. The Department of Employment said the proportion of YT trainees studying for a qualification had increased by 50 per cent since 1987-88. It added that more than 70 per cent of trainees completing gained a qualification or credits towards one. Working Brief 57. August/September 1994. 409 Brixton Road, London SW9 7DG.

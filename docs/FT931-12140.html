			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / French Socialists reconciled to poll disaster: After the long years of power, President Mitterrand's party knows its time is up - The election prospects THE talk these days at the Rue Solferino headquarters of France's ruling Socialists is of rebuilding the party - but after, not before, the parliamentary elections in March. For there, as in the rest of the country, it is assumed that in seven weeks' time the Socialists will take their worst electoral hammering in nearly 20 years. Certainly, Mr Laurent Fabius, the Socialists' secretary-general, has again this week complained at the widespread expectation of a right-wing landslide. But Mr Christian Pierret, the Socialists' campaign co-ordinator, sets his sights low when he says he hopes that 'by the end of the campaign we will reach 23-24 per cent in the opinion polls'. A couple of extra percentage points in the polls would make all the difference, he says. If in March the Socialists won only the 19-20 per cent of the vote which most polls now give them, the number of their deputies would sink from 270 to 80-90. But 23-24 per cent could, under the majority voting system, translate into 130-150 seats. This, says Mr Pierret, 'could be considered a victory - or at least an honourable defeat'. The modesty of Socialists' hopes and the magnitude of their fears are not surprising, given their disarray. Mrs Marie-Noelle Lienemann can say publicly the party's 'time is over' and still keep her job as junior housing minister. Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the left-wing opponent of Maastricht, can run a slate of 30 dissident Socialist candidates (one of them against Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister) and still stay on the party's national committee. This is tolerance born of weakness after the battering which the Socialists have taken during a decade in power. Even their pre-1986 stint in government continues to haunt them. Mr Fabius, who was prime minister in 1984-86, and two ex-health ministers are to go before a parliamentary impeachment procedure to defend themselves against charges of negligence in allowing Aids-contaminated blood to be given to haemophiliacs. More widely damaging are the charges of taking illegal (because hidden) corporate cash, on which Mr Henri Emmanuelli, the National Assembly president and ex-Socialist treasurer, has been indicted. In organising a national redistribution of kickbacks on public contracts, the Socialists may just have been doing more openly what all French parties have long done in a less organised way. But the effect was worse, says Mr Pierret, because 'we used to be regarded as the party of the politically pure'. President Francois Mitterrand went too far for his own party in proposing last autumn a total ban on companies funding political parties. The Socialists joined other parties in passing a law simply requiring greater disclosure of corporate cash. Yet the president is himself a liability to his fellow Socialists. With a 26 per cent approval rating in last weekend's IFOP poll, his popularity is back down to where it was before the Maastricht referendum. Nor have president and prime minister been pulling smoothly in harness. Within a fortnight of Mr Mitterrand's New Year message, which sent the Socialists into battle under the slogan of defending social policy gains, Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy was suggesting that one solution for France's financially-strapped state pension scheme would be to make people work longer before qualifying for retirement pay. The Socialist governments of 1981-86 saw through social reforms including a lower retirement age and reduced working hours. Mr Pierret regrets they did not do more in the good years of the late 1980s: 'Now we are regarded as serious managers of the system, not as reformers.' On the economy, the government has chalked up a number of achievements in the last year, getting inflation down to a 36-year low of 2 per cent and producing a FFr30bn (Dollars 5.55bn) trade surplus. But part of the price of success is a jobless total of nearly 3m. This weighs heavily on Socialist shoulders. In such a period of decline, perhaps inevitable after so long in power, the Socialists' structural flaws become more evident. One of the weaknesses is that, unlike social democratic parties in the rest of Europe, the party has no natural constituency within the trade unions. It has also let slip from its grasp the ecological movement, which is progressing far faster in France than elsewhere in Europe. A CAF opinion poll yesterday put Generation Ecologique, together with the Greens, at 19 per cent, ahead of the Socialists with 17.5 per cent. Virtually the only consolation on the Rue Solferino is the knowledge that France's right is as sharply divided as the Socialists. Playing on the opposition's divisions is the Socialists' best, maybe only, gambit.</p>

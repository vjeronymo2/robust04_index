			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: Few acts of outrage at Summer Exhibition - Patricia Morison reviews some of this year's 1,800 exhibits THE ARTIST bites back in the catalogue to this year's Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. According to Tom Phillips RA, it is only the critics  - languid, and blinkered as they are - who fail to perceive the 'defiant outrageousness' of the Summer Exhibition. The people, on the other hand, flock to Burlington House to 'assert their democratic right to know what is going on in the visual arts'. This year, the People's Show in London's Piccadilly exhibits 1,800 works, slightly more than before. It is the last Summer Exhibition under the presidency of Sir Roger de Grey, who retires this autumn. Pace Phillips, the show is an enjoyable one although, as ever, so much work and so varied is likely to give anyone a touch of the wilts - not just a critic. In a year of blood-letting and stuffed fish, it is something to be grateful for that individual acts of outrage are absent from the RA. Once again, a hotchpotch of international grandees is found in the first two galleries; a wall of six glaring Hockneys, also Kiefer, Liechtenstein, Jasper Johns, Eduardo Chillida, and so on. To my mind, the Summer Exhibition would be none the worse if it reverted to its old pattern and did without the grandees. A corner of repose amid the peculiar jumble is created by 'A Crucifixion' and 'The Example - With Acknowledgements' by Robert Medley, next to Ken Howard's 'Muse d'Orsay' and his magical view of the Tuileries Gardens. Retrospective groups of eight Academicians who have died in the past year contribute a particular quality to this year's hang. Many visitors will realise with real sadness that Peter Greenham, Richard Eurich and Sir Robin Phillipson appear for the last time. Two examples of Phillipson's genius for the small, colourful pastel drawing should not be missed in the watercolour gallery. John Bratby and Elizabeth Frink dominate Gallery III. Together with John Bellany, they are the most commanding presences in the exhibition. The Korn/Ferry Award for the Picture of the Year was awarded to Bellany's 'Sunset Song', a group portrait of his family hung in the Central Hall. The RA's other big prize, the Charles Wollaston Award, was given to Paolozzi for the bronze 'Road to the Isles'. Gallery X, mainly sculpture, is a mess and not improved by a fearsome blue tondo by Gillian Ayres. But then sculpture is rarely shown to advantage at the Summer Exhibition. Look out for Allen Jones's little fragment of a female torso which does indeed, as the title suggests, cry out for a caress. I could see the point of Peter Randall Page's 'Where the Bee Sucks', bought for the Tate under the Chantrey Bequest. It is best described as an enormous sheep's dropping carved in stone. William Pye's water-sculpture, 'Plateau', is a fascinating piece. In a bronze vessel, a broad rim of still water presents a surface like black lacquer contrasting with limpid stream coursing at the foot. For the second year, Peter Blake has filled his gallery with small pictures crammed frame-to-frame, many of them by naive artists. It is an exercise in sheer egotism and wretched for exhibitors thus press-ganged into a Blake creation. In the Small South Room, the cramming of small pictures is equally bad but is at least hallowed by tradition. Among the works to hold my eye was 'Towards the Sea', a very small, atmospheric landscape by Nikki Danks, also Charles Hardaker's keyhole views of the Underground. Anne Gardener's 'Face Pack' and 'The Convalescent' by Mark Shields stand out from a number of balefully staring self-portraits. One of the best things in the show is Stephen Goddard's portrait of an old woman, painterly, poignant, and immensely skillful. In contrast, one notices how few large, commissioned portraits there are compared with a decade ago. The small self-portrait and the 'Portrait of a Waiting Woman' by Tai-Shan Schierenberg are admirable. As last year, I am affected by the vulnerability of James Rushton's watercolour heads. The print selection is terrific. Rothenstein's small screen-print, 'Japanese Kite', crackles with the same exuberance as his larger ones. In a year short on the erotic, there is a ripe 'Semele' by Tom Phillips. Norman Ackroyd's 'Scottish Glen' has a transcendental beauty - what a wonderfully gifted artist Ackroyd is, able so perfectly to capture the spirit of very different places. Look, too, for John Howard's stark 'Disused Viaduct', Sean Harris's 'Hawksbill Turtle', and from the sculptor Nicola Hicks, a sheet of six spirited etchings of farmyard animals called 'Old Macdonald'. Elizabeth Blackadder's fascination with traditional Japan has inspired two memorable works; 'Shrine, Kyoto' and 'Reflections in a Black Pool.' Among other RAs who exhibit work on the grand scale, it is a memorably good year for Anthony Wishaw. At first sight His massive canvas, 'Autumn Spinney' might appear dour but then reveals its lyrical quality, a season simplified by the painter's eye into branches, a scatter of red berries and silver streaks of frost. Sonia Lawson is another RA who can be relied on not to trot out a well-tried formula. This year, her paintings range from a large still-life evoking Holland (herring, windmills, tulip-bulbs) to the strongly symbolist 'Homage to William Blake'. Although hung high and hard to see, Alfred Whiteley's 'Family Group with Boer Soldier' is an interesting, enigmatic painting. Peter Layzell's 'Crowds Around a Fire' has a mysteriously supernatural quality in a year when there are many small pictures of obscurely menacing figures. I was also much taken by Brian Nolan's still life, 'Apres Midi', Robert Chandler's subtle 'Blue Vase' several attractive watercolours by Victoria Crowe, and strong, uninhibited charcoal landscapes by Tessanna Hoare.

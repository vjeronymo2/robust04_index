			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE PANEL PONDERS DEPARTMENTAL CHANGES;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: RANDOM DRUG TESTING OF OFFICERS, CLOSER SCRUTINY OF NEW HIRES  ARE BEING CONSIDERED.  </P> <P> A San Diego Police Department ethics board may recommend department-wide random  drug testing, a special anti-corruption unit to deal with potential abuses  among officers, and more extensive scrutiny of new hires, an ethics committee  member said Wednesday.  </P> <P> At the same time, the department's second-in-command is conducting a police  management audit that is designed to test whether the department's policies are  being carried out and whether its organizational structure is sound.  </P> <P> The ethics review, considered the most extensive in department history, began  in February when top administrators decided that police officers were not  getting any ethics training once they graduated from the Police Academy.  </P> <P> Lt. Dennis Gibson, a member of the 20-person committee, told a citizen's  advisory board that studies police issues that his group is expecting to  forward a number of recommendations to Police Chief Bob Burgreen in the next  four or five months.  </P> <P> One of those recommendations may include mandatory random drug testing for all  employees, he said.  </P> <P> The department put a program into place last month to test about 150 officers  who work in highly sensitive units, such as internal affairs, narcotics,  criminal intelligence, gangs and vice. Gibson said 26 tests have been performed  so far, and nobody has tested positive for drugs.  </P> <P> San Diego and South Lake Tahoe are the only departments to impose such  mandatory tests, which the president of the state's largest law-enforcement  association -- the Peace Officers Research Assn. of California -- opposes.  </P> <P> Now the committee is considering whether to randomly test all 1,850 police  officers. It would cost the department about $220,000 a year to test each  employee twice, he said.  </P> <P> In addition, the department may establish a special corruption unit whose  investigators would handle sensitive police misconduct cases, Gibson said. Such  investigations now are handled by the police internal affairs division.  </P> <P> Gibson said few departments in the country have corruption units and the San  Diego Police Department is wary of establishing one because of the public  perception that to create one is to admit that corruption exists.  </P> <P> Senior officers, from Burgreen on down, say their department is now  corruption-free despite allegations that police officers may have had improper  contact with prostitutes in the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> Burgreen recently suggested that the ethics committee establish guidelines that  discourage officers from getting personally involved with prostitutes after  allegations surfaced that at least five police officers and one former officer  may have had such improper involvement.  </P> <P> A special unit of the Metropolitan Homicide Task Force -- the group of  investigators examining the deaths of 43 women, mostly prostitutes and  transients, since 1985 -- is looking at allegations that police officers may  have had relationships with one of the murdered women and another prostitute  who has been missing for four years.  </P> <P> Some members of the department believe that not enough is being done to test  for possible corruption, such as carefully auditing money in narcotics cases or  inspecting crime scenes to see if officers follow proper procedures.  </P> <P> Gibson said that if the committee does not recommend creation of a special  corruption unit, it may advise Burgreen to expand the internal affairs staff.  </P> <P> It may also recommend that greater scrutiny be placed on new hires, including  the expansion of screening committees that decide who gets hired and asking  personnel administrators to personally visit recruits' job references.  </P> <P> "The committee feels strongly that if we are concerned about honesty, integrity  and credibility of police officers, we need to start at the ground floor and  ensure to the extent possible that we attract only the most qualified and  ethical people that we can," Gibson said.  </P> <P> The committee also is considering whether to rotate officers out of specialized  assignments such as narcotics enforcement, criminal intelligence, vice and  gangs to keep the units corruption-free.  </P> <P> Gibson said San Diego police are not alone in their lack of ethics training  programs.  </P> <P> "A national survey we did indicated we're not different from a lot of  departments," he said. "There's just not much being done in the area of ethics  awareness or training."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Assistant Chief Norm Stamper said he has been assigned to study the  department's organizational structure.  </P> <P> Burgreen had assigned Stamper to personally review the prostitute murder cases.  </P> <P> Stamper recommended that the task force membership be nearly doubled and  divided into three areas: one team to examine all the murder victims; another  to scrutinize possible police misconduct, and the third to investigate the  death of prostitute Donna Gentile, who was murdered in 1985 shortly after she  testified against two police officers.  </P> <P> Stamper said Wednesday his work with the task force has been completed.  </P> <P> He said Burgreen is concerned that police policies are not being carried out  because there are seven levels of management between the police chief and the  patrol officers.  </P> <P> Because of such a long chain of command, Stamper said, Burgreen's messages  about what he wants done in the department may not be filtering down.  </P> <P> "My first job is an audit of the organization," he said. "What is the extent to  which the chief's philosophies and policies are translated into practice? The  second part of the assignment is: Are we organized effectively to get police  work done?"  </P> <P> Stamper said he will also be sitting in on ethics committee meetings and on  those of a separate police group looking at the department's use of deadly  force.  </P> <P> "I can tell you that the chief would like to see a much stronger community  orientation," Stamper said. "The bywords of his administration are dignity and  respect. He wants citizens treated with dignity and respect and wants to  communicate that message to the officers."  </P></p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Fimbra call over watchdog A call for people who work in the financial services industry to be fully involved in the proposed new retail financial services watchdog came yesterday from one of the regulators it is to replace. The council of Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for independent financial advisers, said it was 'vital' that there should be proper involvement by practitioners, in the interests of investor protection. The statement is a modest boost for the planned personal investment authority, since Fimbra does not take issue with the proposal that only nine of the 19-strong PIA board should be practitioners. Independent financial advisers, who make up Fimbra, have been among the most outspoken critics of the PIA proposals, arguing that in their current state they do not represent self-regulation. At the same time, however, the statement offers a clear warning about the sort of structure Fimbra wants to see the PIA adopt. It urges strongly that practitioners should be fully involved in committees and working parties which report directly to the PIA board. This reflects unease within the IFA sector that the PIA may be an 'executive-driven' regulator - closer to the model of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, than to Lautro, the self-regulatory organisation for the life insurance industry, where committees play a greater role. The PIA board will meet today to discuss its draft prospectus and application to be recognised as a regulator. Squabble, Page 21</p>

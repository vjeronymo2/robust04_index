			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Beijing police resumed their harassment of  dissidents' relatives immediately after the United States  renewed China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status last  week. Police moved into position outside the home of Chen  Zihua, sister of released political prisoner Chen Ziming, early  on Friday [27 May ] morning, hours after US President Bill  Clinton announced that he was severing the link between human  rights and MFN renewal. A police car and six uniformed officers  remained in position until 2 am, closely monitoring the family's  activities.    It was the first time Chen's family had been put under  surveillance since the National Peoples' Congress met in Beijing  in March. Chen was released two weeks ago on medical parole  after serving nearly five years of a 13-year sentence, in a move  seen as concession to the Clinton administration in order to win  MFN renewal. However, Chen was not allowed to return home and  was forced instead to leave Beijing with his wife and parents.  He is not expected to return until after the fifth anniversary  of the June 4 crackdown. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Ratifying Gatt The Uruguay Round is apparently never safe. Now the problem is ratification, which is supposed to be finished this year. But difficulties are arising, not least in the US. Mr Clinton can be criticised on many counts, but on trade - with the major exception of his administration's narrow-minded approach to Japan  - he has been largely right. He did succeed in ratifying the North American Free Trade Agreement and completing the Uruguay Round negotiations. He is right now to insist that the Senate should stay in session until the round is ratified. Time has run short, partly because Mr Clinton delayed too long in trying to gain acceptance of a new 'fast track' negotiating authority that covered labour standards and the environment. By introducing the bill only last Tuesday, the president gave the initiative to the protectionist chairman of the Senate commerce committee, Ernest Hollings, who has the power to hold hearings for 45 days. That would take the vote beyond the planned date of adjournment, next week. Mr Clinton is asking the Senate to return after a recess for the congressional elections. There should then be enough time to complete ratification before the newly elected Senate replaces the present one next year. Otherwise, the bill would lapse and might prove difficult to revive. The issue must be understood. It is not whether Mr Clinton, the Democrats or the Republicans 'win'. It is whether the US will take a big step in the direction it has pursued for half a century, or turn its back on its achievements and the world's hopes.</p>

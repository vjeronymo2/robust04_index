			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Arts: Lorenzo in London / Review of the Renaissance exhibition at the Accademia Italiana A great patron can only exist at a time and in a place where great art is to be found. Last year Florence spared no expense in commemorating the fifth centenary of the death of one of its most illustrious sons. No fewer than nine exhibitions were devoted to the art and culture of the age of Lorenzo the Magnificent. It may be that a tireless visitor would have come away with a more profound understanding of the relationship between the man and his time, but it seems more likely that he would have been unable to see the wood for the trees. Now the Accademia Italiana in London offers a kind of digest of the Florentine shows in a single exhibition. It was a bold undertaking, not least in a venue outside Italy (Italian museums are renowned for their reluctance to lend works of art) and one as essentially domestic in scale as the Accademia. The catalogue  - despite the lamentable translation  - is very illuminating about Laurentian architecture and Lorenzo as a patron and collector, the political and religious life of late 15th century Florence, its spectacular public entertainments and the workshop system of its artists and craftsmen. Those who do not invest in it (Pounds 18) will find a quite different show. Its strength lies in the power of the exhibits to bring to life not so much Lorenzo as some aspect of the vanished world of Renaissance Florence. That object might be a richly gilded ceremonial helmet topped by a predatory eagle from the vast workshop of Antonio del Pollaiolo; a noble 2nd century AD bronze head of a horse from the Medici collection beside the much smaller contemporary version it no doubt inspired; or a humble patchwork cushion. Perhaps such juxtapositions explain exhibition designer Maurizio di Puolo's brutalist chipboard and gold leaf. Exceptional works of art are to be found. Particular treats include a miniature Crucifixion by Fra Angelico and Fra Bartolomeo's exquisite grisaille panels from the tabernacle of Pietro del Pugliese. From San Gimignano comes a bust of an obscure local saint, Santa Fina, by Pietro Torregiano. Demonised by posterity as the teenage lout who broke Michelangelo's nose, or at least as the author of Henry VII's tomb in Westminster Abbey, he reveals himself here capable of extraordinary feats of delicacy. As if in a gesture of deliberate ostentation, the sculpture is carved out of fine marble and then painted. The least important works of art are often the most telling, not least the anonymous, meticulously detailed account of Savonarola's execution at the stake. This piece of reportage is made all the more chilling for its wide-eyed naivety  - and also because the Piazza della Signoria has changed so little since then. Inevitably the Renaissance is thought of in terms of 'high' art and of an unbroken succession of masterpieces. One of the show's most refreshing features is that it continually challenges these misconceptions. Laurentian Florence not only produced such high-minded and princely objects as the masterly small bronze Hercules on Horseback by Bertoldo di Giovanni, the mentor of Michelangelo, but the primitive but no less compelling 'Madonna del Soccorso' which belongs more to the folk tradition of the peasant ex-voto. The Virgin appears larger than life and brandishing a knobbly club with which to ward off a bearded scarlet monster of a devil. He can snarl as much as he pleases but the child will be able to return to the safe embrace of his praying mother. Lorenzo is powerfully present in the sequence of lavishly mounted hardstone cups and vases, and in the manuscripts. Fashioned out of rock-crystal, sardonyx, cornelian and amethyst, the former blazon his name, the letters LAV. R MED cut into their very surface. Such gems, ancient and modern, were Lorenzo's passion. It is revealing that his prized Farnese Cup, perhaps the most impressive of all antique cameos, was valued at 10,000 florins. A mere Botticelli was worth around 100. As far as we know, he never cared to buy one. Medici emblems and those of the man himself  - the laurel wreath being the most obvious  - sumptuously embellish the manuscripts that he acquired or commissioned to supplement the already extensive family library. The creation of the Laurentian Library at San Lorenzo was to absorb much of Lorenzo's energies and finances during his later years. His was the last great manuscript collection of the Renaissance, amassed at a time when the invention of printing had already sounded their death-knell. Renaissance Florence: The Age of Lorenzo de' Medici 1449-1492, sponsored by the American Express Foundation, continues until January 23, 1994 at the Accademia Italiana, 24 Rutland Gate, SW7.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Zhao Wei (6392 5898)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- At the Second Session  of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], the deputies  have been discussing reform, development, and stability.  Naturally, many of them have also discussed the establishment  of a socialist market economic structure and the ongoing reform  of the market structure. Whenever they touched on the topic of  market, some deputies expressed their worries and uneasiness  about society's misunderstanding of and prejudices against  markets.    At present, there is a representative view on markets: In a  market economic structure, all things and all departments should  move into the market; they will be judged by the market and  their fate will be decided by the market. It seems that the  market is omnipotent. There is another view: the greatest  interest of the market is profit-making. It seems that the  market will certainly lead to "money worshipping." Some  deputies held that these two tendencies are wrong and that if  allowed to develop, they may delay or even hinder the reform on  the establishment of a market economic structure.    We have suffered losses from failure to abide by the law  governing the operation of markets. At a time when a market  structure was put into operation for the first time, many people  harbored illusions about markets, the nature of which were not  familiar to them. To them it seemed that a market was like a  magic wand which can solve all problems. In fact it is not  true. A market also has its dead corner. For example,  government actions, compulsory education, basic science  research, and quality intellectual products.... It is difficult  to use market prices and market demands to measure their value  and functions. This means that there is something the market is  unable to do. Deputy Li Jingwen said if government institutions  also act as the main competitors in the market, the move will  lead to the practice of trading power for money and the  occurrence of corrupt phenomena. Deputies Tao Xiping and Pan Ji  held that everyone knows the social benefits created by basic  education and basic science research, the former is the  foundation for raising the educational level of the Chinese  nation and the latter is the mother of all types of applied  research. However, it is difficult for the market to repay  these achievements in the form of exchange or according to their  production value. The state should assume protection of these  areas. Citing ordinary reading materials and academic works as  an example, some deputies from the cultural and theoretical  circles pointed out that by comparison, the value of the latter  is much higher than the former, but the judgment of the market  is frequently the opposite. Therefore, the market should not be  allowed to decide the fate of all things. The plight of  symphony orchestras, ballet dances, plays, and other magnificent  arts has invoked strong responses from all sectors of society.  This situation reflects, to a certain extent, the imbalance  brought about by allowing the market to regulate everything.    As an economist, Deputy Li Jingwen said: Speaking from the  angle of an enterprise, the purpose of a market economy is to  seek maximum returns, but this is not the same as the  profit-before-everything mentality. Speaking of the market  economic structure itself, what it seeks is optimizing the  allocation of resources, thereby gaining maximum returns. In a  sense a market economy means a market governed by laws and  regulations. It demands that maximum profits be realized  through legitimate competition on equal terms, and what it  stresses is reasonable; but the profit-before-everything  mentality refers to seeking exorbitant profits by resorting to  unscrupulous means or even fraud and swindling, and is entirely  different from competition on equal terms. It is groudless to  assume that a market economy will inevitably lead to money  worshipping. That is a misunderstanding of or a prejudice  against the market economy.    Many deputies held that to eliminate people's  misunderstanding of a market economy, the best way is to  accelerate the pace of building the socialist market economic  structure, deepen the reform of the market structure, and enable  people to step into the market with an understanding of it and  the laws and rules governing it. In this way, they will not  reject or avoid the market, nor will they indulge in  supersitions about the market. Speaking from the angle of the  government, the government should render support for the "dead  corners" of markets and for the areas in which it cannot fully  get involved. To seek a balanced development in society, the  government should have explicit policies on what should be  decontrolled and preserved.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Patient makes slow progress: As hopes of an end to recession start to brighten, economic barometers show mixed climate THE BATTERED UK economy, like a hospital patient coming round from major surgery, appears to be heading for recovery. But the first steps are proving painfully slow. In a signal that the recession, which started about mid 1990, might be nearing an end, a Gallup survey at the end of last week showed consumer confidence sharply higher since the election. Sectors such as TV advertising, recruitment and housing show signs of life, while over Easter many retailers reported buoyant sales. In the past month, several surveys of business opinion have indicated increased optimism - a message likely to be echoed tomorrow when the Confederation of British Industry publishes its quarterly report on prospects for manufacturers. Few people in business, however, predict a quick end to the country's longest recession since the 1930s. Mr Peter Clappison, finance director of the BBA automotive parts group, said: 'We are seeing greater optimism, but very little (in terms of extra UK orders) is coming through the door.' Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman and chief executive of British Polythene Industries, Europe's biggest maker of polyethylene film for agriculture, construction and retailing, said the order profile from customers remained 'flat'. Several industry representatives said, however, they had seen signs of increased economic activity in recent weeks, some of it possibly helped by the removal of political uncertainty after the election. Mr David Powis, director of the British Forging Industry Association, which represents 100 companies in areas such as cars, aerospace and mining equipment, said: 'Over the past four to six weeks, member companies have been reporting greater levels of customer inquiries.' Mr Jim Winship, director of the Pizza and Pasta Association, which has 700 members in the food industry and catering, said: 'Companies are behaving as though a recovery is going to happen, for instance by stepping up marketing support for their products and services.' Mr Ian McColl, finance director at plastic pipe and industrial equipment maker Victaulic, said: 'The telephone is ringing more often. Since the election our customers seem to have done more to crystallise their plans.' As for the business exhibitions industry, which depends on a range of companies spread across manufacturing and services, prospects are brighter. Mr Bill Richards, of the Exhibition Industry Federation, said: 'A year ago our members were moaning about the recession. Now they are finding customers are actually confirming plans for future events.' The harsh business climate has benefited one group of companies - insolvency practitioners. Even in that area, though, it is possible to find signs that the recession may be drawing to a close. Mr Peter Phillips, a partner in Buchler Phillips, a leading insolvency practice, said many of the companies being put into liquidation were the result of bankers 'clearing out intolerable debts in favour of more exciting projects'. He added: 'We have been through the biggest boom in insolvencies for 30 years. But I feel the worst in terms of the state of the economy is behind us.'</p>

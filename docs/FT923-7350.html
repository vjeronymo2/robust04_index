			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Starvation fear for 18m people An estimated 18m people in 10 southern African nations face food shortages because of drought, a regional planning group says, AP reports from Harare. In its latest bulletin obtained in Harare , the Southern African Development Community's Early Warning Unit said food shortages were severest in Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Because of southern Africa's worst drought this century, most SADC member nations have virtually exhausted strategic food reserves by meeting immediate needs, the bulletin said. 'The current stock position for the region is very precarious,' it said. The 10-nation grouping - Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe - now holds some 813,000 tonnes of grain in stock, enough for about three weeks' consumption. The bulletin noted that delivery of food supplies to isolated areas was held up by the civil war in Mozambique and transport problems in Angola, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p>

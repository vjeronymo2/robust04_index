			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko deemed  the adoption by the Ukrainian Supreme Council of a resolution on  withdrawing reservations to Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol to  be an important event. Speaking at a news conference held at  the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry today, the minister emphasized  that an important fact about this resolution is that the Supreme  Council positively evaluated steps taken by the Ukrainian  president and Government directed at implementing  recommendations suggested by the Ukrainian parliament, which was  reflected in the tripartite declaration and a supplement to it.  It should be stressed, Anatoliy Zlenko noted, that by taking  back its reservations to Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, the  Ukrainian Supreme Council reconfirmed Ukraine's intention to  join the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state.  He also explained that the fact that the resolution did not  contain a decision to join the Nonproliferation Treaty should  not be understood as the legislature's negative attitude toward  the treaty in principle, but as its intention to examine this  issue at a separate session. This proves, Anatoliy Zlenko said,  that the issue of joining the treaty has not been taken off the  agenda.</p>

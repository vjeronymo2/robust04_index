			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Apres moi, le vide: The race to replace Jacques Delors is based on false expectations Smart Alecs on the European circuit have lately taken to poor-mouthing Jacques Delors as if he had over-stayed his welcome and over-stretched his powers. But if you want an objective measure of what Delors has achieved in his 10 years as president of the European Commission, you only have to look at the international calibre of the politicians who want to succeed him. A decade may or may not be too long. But the fact is that Mr Delors has raised the status of his job to a level where only those with top qualifications need apply. Walter Hallstein, the first president of the Commission, was also by far the most impressive, until Delors came along; and yet Hallstein, came from a modest background as a junior minister in the German government. Roy Jenkins was another distinguished president, and he had had a much more prominent national political career; but Jenkins never quite made it to the top in British politics. Today, in contrast, the battle to succeed Delors is being fought out between prime ministerial candidates: Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgium, and Ruud Lubbers, until recently the long-serving premier of the Netherlands. Not long ago, there was a third prime minister reported in the running, Felipe Gonzales of Spain. And when Chancellor Helmut Kohl seemed to be facing certain defeat in the German federal elections, nobody laughed when it was suggested that even he might be a contender for the Brussels job. So fierce has the battle become, that if it isn't finessed through a compromise on one of the lesser candidates, such as Peter Sutherland or even Sir Leon Brittan, it could even deadlock this week's European summit on Corfu. But the paradox of the battle over Delors' successor, is that it seems to be largely based on misplaced expectations. For the one thing we know almost for sure, is that the next president, whoever he is, will be a much less important figure than Delors; not for reasons of personal incapacity, but because the circumstances which favoured Delors have changed or are changing. Indeed, it is possible that no president will ever again play as big a role in the construction of Europe as Delors has played in the past 10 years. First, the volume of European legislation is likely to shrink, and with it the role of the Commission as its motor. The single market white paper and the Single European Act stimulated an unprecedented proliferation of legislative proposals in the run-up to the introduction of the unified market in 1993; but that process is now complete, so the pace of legislation will subside. Second, the anti-European backlash in many member states, and the new stress on subsidiarity enshrined in the Maastricht treaty, should ensure that the Commission will think twice before trying to push forward the frontiers of European integration with gratuitous new initiatives. Third, and the most important factor, is that Europe's agenda is now changing from the technical to the political; as a result the centre of gravity will move from the Commission to the member states. In the 1980s, Delors was brilliantly successful in inventing, and then in riding the bureaucratic processes which led, with apparently inexorable logic, from the white paper to the Single European Act, then to the so-called Delors committee on Economic and Monetary Union, and finally to the Maastricht treaty. But the reason why he was able to dominate this process, was that it could be represented as little more than the implementation of long-established EU goals: the single market was the logical extrapolation of the Rome treaty's customs union, while monetary union had been a declaratory objective of the member states since the early 1970s. All Delors was doing, was putting the power of the Brussels machine behind political objectives of uncontested legitimacy. His successor will not be able to match this bureaucratic tour de force, because the next phase in the development of the European Union, the enlargement to the east, lies in uncharted territory. No one knows exactly how east Europe can be accommodated within the Union; but everybody knows the enlargement process will require far-reaching revisions of Europe's treaty arrangements. These revisions will undoubtedly be bitterly contested by different governments. It is already clear, for example, that the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference will be a fierce battle between supporters and opponents of a more explicitly federalist Europe. In this battle, the Commission has no leadership role. It has a mandate to uphold existing treaty obligations; and perhaps it can fudge a mandate to extend existing treaty obligations; but since it has no independent legitimacy, it has no mandate to invent new political objectives. Those can only be determined by the member states. So when you hear that Britain opposes the appointment of Dehaene, on the grounds that he is a federalist, you know that the British government is once again talking through its collective hat. Not merely will the future shape of Europe not be determined by the preferences of the next president of the commission, he will not even be asked to draft the agenda. What will count, in 1996, will be the line-up of France and Germany. In next spring's presidential election, French conservatives may be tempted to play the nationalist card, though in practice they would almost certainly revert to the traditional pro-European alliance with Germany. But it would be a delicious irony if the next phase in the development of Europe were led by President Delors - of France.</p>

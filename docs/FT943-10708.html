			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: CSA cuts losses to Kcs273m in first six months Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA), which is seeking a strategic partner to replace Air France, posted losses of Kcs273.2m (Dollars 9.75m) in the first six months of this year, writes Vincent Boland in Prague. This is less than half the deficit in the same period last year, when CSA lost Kcs629m. The airline said improved revenues from domestic and international ticket sales and tightly controlled costs, held to 1993 levels, contributed to the better performance. Passenger numbers in-creased and seating capacity rose to 59.2 per cent from 53.6 per cent, with routes to western Europe showing a 10 per cent increase in capacity. CSA is in talks with several international airlines on strategic co-operation.</p>

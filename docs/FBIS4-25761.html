			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 13 (XINHUA) -- China today unveiled a  bio-diversity action plan, to implement the 1992 Rio de Janeiro  biological diversity convention, of which China was a signatory.    The plan was drawn up by the State Environment Protection  Agency (EPA), the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of  Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, other ministries and the  Chinese Academy of Sciences.    It is the first national bio-diversity protection plan aided  by the Global Environment Fund.    Bio-diversity, including animals, plants and  micro-organisms,  refers to ecosystem diversity, species diversity and genetic  diversity.    Xie Zhenhua, director-general of EPA, said that sustainable  development is at the core of China's strategy to conserve  bio-diversity.    The strategy -- a sustainable use of living things and a  guarantee of a healthy cycle for the ecosystem -- is expected to  help create sound material and environmental conditions for a  sustainable development of the national economy and the whole  society.    He said that China would soon take some specific measures to  ensure the fulfilment of the overall bio-diversity protection  plan.    China would first decide which places and species need the  most urgent protection, set up a monitoring system and  information centers on bio-diversity, launch experimental  projects to return artificially-bred species to nature,  introduce a bio-diversity appraisal system, establish special  funds for bio-diversity protection and expand international  cooperation in this sphere.    Song Jian, state councillor and minister of the State  Science  and Technology Commission, noted that currently bio-diversity is  seriously endangered by cutting and burning trees on a large  scale, improperly reclaiming grasslands and wetlands,  over-hunting of wild animals and over-gathering of wild plants,  inappropriate use of pesticides, destructive fishing and  environmental pollution.    "Bio-diversity has become a priority global environmental  issue and the loss of bio-diversity is threatening people's life  and development," he warned.    He said China is one of the dozen "mega-diversity" countries  in the world. It has some 2,340 kinds of land vertebrates, or  10 percent of the world's total, and more than 300,000 species  of flora, which ranks it third in the world.    "In view of these facts, bio-diversity conservation in China  is of great international significance," Song stressed.    The Chinese Government has been consistent in its efforts to  protect the eco-environment while developing its economy and  eliminating poverty, he said.    He added that the newly-launched action plan, a set of  guidelines for bio-diversity conservation throughout China, will  prove to be of great value in getting the whole of society to  conserve the unique, rich and varied bio-diversity of China.    Xie said that the painstaking efforts made by the  departments  involved have begun to yield results. He recalled that China  has since 1956 established more than 760 nature reserves, and  the protected area now amounts to 6.8 percent of the country's  entire territory.    He also said that China now has 110 botanical gardens, over  40 zoos, 26 breeding centers for endangered animals and more  than 230 farms for rare and precious animals.    Today's conference to launch the bio-diversity action plan  for China was attended by more than 400 government officials,  experts, foreign ambassadors to China and representatives from  the U.N. Development Program, the U.N. Environment Program and  the World Bank.</p>

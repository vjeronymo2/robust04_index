			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Europe and World Trade: Germany stagnates as orders fall 12% ORDERS for German engineering products continued to fall in August, reinforcing both machinery makers' fears of a real 5 per cent fall in production this year and more widespread concern over the threat of recession. The value of new contracts for machinery and plant signed during the month was 9 per cent down on the same month last year, the VDMA manufacturers' association said yesterday. A three-month comparison, less prone to distortion by short-term factors, showed new order intake to the end of August down 12 per cent on last year. The same measure at the end of July showed an 11 per cent year-on-year slump. Meanwhile, a survey of 3,000 Mittelstand, or medium-sized, companies concluded that German economic growth would fall 0.5 per cent in the next six months. After stagnating for the past six months, the economy was 'already on a recession-like downtrend,' said Mr Jurgen Kolsch, chairman of the Federal Association of Young Entrepreneurs (BJU). Plant utilisation among members surveyed had fallen from 90 per cent of capacity to 85 per cent within six months and was expected to fall further to 83 per cent in the next six. The machinery and plant industry, which shares top position in the German exporters' league with vehicle makers, is already shedding 80,000 of its 1.15m workforce this year. Meanwhile, Porsche, the luxury sports car maker yesterday announced plans to cut its 8.000 workforce by a further 1,000. See International Company News</p>

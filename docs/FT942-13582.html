			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Hillary Clinton defends her business ethics Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday defended her business ethics and her investment practices in an unusual White House press conference called in an attempt to dispel the continuing questions over her and President Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater Development Corporation. She said she had no knowledge of money passing from Madison Guaranty, a failed Arkansas savings and loan institution, to Whitewater or to Mr Clinton's campaign funds. She defended her successful trading in cattle futures, saying she had been well advised by Mr James Blair, a close friend, and lucky in her decision to pull out of the market when she discovered she was pregnant. 'He and other friends of mine who continued trading ended up losing money.' Mrs Clinton also denied she had received any favourable treatment in her trading, in which she rode a bull market in cattle futures to build an initial Dollars 1,000 investment into nearly Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 68,490). 'There isn't any evidence that anybody gave me any favourable treatment.' Mrs Clinton acknowledged that her earlier reluctance to answer questions about her finances had added to public doubts, and said she now regretted that reluctance. She also denied that her high-rolling investment strategies contradicted her husband's campaign rhetoric about the greed of the 1980s.</p>

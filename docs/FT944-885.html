			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Guinness aims to raise spirits at Christmas: The strategies directed at boosting whisky sales The advertisements for Bell's eight-year-old Scotch whisky, launched this summer to replace the original, five-year-old blend, proclaim: 'It's challenging stuff.' On the face of it, the challenge that Bell's owner Guinness is making to drinkers is to try a smoother, older blend of the UK's biggest-selling brand. But it is also a three-pronged challenge for Guinness itself: to build up the value of the brand by offering a better product at the same price, to convert consumers from the original blend, and to win people over from other spirits. The strategy is designed to stop the downward spiral of sales volume and value in the whisky market. Whisky suffered badly in the recession. From 1988, UK sales volume fell some 25 per cent, with brands suffering even more as drinkers sought economy in own-label whisky. The fastest growing brands continue to be 'the cheapest on display'. The very cheapest retail for about Pounds 7.99 a bottle of which some Pounds 7 goes to the exchequer in tax and excise duties. 'Selling less whisky at lower prices was a very, very dangerous trend for us and the whisky industry,' maintains Mr Anthony Greener, Guinness' chairman. Introducing the improved Bell's was designed to encourage consumers back upmarket. Also, Guinness wanted to hold whisky prices, particularly in the face of strong seasonal pressure. Retailers are demanding good Christmas deals and some competitors are pricing aggressively. Guinness is running a calculated risk. If its prices get out of step with its competitors - notably Famous Grouse from Highland Distilleries and Teacher's from Allied-Domecq, the second and third largest brands - it might lose some of the one-bottle-a-year buyers it needs to convert to the new blend. Under the pressure of Christmas competition, Guinness has had to give more ground than it hoped. As the season opened, a typical supermarket or off-licence price for Grouse was Pounds 11.99 a bottle (less in Scotland), Pounds 11.79 for Bell's and Pounds 11.29 for Teacher's. Guinness considered Bell's 20p discount to Grouse and 50p premium to Teacher's as the traditional positioning of its brand in terms of quality and value. Grouse dropped to Pounds 11.49 and held, Bell's dropped to Pounds 11.29 then to Pounds 10.99, while Teacher's dropped to Pounds 10.99, then Pounds 10.79 plus a 'multibuy' discount of Pounds 3 off a pair of bottles. This has distorted brand differentials and undercut Guinness' pricing strategy. With a tense two days until Christmas and scope for a last-minute cut by one brand which the others might have to follow, Guinness is still not home and dry. November and December account for 25 per cent of annual UK whisky sales and whisky accounts for about half of all spirits sold over the Christmas season. One helpful trend for the three top whisky brands is that their collective market share typically rises by about 5 percentage points at this time of year. Highland is defending Grouse's position as the most expensive mainstream blended whisky. 'It is a premium brand at a premium price,' said Mr Brian Ivory, managing director. 'But that's a relative statement. There are always some discussions with retailers which we hope will be resolved in a satisfactory way.' The group raised marketing expenditure by 15 per cent in the current half year but has shunned multibuys which, said Mr Ivory, 'increase volumes but inevitably erode the price position of the brand'. Guinness launched the new Bell's with a 50 per cent increase in the annual spending on marketing to Pounds 15m. It said it would avoid multibuys but succumbed as the Christmas season got under way - there are limited supplies of paired bottles with Pounds 2 off. It says it is spending to build up the value of the Bell's brand. It is critical of other distillers - notably Allied-Domecq, which increased its marketing budget for Teacher's to Pounds 16m - for spending money on cut-price promotions. Keeping Christmas strategies intact is hard when retailers start turning the screws. Kwik Save, for example, has knocked the price of Grouse down to match Bell's at Pounds 10.95. Where a retailer breaks ranks, the cut probably comes out of the distiller's margins rather than the retailer's. But for all the price anguish, this Christmas looks a good one in volume terms. Building on a gentle turnround that began a year ago, distillers could end 1994 with volume growth of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent, its first upturn in five years. Better still, exports are up 5 per cent. The new Bell's 'has stimulated the whole market', said Mr Richard Maude-Roxby, trading director of Booker Belmont Wholesale, the UK's largest independent drinks distributor. The new year brings a new challenge for Guninness - to push prices back to pre-Christmas levels and add 26p from the chancellor's mini-Budget. This would mean a 10 per cent price rise from Bell's Christmas low.</p>

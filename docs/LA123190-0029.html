			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON WOMEN'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> GOLDEN WEST EDGES SEQUOIAS WITHOUT SIRCHIA  </P> <P> Golden West College, playing without its top player, won the Fullerton women's  basketball tournament Sunday because of some horrible work at the free-throw  line by College of the Sequoias.  </P> <P> The Rustlers came away with a 71-68 victory, and Sequoias got a four-hour bus  ride home to Visalia to ponder a game in which the Lady Giants made only six of  29 free throws.  </P> <P> Golden West (18-1) had its own handicap with Bits Sirchia, an all-state guard  last season, sidelined with a twisted right ankle.  </P> <P> But Tracy Wolfe, Allison Bickel and Jennifer Harney made the key plays in the  final minute to secure the victory. Wolfe stole a pass with 46 seconds  remaining and made a layup with 30 seconds left to give Golden West a 69-68  lead.  </P> <P> Sequoias' Shaulonda Rittenhouse then missed a shot with 12 seconds to play. A  scramble involving several players followed, then Golden West gained possession  after a jump ball was called with 10 seconds left.  </P> <P> But the Rustlers turned the ball over when they failed to get it inbounds in  the allowed five seconds. Sequoias (15-4) then inbounded the ball to Lataria  Andrews, who was fouled while shooting with eight seconds left.  </P> <P> Andrews missed both free throws, and Harney got the rebound and was fouled with  five seconds left. She missed her free throw, but Bickel got the rebound and  made the layup for Golden West with two seconds left.  </P> <P> Sequoias failed to get the ball to half-court before time ran out. Harney, the  tournament's most valuable player, led Golden West with 24 points, 20 in the  second half. Bickel added 13.  </P> <P> In the third-place game:  </P> <P> Fullerton 80, Los Angles Valley 57 -- Hollie Keeton scored 17 points, 13 in the  second half for Fullerton (14-3). Nicki Durity added 16 and Vicki Evans and  Keri Erkenbrack each had 13 for Fullerton, which led at the half, 41-33.  </P></p>

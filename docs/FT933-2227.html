			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Corporate bonds The year since sterling left the ERM has seen a remarkable transformation of the UK corporate bond market. As long rates have fallen, spreads over gilts have narrowed sharply - by about 70 basis points to around 100 on 15-year unsecured issues, according to BZW. Such tight spreads raise doubts about whether corporate bonds can continue to outperform, especially if worries about inflation stop gilt yields falling. In theory, supply should then increase as companies hurry to issue debt before absolute yields rise; demand would diminish as higher gilt yields reduce the need for investors to trade risk for extra return. Real life looks more complicated. The credit standing of some borrowers has undergone a sea change. This applies not only in the property sector but also to companies such as British Aerospace whose bonds due 2014 trade at a spread less than half last autumn's 310 point peak. Such exceptional outperformance makes BAe's paper vulnerable to correction. More generally, though, the shape of the yield curve seems likely to be decisive. While it remains steeply positive, retail investors will continue shopping for higher returns. They may only look closely at the risks of buying subordinated bank and building society paper when base rates rise again. An upward sloping yield curve is equally a deterrent to borrowers. Recent issuance has concentrated on maturities of up to ten years where interest rate swaps are available. At the long end, supply is short. Corporate borrowers incur a cost by borrowing long when the proceeds can only be invested at lower rates in the money market. Rightly or wrongly, that is making treasurers dither.</p>

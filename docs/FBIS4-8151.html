			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross </F> by correspondent Pal Lakatos on the "Sunday Newspaper" program  -- live]    [Excerpts] I welcome our studio guest, Prime Minister Peter  Boross. Pal Lakatos, duty editor of "Sunday Newspaper," will be  putting both the listeners' and his own questions to the prime  minister.    [Lakatos] [passage omitted] The collection of nomination  slips for next month's elections closed on 8 April. According  to the statistical data, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]  can put up candidates in 166 places, the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] in 172, the Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP] in  176, and the Workers' Party in 146. [passage omitted] On the  basis of the figures, should one not, or do you not, fear the  possibility of a shift to the left? [passage omitted]    [Boross] On the basis of the figures I do not fear this.  Otherwise, a tendency towards a shift to the left is something  that everyone can sense. As for its proportion, that is  something that only the elections will decide, and I hope that  it will not be of a greater proportion than desired. These  figures by themselves do not say anything. The nomination slip  collections in more than one case were a show put on by campaign  groups that tend to do this, rather than an expression of the  personal qualities of the candidates. [passage omitted]    [Lakatos] It is interesting to note that during the past few  days on the part of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] there  have been more and more appeals to the Christian Democratic  People's Party [KDNP]. It is generally known that you too would  join a coalition with the KDNP if the chance presented itself.  What is your opinion on this?    [Boross] My opinion about this is that our cooperation with  the KDNP is a natural one deriving from shared political  orientations on the basis of shared principles and ideas.  Whereas other parties -- the abovementioned one as well, I  think -- would have to struggle with this difference in concept  which separates them from the Christian Democrats. My  impression is that the KDNP will not fall for various siren  voices which are speaking in its direction, because it is aware  that from the point of view of the party's future, it is  extremely risky to conclude a political alliance contrary to the  demands of the membership and the masses that support it.    [Lakatos] Pardon the expression, but this is what people  say,  this is how they put it: Prime Minister Peter Boross is engaged  in undermining work [aknamunkat vegez] to divide the party of  the SZDSZ. At the same time they also say that he would like to  lure the Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] to the MDF.    [Boross] It is no accident that they use this word --  undermining. It is true that it takes place under ground and in  secret and not in full view or within earshot of others.  [passage omitted] My conviction is that in the SZDSZ there are  two parties and two trends. I must add that the SZDSZ is the  one that did not in any way split in the course of the trials of  the previous four years. On the whole this sort of thing did  happen to the parties, and in certain cases it ended sadly, as  in the case of the smallholders. In others it could even be  called a purification process. This split did not happen with  the Free Democrats. However, this dual trend is perceivable in  the SZDSZ.    Now, in the case of Fidesz there is nothing: Our stance has  not changed in any way. It is simply that Fidesz's national  conference or congress, or I don't know know what they call it  exactly, in Debrecen, proclaimed a national liberal profile.  And naturally this aroused the attention of a  national-orientated party, such as the MDF. But if this looks  like some kind of allurement, then I have to say that this is  not a well-meaning interpretation. We are looking for the  motifs in every party that could become the basis for future  cooperation in the country's interest. Accepting the national  trend is one very serious element of this, and it can be found  without doubt in the case of Fidesz. However, this means  nothing with regard to the future. At present we are rival  parties in this election struggle and each represents his own  principles and programs, which, in more than one case, clash.    [Lakatos] Let us leave party politics proper for a moment  and let us remember the date, today's date to be precise, 10  April 1994, when throughout the world people remember the  600,000 Hungarian Jews who perished in the Holocaust. Is this  an occasion for the world to bow its head?    [Boross] It is an occasion for the world to bow its head; it  is an occasion for every right-thinking person to bow his or her  head; it is particularly an occasion for every right-thinking  Hungarian to bow his or her head. On 19 March 1944 the country  was caught up by the tragedy, the tragedy of the Nazi  occupation. And what happened after that is the darkest point  in Hungarian history, when old people, women, children  indiscriminately were transported to their deaths. And these  kinds of trains set off from this country. I think that the  memory of this terror must shake everybody. [passage omitted]    [Lakatos] Our late prime minister, Jozsef Antall, whose  birthday, 62d birthday, would have been on 8 April, declared  himself to be the prime minister -- in spirit -- of 15 million  Hungarians. A listener from Nove Zamky [in Slovakia] asks: Do  you think in exactly the same way?    [Boross] I have already spoken about this; yes, I do think  in  exactly the same way. And on this occasion as well I would  stress with great emphasis the oft-misquoted phrase of Jozsef  Antall's -- in spirit -- lest it arouse excitement among those  who would infer from this some kind of intention to change the  borders, let alone to change the borders by force. Throughout  the world there are 15 million Hungarians: four million here [in  the neighboring countries], beyond the borders, and one million  in the wide world who call themselves Hungarian. This has been  their fate in the 20th century. And a Hungarian prime minister  at all events must pay heed to these 15 million as well; and I  think he has every moral basis for feeling himself to be the  representative -- in spirit -- of 15 million Hungarians.    [Lakatos] Istvan Gangesz from Budapest, telephone number  1320- 428, asks in connection with this: If you consider  yourself the prime minister -- in spirit -- of 15 million  Hungarians, then why did you permit 10,000 foreigners to  privatize Hungarian industry?    [Boross] I don't know who counted these 10,000, or where  this  figure comes from; I have no personal knowledge of this. I will  give a very much simplified answer: In 1938 about 30 percent of  Hungarian industry was in foreign ownership; at present this  figure is around 10 percent, but it is not even as much as that.  [passage omitted] A significant part of what has passed into  foreign ownership in our country represents developed, modern,  up-to-date technology; it means production in our country, wages  paid in our country, and in every way it is a blessing to the  country. [passage omitted] In any case, if this foreign capital  were not to appear in Hungary, then the oft-repeated  modernization, the problems caused by the oft-repeated shortage  of capital, would never be resolved. I can reassure everybody:  We take great care that this foreign investment should not go  beyond the limits beyond which a country's self-determination,  or its sovereignty, might become doubtful. Those who know us  will know that we take extraordinary care about this and this is  a real priority with us.    [Lakatos] Prime Minister, are you not afraid, after these  remarks, that the accusation of the recent past will be revived,  namely that you are conducting success propaganda?    [Boross] [passage omitted] These four years have been full  of  a lot of bitterness and a lot of counter-propaganda. There have  been results, and the Hungarian economy -- but not just the  economy, other sectors as well -- has started on an irreversible  road. I know that this is not yet making itself felt directly  in the households, but it carries within it the promise of the  future.    [Lakatos] Allow me to quote the words of Gyula Horn, HSP  [Hungarian Socialist Party] chairman. Gyula Horn's message to  the voters a few days ago was: Dismiss this MDF-led government  which gives the people, the nation, as its authority, but which  in the meantime, dispossesses [kisemmiz] the majority.    [Boross] Well, one could quote numerous other things from  Gyula Horn's ex-cathedra sentences. [passage omitted] This far I  can understand it, because Gyula Horn wishes to have a socialist  government; after all this is the essence of the election  struggle now. Only, this socialist government has already  existed once; at least, in the two years prior to 1990 it called  itself a socialist reform government. Anyone who has a good  memory will remember what it achieved with this reform. My  conviction is that it would be very bad for the country if it  listened to Gyula Horn. [passage omitted]    [Lakatos] Agnes Csongradi from Budapest, or possibly not  Budapest -- the telephone number is 133-203 -- remarks or asks:  Will you be leaving the velvet seat with a clear conscience  after having sold off the country? And she hopes that the new  government will be much better than the present one.    [Lakatos] [passage omitted] Will you be leaving the velvet  seat with a clear conscience? We don't want to, and I  personally do not want to leave this velvet seat, I who have  held the post of prime minister for six months, not even for six  months. But let me put it [the velvet chair] into quotation  marks. This much-vaunted velvet seat is full of quite  unpleasant fakir's nails. [passage omitted]    [Lakatos] [passage omitted] If we have a look at the  popularity ratings and if I remember well, you received a rating  of around 20 percent, while the MDF received around 10 percent.  These two data suggest that you may be the most popular  candidate for prime minister, but if your party does not win the  elections, then you are not going to be a prime minister.    [Boross] The listeners should know that I can only be the  prime minister of the country if they cast their vote for the  MDF. [passage omitted] I aspire to be the prime minister of the  country for four years so that I can put my ideas into practice  in the country's economy and other fields.    [Lakatos] Several opposition politicians say if they enter  government they will complete the compensation process; however,  they cannot give any compensation for the past four years.    [Boross] Well, this is the usual irony. [passage omitted]  But  as far as compensation is concerned, I think that there can be  many types of privatization, but privatization as a means of  compensation has its own moral underpinning.    [Lakatos] It would be worth talking about what the country  was like in 1990 when this coalition entered government and what  it is like today. Just a few important facts need to be  mentioned.    [Boross] [passage omitted] This country was on the brink of  insolvency. It has already been said several times that the  foreign currency reserves today are nearly 10 times what the  previous government had at its disposal.    [Lakatos] Then it was 800 million dollars and now it is  nearly 7 billion dollars.    [Boross] Yes, around 7 billion, but this number is moving.  [passage omitted] I refute allegations that the country is in a  worse condition now -- especially now, when there is no writer  on economic topics or economist who would deny that industrial  production grew by 10 percent at the beginning of this year.  [passage omitted]    [Lakatos] However, many say that to implement the tasks more  quickly, debt rescheduling would be necessary. [passage omitted]    [Boross] [passage omitted] We have already transformed the  country's short-term debts into medium and long-term debts to  make these years easier. It was only possible because we give  the impression of being a stable country with our financial  reserves and internal relations. [passage omitted] If somebody  has reserves like Hungary has and submits a request for  rescheduling over an even longer period, then on the one hand it  will be turned down, and on the other hand it will give a very  bad impression on the international market, where every tiny  movement is closely monitored. They would arrive at the  conclusion that the country is insolvent. [passage omitted]</p>

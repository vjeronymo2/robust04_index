As soon as a compromise is reached, the Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry will start negotiations with the  U.S. to avert possible U.S. trade sanctions, the sources said.    The U.S. has said it will retaliate against Japan if Japan  fails to open the cellular phone market to the products of  Motorola Inc.    Japanese cellular phone company Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp.  (IDO) has indicated readiness to make further concessions on  Motorola's demand for more purchases of its systems and  equipment.    Motorola has said it will urge the U.S. Government not to  impose sanctions if it reaches a settlement with IDO, according  to the sources.    IDO in January came up with a plan for installation of more  Motorola-type cellular phone stations, but that failed to  satisfy the U.S.    Under that plan, 134 such stations were to have been  established by March 1997.    But Motorola asked, among other things, that IDO implement  the plan two years earlier.    IDO and Motorola are continuing negotiations on the plan,  the  sources said.</p>

Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion of  reunification.    The statement scathingly denounces the traitor Kim  Yong-sam's  fascist step as an intolerable insult to the patriotic spirit of  Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a grave infringement on the compatriotic  feelings of the entire youth and students and people in the  North and a total denial of ethics and morality.    The statement says:    "It is outrageous of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique to talk  about `organisation benefiting the enemy' and `nuclear issue'  for justifying their act this time.    "Denying the National Alliance for the Country's  Reunification (Pomminnyon) means denying great unity of the  nation, and the latter means denying national reunification.    "The entire youth and students in the northern half of the  country will become flames burning injustice and immorality and  standard-bearers of great national unity, punish the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique seeking a way out in dependence on  outside forces and North-South confrontation and achieve  national reunification which was the lifelong wish of Rev. Mun  Ik-hwan, a patriotic martyr for reunification, rallied around  Pomchonghaknyon, the vanguard of Pomminnyon."</p>

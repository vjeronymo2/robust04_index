			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: CBS forms joint ventures with Westinghouse CBS, the US television network, signed up three additional stations owned by Westinghouse Electric as affiliates, in the process repairing some of the damage done by the defection of eight other affiliates to Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox network in May. Westinghouse and CBS also announced they would seek to extend their ownership of broadcast television stations through a new joint company, to be majority owned and managed by Group W, Westinghouse's broadcasting company. In addition, the two companies announced joint ventures in programming and advertising sales. For CBS, the deal brings VHF stations in three important US markets: Philadelphia, the fourth-ranked market in the country, Boston (6th) and Baltimore (22nd). CBS already owns a Philadelphia station, which will be sold. Two of the stations are switching from NBC, with the third from ABC. The deal has been under discussion for two months, the two companies said. In recent days, CBS has dropped a proposed merger with home shopping group QVC, which would have taken it into cable television, raising questions about the future of its earlier strategy of relying on broadcast stations. For Westinghouse, the joint ventures with CBS will provide extra resources to expand Group W's operations. Mr Michael Jordan, the group's recently appointed chief executive, has resisted selling the unit as part of an overhaul of the troubled manufacturing group. As part of yesterday's deal, Group W and CBS will form a joint programming unit, to provide material to their own stations and others. The partnership will not take effect until November 1995, when existing regulations end. Group W will also own the majority stake in a new company formed by merging the two group's advertising sales operations. Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive of CBS, said the deal 'further demonstrates our commitment to the network/affiliate system and our firm belief in the future of broadcasting.'</p>

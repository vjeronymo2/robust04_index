			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also wishes to make clear, however, that if videotaped or electronic training is offered, the provider must be able to verify that the video has been viewed or the training completed by the registrant before the provider issues a certificate of attendance to the registrant. Accordingly, if a provider will conduct training via videotape or electronic presentation, either exclusively or in addition to in-person training, the Commission is proposing that the provider's certification referred to above be supplemented to include a representation that the provider will maintain documentation reasonably designed to verify that registrants have properly completed ethics training for the minimum time required (one, two or four hours).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission envisages that an appropriate verification regime for a provider would include procedures such as the following. The provider would maintain a list of the computer-based ethics program purchasers and match each completed program with a record of purchase. Registrants would be required to enter identifying information, such as name, firm's name, business address, telephone number, date of birth, NFA and/or Social Security number, on the control diskette and return a signed statement with the completed computer diskette certifying that he did in fact complete the ethics training course in the manner set out in the instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the fulfillment of the minimum time requirements and verification of the registrants' participation in the program, the ethics training provider could use a computer-based test to assure that the registrant has attained a minimum level of understanding of the materials covered, drawing upon matters covered in video and written materials, as well as the computer program, to the extent applicable. Registrants would be required to pass each section of the test prior to answering questions in later sections of the test to assure that each section of the program is completed. While those who fail the test would be required to retake it until it is successfully completed, only the time spent on the first test could be credited toward the ethics training time required by Rule 3.34. Registrants answering quickly would be given additional questions to answer, and the program would cease recording elapsed time for those slow to answer questions. Thus, registrants would be monitored both as to time spent and material covered. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If an ethics training provider develops a computer-based ethics training program for use by a particular registered firm and its APs that in addition to the required subject matter also includes material tailored to that firm, such as the firm's specific professional conduct policies, the ethics training provider could verify completion by the APs by relying on the registered firm's representation as to its APs' attendance if the firm can verify the identity of participants through the firm's in-house computer communication system or through monitoring by the firm's supervisory or managerial staff. The ethics training provider should require registered firms using a tailored ethics training program to furnish periodic reports of specified identifying information for each AP accessing the training program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a provider wished to follow a different verification regime, he could do so if such steps had been submitted to and not found objectionable by a registered futures association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / C&amp;J Clark compromise planned DIRECTORS at C&amp;J Clark were last night working on a compromise agreement to end the two-month-long row at Britain's largest shoe manufacturer. The compromise could come in time to avert the extraordinary general meeting called by four board members to unseat Clark chairman Mr Walter Dickson. A 10-point proposal was put forward by the rebel directors yesterday afternoon which would leave Mr Dickson and non-executive director Mr James Power in position. If agreement is reached, the EGM is likely - at the very least - to be postponed until the annual meeting in April. Solicitors and directors were working to reach a compromise by this evening  -the latest the company could warn its 4,000 shareholders around the UK that the EGM had been cancelled. The compromise proposed by the requisitionists - so named for calling the EGM - made postponement of the meeting conditional on several points. These are believed to include the formation of an independent bid committee, chaired by an executive other than Mr Dickson, to review any future offer for Clark. The condition was made in light of the talks over a possible bid by management consultant Mr Colin Fisher backed by Electra Investment Trust, who said Mr Dickson and Mr Power would remain if a bid succeeded. The requisitionists are also believed to have set out conditions for the conduct of any future dispute between directors of the company. The row has thrown Clark, based in Street, Somerset, and controlled by an extended Quaker family, into the glare of publicity. Both sides have hired advisers for the dispute, incurring heavy costs in a company with falling profits. In August, the chairman warned that pre-tax profits would be lower than last year's Pounds 20.4m and the interim dividend was cut from 3.5p to 1.75p. The proposals are also believed to include a suggestion to devolve power within the board. One of the areas of friction has been the increasing influence of non-family members on the board. Mr Dickson is only the second non-family member to chair the 167-year-old firm.</p>

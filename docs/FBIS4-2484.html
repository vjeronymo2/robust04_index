			<p>BFN     [Text] Guiyang, April 8 (XINHUA) -- China is making  efforts in building hydro-power stations along the Wujiang  River, a major tributary of the Chang Jiang River, in south-west  China's Guizhou Province.    The state has just approved construction of the Hongjiadu  Hydro-Power Station with a generating capacity of 540,000 kw.    Experts calculate that the Wujiang River's abundant  hydro-power resources have a total potential capacity of 8.56  million kw for development.    At present a 630,000-kw hydro-power station is in operation,  another 510,000-kw plant will be completed within the year, and  in the long run, a Wujiang hydropower energy base with a total  generating capacity of 6.39 million kw will be built up in the  coming 25 years.    The Wujiang River Valley is rich also in natural resources  of  coal, aluminium, sulphur, manganese and mercury. The bauxite  reserve amounts to 270 million tons, ranking third in China; and  its phosphate ore reserve comes to 2.58 billion tons, ranking  second in the country.    In order to accelerate development of hydro-power resources,  the central government and Guizhou Province have also  incorporated the Wujiang Hydropower Development Corporation of  Guizhou, which will be in charge of construction and operation  of nine power stations along the Wujiang River.</p>

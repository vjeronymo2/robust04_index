			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Ukraine in bitter attack on Moscow THE SHARPENING tension between Russia and Ukraine burst into the open last night at the end of a meeting in Kiev of the leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, the summit's host, was openly and bitterly caustic towards Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, before hundreds of journalists at a final press conference. Declaring none of the 23 agreements signed had any real importance and Ukraine had signed only one minor technical document among the military treaties, Mr Kravchuk said while he held the Russian people in high esteem, 'I forbear from commenting on Russian leaders.' Accusing Mr Yeltsin of being ironic in speaking earlier of a 'constructive attitude' at the summit, Mr Kravchuk matched his irony by saying Russia's attitude had pleased him, 'because I now understand we will never agree to a division of the assets of the former Soviet Union.' At the summit Mr Yeltsin brusquely dismissed Ukraine's proposal to discuss splitting up all former Soviet property, including foreign embassies and reserves of the former Soviet state bank, Gosbank. In contrast to bland statements by Mr Yeltsin and other presidents that the CIS was essential and vigorously alive, Mr Kravchuk said: 'If the situation does not improve, the commonwealth is doomed.' Later, senior Ukrainian officials said they believed the next scheduled CIS session in Tashkent would be its last. Mr Kravchuk as good as called his Russian counterpart a liar. He said he had not phoned Mr Yeltsin earlier this week to promise to return tactical nuclear missiles, as the Russian leader claimed - and, turning to Mr Yeltsin on the podium at the press conference, he said: 'Boris Nikolaevich (Yeltsin) can confirm that.' Mr Yeltsin made no response. Earlier, Mr Kravchuk confirmed that Ukraine had ceased to send tactical nuclear missiles to Russia. No more would be sent until guarantees had been given that they would be destroyed under international supervision. Western military and diplomatic observers at the meeting said Mr Kravchuk's call for international supervision might strike a sympathetic chord in the west, which is concerned about proliferation of nuclear states. Ominously, the Ukrainian president said Russia could not be blamed for acting according to its own interests - and 'we must learn to do the same, we must act in the interests of our people and will not be swayed from this.' The one positive agreement appeared to be a resolution to create a CIS peacekeeping force for use in national and ethnic conflicts, as in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Trans Dnestr region of Moldova. Mr Seitkazy Mataev, spokesman for President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhastan, said that after an hour of 'heated discussions' the presidents had agreed to create a force that would intervene once there was a ceasefire and on the invitation of at least one side. But the force would have no military role. Ukraine and Russia now seem set for a further dangerous escalation of tension, with none of the outstanding disagreements between them - over splitting up property, maintenance of borders and division of the Black Sea Fleet - even discussed, let alone settled. About 33,000 St Petersburg students and a large number of pensioners will each get Rbs150 out of funds from the sale of EC food delivered to the city, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The European Commission said about Ecu80m (Pounds 57m) of nearly Ecu200m of food aid to St Petersburg and Moscow had been delivered.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Cost of legal services falling LEGAL bills are coming down, but even the cheaper City lawyers still charge as much as Pounds 200 an hour, according to The Legal 500, the annual guide to law firms published today. Commercial clients are shopping around - often going outside London - and competition has brought charges to between Pounds 100 and Pounds 200 an hour, compared with the Pounds 200 to Pounds 400 or more that had become standard in the City. Clients have also benefited from changes in the procedure for investigating complaints, according to the annual report of the Solicitors Complaints Bureau, published today.</p>

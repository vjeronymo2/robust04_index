			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Bombay, March 2--Panun Kashmir, an organization of  refugee Kashmiri Hindus, has criticized India's defence of the  Kashmir issue at international forums, saying it was from "a  very low level of moral credibility" as the country has been  continuously changing its perception and projection of the  problem. Demanding that India cut off diplomatic relations with  Pakistan, the organization suggested that the Union Home  Ministry entertain human rights bodies other than Amnesty  International and Asia Watch which, they claim, are biased.    Following their return from the UN Human Rights Conference  in  Geneva, leaders of the organization addressed a press conference  here today. The spokesman, Mr. Ajay Chungroo, claimed there was  evidence to suggest that Pakistan and the ISI [Inter-Service  Intelligence of Pakistan] were involved in terrorist activities  in this country. Even the Home Ministry, he claimed, had  admitted as much.    Mr. Chungroo had presented a paper--on behalf of the Indian  Institute for Non-Aligned Studies--on the minority and refugee  status of Kashmiri Hindus at the conference, the first time the  issue had been discussed at this level.    Another member of the delegation, Mr. Moti Kaul, said the  overall impression was that most delegates were ignorant of the  real issues in Kashmir and he blamed the Indian Government for  this. He claimed that Panun Kashmir was doing the job of the  Government but added, "We are not stooges."    Mr. Kaul claimed that Pandits were victims of the  Government's policy on Kashmir. "Even today, between 250,000 and  300,000 Kashmiri Pandits forced to flee the State are living in  sub-human conditions, refugees in their own homeland. And we  thought it was time the international community was made aware  of this," Mr. Kaul said.    While stating that they did not want to be "hostages of  Indian secularism in Kashmir," Mr. Chungroo said that the  fundamentalist-terrorist problem was spreading to Jammu. He  criticized the Prime Minister for not visiting any of the  refugee camps, not even those in New Delhi. "We are asking for  our own territory, yes, but in such a way that we have greater  integration with the country. We went to Geneva because we have  India's interests at heart."    The members felt that India should not wait for the United  States to declare Pakistan a terrorist state. The United States,  they said, had its own agenda and sought "more direct  involvement in the territorial problem for its own reasons."  Criticizing the Government's inconsistent stand on Pakistan, Mr.  Chungroo said: "It just can't go on. Instead of waiting for the  United States we must demonstrate our firmness and cut off  diplomatic ties."    Both Mr. Chungroo and Mr. Kaul were critical of the  "excessive importance given by India to the Amnesty  International and Asia Watch reports on human rights abuses.  They questioned the reports that the abuses began in 1989 and  pointed out that these organizations admitted that the scope of  their investigations was limited.    Amnesty, they said, had stated that it examined human rights  violations by the state, but they wondered who examined those  committed by terrorists. "When we asked why they did not visit  the refugee camps in Delhi even after they were provided the  addresses last year, they said `No time,'" Mr. Chungroo said.    The organization expressed disappointment that the  resolution  adopted by Parliament recently did not mention the refugee  problem of Kashmiri Pandits and blamed all political parties for  their perception of and approach to the problem. "Even the BJP  because it is unable to go beyond the Article 370 issue," Mr.  Chungroo said. They were confident, however, that the Centre's  attempts to encourage Dr Farooq Abdullah's participation would  backfire as "he is one of those who advocates autonomy" for  Kashmir.  *</p>

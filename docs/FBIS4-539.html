			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Senegalese President Abdou  Diouf has asked France to help Senegal repatriate the Senegalese  troops of the UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda. The Belgian  prime minister says Belgian troops must come home as soon as  possible. One needs to know, therefore, if France will be the  only country to keep its troops in Rwanda. The French defence  minister said recently that even if they remained in the country  they would not fight. No one can understand why they should  remain. It is worth recalling that the Rwanda Patriotic Front  spokesman in Kampala recently said that if the French troops got  in the way of the RPF they would certainly be fired at. They  bleed just like anyone else. [passage omitted]</p>

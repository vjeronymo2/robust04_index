			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Arts: An ultra-violet 'Peter Pan' - Theatre Some people may like Peter Pan at Sadler's Wells, though it should come with a warning. This is not Peter Pan with dialogue, wit, symbolism and a story that many of us admire. Nor is this the old Sadler's Wells that many of us remember with affection. Scarcely a monument to a better yesterday remains, save that the place is still in Rosebery Avenue. This is regimented, educational theatre backed by the London Arts Board with the help of Czechoslovakia. Not the new republics of the 1990s, but the Czechoslovakia before the Berlin Wall came down and when it made sense to do things in mime because there was no guaranteed freedom of expression. The Black Light Theatre of Prague's production is interesting, if you have not seen the techniques before, for a few minutes because it has some clever staging and visual effects. The coffee cups float up and down, brightness falls from the air, the lighting is ultra-violet. It does not take long for such effects to wear thin. If you can float one object, you can float another, and another, and make a crocodile crawl across the floor in lights. Twice is enough. The Prague production makes the nearly always fatal mistake of seeking to combine too many art forms in one: dance, music, visual show-off while trying to tell a story. The dance is sometimes pretty. The music is varied, but always banal - never fast enough to have zip, never slow enough to have feeling: real old communist central Europe. The story is lost. The real Peter Pan has some very good lines and intriguing psychology. It ends with Mr Darling retreating into the kennel to which he had banished the dog on the night the Darlings went out to dinner. In the Black Light version this is omitted. If you go to see, be sure to buy a copy of the programme, read it and keep it. In terms of pretentiousness, it is a collector's item. Sadler's Wells Theatre until January 8. (071) 434 0909</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this limitation is to encourage the use of water-based or other low toxicity drilling fluids and additives. This toxicity criterion became BAT when the final effluent guidelines were signed January 15, 1993 (58 FR 12469, March 4, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The toxicity limit is an end-of-pipe discharge limit; and represents a different approach to controlling this wastestream than has been applied in previous general permits issued by Region 10. When the Region issued its first general permits under the proposed guidelines, it developed a case-by-case approach to limiting the toxicity of discharged mud/additive systems as BPJ determination of BAT until guidelines could be promulgated. Region 10 used the 30,000 ppm SPP value as a criterion in evaluating available bioassay data for the proposed discharges. The process of evaluating each mud/additive system with respect to the discharge toxicity constituted BPJ determination of BAT. Since the guidelines have now been promulgated with a toxicity limitation for drilling muds and cuttings, Region 10 will be discontinuing the mud preapproval process in favor of the end-of-pipe limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance with the drilling mud toxicity limit will be determined by using the Drilling Fluids Toxicity Test (see appendix 2 to subpart A of part 435, 58 FR 12507, March 4, 1993). At a minimum, monitoring is to be done on a monthly basis for each well. When the end-of-well is reached, a final bioassay analysis will be required (see Part II.A.1.k. of permit). The last monthly bioassay may constitute the end-of-well bioassay. If a mineral oil pill is required (Part II.A.1.g. of permit), the mud shall be sampled for bioassay prior to application of the pill <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> after removal of the pill. Complete bioassay reports are required as part of the regulatory record for each well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diesel oil:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The discharge of drilling muds and cuttings which have been contaminated by diesel oil is prohibited by the Agency, in accordance with the offshore oil and gas effluent guidelines (58 FR 12469, March 4, 1993). The prohibition on the discharge of diesel oil has been part of all of the general NPDES permits issued by Region 10 for the Offshore and Coastal Subcategories. Diesel oil, which is sometimes added to a water-based mud system, is a complex mixture of petroleum hydrocarbons, known to be highly toxic to marine organisms and to contain numerous toxic and nonconventional pollutants. The pollutant ``diesel oil'' is being used as an ``indicator'' of the listed toxic pollutants present in diesel oil which are controlled through compliance with the effluent limitation (i.e., no discharge). The technology basis for this limitation is product substitution of less toxic mineral oil for diesel oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mercury and Cadmium in Barite:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the offshore oil and gas effluent guidelines (58 FR 12469, March 4, 1993), the proposed permit contains limitations of 1 mg/kg mercury and 3 mg/kg cadmium in barite. Barite is a major constituent of drilling muds. These restrictions on drilling fluid influent are designed to limit the discharge of mercury, cadmium, and other potentially toxic metals in the drilling fluid effluent, since these metals can occur as contaminants in some sources of barite. The justification for the limitation under BAT is product substitution or transportation and disposal of the waste onshore. That is, operators can substitute ``clean'' barite, which meets the above limitations, for contaminated barite, which does not meet the limitations. Numerous offshore exploratory wells and the production wells drilled under permits previously issued by Region 10 have been drilled subject to this requirement. Chemical analyses have shown that the barite used has not exceeded the limitations. Further discussion on the mercury and cadmium limits in barite is presented in the offshore oil and gas guidelines (58 FR 12479&hyph;80, March 4, 1993) and in the development document (U.S. EPA, 1993a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has eliminated a waiver provision for the barite limits which was in the previous permits. The waiver stipulated that if a permittee was unable to comply with the barite limitations due to the lack of availability of barite which meets the limitation, then the permittee could request a case-by-case waiver allowing the discharge of barite which exceeded the limits (53 FR 37858, September 28, 1988). As a part of the effluent guidelines development, EPA investigated the availability of domestic and foreign supplies of barite to meet the cadmium and mercury limits. The Agency also considered the potential for the increased demand for clean barite stocks resulting from this rule to cause a rise in the cost of barite. (See the Development Document (U.S. EPA, 1993a) and the Economic Impact Analysis (U.S. EPA, 1993d) for detailed discussion on the availability and economic availability.) EPA concluded that ``there are sufficient supplies of barite capable of meeting the limits of this rule to meet the needs of offshore drilling operations (58 FR 12480, March 4, 1993). Hence, the waiver provision has not been included in this proposed general permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

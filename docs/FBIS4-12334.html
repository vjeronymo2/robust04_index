			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 Apr (MENA)--The PLO has announced that the  'Affula incident yesterday confirms the urgent need to achieve  tangible progress to implement the interim agreement and to  undertake practical measures to prove the seriousness of the  peace process.    In a statement by an official Palestinian spokesman in Cairo  today, the PLO expressed its grief over the incident, which left  several Israeli civilians dead.    The organization noted that the series of actions that began  with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron and subsequent  massacres, most notably that in the Jabalyah refugee camp in the  Gaza Strip, where Israeli military forces have killed PLO  cadres, confirms the urgent need to establish peace.    The spokesman said the PLO extends its condolences to the  families of the civilian victims and hopes that all the parties  concerned will assume their responsibility of safeguarding the  peace process and achieving its goals to ensure a just and  balanced solution guaranteeing genuine coexistence between the  Palestinian and Israeli peoples.</p>

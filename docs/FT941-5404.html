			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Business Travel: Track through the traffic - How to get around and do deals in Bangkok In any other city, the sight of a sweating businessman in a pinstriped suit perched on the pillion seat of a small, noisy motorcycle, clutching his briefcase and mobile telephone while the driver weaves between lines of cars and buses, might be considered unusual. Not so in Bangkok, where the notorious traffic congestion has made the lethal motorcycle taxi a routine form of commuter transport for secretaries, government officials and foreigners alike. Traffic jams inevitably feature in any assessment of the problems confronting visitors to the Thai capital, but it is worth putting Bangkok's bad reputation in perspective. For a start, it is a big city, comparable in size with London, and is home to several times the population of Kuala Lumpur or Singapore. Nor is it the only Asian metropolis with traffic problems: Manila, Jakarta and even Kuala Lumpur are also suffering from the surge in car ownership that accompanies economic growth. Occasional floods in the June-October rainy season can cause city-wide gridlocks lasting several hours, but few journeys within Bangkok during the daytime should take more than an hour. Here are some tips on how to beat the traffic: Be flexible about your means of transport. A taxi is often the best solution, but it might be quicker to get out and walk 200 yards than to wait for the taxi to crawl round a one-way street system for half an hour to drop you at the door. Occasionally, you will find it quicker to go between two points by river taxi or canal boat, but make sure you know where you are going, because few of the operators speak English. My own view is that motorcycle taxis should be a last resort when you are late for an appointment with the prime minister. Otherwise, they are for the brave and those who do not mind being asphyxiated by exhaust fumes. For foreigners, the three-wheel tuk-tuk is usually as expensive as a taxi, and much less comfortable. There is no metropolitan railway system. From the airport to town, most international business travellers take the Thai Airways limousines for 500 baht (Pounds 13.30). Be certain about your destination. Thai street addresses can be baffling, so your contact will often send you a map by fax with the name of the place written in Thai; such maps should be shown to the driver. Taxis with meters are now cheap and easily found. But if you can afford it, a chauffeured car from your hotel is even better; the driver is more likely to be familiar with your destination and to speak some English. Choose a hotel near to where your meetings are to be held. Instead of a single city centre, Bangkok has several business districts and another area embracing most of the government ministries. Take your work with you in the car, or a newspaper or book to while away the time. If possible take a mobile telephone as well (a hotel limousine may provide this), so that you can contact people if you are going to be late. Having reached your meeting, you now have to do your business - interesting and potentially profitable, but not always easy. Unless you are a fluent Thai speaker, it is essential that you have a first-class interpreter. Some senior Thai government officials and business executives speak excellent English, but English is inevitably much less widespread than in former British or American colonies such as Singapore and the Philippines. One example of the pitfalls involved in undertaking large projects in Thailand is the so-called Second Stage Expressway, a Dollars 1bn elevated toll road built by a consortium led by Kumagai Gumi of Japan. KG and some of the foreign banks that helped finance the deal believe the Thai government has flouted the contract and effectively nationalised the road. They are now trying to get their money back and extricate themselves from the project. Part of the dispute centres on the wording of the contract. One weary foreign businessman once told me that a signed contract in Thailand was regarded as no more than a starting point for further negotiations, but do not believe everything you hear about the Asian way of doing business. (In the provinces it is not unusual for Thai tycoons to be gunned down by hit-men on the orders of their rivals.) Be direct in your letters and discussions, explaining what you have to offer and what you want from the other party, but do not expect an immediate yes-or-no response. In a country where the economy is growing at about 8 per cent a year, your contacts, whether from the public or private sector, are likely to be busy. Office meetings tend to be formal. Suits and ties are worn; such clothes are extraordinarily unsuitable for the steamy Bangkok climate, but local businessmen move from air-conditioned house to air-conditioned Mercedes to air-conditioned office and rarely breathe the hot, poisonous air outside. Any good guide book will give you advice on how to be polite in Thailand, although one foreign businessman, asked about business etiquette, pointed at his cheque book and said: 'It's usually made out to cash.' Matters of bribery and corruption - sorry, consultancy fees and special payments - for everything, from customs clearance to winning contracts, are best handled by your local partners. For all its pollution and physical ugliness, Bangkok's saving grace is that it is a lively, cosmopolitan city. Hotels and restaurants are excellent, and you can enjoy a Dollars 1 Thai snack from a roadside stall as much as a Dollars 50 meal in a five-star hotel. Given a free weekend, you can explore the many sights of Bangkok or make an excursion by road to the beach at Hua Hin, the 'Death Railway' between Thailand and Burma, built on the River Kwai by prisoners of the Japanese during the second world war, the old capital of Ayutthaya or the Khao Yai national park. There are regular flights to the islands of Samui and Phuket and to the northern capital, Chiang Mai. This once peaceful town is now being called 'another Bangkok': not, alas, with any affection, but because its traffic jams have started to emulate those of the capital.</p>

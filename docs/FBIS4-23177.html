			<p>BFN     [Text] Kimberley May 30 SAPA -- Kimberley is to remain the  capital of the Northern Cape, SABC [South African Broadcasting  Corporation] Radio News reported on Monday [30 May]. Northern  Cape Premier Manne Dipico said during the second sitting of the  provincial legislature that there was consensus Kimberley should  be the legislative seat of the province.    It was also recommended the province should have four  official languages: English, Afrikaans, Tswana and Xhosa.    Mr Dipico said in his opening address he was satisfied with  the boundaries of the region but would appreciate it if parts  like Namaqualand and Kuruman remained part of the Northern Cape.  According to legislature these parts can decide by referendum if  they want to form part of the Northern Cape or not. However,  the premier appealed to people living in these regions not to  consider a referendum but to remain part of the Northern Cape.    He said it was important that the mining industry should  find  ways of retaining the wealth generated within the province  through job creation mechanisms by the development of allied  secondary industries and local business. Mr Dipico said the  Northern Cape Government had already started encouraging  potential foreign investors to the province. The government was  also determined to consider the provision of suitable housing  for all its citizens a top priority.    He said a provincial policy on agriculture should be  developed to encourage sustainable agriculture as the area  displayed considerably low levels of agricultural potential.  This was largely due to the shortage of surface water, and a  drought management programme was essential.    Another matter which also needed urgent attention was the  question of the landless. Vast tracts of productive land were  held by the Defence Force. This land was needed and everything  would be done to gain access to it to unlock the full  agricultural potential of the province, Mr Dipico said.</p>

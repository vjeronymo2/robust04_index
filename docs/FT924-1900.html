			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK blocks funding for Brussels-backed HDTV strategy BRITAIN yesterday blocked funding for a Brussels-backed strategy to market high definition television, throwing into doubt the European Commission's plans to fund the technology. Eleven member states drafted a statement reaffirming support for HDTV - the advanced generation of television technology, which is expected greatly to enhance picture quality - but British opposition to more than Ecu500m (Pounds 404m) of funding jeopardises the Commission's plans to back HDTV technol-ogy. Britain's tough stand drew criticism from the Dutch and French after a heated meeting of EC industry ministers in Brussels yesterday. Mrs Hadja May-Weggen, Dutch industry minister, denounced the British position and suggested that Mr John Major, prime minister, had promised Mr Ruud Lubbers, his Dutch counterpart, to be supportive when they met at the Edinburgh summit. The Dutch and French support the five-year spending plan. Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France have spent millions developing the D2-Mac and HD-Mac technology and are seeking markets. The row at yesterday's meeting turned into an EC clash between British distaste for industrial policy and a Franco-Dutch desire to support national champions. Britain offered to keep the HDTV programme alive with Ecu80m in 1993 and to review all advanced television technologies, including HDTV which the UK believes risks becoming outdated. Dutch officials were incensed that Mr Tim Sainsbury, British industry minister who chaired the meeting, refused to drop UK opposition. One official said: 'Because 11 members are in favour, the UK should do the decent thing and abstain.' Mr Sainsbury said the UK was concerned that spending proggammes devoted to the Mac standard rather than advanced digital technologies might saddle the EC with technology the Asians and North Americas would not be using. UK officials said several other member states such as Denmark and Ireland were also uneasy about allowing Brussels to commit large sums to HDTV. 'We don't want to be led into a technological cul-de-sac,' said a UK official. Brussels' original plan was to spend Ecu850m over five years. Member states yesterday scaled back these plans, with bids ranging from Ecu450m to Ecu600m. The money would go to consortia for satellite broadcasting, as well as to producers for converting programmes for use in high definition TV sets. Money may also go to other widescreen TV services such as Pal Plus, and for modifying studios making programmes for broadcasting using HDTV technology. The 11 member states urged that the general affairs council take up the HDTV issue next Monday.</p>

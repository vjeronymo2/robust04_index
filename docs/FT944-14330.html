			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Farm agency wins Pounds 1.5m coal clean-up deal Adas, the agricultural advisory agency earmarked for privatisation, will today announce that it has won a Pounds 1.5m contract with British Coal to clean up 120 opencast sites as the coal industry moves into the private sector. The 18-month agreement between Adas and British Coal Opencast, which carries out surface mining, will involve the restoration of former mining sites for agricultural or other uses. It formalises a long partnership that has covered landscaping and the handling of soil during and after mining operations. The contract exemplifies Adas' rapid diversification into industries other than farming as it gears up for a likely sell-off. The Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit recommended in July that Adas be privatised. It became an executive agency two years ago. A decision is awaited from ministers on its future. This year the agency has to recover 63 per cent of the costs of its commercial work under its tough financial targets. It started charging customers in 1987. Before that farmers obtained free advice. Last year commercial consultancy and research work amounted to 33 per cent of its Pounds 76m turnover, up from 29 per cent in the previous year, according to its annual report, which is published today. Staff numbers have been cut by nearly 700 to 2,215 in the past three years and many consultants have become home-based with mobile telecommunications to cut office costs. Dr Julia Walsh, Adas chief executive, said the agency's traditional work advising farmers remained vital, especially given the Gatt trade deal, and the prospect of further Common Agricultural Policy reform and enlargement of the European Union. 'We're encouraging the industry to get itself into shape,' she said. 'It's generally agreed that subsidies can't continue at their present level.' Adas has diversified into waste management, land reclamation and environmental work. It recently won an Ecu1.2m (Pounds 940,000) contract with a Dutch engineering consultancy to manage the clean-up of heavily polluted industrial and farm land in southern Poland. The agency manages the government's 29 environmentally sensitive areas, which cover 12 per cent of agricultural land in England and 24 per cent in Wales and are designed to promote environmentally friendly farming.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREPS;  </P> <P> NARBONNE HIGH COACH DOESN'T FEEL UNLISTED ANY LONGER  </P> <P> Before the season, Narbonne High basketball Coach Bob Hoppes was rarely in  demand. Then success entered his life.  </P> <P> Now his phone rings at all hours.  </P> <P> "That's one reason I bought the (answering) machine," he said. "I don't want to  slight anybody. I want to return those calls."  </P> <P> Coaching colleagues call to offer congratulations. Reporters want to know the  secret behind turning a perennial loser into a winner.  </P> <P> And the Gauchos, who for years played to sparse home crowds, are starting to  draw a following.  </P> <P> Hoppes, a modest and cautious coach, takes it all in stride. He knows the  attention will last only as long as the victories outnumber the defeats.  </P> <P> "The bottom line," he said, "is people want to see wins."  </P> <P> Narbonne fans saw just the opposite last season. The Gauchos finished with a  3-18 record in Hoppes' second year as coach after suffering an embarrassing  97-47 loss to top-seeded Manual Arts in the L.A. City Section 4-A playoffs.  </P> <P> Narbonne had no business going to the playoffs after finishing in last place in  the four-team Pacific League. But L.A. City athletic officials, in their  infinite wisdom, decided midway through the season that all 4-A teams would  qualify for postseason play in order to fill out a 16-team bracket.  </P> <P> So, what is usually regarded as a reward, a playoff berth, became a death  sentence for the Gauchos.  </P> <P> "We didn't belong in the playoffs against Manual Arts," Hoppes said. "I had to  turn around (after the game) and look at the parents and the people who  supported us all year. That was tough.  </P> <P> "I took a lot of heat. I seriously thought about getting out of (coaching) at  that point."  </P> <P> Fortunately for Narbonne, he decided to give it another try.  </P> <P> With the support of his family and the knowledge that he had a good group of  athletes coming back, Hoppes went to work after last season. He picked the  brains of other coaches and he pushed Narbonne through a rigorous schedule of  summer league games.  </P> <P> The payoff has been a 10-3 start for the Gauchos, who reached the final of the  Torrance Holiday Classic by beating Torrance on Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "I've stayed at it," Hoppes said. "I've been busy since I got the job. Some  people think all you have to do is give the players the ball and let them play.  After our games, I'm up most of the night thinking about the things that we  didn't do right.  </P> <P> "I think the biggest factor is that the players believe in themselves and  believe in what I'm doing."  </P> <P> Hoppes credits good chemistry for Narbonne's turnaround.  </P> <P> The Gauchos returned two starters -- 6-foot-4 off guard Major Goulsby and 6-7  forward Curtis Boyer -- and Hoppes blended them with two players off last  year's league champion junior varsity team -- point guard Gabriel Maciel and  6-6 center Mike Reynolds. All are seniors.  </P> <P> The fifth starter, 6-3 junior D'Mitri Rideout, was academically ineligible most  of last season but perhaps has become Narbonne's most exciting player. He has a  45-inch vertical leap, according to Hoppes, and was named all-tournament two  weeks ago at the Hamilton Tournament.  </P> <P> The first players off the bench for the balanced Gauchos are juniors Vijay  Mani, an off guard, and forward Robert Jordan, a transfer from Carson.  </P> <P> "Five or six players have scored in double figures most of the season," Hoppes  said. "We don't really have a star. It's tough for me to single out any one of  them."  </P> <P> If he had to, though, Hoppes would pick Maciel.  </P> <P> "He's averaging about 16 points and seven or eight assists a game," he said of  his floor general. "He even does some rebounding. He has an uncanny knack for  being at the right place at the right time."  </P> <P> Winning has its rewards. For Hoppes, he hopes it can attract the type of  athlete who has bypassed Narbonne in the past for more successful programs at  Carson and Banning.  </P> <P> "You have to be (at Narbonne) to understand what's going on," he said. "We have  some great kids and athletes, but they're not the caliber that are at other  schools. If a kid checks into the area and is an athlete, he usually wants to  go to Carson or Banning.  </P> <P> "In order to attract good athletes, we have to win. That's why the season so  far has been so special."  </P> <P> A promising start would seem to make it easy for Hoppes to aim for lofty goals.  But in keeping with his conservative personality, his sights for the remainder  of the season are set on the game at hand.  </P> <P> "I don't believe in looking past the next one," he said. "I really try to  instill that in the parents and kids. I want to be realistic."  </P> <P> Narbonne was given a dose a reality last week in a 51-38 loss to Carson, a team  it will meet twice more in league play.  </P> <P> That indicates the Gauchos still have their work cut out.  </P> <P> And Hoppes still has some sleepless nights ahead.  </P> <P> Morningside's girls basketball team, which lost its first game last week, also  might have lost a shot at a mythical national championship with a 59-48 setback  to Brea-Olinda in the Tournament of Champions at Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Coach Frank Scott, though, isn't lamenting the fact that an unbeaten season has  escaped his team's grasp.  </P> <P> "It would be nice to go undefeated," he said. "But with the schedule we play,  it's almost unrealistic to think we could go undefeated for a whole season.  This gives us a chance to see where we are and what we have to do."  </P> <P> Scott said the Lady Monarchs took the loss to Brea-Olinda hard.  </P> <P> "Everybody was down," he said. "We went to the locker room and everyone was  crying. I told them to get it all out now. It hurts to lose but they have a  whole season ahead of them."  </P> <P> Morningside played Brea-Olinda without two of its best players. Sophomore  forward Janet Davis (6-4) was out with a sprained ankle and junior Princess  Murray, the Lady Monarchs' first player off the bench, was sidelined with a  dislocated shoulder. Also, 6-5 center Lisa Leslie played only about half the  game because of foul trouble.  </P> <P> "It hurt us," Scott said. "I'd love to play Brea-Olinda again with a full  lineup."  </P> <P> PREP NOTES -- Three Mira Costa basketball players received honors last week at  the Roosevelt Tournament in Honolulu. Guard Chris Hobbs and forward Canyon  Ceman were named Co-Most Valuable Players and reserve guard Simi Fonoa, who was  pressed into the starting lineup because of injuries, was selected to the  all-tournament team. The Mustangs beat David Douglas High of Portland in the  championship game . . . Morningside, playing this week in the Best of the U.S.  girls basketball tournament at Shelbyville, Tenn., expected cold weather after  temperatures near Nashville dipped below zero last week. But Coach Scott  reported it was 40 degrees Wednesday when the Lady Monarchs opened play . . .  St. Bernard's Kerrie Peques and Morningside's Santisha Arnold have been invited  to compete in the girls 500-yard run at the Sunkist Invitational track meet  Jan. 19 at the Sports Arena.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bengali </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Tensions Created Over Kashmir"] </F>   [Excerpt] Indo-Pak relations are in a free-fall slide over  the Kashmir problem. Mutual accusations and allegations followed  by counter-allegations have filled the two neighbors with enmity  toward one another. Pakistan is even more over-heated. A  nation-wide strike is being observed to show solidarity with  Kashmiri militants. This fruitless effort is like cutting off  one's nose to spite one's face. In reaction, the Youth Congress  [Indian Congress (I)] has held demonstrations. Demonstrations  have been held near the Kashmir and Punjab borders [with  Pakistan]. In both countries, these demonstrations have the  possibility of flaring into violence and security forces may  have to use force to contain these demonstrations. Mutual  suspicions are escalating and could become explosive. When there  is a halt in understanding between India and Pakistan, the  increasing tensions in the Subcontinent become very worrisome.    Everyone knows the basic cause of the Kashmir crisis. After  the separatists became involved in terrorism, the situation  became more complex. It is no secret that these terrorists have  received training, weapons and shelter from Pakistan. Pakistan  wants all of Kashmir as its own. But Bhutto's intentions do not  match those of the militants. Their dream is of an independent  Kashmir. Consequently, Benazir's wishes are unlikely to be  fulfilled. In reality, Kashmir is an inseparable part of India  and its own internal affair. Benazir cannot take Kashmir by  force. This is why she is so busy making a fuss about it  everywhere. She is busy raising the subject at international  forums and is not particular about where. For example, she tried  to raise the Kashmir issue at an economic summit in Davos. It  was farcical. People did not come to Davos to hear her lecture  about Kashmir. She tried to present the Kashmir problem as an  issue of concern to the entire Muslim world. Many Muslim  countries, however, regard Kashmir as an internal matter of  India.    Perhaps a more important point, though, is that the Muslim  world is divided. Unlike the middle ages in which jihads were  conducted in the name of religion, national interests are now  paramount. When Pakistan was created as an Islamic nations, half  of India's Muslims remained behind. They accepted the secularist  Indian Republic. The Islamic community in Pakistan has been  unable to build national unity on the basis of Islam. Was not  Bangladesh created on differences of language and culture?  [passage omitted on separatist tendencies in Pakistan]    Now Pakistan is raising Kashmir in international forums.  There are supporters in the U.S. administration. The Kashmir  problem is complex. The common man's life is full of uncertainty  due to terrorists clashing with security forces. There has been  suffering on all sides. Internationalization, however, is not  the solution. Making Kashmir an Islamic nation is not the  solution. Benazir Bhutto, living in a glass house herself,  should not throw stones.  *</p>

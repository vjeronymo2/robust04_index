			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HENDERSON GETS RECOGNITION IN FORM OF MVP;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: HE GETS 14 OF 28 FIRST-PLACE VOTES AND NARROWLY BEATS FIELDER.  </P> <P> The recognition Rickey Henderson has craved since childhood finally came his  way Tuesday when he won the American League's most valuable player award.  </P> <P> The Oakland Athletic outfielder's dazzling array of speed, power, batting and  defense outshined the sheer slugging of Detroit's Cecil Fielder in balloting by  the Baseball Writers Assn. of America.  </P> <P> "I want to tip my hat to Cecil Fielder," Henderson said. "He had an outstanding  year and he deserved to win this award, too. But I think because of all the  things I did for my team I was able to edge him."  </P> <P> Henderson capped the finest overall season of his 11-year career by gaining 14  of the 28 first-place votes. Henderson's total of 317 points put him narrowly  ahead of Fielder, who led the majors with 51 homers and drove in 132 runs.  Fielder drew 10 first-place votes and 286 points in the voting by two writers  in each AL city.  </P> <P> Henderson said he hasn't been so excited since he broke Lou Brock's stolen base  record of 118 by stealing 130 bases in 1982.  </P> <P> "My next big moment is going to be when I break Brock's all-time stolen-base  record," said Henderson, who needs three more to surpass Brock's career total  of 938. "If I can play eight or nine more years, I'll put it out of reach --  1,200 to 1,500 is what I'll shoot for."  </P> <P> Said Hall of Famer Willie Mays, whose No. 24 is worn by Henderson and NL MVP  Barry Bonds of Pittsburgh: "Rickey's the best leadoff man I've ever seen.  They're both my kids, both great players. Barry's my godson and a wonderful  young player. Rickey has everything it takes, the hitting and running and  fielding. I've never seen a leadoff man who can do all the things he does so  well."  </P> <P> More than the slugging of Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire, it was Henderson who  made the Athletics go this year. If he didn't open the scoring with a homer or  a "Rickey run" -- a walk or single followed by two stolen bases and a sacrifice  fly -- he frequently started rallies that brought the A's back or made the big  plays in left field.  </P> <P> Oakland won 26 of the 33 games in which Henderson scored in the first inning.  Five of his career-high 28 homers were leadoff shots, extending his major  league record to 45 leadoff homers.  </P> <P> Henderson, still running and taking the bumps at age 31, led the American  League in stolen bases for the 10th time, finishing with 65.  </P> <P> Henderson also led the majors in runs scored (119) and on-base percentage  (.439). He finished second in batting with a .325 average, behind George  Brett's .329, and in slugging with a career-high .577 mark, just behind  Fielder.  </P> <P> Fielder was disappointed at not winning."It would have been nice. But I know my  teammates appreciate me."  </P> <P> Boston pitcher Roger Clemens finished third with three first-place votes and  212 points. Oakland's Dennis Eckersley, who finished sixth in the MVP voting  behind Toronto's Kelly Gruber and Chicago's Bobby Thigpen, got the other  first-place vote.  </P></p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (5): There's a yen for business cards - Business etiquette: It reduces a host's anxiety if you arrive early and are as fully briefed on the Swiss as they will be on you, advises Ian Rodger. Indeed, the parallels with Tokyo are surprisingly close When leaving Tokyo for Zurich, nearly three years ago, I joked to friends that this would not be a difficult move because the two cities were much alike: clean, safe, expensive, blessed with dependable services and inhabited by courteous, if inscrutable, natives. I soon realised that this observation was actually quite perceptive. Zurich is perhaps not as neurotically clean as Tokyo, but it is every bit as safe, and public services are well maintained and a treat to use. But the big surprise related to the natives. They are astonishingly like the Japanese, especially in their business culture. They are, for example, only fractionally slower than the Japanese to produce their business cards, and nearly as earnest about studying them. Swiss businessmen, like their Japanese counterparts, tend to preface any conversation with a foreigner with a po-faced litany of the overwhelming disadvantages and problems they face - including high labour costs, an absence of natural resources and a paralysed government. Japanese companies are famed for their consensus decision-making; Swiss companies also prefer to go through a long process of consultation before taking important decisions. And the Swiss match the Japanese taste for nemawashi - preparing for every meeting or conference with the most meticulous care. Do not be surprised if you are asked for a curriculum vitae and a list of topics or questions before meeting a senior corporate executive. And be as fully briefed as you can on them. They will be fully briefed on you. Needless to say, meetings occur punctually in Zurich, and it reduces a host's anxiety if you arrive a little early. As in Japan, offices are modest, even for chief executives. Meetings with outsiders tend to take place in specially appointed meeting rooms. The Swiss business set, like that in Japan, is overwhelmingly male and misogynist. Women are used mainly for menial tasks and decoration. At a bank press conference in Zurich a few months ago, visitors were greeted at the door and guided about by immaculately groomed and identically uniformed young women, each in a state of ill-concealed terror that she would put a foot wrong. But for the prevalance of blonde hair and the absence of bowing, one might have been in Tokyo. As in Tokyo, the foreign company or bank setting up for business in Zurich is obliged to have an opening party to which the city's business leaders are invited and usually appear. All guests are presented with a gift as they leave. The Swiss corporate structure bears more than a passing resemblance to Japan's keiretsu or loose networks of companies, although it would probably be more accurate to see the Swiss structure as one single keiretsu, a sort of Schweiz AG. It is not uncommon to find the chairmen of two of the big three banks sitting on the board of the same industrial company, or an industrialist on two or three bank boards. As in Japan, when Schweiz AG companies get into trouble, everyone closes ranks to help out. Thus Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, and Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, chairman of the Holderbank cement group, were helping Swissair in its ultimately unsuccessful negotiations on joining forces with three other European airlines. At first glance, there would seem to be no reason why the two business cultures would be so similar. They have certainly not had much impact on each other historically, although General Douglas MacArthur promised when he went to run the occupation administration in Japan after the second world war that he would make it the Switzerland of Asia. Socially, there are at least two intriguing similarities - cultural unity and a strong egalitarian spirit. Before someone protests that the Swiss are anything but mono-cultural, I should limit the claim to the German Swiss, who make up 70 per cent of the population and rather more of the business community. And even though there are many sub-groups in Swiss German society, the men at least are brought together in a very intense way through their compulsory military service, just as the Japanese are in their gruelling education system.</p>

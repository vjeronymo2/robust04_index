			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Exchange proposes stake in Crest The Stock Exchange has proposed to its members that it should represent their interests by taking a shareholding of up to 30 per cent on their behalf in the new Crest paperless settlements system being developed by the Bank of England. The exchange has also proposed that it should interpret the needs of Crest members to its technical managers. Since the collapse of the Stock Exchange's proposed Taurus paperless settlements system last March, the exchange has been seeking a role for itself in the successor system being built by the Bank of England. Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, Stock Exchange chairman, said in a letter to exchange member firms late last week that ownership 'on the basis of a significant minority interest would best contribute to the effectiveness of the arrangements'. Last month the Bank issued a consultation document on Crest ownership saying that it did not believe any single company should own more than 10 per cent of it and that no sectoral group should own more than 30 per cent. The exchange is not interested in owning a stake as small as 10 per cent, it said yesterday. However, under these proposals ownership of a 30 per cent stake would require Stock Exchange member firms to forgo their right to be individual shareholders. Sir Andrew said there will be a need for a management role to handle the transition to Crest from the ageing, paper-based Talisman settlements system currently in use and operated by the exchange, and 'to interpret the future requirements of the owners and users to the operator and in managing market changes'. Sir Andrew said that at least in the early years of Crest operation the exchange was the best body to do this. But the Bank has made clear that it does not want any single company or interest group to have a controlling role in Crest. In a paper issued last month, the Bank said it wants a wide ownership base to avoid giving undue advantage to any one commercial interest or to any one community.</p>

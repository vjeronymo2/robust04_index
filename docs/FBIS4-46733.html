			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Kabardino-Balkar Republic [KBR] Cabinet of Ministers Decree </F> No. 37, issued 3 March 1994: "On Efforts by the Nalchik City  Administration To Maintain Public Order and Combat Crime, With  Consideration for the Requirements of a KBSSR Presidential Edict  Issued on 16 January 1992, `On Urgent Measures To Improve Law  and Order in the KBSSR'"]    [Text] The KBR Cabinet of Ministers notes that issues  pertaining to maintenance of public order and anti-crime efforts  account for a significant share of the work done by the Nalchik  City Administration. It is making efforts to ensure compliance  with laws and create the proper conditions for the functioning  of law enforcement agencies, including public safety militia  units (local militia). A number of measures of an  organizational, financial and physical support nature have been  implemented for the purpose of supporting law enforcement  agencies, in particular militia units.    However, despite the measures that have been taken the crime  situation in the republic capital remains difficult, with the  number of serious crimes increasing by 19.4 percent and the  number of crimes committed by minors up by 56 percent. The  overall apprehension rate is 45.3 percent, below the  republic-wide figure. There is no clear-cut interaction between  various internal affairs departments. Crime prevention efforts  are poorly organized, including efforts to prevent recidivism.    Economic crime is occurring on a large scale. Proper  interaction between internal affairs agencies, the tax service  and the Tax Police Department has not been developed in  connection with efforts to combat this type of crime. Serious  shortcomings have been noted in the operations of the city  court, and procuratorial oversight is not sufficiently effective.    Physical and technical support for law enforcement agencies  is not up to modern standards. There continues to be a shortage  of vehicles, telephone and radio communications equipment and  many other types of special equipment. The 2nd Internal Affairs  Department lacks office space, the city court is housed in two  buildings, and the city procuracy lacks normal working  conditions. The problem of how to provide housing for members of  law enforcement agencies is acute.    Thus far the city administration has not made full use of  the  powers granted it to maintain law and order and monitor the  operations of internal affairs agencies. A plan for priority  anti-crime measures in the KBR in 1993 that was approved by a  Republic Supreme Soviet decree on 27 April 1993 has not yet been  fully implemented.    The KBR Cabinet of Ministers hereby resolves:    1. to note that measures taken by the Nalchik City  Administration to protect public order and combat crime in the  republic's capital are inadequate.    2. in view of the difficult crime situation in the city of  Nalchik, to instruct the Nalchik City Administration to draw up  during the second quarter of 1994, in conjunction with the KBR  Ministry of Internal Affairs and other law enforcement agencies,  priority measures to improve protection of public order in the  city and to prevent and investigate serious crimes.    3. that the Nalchik City Administration (S. B. Abrokov)  shall:    -- increase its demands on the heads of city internal  affairs  departments and personally oversee their efforts to combat  violations of the law;    -- take effective measures to reverse the decline in public  activism with regard to preservation of public order, and by 1  July 1994 arrange for the establishment of volunteer citizens'  patrols through major labor collectives, providing them with  material incentives and reestablishing public law enforcement  posts;    -- focus greater attention on improving the working and  living conditions of persons employed by law enforcement  agencies and judges, providing them with office space and  housing in a timely manner; during the first half of 1994 make  private garden plots, parcels of land for individual  construction and loans for those purposes available to the  aforementioned personnel; by the end of 1994 fully provide  members of the militia, the procuracy and judges with telephones  in their offices and homes; complete by 1 April 1994 the  renovation of office space set aside for the 3rd Internal  Affairs Department; by the end of 1994 solve the problem of  locating appropriate office space for the City Procuracy;    -- in conjunction with the KBR Ministry of Internal Affairs,  during the first half of 1994 consider and take action on the  possibility and appropriateness of establishing a coordinating  center for the purpose of arranging interaction between internal  affairs departments and other law enforcement agencies in their  efforts to combat crime and establish proper order in the city  of Nalchik;    -- in order to improve protection of all forms of property,  in conjunction with the KBR Ministry of Internal Affairs and  other affected agencies study the appropriateness and  possibility of restricting and eventually banning entry into the  city by motor vehicles from other regions of the Russian  Federation, submitting proposals to this effect to the KBR  Cabinet of Ministers during the fourth quarter of 1994.    4. to direct the attention of KBR minister of internal  affairs Kh. A. Shogenov to serious shortcomings in the  operations of internal affairs departments in the city of  Nalchik with regard to the investigation and prevention of  crimes, and to demand that effective measures be taken to  improve the effectiveness of those departments' efforts to  strengthen law and order.    5. that the KBR minister of internal affairs (Kh. A.  Shogenov) shall in conjunction with the city administration  consider and take action on the following matters in 1994:    -- additional allocation of motor vehicles, fuels and  lubricants for the needs of city internal affairs departments,  primarily dispatcher stations and patrol and checkpoint units;    -- full supply of radio communications equipment, recording  equipment, photographic supplies, copying machines, video  equipment and other types of special equipment to criminal  militia under the city's internal affairs departments;    -- relocation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Financial  and Economic Department, the Address Bureau and the Okhrana  [Protection] Association Warehouse (a part of the Ministry of  Internal Affairs) out of the 2nd Internal Affairs Department's  building in order to ensure normal working conditions for the  department's personnel;    -- the possibility and appropriateness of setting up militia  units in the Volnyy Aul and KBGU microrayons and a militia  station in the park zone, with allocation of the necessary  buildings;    -- improvement of the effectiveness of the medical  detoxification unit to ensure profitability in its operations.    6. to propose that the KBR Procuracy (R. I. Abazov) take  measures to improve the effectiveness of procuratorial oversight  in the city of Nalchik with regard to exact compliance with laws  pertaining to the protection of citizens' rights and legitimate  interests, crime prevention and investigation, and compliance  with the law in the operations of internal affairs agencies, the  city court and the executive branch.    7. that the Ministry of Justice (A. M. Batyrbekov) shall  take  measures to increase the effectiveness with which the city  court's operations are organized and ensure correct application  of legislation in judicial practice.    8. that the Administrative Law Department of the KBR Cabinet  of Ministers Administration of Affairs shall monitor compliance  with this decree.    9. that the status of compliance with this decree by the  Nalchik City Administration and the KBR Ministry of Internal  Affairs shall be reported to the KBR Cabinet of Ministers by 1  February 1995 based on year-end findings.

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Gengold drops 5.2% to R106m in quarter An unsettled labour force in the run-up to South Africa's first all-race elections was responsible for a 5.2 per cent drop in production for the March quarter at Gengold, the gold mining division of South Africa's Gencor group. However, a higher gold price meant that after-tax profit declined only 3 per cent to R106m (Dollars 20m), compared with R110.5m in the preceding three months, and was still sharply up on the R75.3m for the same period last year. Due to reduced capital expenditure, distributable income rose from R78.2m to R82.3m in the quarter, but total gold output declined to 15.87 tonnes from 16.7 tonnes in the December quarter as the effect of short strikes at a number of the group's mines affected output. Overall gold yield remained unchanged at 5.9 grammes/tonne. The average gold price received was R39,663 a kg, well up on the previous quarter's R37,992 but still short of the spot price as a result of the group's hedging operations. However, Mr Tom Dale, general manager for finance, said that no further hedging arrangements would be undertaken at this stage and all forward sale contracts would be completed by May. Of the group's big mines, Beatrix, Kinross and Winkelhaak mines all turned in satisfactory performances, with Winkelhaak boosting after-tax income to R12.9m from R9.3m. The poorest results came from Buffelsfontein, which was affected by five fires, three seismic events and a brief illegal strike. Production dropped to 3,080 tonnes from 3,500 tonnes in the December quarter. See Commodities</p>

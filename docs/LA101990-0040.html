			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STUDENT APPLICANTS FLOOD CSU SAN MARCOS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE NEW UNIVERSITY MAY HAVE TO TURN AWAY  QUALIFIED APPLICANTS FOR SPRING SEMESTER.  </P> <P> Still in its inaugural year, Cal State San Marcos will turn away qualified  student applicants for the upcoming spring semester, university officials said  Thursday.  </P> <P> The university last Monday stopped accepting applications for the semester  beginning in January. As late as Thursday, only an estimate of the number of  applicants was available.  </P> <P> "Our expectations were exceeded, and it looks like we are going to have just  under 400 applications for the spring," said Betty Huff, director of  admissions.  </P> <P> Although none of the applications have been processed yet, Huff expects that  more than 90% will meet the school's entrance requirements.  </P> <P> Huff said the campus, at 283 full-time students, is already above the 250  students that had been budgeted for this year. The new applicants will easily  push the number of full-time students beyond 300, although no one is quite sure  by how many, Huff said.  </P> <P> Students applying to the university's teacher's credential program, its only  post-baccalaureate program, accounted for more than 100 of the applicants,  school officials said.  </P> <P> The credentialed program, however, has space for only 25 more students in the  spring, and it is likely that qualified applicants will be turned away, said  Dorothy Lloyd, director of the program.  </P> <P> "We will be looking at test scores, students will come in for personal  interviews, they must have completed field experience, and there is their  grade-point average to consider," Lloyd said.  </P> <P> "I hope that the students that don't make it this time will reapply for the  fall, because the fall class will be much larger," Lloyd said.  </P> <P> Accepting even 25 students is a stretch of the school's resources, she said.  The 52 students accepted into the program for this semester were two more than  expected.  </P> <P> "It squeezed our budget to do it, but it would have been terrible not to take  in any students this spring. We would not have been serving our community if we  did not," Lloyd said.  </P> <P> The school delayed hiring both administrative and support personnel until the  fall in order to accept the added students, she said.  </P> <P> Interest in the credential program had been building ever since the opening of  school, Lloyd said, with as many as 30 inquiries a day from prospective  students.  </P> <P> "We're not really surprised at the number of applicants," Lloyd said. "We had  heard that there was a great need for teachers in the North County area, and we  are in a prime location for students."  </P> <P> Lloyd said the university plans to accept 75 to 80 students for the credential  program in the fall of 1991.  </P> <P> Huff, director of admissions, said she does not expect any baccalaureate  students to be turned away. Dean of students Ernest Zomalt expects that about  10% of the baccalaureate students will not enroll when classes begin next year,  given the university's experience.  </P> <P> "Out of the group that is readily admissible (both baccalaureate and  post-baccalaureate students), we're thinking that there would be something on  the order of 200 to 210 of the 380 to 390 applicants that would in fact  enroll," Zomalt said. "Our analysis of available space would indicate that we  can absorb that number."  </P> <P> Zomalt said that at least two faculty positions will be filled to help handle  the influx of students but conceded that the student-to-faculty ratio will  probably rise slightly, particularly in business courses.  </P></p>

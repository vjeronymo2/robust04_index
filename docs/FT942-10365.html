			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Builders launch Brussels lobby group An organisation to win Britain a bigger share of the European Commission's Pounds 8.5bn research and development budget was launched yesterday by the construction industry. The Construction Industry European Research Club, which is supported by the Department of the Environment, will provide information on impending projects, arrange partnerships with other European companies and research organisations, provide contacts and prepare submissions to the Commission. It will be managed by the independent Building Research Establishment, which has extensive contacts with research organisations in continental Europe. To qualify for EU funds applications must be supported by bodies from at least two EU countries. Establishing co-operative ventures between UK companies competing in the same sector, and arranging cross-border support has proved difficult in the past. British companies have failed to win as big a share of the EU budget as they would like. There was now a significant opportunity to redress this balance, said Mr Tony Baldry, the construction minister. Corporate membership will cost Pounds 1,000 a year and Pounds 500 for academic organisations. Builders started work on 48,800 homes in Britain during the three months to the end of March, 1 per cent more than during the corresponding period last year. Starts were also 1 per cent higher than during the previous three months, figures published yesterday by the environment department show.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandur Tomov, chairman of the Civic </F> Alliance for the Republic, by Todor Tokin; place and date not  given: "We Will Support Any Government That Brings About the  Country's Stabilization"]    [Text] The chairman of GOR [Civic Alliance for the  Republic] is nearing his 40th birthday. Last July he left the  BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], and 10 days later also left the  Socialists' parliamentary group. The GOR has almost 800 local  and 110 municipal organizations.    [Tokin] Mr. Tomov, how do you assess the economic and  political situation in Bulgaria at the moment?    [Tomov] I think that the situation has become extremely  heated at an awkward time, and the politicians are the main  cause of this. Many people have lost their nerve who are  striving at all costs to seize power. What is more, it is clear  that some people have become scared that if we sign the  agreement with the IMF and the banks of the London Club, this  will happen without them and they will be unable to utilize the  substantial sums that the world organizations are granting. I  think this political gambling with margins is untimely and very  harmful for the country. Unfortunately, the general situation  at the moment is destructive. In Zlatograd recently someone  said to me: "At one time Simeon Radev wrote `The Builders of  Modern Bulgaria'; today someone around will probably write a  book called `Destroyers of Modern Bulgaria.'"    [Tokin] Have things really become as bad as that?    [Tomov] Today very few people think about the consequences  and the cost of the changes that they are demanding. Every  spring, political schizophrenia breaks out in Bulgaria, and this  is the fifth year in which it has happened.    [Tokin] Did the president not add fuel to the flames by  saying in London that the government is sick? Who would  conclude the expected agreements with a sick government?    [Tomov] To blacken the name of the state and the state  institutions abroad harms Bulgaria, whatever the reasons are.  In civilized countries, no one makes assessments of their  government when abroad. If you want people to respect you  abroad, you should say only nice things about Bulgaria.  Accordingly, I do not think the president's statement in London  was constructive. Second, I have always advised him to act as  an arbiter and stand above the national parties and the  situation at the time, above petty feuds and petty aims. This  is the president's constitutional role, one that cannot be  replaced, in view of the weakness of the institutions and the  power vacuum. In his statements President Zhelev took sides,  and when he has taken one side, he has always lost. If he does  not do so, he will always win.    [Tokin] How do you view the other statement he made in  London, about the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces], NSD [New  Alliance for Democracy], DPS [Rights and Freedoms Movement], and  the independent members of parliament forming a government?    [Tomov] The president probably does have some idea of this  kind. However, first, it was not the right place to announce  such a thesis; second, such a prospect is not very realistic.  Offers of this kind are made when it is clear that they will be  accepted. When a head of state makes such statements and it  turns out that everything is hanging in the air and that those  who are expected to form this government do not want to hear  anything about it and make statements to the opposite effect,  this naturally dooms such proposals to failure and does not  increase the authority of the head of state.    [Tokin] What kind of government does the GOR advocate?    [Tomov] We will support any government that brings about the  country's stabilization and solves the two great problems,  namely signing the agreements with the IMF and the creditor  banks. If this comes about, if the government guarantees  relative stability for the lev and skillfully manages the scanty  reserves at our disposal, then this would be of benefit. If,  however, the country is thrown into chaos, the people who make  the political provocations will have to take the responsibility.    It is possible to achieve a political consensus on holding  elections in the fall, but at the moment, when this outcome is  being forced upon us by declaring that the government is  useless, by holding rallies, and by launching attacks on the  Bulgarian lev -- something that I regard as especially  dangerous, all this leads to destructive tendencies. This is  the scenario offered to us by the people who want elections as  soon as possible. Here I would like to stress that GOR has no  commitments to the present government. We can see its numerous  weaknesses. Accordingly, if someone proposes replacing it by a  better one, the GOR will support this idea. However, is there  anyone who can make such an offer? If the government simply  falls now, and the elections are not held until October or  November, this will lead to five or six months of chaos, and we  will find ourselves in a situation of spiralling inflation --  this is my solemn warning.    [Tokin] Nevertheless, now that the president has withdrawn  his confidence in the present government, which government will  sign the agreements?    [Tomov] Any legitimate government can do this, but not a  caretaker government or one that has been toppled. If anyone  topples Lyuben Berov's cabinet now and no new alternative  cabinet is formed quickly, then it is possible that no  agreements will be signed.    The thesis that Ivan Kostov developed last week, that it is  impossible to maintain the dollar at a reasonable level and at  the same time sign the agreements, is actually a thesis against  the agreements. However, as we saw, the next day following his  statements the IMF slapped down this thesis by announcing that  the issue will be examined before 11 April. I maintain that the  lev can be saved if the agreements are signed and if we receive  the first tranche by 15-20 April.    [Tokin] In the meantime, there is talk about a "blue" [SDS]  caretaker cabinet....    [Tomov] If Dr. Zhelev appoints a caretaker government, this  government will probably have such a tinge, despite the fact  that a balance should be maintained. The best thing would be  for it to be composed of people who have no direct commitment as  regards the elections and who will not be tempted to act in  favor of one or another party.    [Tokin] What do you think about applying value-added tax to  newspapers?    [Tomov] We cannot deviate from European standards. As I  have said in parliament, it is ridiculous for us to have rates  three or four times higher than the average European ones. I  look at the issue purely pragmatically: The revenue that the  budget receives from the press is insignificant. I say that the  taxation policy proposed by Ivan Kostov is totally wrong. To  me, it is a policy favored by tax collectors.    [Tokin] Would you agree to lead a cabinet now, at this  moment?    [Tomov] I hardly have a moral right to do this within the  term of the present National Assembly. Nonetheless, I will say  that the problems facing a politician are now quite specific,  that is, everything depends on the balance of forces inside  parliament. I would associate myself with a government on one  sole condition, namely if I feel that I have solid support  behind me both in parliament and in the nation at large. I am  especially interested in the latter. Moreover, I would want to  be given a free rein to do what I want. Change must come about  in Bulgaria. Bulgaria needs a new choice.    [Tokin] Do you remain an optimist, despite everything you  have said about concluding the agreements with the financial  institutions?    [Tomov] Yes. This is a chance for Bulgaria to escape from  the present situation and join the family of civilized states.    If we fail because of political machinations, the whole  blame  will fall on the shoulders of those "Bulgarian politicians" who  cannot see any further than their own noses.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Margin pressures hit BTR shares BTR shares plunged nearly 12 per cent, from 382p to 338p, after the UK-based industrial conglomerate confirmed market fears that manufacturers are finding it difficult to pass on higher raw material prices to their customers. BTR said that as economic recovery had gathered pace in certain key markets, notably North America and Australasia, it was beginning to see the twin benefits of economic growth and increased confidence. But it warned: 'Notwithstanding the improved orders and sales position, overcapacities in many of the group's markets, together with raw material cost increases, are giving rise to pricing pressures which will continue to make the improvement of margins difficult to obtain in 1994.' Pre-tax profits increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 694m in the six months to June 30, while sales increased by 11 per cent to Pounds 4.5bn. Excluding gains on disposals, pre-tax profits rose by 12 per cent, from Pounds 549m to Pounds 616m - well below market expectations, which had been about Pounds 665m. Operating profits rose by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 684m, but margins slipped from 15.7 to 15.2 per cent. Analysts said BTR was a barometer stock. If a group with such strong market positions was suffering margin pressure, then it boded badly for many manufacturers. One said: 'We must see an increase in output costs for companies to make money.' However, Mr Bob Faircloth, BTR's chief operating officer, said margins had actually increased in businesses accounting for about 70 per cent of group sales. The margin erosion came because of specific situations in the US and some business in continental Europe, which had still to benefit from recovery. Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive, said that although he saw little scope for margin improvement in the second half, he remained confident that the group would make further progress next year. Gearing fell from 63 per cent to 43 per cent. Mr Jackson said 'we've got our eye out for a large acquisition', but BTR was not yet close to a specific deal. The interim pay-out is a foreign income dividend (Fid) of 6.5p, compared with last time's conventional dividend of 4.95p. For non-taxpayers, this represents a 5 per cent increase, and a rise of 30 per cent for taxpayers. Earnings per share rose by 9.5 per cent to 11.5p (10.5p). Productivity and efficiency savings added Pounds 37m to operating profit, offset by Pounds 18m of redundancy and rationalisation costs. The group also announced a 'very significant' clutch of appointments to its main board. Next generation, Page 14; Lex, Page 18; BTR Nylex, Page 28</p>

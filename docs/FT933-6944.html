			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Kinkel, Juppe in Gatt talks pledge MR KLAUS KINKEL, German foreign minister, and Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart, yesterday voiced their determination to reach a rapid settlement of the Uruguay Round. 'We have not solved all the problems, but our determination to find a solution is stronger than ever,' Mr Juppe told a news conference. He said Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, would be bringing new 'texts' putting forward French proposals on farm trade liberalisation, when he came to Bonn for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl tomorrow. After a day of informal discussions in Dresden, in the east German state of Saxony, the two foreign ministers underlined the 'excellent' state of relations between their governments, in spite of the recent upheaval in the European monetary system, and their continuing differences on the Gatt negotiations. Mr Juppe said that France could not accept the extent of cuts in European Community cereal exports, of between 13m and 17m tonnes a year, agreed in the EC-US Blair House accord last year. Underlining efforts to forge a common position, Mr Jochen Borchert, German agriculture minister, flew to Paris for dinner with Mr Jean Puech, his French opposite number, last night.</p>

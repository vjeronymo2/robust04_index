			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Distribution surge As a mechanism for returning cash to shareholders, East Midlands Electricity's special dividend will attract maximum political flak. The Pounds 186m pay-out is more visible than the share buy-backs espoused by other electricity companies and so more susceptible to attack by Labour politicians. But shareholders will be unworried by political sniping, provided that the mega-dividend is a fairer and more tax-efficient way of returning cash than share buy-backs - as East Midlands claims. There is little in the fairness argument. It is not true, as some suggest, that everybody benefits from dividends while only institutions which tender their shares gain from buy-backs. Ordinary shareholders benefit too because a share buy-back gears up a company's balance sheet, boosting earnings per share - although the gain is not as obvious as with a mega-dividend. The tax benefit of the special dividend is the more powerful argument. Tax-exempt investors will definitely receive a tax credit. The best that can be said of share-backs is that, in those which used a tender, there may be a tax credit. In those where the company merely bought shares from a market maker, there will certainly be no tax credit. There is, of course, more to mega-dividends and buy-backs than tax. The underlying aim is to leverage the balance sheet. Given the predictability of the electricity distribution business, gearing of 50 per cent or more would seem appropriate. By that yardstick, East Midlands - with gearing after the dividend of 20 per cent - has much further to go. Once the uncertainty over the flotation of the National Grid is resolved, more special dividends are likely. Other electricity companies will come under pressure to follow suit.</p>

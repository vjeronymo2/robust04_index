			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MMS agrees with the last three commenters. Accepting Form MMS&hyph;2014 filing as tolling the 2-year period could increase the submission of unauthorized credit adjustments and increase review costs. Additionally, there is no logical reason to toll the section 10 2-year period by filing a Form MMS&hyph;2014 credit adjustment after the rules have been published. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) One commenter questioned the limited refund amendment rights provided by &sect;230.453(e)(1). This commenter stated that inadvertent errors of notation related to the lease or any particular month should be amendable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MMS disagrees with this commenter. Permitting exceptions to the rule in an effort to be fair usually has the opposite effect. In this case, MMS would be required to judge an ``inadvertent error'' exactly the same in every case, an impossible task. To assure clear understanding and equal application to all lessees, the rule provides for no exceptions and will be strictly applied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Several commenters questioned the approval of refund requests subject to later audit contained in &sect;230.455. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reponse:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this section is to eliminate the time delay required to complete an audit prior to the lessee's recovery of the overpayment (see discussion of general comment (b) above). Without an analysis of the lessee's records, MMS cannot determine the validity of the refund request. Accepting refund requests as valid subject to audit provides the lessees more timely use of funds, and provides for MMS' recovery in the event the requests were improper. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) One commenter stated that MMS should clearly indicate that the 2-year requirement of section 10 does not apply to offsets described at &sect;230.456. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since section 10 does not apply to offsets, the 2-year requirement of section 10 does not apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) One commenter stated that MMS should clearly define the word ``intentional'' within the meaning of &sect;230.456, to protect lessees. This commenter expressed concern that if this determination were based upon the subjective judgment of the auditor, offsets would almost certainly be applied inequitably. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MMS disagrees with this comment. To develop a finding of intentional underpayment for the purpose of &sect;230.456, an auditor would have to demonstrate that the lessee's policy is to recover overpayments by filing subsequent underpayments. This finding would not be a subjective audit determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Three commenters objected to the provisions of &sect;230.458(b) which impose an assessment of $500 for each unauthorized credit adjustment. Because MMS often discovers the unauthorized recoupment more than 2 years after payment, one commenter stated that the recovery of the improperly taken credit with interest already exceeds the actual amounts required by lease terms. An additional penalty appears harsh to this commenter. Another commenter argued that if it costs MMS $500 to research and approve refunds, then all amounts less than that should be allowed without following &sect;230.453 procedures. The third commenter stated that the amount is arbitrary and excessive because unauthorized recoupments are generally unintentional and are incurred when attempting to make internal accounting adjustments. Since proposed Form MMS&hyph;2014 line entries must be submitted with a refund request, it is often necessary and more expedient to process accounting corrections, allow the MMS&hyph;2014 credit lines to be generated, and then eliminate those credit entries prior to the normal monthly royalty payment. If the adjustments are numerous or complex, a credit entry may fail to be pulled, resulting in an inadvertent unauthorized adjustment. This commenter further argued that the time delays in the process, both before the overpayment is discovered and after the refund request is filed and authorization issued, result in the Government receiving the time value of the funds at the expense of the lessees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MMS disagrees with these comments. First, the review of unauthorized recoupments within MMS is now an automated process. Once these regulations are effective MMS will begin reviewing for such recoupments on a current basis. The MMS plans to discover unauthorized recoupments in time for the lessee to file a refund request before the 2-year period after payment has expired. Without the penalty, lessees will incur no material costs as a consequence of filing an unauthorized recoupment. In such an environment, some lessees may decide not to establish internal controls to prevent unauthorized recoupments, but rely instead on the Government. This reliance would shift the costs from the lessees and provide protection from the effects of missing the 2-year limit. The MMS would not be properly enforcing section 10 if it allowed such a result. Moreover, even with the penalty, many lessees will incur less costs than with the less timely Government review that has occurred in the past. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The penalty is not established to recover the costs of refund request processing. Rather, MMS is recovering the costs of review recoupments and comparing them with approved refunds. Since MMS cannot determine the effect publishing these rules will have on the rate of unauthorized recoupments, the cost per incident is not quantifiable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The concerns of the third commenter related to production and filing of proposed Forms MMS&hyph;2014 being eliminated when the regulations are effective, since the forms are not required by &sect;230.453. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) One commenter noted that the purpose of &sect;230.459(a)(3) as explained in the section-by-section analysis would be better served by changing the date of tolling from the date of ``application'' for unitization to the effective date of the unit. The commenter also noted that unit revisions should be added as covered by this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MMS disagrees that the date of tolling should be changed to the effective date of the unit. As noted in the discussion of this commenter, the effective date is subject to the judgment of the Regional Supervisor. In contrast, the date of application is a fixed event. Unit revisions are included in the operation of &sect;230.459(a)(3), as discussed in the proposed rule preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) One commenter expressed concern that it may be impossible to comply with the requirements of &sect;230.459(a)(4). This section provides that to toll the 2-year period, lessees must specifically identify an action or proceeding that could result in payments becoming excess, the lease(s) and sales months affected, and an estimated of the amount that could be subject to refund or credit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special  coordinator for Cyprus affairs, will be arriving on the island  today. President Rauf Denktas will receive Lamb tomorrow.    The Greek Cypriot radio announced that Lamb is not bringing  any new proposals but that he will conduct more effective  initiatives for the adaptation of the 21 March UN document.  Lamb will leave the island on Friday [15 April] after  concluding his contacts.    Denktas said that nobody can take away the Turkish Cypriot  people's just rights by force. Assessing Lamb's unexpected  visit on the island, Denktas noted that there are efforts to  conduct new ploys in Cyprus. Denktas stressed that Lamb's  arrival in Cyprus at a time when the Turkish Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller is visiting the United States gives rise to thought.    Denktas stated that the Greek Cypriot side is responsible  for  the deadlock reached in the proximity talks regarding the  confidence-building measures, and added that the Turkish Cypriot  side is open to new suggestions that Lamb may bring forward.    Indicating that it is natural for Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish  Foreign Ministry deputy under secretary, to visit the Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus, Denktas pointed out the advantages  of frequent exchanges of views with Ankara.    Indicating that Turkish and Greek Cypriot youths  participating in the archery competition held under the auspices  of the United Nations in the Greek Cypriot side has no political  aspect, Denktas added that these kinds of events should not be  transformed into a political message. Noting that these kinds  of political messages prevent the development of events that  further intercommunal personal contacts, Denktas added that  these events are not related to the Cyprus issue.    Reiterating that the Turkish Cypriot cannot live under Greek  Cypriot administration nor under the United Nations control,  Denktas stressed that for a permanent agreement, the Turkish  Cypriot should live freely under equal rights and conditions as  the Greek Cypriots.</p>

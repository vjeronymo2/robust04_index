			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: When 'arrogance' pays - Joanna Slaughter talks with fee-based adviser Murray Noble. Second in a series Fee-based independent financial advisers were rare birds when Robert Noble-Warren founded Murray Noble in 1976. Indeed, he would argue that they had scarcely emerged from the egg. He says: 'In 1976, I had an idea of what should be provided 10 years on, but there was no one to copy. We were ahead of the Financial Services Act; we were disclosing commission before anyone was talking about it; and we were also charging fees before anyone was talking about it.' Keivan Borhani, Murray Noble's managing director, agrees. 'We are arrogant pioneers,' he says. Unlike many pioneers, however, Noble-Warren has not received a quiver full of arrows in his back. On the contrary. He has 300 clients, and eight years of hard work has confirmed his belief in the value of fee-paying financial advice, which concentrates on solutions rather than selling products. He argues: 'From a client's point of view, the rationale of a fee-based firm is that we can be free to explore solutions that don't involve commission-based products. And you then find that the solutions are much wider. Only about 20 per cent of the work we do is involved with a product. If commission is paid, we don't regard it as our own. We ask clients what they want to do about it.' But what of the argument that people are not prepared to pay for fee-based financial advice? Borhani replies: 'Once you can demonstrate value, we have not found any resistance to paying fees. I think it is more commercially viable to go down the fee-based route. It is not so capital-intensive; you grow more slowly; and you have time to build a relationship, as you have to be able to answer for every piece of advice you give in two or three years' time.' Unlike some fee-based advisers, Murray Noble is not content to trawl only the ranks of the wealthy to find clients. Its aim is to bring its service to ordinary people, although this broad ambition is still some way from being realised. 'We don't look at a client and say: what is your wealth?' Borhani explains. 'We say: what is your problem and how can we help? We have miners in Wales and retired couples who think that financial planning is worthwhile for them. What we don't yet have is sufficient volume to bring the prices down.' Murray Noble's fees for financial planning range from Pounds 75-95 an hour, while administrative advice costs Pounds 35. If the financial need is a common one, however, clients will be quoted a set fee. Noble-Warren says: 'If people have a retirement income question mark in mind, for example, we can do a fixed fee service for anything between Pounds 400 and Pounds 800, depending on the complexity of the case.' The initial meeting with a client is free and is held at the Murray Noble offices, which overlook London's Fleet Street. 'This first interview is for us to get to know each other and to make our assessment and to see whether we can help,' says Borhani. Noble-Warren adds: 'It is very rare that someone says: what services are you offering me? They say: I have a problem. I have inherited this money, or I am about to retire, or my daughter has Down's syndrome.' 'They don't come here and say: plan me,' Borhani agrees. 'And, very often, the needs we identify are very different from the things they consider they need. That gets sorted out over the years.' Couples are put under some pressure to attend the first meeting together, although Borhani concedes this insistence on mutuality has caused problems at times: 'On three occasions, the partners have subsequently divorced - and then each of them has wanted to continue with the same planner.' A barrister and a law graduate are among Murray Noble's four financial planners. All the advisers have sat the examinations to become Associates of the Institute of Financial Planning, and some have won awards: Noble-Warren was Money Management's Financial Planner of the Year in 1992 and a colleague, Joanna Stone, was Money Week's Independent Financial Adviser of the Year in 1993. The firm's strategy is to forge long-term relationships with its clients. To do this, it offers continuing support and help on a retainer fee basis. Should clients be made redundant, they receive the retainer service free for two years, if necessary. There are three levels of service: The Executive (Pounds 60 a year) provides quarterly newsletters, sundry mail shots and an annual tax and financial plan. This allows clients to alert their planner to any changes in their circumstances. The VIP (Pounds 150) offers all the benefits of the Executive service plus an annual interview with an adviser. The Directors' (Pounds 480) is the flagship. Borhani says: 'It is designed for directors of companies and people who have quite complicated situations. They have specific objectives and they need the help of a planner on a much more regular basis.' Services offered include tax advice and investment management, and clients may receive a prod in the right direction if they need help that Murray Noble cannot provide. Those who have not made a will, for example, will be given the names of solicitors known to the firm. Borhani's area is investment management. He runs four broker funds, 'our planners will select them if the performance is good' and an advisory asset monitoring service and says: 'We have planned portfolios. I think this was the reason why there wasn't a single panic telephone call from clients at the time of the Kuwaiti invasion.' The firm's present strategy is to move away from investing in the established, developed markets of the US, UK and Japan. Noble-Warren argues: 'The UK market just doesn't stand up compared with the risk/return you can get elsewhere so, for some time, we have been steadily sailing on the other tack, away from UK equities.' Murray Noble has indemnity insurance for its professional activities and no one in the firm handles client money. Noble-Warren says: 'If people are buying a security, they will pay a cheque and their money will go straight to the institution. We don't have a clients' account.' On a more personal level, Noble-Warren says: 'I can't get on with people who just come across as greedy. And I wish people would take money a little more seriously, instead of reacting on the spur of the moment. They end up with bits of products that don't match and don't do what they should.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE INDEPENDENTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Name                                 Murray Noble Group Address and head office              50 Fleet Street                                      London EC4Y 1BE Date firm was established            1976 Regulator                            Fimbra Funds under management               Pounds 2.5m (broker funds);                                      Pounds 7-Pounds 8m (Asset                                      Monitoring Service) Number of clients                    300 Number of offices                    2 Minimun investment accepted          No minimum Services offered                     Financial planning; investment;                                      tax advice; estate planning.

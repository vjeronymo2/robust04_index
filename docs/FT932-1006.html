			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: TSB's capital question After all the losses it has piled up as a result of its purchase of Hill Samuel and ill-judged forays into commercial lending, it is astonishing that TSB still has a tier one capital ratio as high as 8.1 per cent. Now that provisions appear to be on a falling trend, surplus capital could become something of a burden. The risk that the bank will again find something stupid on which to fritter away its cash is small. The new management brought in to sort out the mess left by Hill Samuel will not want to suffer the same fate as its predecessors. But TSB's chosen specialisations require relatively little capital. That applies not only to insurance, but also to mortgage lending, which requires only half the capital backing of ordinary commercial credit business. In terms of operating profit, TSB's strategy may pay off only slowly. The bank has no alternative but to bid up for retail deposits as it cannot expect to retain the low-cost funds on which it depended in pre-privatisation days. The 80 per cent jump in insurance income during the first half will not necessarily be repeated. Part of it reflected the buoyancy of the stock market and part the first significant contribution from general insurance. Nor will costs necessarily continue to fall. But unlike other banks whose capital ratios have suffered from the recession, TSB will not need large retentions from earnings to finance growth in the recovery. Its ability to increase its dividends should be correspondingly greater.</p>

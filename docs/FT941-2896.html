			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / BMW stays in front of rivals BMW has once again proved the leading light of the German automotive industry, according to figures released yesterday. Riding on the strength of a DM516m (Pounds 200m) net profit last year, and an unchanged dividend, the Munich-based performance car maker unveiled plans to raise around DM800m through a rights issue. Daimler-Benz, on the other hand, with more than three times the turnover of BMW, managed a net return of only DM600m, compared with DM1.45bn last time, according to Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman. A reduced dividend was not impossible, he told journalists in Berlin. Bringing up the rear, the troubled Volkswagen group came in as expected with a DM1.9bn loss, but maintained its DM2 payout as an indicator that the company was on the road to recovery. Surprise of the day was BMW's one-for-11 rights issue, approved at a meeting of the supervisory board, which includes two representatives of the majority stakeholding Quandt family, which will accordingly put up most of the new capital. The proposal for a nominal DM82m capital hike to DM984m, with the new ordinary shares priced at DM500 and preferred stock at DM365, will be put to the annual meeting on May 19. The new shares will carry full 1994 dividend rights, the company said. BMW's stock rose sharply in after-hours trading in Frankfurt yesterday. Although around DM10 down on the day at DM860, it was close to its recent record high. Although BMW's 1993 net earnings fell almost 30 per cent from DM726m in the previous year, the company said recently it expected an increase of 20 to 30 per cent this year, excluding any profits from the Rover group, just purchased for Pounds 800m. Last year's profits at the German parent, BMW AG, rose marginally to DM452m. The company repeated yesterday that it had no need of a rights issue to finance the Rover deal, struck at a price equivalent to the development costs of a single new model. Observers said with long-term interest rates tending upwards, and BMW stock so much in favour, the issue was a sensible step.</p>

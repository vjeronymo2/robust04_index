			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: K.D. LANG "ABSOLUTE TORCH AND TWANG." SIRE *** 1/2: ALBUMS ARE  RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> On her third album, Lang takes a few jaunts accompanied by some venerable  ghosts of pop music past, the most spectacular result being a superlative  version of the Faron Young-Willie Nelson song "Three Days." Imagine Patsy Cline  seeing Judy Garland through the eyes of Billie Holiday (no joke) on this tune  about the utter self-abasement that can hit when love vanishes.  </P> <P> But Lang is only guided by those musical spirits, not possessed by them. While  she can summon up their emotional vulnerability, the difference for Lang is  that loss, no matter how painfully expressed in some of the songs here, never  gives way to despair. The tone is set in the opening tune, "Luck in My Eyes,"  which Lang delivers with a sense of inner strength that hovers over even the  most downtrodden tales that follow. Through the record's Western  swing/honky-tonk musical milieu, Lang taps into characters who, like the  frontier women of old, mostly know what they want and know how to get it.

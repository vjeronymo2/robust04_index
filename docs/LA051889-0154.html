			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BEACH DESEGREGATED, S. AFRICA ANNOUNCES  </P> <P> The segregated beach where mixed-race parliamentary leader Allan Hendrickse  swam in defiance of apartheid two years ago has been opened to all races, an  official said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Provincial governor Gene Louw announced his decision to desegregate the beach  in Port Elizabeth three days after President Pieter W. Botha named him  successor to Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis.  </P> <P> Louw last year overruled a decision by the Port Elizabeth City Council to open  its beaches to all races.  </P> <P> Hendrickse triggered a prolonged row with Botha on New Year's Day, 1987, when  he led a group of "colored" (mixed-race) lawmakers in a defiant swim from  King's Beach in a protest against apartheid and the segregation of public  facilities.  </P></p>

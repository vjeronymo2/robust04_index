			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Japan's economy to recover in 1993 on strong spending, OECD reports THE Japanese economy will stage a steady recovery next year, fuelled by a revival in consumer spending and strong public investment, according to the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development's annual survey of the Japanese economy. The survey predicts Japanese gross domestic product will grow by only 1.8 per cent this year, rising to 2.5 per cent next year before reaching the government's target of 3.5 per cent in 1994. Despite mounting bad loans at Japanese banks after the collapse of the bubble economy of the late 1980s, the report says there is no evidence Japanese companies are suffering a severe credit crunch imposed by banks. The trade surplus is forecast to reach Y137,000bn (Pounds 725bn) this year, rising to Y152,000bn next year. The current balance is likely to amount to 3.2 per cent of GDP next year. Despite anaemic money supply growth and sharp cuts in private sector capital investment, the OECD forecasts the Japanese economy will not suffer from a prolonged bout of slow growth because its capital stock is still growing at a rate likely to generate growth of about 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent a year over the next five years. This is likely to be 1 to 1.25 percentage points higher than the rest of the OECD. Japanese bank lending has contracted sharply in the last year but the OECD says this cannot be interpreted as the start of a credit squeeze as banks reduce lending to offset debts. The report says that the contraction in bank lending may be offset by increased lending from other financial institutions. The banks might strengthen their balance sheets by issuing more long-term debt, allowing them to expand lending. The main impact of more restrictive bank lending and the collapse in the Tokyo stock market has been to increase the cost of capital for Japanese companies, despite an increase in the rate of Japanese household savings. Japanese companies find it more expensive to raise capital than their US competitors, reversing the trend of the late 1980s when Japanese companies had significant cost advantages over American rivals. The report accepts much of the Japanese Finance Ministry's argument that there is limited room for further fiscal stimulus through tax cuts or higher public spending, despite a large general government surplus. The OECD says that, if the rapid ageing of the population and rise in the cost of the pension system are taken into account, the general government financial balance would be in unsustainable deficit. It also warns that cuts in current spending to offset sharp decline in tax revenues, which the government is considering for the 1993 budget, would not be justified as the drop in tax revenues reflects strong revenue growth during the boom from 1988 to 1990. Japanese keiretsu, groupings of companies with cross-shareholdings - attracting considerable criticism in the US for allegedly restricting foreign companies' access to the Japanese market - may be efficient because they give managers more scope for long-term planning, the report says. It calls for a significant tightening of regulation of securities markets as well as further liberalisation to eliminate collusive relationships between brokers and their clients.

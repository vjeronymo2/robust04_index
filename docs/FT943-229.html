			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Three ministries keep Treasury axe at bay The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland offices appear to have beaten off attempts by Treasury officials to reduce their budgets in this year's public expenditure round. Amid signs that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will announce big cuts in public spending in his November Budget, the Treasury is understood to have conducted an intense examination of the spending programmes of each of the three territorial departments. But senior officials at the departments said this week that they expected their grants would be upgraded in line with inflation and that few individual programmes would be scaled back. 'We now know that our grant will not be radically different,' said a Scottish Office official, confirming that the department had strongly resisted changes to a basic formula by which it receives an allocation which is a proportion of relevant spending in England. An official at the Northern Ireland Office also claimed that Mr Jonathan Aitken, the chief secretary to the Treasury, was unlikely to press ahead with cuts in the department's budget during delicate negotiations over a political settlement in the province. 'We reckon that Jonathan Aitken is very astute, and would recognise the problems if the Treasury goes in too strong here and cuts areas that are politically sensitive,' he said. In the annual public spending round, total provision for each of the three territorial departments is adjusted in line with the size of comparable programmes in England, such as education, housing and health. The population of each territory is also taken into account. Last year, Scotland received 10.66 per cent of England's grant, Wales 6.02 per cent and Northern Ireland 2.87 per cent. As in previous years, Treasury officials are understood to have called for changes in these percentages, but appear to have failed. 'The formula arrangements as they apply to Scotland will continue,' said one official, adding that it would be prone to marginal adjustments because of population change. Officials at the Northern Ireland office said this week that the Treasury had again tried to run all three departments on a straight per capita basis, ignoring the special circumstances created by the security situation in Ulster. It is understood that the cost of maintaining Northern Ireland's prisons and paying compensation to victims of terrorist attacks have been regularly examined in talks between the department and the Treasury.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / How to Spend It: Small and upwardly mobile I have always been ambivalent about mobile phones. Once thought of as irredeemably naff, they are, I am forced to admit, terribly useful. Never mind swanky conversations with stockbrokers or secretaries, it is when one breaks down on a motorway at night, is late for a lunch-date or stuck in a traffic jam, that the mobile phone takes much of the stress out of the situation. If you are not sold on the idea of the mobile, Cellnet (to which system the phone is connected) offers another incentive to fibbers. 'A mobile,' Cellnet tells us in a little oeuvre dealing with the modern etiquette problem of mobile manners, 'is genuinely mobile; subscribers get a number which cannot be traced by its dialling code. The possibilities are limitless: a schiatsu massage - coupled with a weekend at a country house hotel - might easily pass for an afternoon of auditing at the family accountant. With a mobile you are never out of touch.' So now you know. The new Sony mobile telephone, the smallest yet devised, addresses my main objection - their high visibility. The Sony version is smaller than a pack of playing cards which means it will fit a shirt pocket or a woman's handbag. It has a small earpiece (much like the Sony Walkman) so that the booming tones that people on the other end of mobiles are prone to use are inaudible to all except the user. It also seems - at about Pounds 450 if you pay full retail price - to be about the most expensive yet devised but if you shop around you can, I am told, find it for Pounds 200. It weighs just 185 grammes, the battery gives 60 minutes talking time and 14 hours of standby time. It takes about 50 minutes to recharge with a rapid charger and it can be adapted for use in the car.</p>

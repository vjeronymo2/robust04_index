			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Wide discounts expected in Indian GDR sector  -International offerings A dearth of supply and the strength of the domestic equity market have underpinned Indian global depository receipts (GDRs) in recent weeks, but that trend could be reversed when issuance picks up in September. Indian issuers will need to continue pricing new issues generously if they want to attract international capital. 'It's still very much a buyers' market,' says a London equity salesman specialising in Indian products. 'In September we'll probably see more GDRs issued at market discounts.' A GDR is a receipt, issued in registered form by a depository bank, representing ownership of shares held in custody in the equity issuer's home market. GDRs and underlying shares are usually fungible but trade independently. A flood of GDRs in the first half of the year caused new paper to be priced at increasing discounts to the domestic market. On the last issues to emerge in late July, discounts widened to around 30 per cent. This month, issuance has ground to a halt due to the summer lull and the weight of undigested supply. Meanwhile, the underlying stock market rallied, pushing the Bombay Stock Exchange Index to a new high. All this, together with strong US buying in the secondary GDR market, has supported the sector, allowing discounts to shrink. 'The GDR market is not very attractive at current levels,' says Mr Jeff Chowdhry, who runs the Dollars 530m India Fund for BZW Investment Management. 'Many issues are trading at fair value or at a premium, and the prospect of more supply suggests the market is likely to come in for profit-taking.' The underlying stock market, too, may be in for a correction. 'The recent rise occurred on fairly thin volume,' says the salesman, adding that stocks heavily weighted in the index 'performed particularly well, pushing the index up, but that may not reflect the market as a whole'. Another source of weakness among secondary GDRs may be investors reshuffling their portfolios, taking profits on recent issues and clearing the deck for upcoming supply. Dealers say around 20 issues have been mandated for launch before the year-end, totalling between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn. 'There are an awful lot of issues in the pipeline - they probably won't all make it,' says a London syndicate official. On the other hand, companies needing to raise cash quickly may offer substantial discounts to do so. Faced with this heavy supply, investors are expected to be increasingly selective. 'They can afford to be choosy and go for the better quality names,' says one syndicate official. Some of the more talked-about companies include motorcycle manufacturer Bajaj Auto with its planned Dollars 150m issue, and the Dollars 150m deal for engineering firm Larsen &amp; Toubro. Whether India's international telecommunications monopoly Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) will brave the market this year remains to be seen. Its planned Dollars 1bn privatisation issue was pulled in early May after it failed to get the desired price. 'We're in regular talks with the government and investors are still very interested,' said Mr Derrick Chow of the equity capital markets team at Kleinwort Benson. 'Everyone wants to do it, but at the right price.' KB's and Salomon Brothers' mandate to lead-manage the VSNL issue expires at the end of the year. There is some market talk that VSNL may return with a smaller offering. While he declines to comment on the likely size of the issue, Mr Chow says: 'We have to be sensitive to investor sentiment - we don't want to overload the market.'</p>

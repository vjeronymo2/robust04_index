			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Khristo Bardaliev: "I Had a Bad Dream About </F> You, Dancho"]    [Text] The ways of Bulgarian democracy are strange indeed.  In the name of some half-understood values and principles that  allegedly guide modern society, we Bulgarians have been  consciously dismantling our state for five years now. Now, all  kinds of "parties" and organizations are unfurling their banners  that are not only unconstitutional (and for that reason  unregistered) but even openly declare that it is part of their  program to split Bulgaria into an unknown number of components.    The Ilinden OMO [Ilinden United Macedonian Organization] is  especially active in this respect. Despite not having any  evident support in the Pirin region and being split into three  mutually warring factions at the moment, the Ilinden members  have the effrontery to give news conferences in the center of  Sofia and to explain to the amazed fraternity of journalists  what words like nation, minority, racism, and genocide really  mean.    However, Ilinden OMO Chairman Yordan Ivanov committed a  grave  mistake. He demanded that the Bulgarian authorities, the army  included, should pull out of the Pirin region, and then  proceeded to utter threats against the Bulgarian majority in  this region.    This proves that the gentleman in question really does not  know his history, because when the official powers have  withdrawn, this will leave only the structures of the VMRO-SMD  (Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of  Macedonian Societies, a pro-Bulgarian organization] there.    As they say in these parts, "I had a bad dream about you,  Dancho."</p>

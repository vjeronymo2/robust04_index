These revisions were submitted to EPA through the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (FDER) on January 8, 1993, and revise regulations for Stage I vapor recovery (Stage I) in Florida's SIP and add regulations pertaining to Stage II vapor recovery (Stage II). This plan has been submitted by the FDER to satisfy the requirement of section 182(b)(3) of the 1990 Clean Air Act, which requires all ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or above to require owners and operators of gasoline dispensing facilities to install and operate Stage II vapor recovery systems. FDER has also submitted this plan as an integral part of the program to achieve and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. EPA proposed approval of these revisions on December 14, 1993, (58 FR 65307), and no comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations meet all of EPA's requirements for Stage II programs and therefore EPA is approving the SIP revisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule will be effective April 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of the material submitted by Florida may be examined during normal business hours at the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Region IV Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, 345 Courtland Street, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Twin Towers Office Building, 2600 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida 32399&hyph;2400. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Protection Agency, Air Docket, 6102, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Alan W.

The Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA) includes new requirements for the improvement of air quality in ozone nonattainment areas. Under section 181(a) of the CAA, nonattainment areas were categorized by the severity of the area's ozone problem, and progressively more stringent control measures were required for each category of higher ozone concentrations. The basis for classifying an area in a specific category was the ambient air quality data obtained in the three year period 1987&hyph;1989. The CAA delineates in section 182 the SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment areas based on their classifications. Specifically, section 182(b)(3) requires areas classified as moderate to implement Stage II controls unless and until EPA promulgates On Board Vapor Recovery (OBVR) regulations pursuant to section 202(a)(6) of the CAA. Based on consultation with the National Highway Transportation Safety Board, EPA determined that OBVR were unsafe and therefore moderate areas must implement a Stage II program. On January 22, 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that EPA's previous decision not to require OBVR controls be set aside and that OBVR regulations be promulgated pursuant to section 202(a)(6) of the CAA. Subsequently, EPA reached a settlement with the plaintiffs which required EPA to promulgate final regulations by January 22, 1994. After such promulgation, moderate areas will not be required to implement Stage II regulations, but Florida has indicated that the State intends to continue Stage II as part of its long term maintenance plan. The EPA Administrator signed the OBVR final rule on January 24, 1994. Under section 182(b)(3), EPA was required to issue guidance as to the effectiveness of Stage II systems. In November 1991, EPA issued technical and enforcement guidance to meet this requirement. These two documents are entitled ``Technical Guidance-Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Control of Vehicle Refueling Emissions at Gasoline Dispensing Facilities'' (EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;91&hyph;022) and ``Enforcement Guidance for Stage II Vehicle Refueling Control Programs.'' In addition, on April 16, 1992, EPA published the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990'' (57 FR 13498). The guidance documents and the General Preamble discuss Stage II statutory requirements and indicate what EPA believes a State submittal needs to include to meet those requirements. The Florida regulations meet those requirements and are discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 17&hyph;252, Gasoline Vapor Recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Stage II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Southeast Florida Air Quality region is designated nonattainment for ozone and classified as moderate. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.300 through 81.437. Under section 182(b)(3) of the CAA, Florida was required to submit Stage II vapor recovery rules for this area by November 15, 1992. On January 8, 1993, FDER submitted to EPA Stage II vapor recovery rules that were adopted by the State on December 9, 1992, and the rules became state effective January 21, 1993. The Florida regulation meets all EPA requirements (see proposal, December 14, 1993, 58 FR 65307). Additional information is contained in the Technical Support Document (TSD) which is available for review in the EPA Region IV office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Stage I <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Stage I regulations have been amended to require Stage I vapor recovery at all facilities subject to the Stage II requirements in areas which are designated as a nonattainment or maintenance area for ozone under Rule 17&hyph;275, F.A.C. (Broward, Dade, Duval, Hillsborough, Palm Beach, and Pinellas Counties). The gasoline tanker truck section was also revised to require submerged filling at bulk plants and facilities required to have Stage I and II vapor recovery. These revisions are consistent with EPA policy and requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is approving the above referenced revisions as meeting the requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the CAA. All of the revisions are consistent with EPA guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This document makes final the action proposed at (58 FR 65307). As noted elsewhere in this document, EPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 2 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by May 23,1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small non-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Nitrogen dioxide, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations, Ozone, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald J.

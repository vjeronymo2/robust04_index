			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: MORE EXCITING DRUG BREAKTHROUGHS FORESEEN FOR 1990S  </P> <P> The drug breakthroughs during the last decade have been extraordinary, but the  outlook for the 1990s is even more exciting.  </P> <P> Looking back over the past 10 years, we have seen a revolution in ulcer  therapy. The most successful drugs of the '80s were Zantac (ranitidine) and  Tagamet (cimetidine) -- both topped annuals sales of a billion dollars, the  first drugs in history to do so.  </P> <P> Blood pressure control became easier with the development of two new classes of  medicine. The ACE enzyme inhibitors Capoten (captopril) and Vasotec (enalapril)  along with the calcium antagonists Cardizem (diltiazem), Procardia (nifedipine)  and Calan and Isoptin (verapamil) have given physicians valuable new tools in  their fight against hypertension.  </P> <P> Clot busters like Activase and Streptase are reversing heart attacks that would  have killed or crippled people 10 years ago. And new research showed that an  old drug, aspirin, could dramatically reduce the risk of heart attacks.  </P> <P> Sexually transmitted diseases captured headlines during the decade just past.  First herpes, then AIDS stimulated drug researchers to develop Zovirax  (acyclovir) and Retrovir (zidovudine or AZT). Although these drugs aren't  cures, they proved that antiviral drug development has promise.  </P> <P> New antidepressants like Prozac (fluoxetine) and Wellbutrin (bupropion) offered  relief without the usual side effects. And non-sedating antihistamines like  Seldane (terfenadine) and Hismanal (astemizole) allowed allergy victims relief  without drowsiness.  </P> <P> Finally, the baby boom generation woke up to discover that it was aging.  Rogaine Topical Solution (minoxidil) disproved the dermatological dogma that  baldness was irreversible. And the acne medicine Retin-A undid excess sun  exposure by reversing wrinkles.  </P> <P> But as exciting as the '80s were for pharmaceutical innovation, the 1990s offer  even greater breakthroughs.  </P> <P> Millions of men with enlarged prostate glands may benefit from Proscar  (finasteride), a drug that may also prove beneficial against male pattern  baldness and acne.  </P> <P> Drug companies are aggressively pursuing treatments for Alzheimer's disease and  other brain disorders of aging.  </P> <P> Lazaroids (named after the biblical character Lazarus who rose from the dead)  represent an exciting new class of compounds that may preserve the heart and  brain from injury during a heart attack or stroke.  </P> <P> Other conditions that may yield to new therapies include osteoporosis, migraine  headaches, schizophrenia, arthritis, asthma and heart disease. If researchers  are able to deliver on a fraction of the promising agents now in development, a  new age of drug breakthroughs lies ahead.  </P></p>

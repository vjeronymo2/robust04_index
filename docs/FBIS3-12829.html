			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat held a press conference at  the conclusion of their two-hour talks last evening.    'Arafat opened the conference by saying: I extend my  heartfelt thanks to President Husni Mubarak, who is standing  firmly and strongly with the Palestinian people, their cause,  and their sanctities.    'Arafat expressed his appreciation of the firm stance Egypt  has taken with the Palestinian people vis-a-vis the heinous  massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. I have asked President  Mubarak to make efforts with all the parties concerned in the UN  Security Council to follow up on this matter, he said, adding:  I discussed this matter with Minister 'Amr Musa.    On resuming the peace negotiations, 'Arafat said: We cannot  talk about negotiations until we see what the situation will be  like at the Security Council and until we see the resolution it  will adopt. We insist on full condemnation of this heinous  crime, international protection for our people, and disarming  settlement inhabitants, he stressed.    'Arafat emphasized the need for protecting the Palestinian  people, emphasizing that withdrawing settlers from Hebron is  essential because these settlements are dangerous. He added  that the Israeli Government must take effective and swift  measures to control the settlers, because this is its  responsibility.    Answering a question on the outcome of the talks his  adviser,  Dr. Nabil Sha'th, held in the United States, 'Arafat said: We  hope the United States will take a clear-cut stance to urge the  Security Council to issue a resolution--this is very important  for the occupied territories, particularly Jerusalem--to disarm  settlers and provide international protection for the  Palestinians.    'Arafat added that the most important thing is to determine  the party that will take charge of protecting Palestinians,  because we have an army [as received] to protect the  Palestinians from these settlers.    'Arafat affirmed that units of the Israeli Army were  involved  in the massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque.    Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa remarked that the situation is  too  serious to be addressed in a sentimental manner. The matter  needs specific measures, he emphasized.    The foreign minister underlined the need for the UN Security  Council to issue a resolution and enforce certain measures to  protect the Palestinians against aggression by the Israeli  settlers.    Speaking about the minimum Palestinian demands, Musa said  that President 'Arafat has already stated this clearly: a UN  Security Council resolution and certain measures to guarantee  protection for the Palestinians and their safety. The  settlements cannot be left the way they are now because this  will lead to a repetition of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident,  Musa said, hoping the Security Council will adopt a resolution  as soon as possible.    The UN Security Council resolution must involve the minimum  Palestinian demands that are supported by the Arab states and  the international community, he stressed. We are very upset at  the delay in issuing a resolution because the Hebron incident  cannot pass without taking specific measures to avert a  recurrence and in the meantime protect the Palestinians in  accordance with the international resolutions that should be  respected, he emphasized.    The foreign minister reiterated that all are acting to issue  a resolution and enforce certain measures to protect the  Palestinians. We have expressed our regrets and our denunciation  of what happened in Hebron, he said, adding that the issue of  Palestinian protection and settlers must be taken into  consideration.    Musa pointed out that as an occupying force, Israel is fully  responsible for protecting the Palestinians according to the 4th  Geneva agreement. He said that the West Bank and Gaza are under  Israeli occupation, according to UN Security Council Resolution  242.</p>

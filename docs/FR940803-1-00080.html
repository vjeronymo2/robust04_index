			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Surface water withdrawals constitute a small percentage of the total water used within the western sections of the historic range of the Arkansas River shiner, primarily because of the limited number of impoundments and elevated levels of chlorides. However, natural flows in the Cimarron River upstream of Waynoka, Oklahoma, are affected by several diversions for irrigation. Dewatering and reduced base flows because of groundwater and surface water withdrawals is considered a significant, ongoing threat to the Arkansas River shiner in southwestern Kansas, northwestern Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle (Larson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1991, Cross  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1985).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water quality in the Canadian River in Texas generally declines as the river flows eastward. The Canadian River traverses oil and gas producing areas and receives municipal sewage effluent and manufacturing return flows, all of which degrade water quality (Texas Department of Water Resources 1984). Water quality degradation is believed to have suppressed Arkansas River shiner populations within affected reaches of the Canadian River. Water quality within the Canadian River begins to improve as the river flows through the sparsely populated counties in western Oklahoma. Poor water quality in the North Canadian River near Oklahoma City and in the Arkansas River at Tulsa are also believed to have contributed to localized declines in Arkansas River shiner populations. The North Canadian River from western Oklahoma City downstream to Eufaula Reservoir is considered to be the most nutrient-enriched stream in Oklahoma (Pigg  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992). The Arkansas River shiner has not been found in this section of the North Canadian River since 1975 (Pigg 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Lake Meredith Salinity Control Project is designed to control brine seeping into the Canadian River from a brine aquifer in New Mexico. The project could have an effect on the quantity and quality of flow in the Canadian River between Ute Dam near Logan, New Mexico and Lake Meredith in Texas. The impacts of this project on Arkansas River shiner populations have not yet been determined. Arkansas River shiner populations in this 219 km (136 mi) reach of the Canadian River are isolated from other populations by Ute and Meredith reservoirs. Flow reductions in this reach could severely deplete, or possibly extirpate, these populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Though not selectively harvested as a bait species, the inadvertent collection of Arkansas River shiners during harvest of commercial bait species may limit population growth. While some harvest of bait species, either for commercial or personal consumptive uses, occurs in New Mexico and Texas, the greatest threat to Arkansas River shiner from overutilization occurs in the State of Oklahoma.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1985, the Cimarron and South Canadian rivers produced over 55 percent of the bait fish harvested in Oklahoma, providing over 20,846 kilograms (kg) (45,958 pounds (lbs)) of fish (Peterson 1986). Plains minnow ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hybognathus placidus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), which may reach total lengths of 127 mm (5 in), was the primary species reported harvested by the commercial minnow dealers. In 1991, the Cimarron and South Canadian rivers produced over 50 percent of the bait fish harvested in Oklahoma, providing over 25,118 kg (55,376 lbs) of fish (Peterson 1992). Plains minnow was again reported to be the primary species harvested. Although the percent of the total poundage harvested from the Cimarron and South Canadian rivers has declined slightly since 1985, the amount, by weight, of fish harvested has increased by over 20 percent. Within the last 10 years (1980&hyph;81 to 1991), the percent of the total harvest taken from the South Canadian and Cimarron rivers has varied from 67 percent in 1982 (Peterson and Weeks 1983) to 46 percent in 1989 (Larson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1991). The amount of fish taken varied from over 37,762 kg (83,252 lbs) in 1982 to 19,147 kg (42,213 lbs) in 1989. The lists of species harvested did not include Arkansas River shiners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

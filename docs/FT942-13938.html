			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Observer: Fat tome Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor, is somewhat selective about his counter-inflation policy. Take his current finance bill. The original version, printed before the line-by-line committee stage, ran to 417 pages and cost Pounds 27.30. The version which finally cleared the Commons on Wednesday night - at 452 pages  -costs Pounds 29.45. When the changes made by MPs during the report stage are taken into account, the version sent to the House of Lords for formal approval on April 29 may be even pricier. Not many jokes in it, either.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL STATE PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> DIVISION IV  </P> <P> Santa Clara 77, Laguna Beach 48 -- After a 140-mile trip to Ventura College,  the Artists never got on track and lost to the defending state champions.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach (23-7) went 11 minutes 30 seconds from the end of the first  quarter until the opening minutes of the third quarter without scoring a field  goal and fell behind, 38-12.  </P> <P> Guard Shon Tarver scored Santa Clara's first 12 points and then put on a show,  scoring 39 points on a variety of drives, dunks and three-point shots.  </P> <P> Tarver, who has narrowed his college choices to Notre Dame, Nevada Las Vegas,  UCLA, Syracuse and Georgia Tech, made 15 of 24 shots and was five of eight at  the free-throw line. Tarver's final basket was his most spectacular, a dunk off  an alley-oop pass before he left the game with 4:19 remaining.  </P> <P> Santa Clara (26-0), which hasn't lost a game since losing to Huntington Beach  Edison in December of 1988, won its 32nd in a row.

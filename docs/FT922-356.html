			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / The Lisbon Summit: EC contest over cash ends in draw THE contest at the Lisbon summit over fiscal transfers from richer to poorer EC states ended in a draw between the north and the south of the Community. The north managed to keep any figures on budgetary commitments out of the summit conclusions, but the south defeated an attempt to extend the prospective increases over a longer period. The main protagonists were Spain, as standard-bearer of the 'cohesion' countries which include Ireland, Portugal and Greece, and the UK, which led resistance to the doubling of the EC's regional and cohesion spending called for by the European Commission. The UK, which takes over the EC presidency this week, will now have to craft a compromise on future financing for December's Edinburgh summit. Its obduracy in Lisbon caused Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, to remove his own compromise from the table. Britain, with one hand tied behind its back by a presidential role which demands conciliation, will thus have to start again from the full 'Delors II' package. That package calls for an increase of nearly a third in EC revenue, from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 46.75bn) now to Ecu87.5bn in 1997 at today's prices. Half the increase is for the Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund set up at Maastricht for the four poorest states. Combined funding for the two instruments would rise from Ecu18.6bn to Ecu29.3bn in 1997. In response to hostility from the north, Mr Delors had suggested the EC revenue ceiling be held at its current level (of 1.2 per cent of combined gross national product) for two more years, and then moved to his original target of 1.37 of GNP in the five years to 1999. This would provide 'a rate of growth in Community assistance of the same order of magnitude as that established in . . . 1988 to 1992', said the draft compromise. The Structural Funds were doubled during that period, so this would commit the EC to a new doubling. But the UK, with Germany and the Netherlands, managed to excise this commitment and replace it with an undefined 'increase appropriate to reflect the Maastricht commitments.' 'Unsatisfactory', said Spain's prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez, making seven syllables of the word in case colleagues were hard of hearing. He got vigorous support from his cohesion allies, sympathy from France, and, Spanish and German officials suggest, some undisclosed advice from Chancellor Helmut Kohl. With Maastricht itself now at stake, many EC officials are looking for further movement in Bonn and Madrid to clear the financial impasse. The UK's position will be further complicated by its need to defend the special annual budget rebate it won in 1984, which has to be reviewed in the new package.</p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Growth seen for final quarter of 1991 MOST BRITISH industrialists do not expect economic growth to resume until the final three months of this year, and when the recovery arrives it will be very gradual. That sober assessment of the economic outlook among leading industrialists will be confirmed this week by two business surveys. The industrialists' prognosis - which has emerged from recent company reporting for 1990 - was borne out by mixed economic indicators in the past week, suggesting the economy is delicately poised between fragile recovery and continuing recession. The first signs of a thaw in the housing market, with housebuilders reporting rising sales and faint glimmers of a recovery in the high street, were offset by a steep fall in bank lending for March and a record monthly rise in unemployment to more than 2m. The Engineering Employers Federation will this week raise its forecast for job losses in the year ahead and predict that a discernible recovery will be delayed until the middle of next year. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce quarterly survey published this week will report a rise in business confidence offset by recent falls in output, home orders and investment among its 8,000 members. The CBI's annual survey of innovation will show that almost 40 per cent of companies regard this investment in innovation as inadequate. Mr Gary Allen, chief executive of IMI, the Midlands engineering group, summed up the caution about the economic prospects: 'For us the earliest an upturn can come is the final quarter of the year.' Mr Bruce Farmer, chief executive of Morgan Crucible, the industrial materials manufacturer said: 'There are the first signs of growth trickling through the dam of recession, but it is a trickle.' According to Mr David Lees, chairman and chief executive of GKN, the automotive components group, trading conditions weakened in the first months of the year. The car industry is concerned that tax changes introduced in the Budget may stifle recovery later this year. Mr Sid Taylor, chief operating officer of TI, the specialist engineering products group, said: 'The UK will remain very tough this year.' Manufacturers hope a resurgence of US business confidence following the Gulf war, combined with continuing growth in Germany, will help lead the UK out of recession. Today's FT-CBI distributive trades survey suggests a weak rally in trade may be under way, with sales in March above last year's levels. However, retailers are concerned the rally may have been caused by consumers seeking to beat the April 1 rise in VAT from 15 per cent to 17.5 per cent. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI distributive trades panel, said: 'The prospects indicate that there could be a slow and gradual recovery, tempered by rising unemployment and relatively high interest rates.'

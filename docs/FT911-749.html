			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Acquiring a new taste in coatings MACHINERY used in the production of food is likely to come under strict scrutiny in the next few months with government restrictions on the use of mineral hydrocarbons for direct and indirect inclusion in foodstuffs. More widely known as white oil and liquid paraffin, these hydrocarbons are used as a wax covering for cheese rinds and a coating on dried fruits as wells a lubricant in machines - such as for oiling the chutes down which food tumbles. As an alternative Rocol, of Leeds, has developed a range of machinery lubricants based on the glyceride and ester families. (Esters are organic compounds produce when acids react with alcohol.) The lubricants will be available from July. Rocol: UK, 0532 866511.</p>

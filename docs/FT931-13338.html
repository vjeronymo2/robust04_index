			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Books: Chinese puzzle CHINESE ROUNDABOUT: ESSAYS IN HISTORY AND CULTURE by Jonathan D. Spence WW Norton &amp; Co, Pounds 15.95, 400 pages WHEN Montesquieu declared 'I believe that we will never completely understand the Chinese', over a century had passed since the first sustained western contacts with China. The admiration of the early visitors had been tempered by disillusion, but misunderstanding persisted. Despite the subsequent growth of Chinese studies and increased contact, misperceptions remain today. This '400 year old history of confusion' is one of Jonathan Spence's favourite themes. In the first section of this collection of essays he discusses people who managed to penetrate the confusion - notably Sidney Gamble, a 20th-century sinologist and photographer - and others who, despite their efforts, were part of it: Montesquieu's Chinese acquaintance in Paris, Arcadio Huang; the Jesuit scholar and confidant of the Chinese emperor, Matteo Ricci; the 16th century Portuguese traveller, Mendes Pinto; and Andre Malraux and his literary contemporaries. These are delightful and subtle portraits. Like Gamble's photographs, they catch 'the evanescent moment in which a particular face, a gesture, a juxtaposition of elements, comes to be more than itself and to speak for a whole time and culture.' Spence rejoices in details - the size of Arcadio Huang's conjugal bed, for example - and unexpected explanations. Grammar, he suggests, was the cause of Ricci's initial happiness in China. On leaving India Ricci no longer had to teach Greek, a highly inflected language, and found the study of Chinese, which has 'no articles, no cases, no number, no gender, no tense, no mood', much more enjoyable. But what distinguishes Spence is not his recognition of the complexity of Chinese culture, for others have accepted this. Rather it lies in his refusal to be baffled by China, having accepted that complexity is not a bar to understanding. These self-selected essays manifest his determination 'to think about China with precision . . . and to be fair and thorough.' Confrontation with a new culture is a disorientating experience. The first few hundred years of Buddhism in China were marked by an attempt to ease understanding of the new religion by linking its ideas and practices with Daoism, an indigenous Chinese tradition. A similar process took place in the early years of Christianity in China, shown in Ricci's Buddhist robes and his retelling of Bible stories for Chinese consumption. But later Buddhists and Christians realised that, in stressing the similarities with native systems, differences were often forgotten and an accurate understanding of the new religion was not possible. The cliches which abound in western literature on China are a result of trying to explain China in Western terms. Spence challenges the cliches and presents a more sophisticated view in which differences are not distorted or glossed over. Speaking of the values expressed by an elderly Chinese philosopher he writes, 'we may not accept or approve of them, but it is hard to deny that there was something truly worth saying at the centre of his being.' Although the essays are grouped thematically rather than chronologically, those in the first section, on cross-cultural interaction, and the fourth, on post-1949 China, contain Spence's most recent and most confident work. While the portraits are enthusiastic, the tributes to his various teachers express respect and admiration for people who also refused to be baffled. The only piece in the other sections which rivals these in depth of feeling is 'Tiananmen', written after the events of June 4, 1989. The remaining sections contain a miscellany of lectures and book reviews. They cover subjects as diverse as the cost of an imperial dinner, the 19th-century debate on whether to prohibit or legalise opium, and the importance of tradition in 20th-century political debates, displaying Spence's self-admitted and welcome 'hare-brained eclecticism' although lacking the sparkle of the rest. In his essays Spence, like the 16th century Dominican friar Gaspar da Cruz, has sought 'those elusive elements that would give the complete picture of China'. Many others have done the same over the past four centuries. Spence, however, remains one of the few to realise the impossibility of the task.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOUSANDS FLEE AFGHAN BATTLE, REBELS REPORT  </P> <P> Thousands of refugees fleeing from fighting around the eastern Afghan city of  Jalalabad have arrived in Pakistan and as many as 30,000 more are streaming  toward the border, Afghan rebels said Monday.  </P> <P> Mullah Torkhani, a guerrilla who returned to Pakistan from the Jalalabad area  Monday, said that crowds of old men, children and women clutching babies and  bundles of possessions are heading toward the Khyber Pass on the frontier.  </P> <P> Drivers are finding it difficult to use the highway, which is mostly controlled  by the moujahedeen guerrillas, because of refugees on the road, other rebels  said.  </P> <P> Thousands of Afghans from in and around Jalalabad have already crossed into  Pakistan to escape what Kabul government officials have described as the  heaviest fighting of the 10-year-old war.  </P> <P> The Western-backed rebels launched their assault on Jalalabad a week ago. They  are eager to capture a major Afghan city to gain credibility for the  provisional government they chose at a congress in Pakistan last month.  </P> <P> The forces of Afghan President Najibullah's Soviet-backed government responded  with heavy bombing and shelling and say they halted the rebel advance. Rebel  sources said that fighting continued Monday but at a much lower level.  </P> <P> The sources said the guerrillas were two to three miles from the city center  but much closer to the airport, a center of heavy fighting for several days.  </P> <P> Most of the latest refugees are members of families who had supported the  Soviet-backed government, the rebels said.  </P> <P> In Kabul, the Afghan capital, a spokesman said the government's forces routed a  moujahedeen ground offensive to capture Jalalabad but that retreating rebels  were pounding the city with shells and rockets.  </P></p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Sport: Lack of depth in the women's game - Tennis Today Steffi Graf, the 24-year-old German, and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain, two years younger, meet in the final of the Ford Australian Open, the first grand slam championship of 1994. For both it will be an important occasion, the first real test for either at a meeting where the average women's standard has been disappointingly thin. Graf has lost just 26 games in the six matches that have brought her to a fifth final here in Melbourne, three of which have ended in victory. Sanchez, who has lost at the semi-final stage for the last three years, has conceded one set and 38 games in reaching the final for the first time. These two, the current leaders of the women's game in the absence of the reigning champion Monica Seles, have played each other 26 times since 1988. Steffi has won 21 of those matches, including a semi-final victory here last year. But three of Arantxa's five wins have been at the grand slams, two in Paris and one in New York. The first of those French wins came unexpectedly in 1989 when Arantxa, a bubbling 17-year-old who chased every ball with exuberance, revealed an uncertainty in Graf's game that has been apparent since on the great occasions. The second French win, an amazing 6-0 6-2 semi-final victory, occurred two years later. It was the first 6-0 set that Graf had lost in five years and came at a time when Steffi was going through family problems concerning her father, Peter, on whom she had always depended. These days Graf is altogether more independent. She looks fitter and faster than she did last year and is hitting the ball harder than ever thanks to a new compression moulded graphite racket. Yet there is still a doubt about Graf's ability to maintain her attacking game against a scrambler of the class of Sanchez. Two of their matches stand out. The first, at the US Open in 1992, on a surface similar to that in use in Melbourne, was full of German frailty. The number of unforced errors Graf committed that day brought her a 7-6 6-3 defeat. It was the same last year on Florida clay at the Lipton Championships where Sanchez simply allowed Graf to hit herself to a 6-4 3-6 6-3 defeat. Steffi's coach Heinz Gunthardt could hardly believe what he had seen. 'She seemed determined to lose,' he said after. While recognising Graf's wonderful record in the grand slams - this is her 22nd final of which she has won 14 - the pressure on the athletic German is growing as Seles' return to competition draws nearer. (The best guess is that Monica will play in Palm Springs next month.) Riding a streak of three consecutive grand slam wins, Steffi knows that her free ride atop the computer is about to end. This knowledge might work to the advantage of Sanchez. If the Spaniard can return Graf's serve with interest, as she did during those wins in Florida and New York, then she could win. If, however, the Spaniard stops believing in herself for an instant and stops playing positively, she will be swept away on a tide of German aggression. The lack of real depth in women's tennis is worrying. It is hard to believe that there was only one American in the quarter-finals. Lindsay Davenport, 16th seed, is a tall, promising 17-year-old with the build of a basketball player and powerful groundstrokes. She was too inexperienced to worry Graf in the quarter-finals but the confident nature of her 6-2 6-7 6-2 win against fellow American Mary Joe Fernandez, seeded No 3 and twice a finalist here, was encouraging. With Jennifer Capriati away from the circuit for an indefinite period while she returns to school in search of a normal teenage existence, the game needs more talented Americans challenging for the top honours. Elsewhere the challenge was virtually non-existent. Kimiko Date, the winner against Fernandez in Sydney two weeks ago and the first Japanese semi-finalist here since 1973, was completely overawed against Graf in the semi-finals. Gabriela Sabatini, without a tournament win since the Italian Open in 1992, was equally ineffective against Sanchez in the other semi-final. In spite of her convincing win against Wimbledon finalist Jana Novotna in the previous round, Sabatini looked slow and unhappy with her game. Carlos Kirmayr, Sabatini's Brazilian coach, with whom she has resumed the successful partnership that brought her the 1990 US Open title, has much work to do - particularly on her serve which has become something of a liability. Tomorrow's men's final will pit top seeded Pete Sampras, the Wimbledon and US Open champion against the No 9 seed, Todd Martin, whose quarter-final appearance at last year's Wimbledon was his previous best grand slam performance. It will be the first final between two native born Americans. (South African-born Johan Kriek had just become an American citizen when he beat Steve Denton in 1982.) In the semi-finals, Martin revealed the inadequacy of Stefan Edberg's serve by blasting countless winning returns. He also served 13 aces to Edberg's six. Martin's 3-6 7-6 7-6 7-6 win was an awesome display of power hitting. In beating his old friend and doubles partner Jim Courier 6-3 6-4 6-4, Sampras was even more impressive. Courier, bidding to become the first man to win three times in a row since Roy Emerson put together five successive wins between 1963 and 1967, was simply outplayed. Sampras hit almost twice as many winners as Courier (42-22) and committed fewer unforced errors (17-21) in a performance of relentless aggression. Poor Courier. Hard as this dogged competitor tried, he was simply outgunned. Martin seems certain to share the same fate.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 2 MORE COUNTY HORSES SUCCUMB TO POISONING FROM TAINTED HAY  </P> <P> Two horses apparently stricken with a rare type of food poisoning from tainted  hay were destroyed in Orange County today as reports of sick horses continued  to stream in, authorities said.  </P> <P> One of the horses died early this morning at the Orange County Fairgrounds  Equestrian Center, bringing the total to nine that have succumbed to the deadly  toxin at the Costa Mesa facility.  </P> <P> The other horse died at the Serrano Creek Ranch Equestrian Center in San Juan  Capistrano, the first Orange County death outside of the fairgrounds.  </P> <P> Three more horses at the fairgrounds were taken ill Thursday and are being  treated with an experimental antiserum obtained from the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta.  </P> <P> State health officials this week blamed botulism for the deaths and ordered a  recall of nearly 1,000 tons of hay cubes believed to be the source of the  toxin. At least 18 horses in four Southern California counties have died as a  result of the illness, and many more are sick.  </P></p>

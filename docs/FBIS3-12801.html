			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Riyad Mansur] </F>   [Text] The collection of a million Palestinian signatures  to a memorandum calling for an end to negotiations with Israel,  unless it agrees to end all settlement activities and dismantle  all settlements, has started. The signatures of Palestine  National Council [PNC] members and national and popular figures  to a similar memorandum has also started to be collected. The  first memo, called "the National Consensus Document," was  prepared by the Habash-led Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [PFLP] and the Hawatimah-led Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] in the occupied Palestinian  territories. Its final draft was worked out yesterday after  consultations with the two fronts' leaders abroad. It reads as  follows:    The ugly crime and horrendous massacre against the  defenseless sons of our people in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, in  collusion with the occupation forces, is clear and unequivocal  evidence of the premeditated intentions against the sons of our  heroic Palestinian people and are meant to force them to  relinquish their legitimate rights. Accordingly, we in the  occupied Palestinian territories call for suspending the current  negotiations until the following conditions are met:    1. Israel's explicit agreement to halt all settlement  activities, expansion, and confiscation of lands.    2. A pledge to dismantle all settlements, considering them  illegal according to the international legitimacy resolutions.    3. Rebuilding the negotiations on the basis of the  resolutions of international legitimacy on the Palestine  question.    4. Providing direct international protection for our people  and their holy places, and forcing Israel to respect all  international charters and norms, the Fourth Geneva Convention,  and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.    The document stressed that withdrawing from the occupied  territories, guaranteeing our people's right to  self-determination and the establishment of their independent  state with Jerusalem as its capital, and implementing the  resolutions of international legitimacy are considered a basic  condition for the establishment of peace in the region.    The two fronts' representatives in the PNC also began to  collect the signatures of the PNC members and national and  popular figures on a similar memo prepared by Taysir Khalid from  the DFLP, 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh from the PFLP, and Sulayman  al-Najjab from the Palestinian People's Party. Al-Najjab,  however, disclaimed the memo in whose formulation he  participated. The representatives of the three organizations  drafted this memo after the failure of 120 PNC members in Jordan  to agree to a joint stand toward the Hebron massacre.    The memo calls for and end to the current overt and covert  bilateral talks with the Israeli enemy until the international  community, particularly the Security Council, and Israel respond  to our just demands which are:    1. Dismantling the settlements and stopping all settlement  activities in accordance with the UN resolutions, particularly  Security Council Resolution 465 for 1980, which considers these  settlements illegal, and evacuating settlers from all the  occupied Palestinian territories, including holy Jerusalem.    2. Securing international protection for our Palestinian  people under occupation, applying the Fourth Geneva Convention  of 1949 to the occupied territories, and entrusting security in  the territories to UN forces for a temporary period of time  until the Palestinian people can assume responsibility and  national authority.</p>

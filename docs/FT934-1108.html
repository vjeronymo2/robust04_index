			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Granada turns up heat on LWT Granada Group turned up the heat in its Pounds 654m aggressive offer for LWT Holdings, describing the London weekend TV company's defence, posted on Sunday, as an 'empty document' which 'failed to add anything serious to the debate'. The bid is the first hostile one in the history of British commercial television. LWT's shares rose 6p to 605p yesterday, while Granada's were up 7p at 527p. That makes the six-for-five share offer worth 632.4p a share. There is a cash alternative at 528p. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, said the defence document did not address the fundamental question of how LWT will provide long term earnings growth to its shareholders. He suggested the price being offered by Granada - of 32 times 1992 earnings per share and 25 times estimates for 1993 earnings - could not be supported by fundamental analysis. He has said the bid, if successful, would not dilute Granada's earnings in the financial year to September 1995. LWT's defence document demonstrated that its shares had performed far better for investors than Granada's had over the last four years, and said half of Granada's profits came from its low growth television rental business. Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT, said on Sunday that it was pursuing talks which could result in a four-way alliance between LWT, Yorkshire, Tyne-Tees and Anglia producing cost savings, although current broadcasting regulations only allow two licences to be combined in one company. Mr Robinson said LWT shareholders should ask how a merger with Yorkshire would affect its earnings, how LWT would protect its market share if it remained independent and what would happen to the LWT share price if the bid failed.</p>

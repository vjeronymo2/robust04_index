			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: British dance to the fore - Prudence Skeen on the importance of supporting our modern dance companies it is the main attraction in this year's International Festival de Nouvelle Danse which takes place in October. In Europe British dance has been watched with growing interest. Last year the British Council promoted a two-week season in Brussels, and this year Hamburg is hosting an exposition of British dance which includes workshops, discussions and videos. Frankfurt, Lisbon, Marseilles and Rotterdam are all planning seasons of British dance, and Britain won two of the four sections in this year's International Competition for Dance Videos in Frankfurt. Such examples of success suggest a significant momentum of interest and one that has gone surprisingly unsung within our shores. Indeed, many of our leading arts correspondents have queried the Arts Council's recent prioritising of the art form. The names that are exciting audiences around the world are among the most daring and diverse of our contemporary dance companies. They include Jonathan Burrows, Michael Clark, DV8, Shobana Jeyasingh, V-Tol and Lea Anderson's Cholmondeleys and Featherstonehaughs. According to John Ashford, Director of The Place Theatre in London and a prime mover in promoting British dance, it is the variety and unpredictability of our dance artists that fascinates. Our foreign neighbours find 'a wealth of curiously provocative work, indicative of the eccentricity of British culture'. Perhaps it is this eccentricity which causes us to ignore, even decry, this part of our cultural treasure. In giving priority to dance in its 1994/95 allocation, the Arts Council is honouring a pledge made in 1989 when it recognised dance as 'an emerging and developing art form'. Dance has grown up since then, but it still receives barely half of the funding given to drama or music. This is in spite of dance being one of the most expensive forms to produce; the fact that almost all dance companies tour for many weeks each year; and that by its very nature dance is collaborative and provides creative opportunities for musicians, designers and visual artists, TV and video producers; and many of today's composers cite contemporary dance as one of the main conduits for their music. Nonetheless, Pounds 20m of taxpayers' money from the Arts Council's allocation goes into supporting dance and the public has a right to know how this amount is spent and how decisions for its distribution are made. Almost three-quarters (Pounds 15.4m) of the Arts Council's dance allocation goes to support four main classical ballet companies: The Royal Ballet, The Birmingham Royal Ballet, English National Ballet and Northern Ballet Theatre. They all tour extensively, with the present exception of The Royal Ballet which is planning to tour more widely in future. The remaining Pounds 5m supports the rest, that diverse and unpredictable wealth of dance that is making such a significant contribution to our cultural credibility overseas. In addition to the companies already mentioned, the rest includes Adzido, Britain's largest African dance company, Rambert Dance Company, London Contemporary Dance Theatre, Green Candle, Siobhan Davies Dance Company, Adventures in Motion Pictures - and seven National Dance Agencies. This network of agencies was started by the Arts Council in close association with Regional Arts Boards and local authorities in an attempt to promote dance at a more approachable level. Any assumption that this is just another administrative structure is belied by a visit to, say, Dance City in Newcastle or Thamesdown Dance Studio in Swindon, where the atmosphere pulsates with energy, movement, creation and participation. For this is the purpose of the agencies - to provide homes for dance where professional artists can create, perform and teach and where those who wish to participate can do so by attending a wide choice of classes and other activities. But still a level of public resistance remains. Dance is an elusive, subtle medium, expressing high emotion in disciplined physical form. Classical ballet may have familiar narratives and melodies; its forms and conventions provide a framework for understanding. Contemporary dance, in common with other contemporary arts, sometimes disrupts or ignores 'the rules'. This may make it controversial and perhaps never more so than when the debate includes funding. Its achievements might be ignored, but its more wayward manifestations make an ideal focus for brickbats. An element of the Arts Council's dance budget will always be devoted to new work. Some of this will be difficult, will be inaccessible, will be questioned by those who do not understand. Many of us do not understand  - nor immediately appreciate - all that we see, but I am reminded of Marie Rambert who, after a lifetime working in classical ballet, was prepared, at the age of 74, to permit her beloved company to be changed into one presenting work in the contemporary techniques at that time coming from America. As she grew into her 90s she would watch with fascination and approval those works whose aesthetic technique was so different from that in which she had been raised. This was a woman who had witnessed the outcry at the opening of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring and had come to see it accepted as a modern masterpiece. Proud as we are of our past, we must be equally caring of our present and nurturing of our future. The new and the strange are not always beguiling, but we would be failing in our duty if we ignored them. Prudence Skene is Chairman of the Arts Council's Advisory Panel for Dance</p>

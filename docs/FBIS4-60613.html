			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who is visiting the  United States, told our correspondent Arye Golan that 'Arafat is  facing severe pressure from the Palestinian peace opponents,  which can perhaps explain his remarks regarding the Quraish  Tribe and the cancellation of the Israeli laws in the autonomy.    [Begin recording] [Peres] 'Arafat has no legislative  authority and no authority to cancel existing laws. So things  are published in the newspapers, I would prefer the newspaper  reports to also agree with the spirit of the Declaration of  Principles.    [Golan] What can we learn about 'Arafat and his behavior  from this?    [Peres] I am not a psychologist, and I do not think I should  comment on the person himself. I can only tell you what he told  me, namely, that he is facing a very strong opposition and that  he is struggling to implement his policy. He told me, for  example, that the entire Johannesburg mosque affair transpired  during a heated argument with the Iranians, who accused him of  proceeding with Israel while the latter is violating the  agreement. 'Arafat claims he said that if Israel violates the  agreement he will violate it himself, just as Muhammad violated  the agreement after the Quraish Tribe violated it.    I do not want, however, to serve as 'Arafat's advocate, it  is  not my duty. I also do not want to hand out grades. I am  conducting negotiations rather than dealing with graphological  analysis or psychoanalysis. [end recording]</p>

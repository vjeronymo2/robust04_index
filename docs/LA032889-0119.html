			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury sold $7.2 billion of new three-month bills at  an average discount rate of 9.1%, up from 9% last week. Another $7.2 billion of  six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 9.12%, up from 9.04%  last week. The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 9.38%  and six-month bills averaged 9.59% on Oct. 29, 1984. The new rates understate  the actual return to investors -- 9.44% for three-month bills, with a $10,000  bill selling for $9,770.00 and 9.69% for six-month bills selling for $9,538.90.  The discount rate reflects the price discount received when government  securities are purchased at less than face value.  </P></p>

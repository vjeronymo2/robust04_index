			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Philips share price falls 17% on results warning SHARES in Philips, the Dutch electronics group, plunged more than 17 per cent on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange yesterday after the company warned that problems in consumer electronics would lead to a substantial drop in second-quarter results and might cause full-year profits to fall below 1991 levels. Philips blamed the downturn on the depressed state of the recession-hit consumer electronics market, which accounts for almost half the company's annual turnover of Fl 57bn (Pounds 17.3bn). 'While we are maintaining market share in our consumer electronics and components divisions, price erosion and under-utilisation of capacity have caused lower than anticipated results,' the company said. Philips, which appeared to be making progress in bolstering flagging profitability, said its other main businesses such as lighting and professional products were performing better than forecast. But these improvements could not compensate for the disappointing trend in consumer electronics. Although it has been clear that Philips and its Japanese competitors faced difficulties in consumer electronics, the Dutch company's profit warning took the stock market by surprise. Philips's shares dropped 17.6 per cent to end the day at Fl 31.30 compared with Tuesday's close of Fl 38.00. The company is scheduled to release second-quarter figures on August 6. When it published first-quarter figures last month, Philips said its consumer electronics business had swung into an operating loss of 'less than Fl 100m' from profits of around Fl 100m the year before, reflecting a 5 per cent decline in selling prices. The company said the crisis in consumer electronics had deepened during the second quarter. 'Should the present trend in this market segment continue in the second half of 1992, it is unlikely that a net profit from normal business operations equal to that of 1991 will be realised,' the company said. In 1991, Philips posted net profit before extraordinary items of Fl 981m, a reversal of the previous year when it suffered a loss of Fl 4.5bn, mainly because of extensive restructuring provisions. It had forecast a 'limited increase' in 1992 net profit from normal business operations. Lex, Page 22; Background, Page 28</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Callone] </F>   [Text] Congress is questioning Finance Minister Julio Sosa  Rodriguez about his performance during the nation's current  financial crisis.    A vote of censure on the finance minister's performance  could  be taken today during the congressional session since a majority  of legislators are criticizing Sosa, as well as the other  cabinet ministers, for not having declared a state of financial  emergency.    According to Pedro Tabata Guzman, deputy head of the  Democratic Action bloc, there will soon be a need to implement  exchange controls.    Deputy Tabata thus responded to questions regarding this  Wednesday's increase in the value of the U.S. dollar.    [Begin recording] [Tabata, in progress] ...not just that  measure will be recommended. I believe we will also have to  recommend importation controls, but only on certain goods.  Without a doubt, we will need to implement currency exchange  controls. [end recording]    Deputy Tabata Guzman also pointed out that the special  commission appointed to evaluate the summons of Finance Minister  Julio Sosa Rodriguez will also summon Development Minister  Alberto Poletto and Luis Carlos Palacios, Central Office of  Coordination and Planning chief.    Deputy Gustavo Tarre Briceno, president of the Chamber of  Deputies Finance Commission, believes the increase in the value  of the U.S. dollar is a result of the prevailing distrust in the  market.    [Begin recording] [Tarre Briceno, in progress] ...the manner  in which the intervention process was handled, the absence of a  genuine and coherent economic program, and inadequate  coordination between public officials result in significant  distrust. All of this leads to a distrust in the banking system,  which leads to withdrawals by account holders, who, not trusting  anyone, prefer to purchase more U.S. dollars. That is what has  caused the price of the U.S. dollar to exceed the 200 bolivares  mark, and the logical consequence of all of this is more  inflation. [end recording]    In this respect, Deputy Tarre Briceno stressed that it is  very likely the inflation rate will reach three digits.</p>

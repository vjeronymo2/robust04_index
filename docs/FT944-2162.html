			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Smoke signals required Sir, Nicholas Lander's guide to restaurant guides ('Christmas Food and Drink', December 10/11) fails to mention a significant difference between the various guides. For the discerning diner who enjoys the subtle aromas of food and wine, freedom from the intrusion and irritation of smoke is desirable. Among the guides, Harden's and Which? report most consistently on whether a restaurant boasts a no-smoking section. It is much more convenient to have this information in the guide than to waste time telephoning one restaurant after another, in search of this ultimate in gracious dining.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic  Liberal Party (DLP) is wooing independent lawmakers in a bid to  impede the emergence of a new party large enough to become a  negotiating body, DLP officials said Tuesday.    They said several independent lawmakers have expressed  interest in joining the ruling party, suggesting that the DLP is  currently selecting some for membership.    Two splinter parties -- the United People's Party (UPP) and  the New Political Reform Party (NPRP) -- announced Monday they  would merge and possibly become a third negotiating body in the  National Assembly if they win over seven or more lawmakers.    Rep. Mun Chung-su, secretary-general of the DLP, said, "some  nonpartisan lawmakers expressed the intention to enter our party  long ago, but we cannot accept all of them."    He hinted that the DLP may select just enough independent  lawmakers to deter the newly merged party from becoming a  negotiating body.    He named Reps. Kim Chung-nam, Pyon Chong-il, Chong  Mong-chun,  Chong Tae-yong, Kim Chin-yong and Chong Chu-il as those who  might be joining the DLP.    At present, the United People's Party has 12 lawmakers and  the New Party for Political Reform has one.    If the new party managed to secure seven more lawmakers, it  could upset the power balance that has existed ever since the  inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam in February 1992 between  the ruling DLP and the main opposition Democratic Party (DP).</p>

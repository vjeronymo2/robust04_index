			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / People: Virtuality's new strategist Virtuality, the recently-floated company which produces hardware and software for virtual reality computer-generated entertainments, has turned one of its non-executive directors - Anne Glover, on the board since December 1991 - into chief operating officer. Glover, right, will be based in the UK and will be responsible for operations worldwide. She will focus largely on implementing the international strategy of the company, which is aimed at making strong advances in Japan, Asia-Pacific, and the US. Virtuality is focused on exploiting the leisure possibilities of the new technology. Glover, 39, is a Cambridge graduate and gained an MBA at Yale. She then spent five years with Cummins Engine in the US, followed by a further five years with the management consultants Bain, in Boston. In 1989 she joined the venture capital company Apax Partners, which backed Virtuality in its early days as W Industries. Peter Englander, a director of Apax, is to join the board of Virtuality as a non-executive director. The company was founded in 1988 by Jon Waldern, who remains its managing director. Apax still has a 50.9 per cent stake in the company, though that is expected to diminish gradually over the next few years. Virtuality floated on the London Stock exchange in October; its shares immediately traded at a substantial premium to the placing price of 170p, reaching a high on the first day of 315p.</p>

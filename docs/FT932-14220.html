			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / The Lex Column: AB Foods ABF seems to specialise in bare-knuckle fights. In the UK, the trench war in milling and baking continues to grind down the participants. The industry turns over some Pounds 3bn, yet it is making negligible profits and has plenty of latent capacity. Exit costs are high, so breaking even in the hope of an upturn may seem preferable to crystallising losses. ABF's shares rallied in the wake of Tomkins' acquisition of RHM, presumably in the hope that capacity would be cut quickly. So far that has not happened, and there seems little reason to suppose that a mild economic recovery will stimulate demand for bread. In Ireland, ABF says it has regained the market share it lost in the supermarket price war. However, margins have been mauled, and rebuilding profitability will be a slow process. Only British Sugar offers comfort, yet even here profits growth is dependent on rationalisation and the benefits of green pound devaluation. The one-off gains in investment income following sterling's exit from the ERM are also unlikely to be repeated. With interest rates low, investors may thus look for ABF's strong balance sheet to be used to greater effect. The company has so far failed to find a suitable target to apply British Sugar's expertise abroad. Until it does, prospects are dull.</p>

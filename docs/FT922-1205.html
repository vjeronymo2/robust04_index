			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: Waterproof in Venice - The risks and rewards of special techniques to save the crypt of St Mark's basilica Visitors entering St Mark's basilica in Venice usually cast their eyes upwards as their attention is caught by the stunning golden mosaics of Christ and the Apostles towering above them. Few spare a thought for matters below ground. However, until recently, the crypt beneath the High Altar, which houses the remains of the Serenissima's patron saint, offered a scene to dampen the spirits of even the keenest tourist. For decades the crypt, one of the basilica's holiest places, has played host to thousands of gallons of dirty, fetid water. Its level has been rising steadily as Venice itself has sunk. At high tides, the water has even lapped the tips of the ancient vaulted brickwork forming the crypt's ceiling, leaving a disfiguring and potentially dangerous legacy of salt within the stone. The water has not come from Venice's famed tides, but from seepage through the crypt's walls. The level of water outside the crypt has risen, allowing ever more water to penetrate its walls. Today, the crypt floor is 36cm below sea level. Church records show that attempts to tackle the problem are as old as the Basilica itself. In the mid-sixteenth century, administrators thought they had overcome their troubles by raising the floor. That worked for a few decades. By the mid-1580s, the crypt was becoming unusable again, and it was eventually walled off. Three hundred years later, with the discovery of concrete, another serious attempt was made to resolve matters. The lower half of the walls and the floor, raised again, were covered with concrete to keep the water out. The treatment worked, but did nothing to stop the problem of summertime condensation, which became evident as soon as the crypt came back into use. By the mid-1950s, water penetration was increasingly acute as the concrete lining aged and the whole city sank further. The crypt was closed. At a press conference last week, Rhone Poulenc, the French chemicals group which has sponsored several stonework restoration projects in Italy, announced that the crypt's problems may be over. After a six-year project, involving study of materials and the injection into the walls of a special waterproof resin, the sea may be out for good. When the next phase of the restoration, concentrating on the ceiling brickwork, is over, it should be possible to hold services in the crypt again. The hope is to complete by 1994, the Basilica's 1,000th anniversary. The crypt would be reserved for worship. Rhone Poulenc's contribution has come in the form of speciality chemicals - in this case Rocagil, a silicone-based resin - and the technique to apply them. The company is reluctant to say how much it has spent. Apart from donating the materials, its commitment has involved devoting senior specialists to the project, with two technicians on site. Using resins for waterproofing is not new. According to Carlo Molteni, a former R&amp;D chief of Rhone Poulenc in Italy, the first application dates back to a dam project in Algeria in 1968. The age and the cultural and religious significance of St Mark's crypt turned the restoration process into an unusually lengthy task. Preliminary work in 1972 involved the use of epoxy resins. They failed to permeate the finest cracks and pores. Rocagil had a viscosity level similar to that of water, which made it ideal for the task, explains Molteni, who holds a 1967 patent on the use of silicone-based resins. Even when the right product had been identified, application could only take place slowly. Only after two high tides could the project leaders be sure that the chemical, and the technique, were working. The need to observe the Basilica's primary function as a place of worship meant heavy work, such as drilling, could not take place uninterrupted. The project has been a object lesson in public relations and marketing for Rhone Poulenc. It also spotlights the risks of misunderstandings and cultural clashes that can emerge when big business and bodies like St Mark's mix. Sponsorship of the arts is not new in Italy. Many companies, notably banks, are generous givers for prestige-winning restoration projects. Rhone Poulenc, which counts Italy as its fourth biggest foreign market, with sales of about L1,300bn, is no exception. It has been involved with projects to restore the stonework on buildings and monuments as famous - and disparate - as Milan's town hall and the Duomo in Parma, as well as making a perfect copy of Donatello's statue of St Mark in Florence. Concentrating on restoration and copying allowed the company to associate its name with some of Italy's best-known monuments. The idea also makes sense in terms of the group's overall image and communications strategy. Rhone Poulenc is only the world's seventh biggest chemicals group. It claims however to be a leader in advanced chemicals for stone restoration. Executives say it is one of a handful which have the specialist skills to apply the materials most effectively. However, the Venice restoration shows how delicately a company must tread. It was no coincidence that one of the Basilica's representatives pointedly refused to use the word 'sponsorship' at last week's press conference. 'Sometimes their attitude is pure hypocrisy', says one person not linked to Rhone Poulenc. 'They want our money and our products but balk at the idea that we may be doing them a favour. Rather, it's the other way around. Sometimes, you'd think they'd prefer it their buildings were just left to fall down rather than having anyone interfere'. That approach may seem surprising for cultural administrators in countries like the UK, where government funding cuts have obliged curators and churchmen to look to industry for assistance. With more than a decade of experience in Italy, Rhone Poulenc has probably learned the right arts of diplomacy. Despite the obvious differences, its presence at St Marks is clearly appreciated, especially now that work is due to start on the crypt's ceiling. That process may take as long as dealing with the floor and walls, as the ancient bricks, now completely impregnated with salt, are visibly crumbling. 'I don't think there is a structure as compromised as this one', says Mr Molteni. How the salt will be expelled, and what will replace it so that the bricks do not fall to pieces, will require months of study before final decisions are made. Whatever technique is chosen, the church and the company will be working, as far as possible, in harmony.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Topical Talk" feature] </F>   [Summary] Dear comrades and friends: At its fourth session  in late 1993, the Ninth National Assembly issued a resolution on  practicing thrift and fighting wasteful spending, corruption,  and smuggling. Acting in line with this National Assembly  resolution, all echelons and sectors have made many efforts to  effect changes for the better in the front against wasteful  spending, corruption, and smuggling.    As far as the Army is concerned, efforts were made in 1993  to  accelerate the movement against corruption and smuggling a step  further and carry out the campaign to practice thrift and fight  wasteful spending. Positive results have been recorded. Since  early 1994, the Ministry of National Defense has instructed all  echelons, sectors, agencies, and units to implement the  aforementioned tasks. In the framework of that campaign, an  all-Army conference against corruption and smuggling was  convened in late 1993 in the north and early 1994 in the south.  The conference aimed to derive experiences and discuss measures  to coordinate action among military units, as well as between  military units and state agencies, in dealing with smuggling or  attempts by Army units to help private dealers carry out illegal  business activities.    The minister of national defense also signed a decision on  the management of military vehicles and equipment. Under this  decision, with the exception of vehicles with permits to engage  in economic activities, all military vehicles are prohibited  from transporting goods for private dealers or for non-military  agencies and organizations.    Furthermore, the Ministry of National Defense set up a  standing committee to oversee the campaign against corruption  and smuggling in the armed forces. Acting in line with the  ministry's common guidelines, all military agencies and units  have, since the very beginning of 1994, drawn experiences from  the movement against corruption and smuggling and consolidated  steering committees a step further.    Regarding the movement for thrift and against wasteful  spending, the Ministry of National Defense has issued a  directive requesting all agencies to make a thorough review of  spending and detect loopholes that could easily lead to wasteful  spending or the misappropriation of public funds. In  implementing this directive, many military agencies and units  made arrangements for cadres and combatants concerned to study  new state and Army regulations and rules and henceforth  formulate new management systems to deal effectively with  corruption and smuggling. The national defense agencies  concerned also reviewed the various policies and regulations  governing the movement for thrift and against wasteful spending.    Along with settling complaints and letters of denunciation,  the national defense inspection sector also made joint  investigations with commanding officers into many cases of  financial or logistical mismanagement.    Inspection and investigation results indicate that the  situation in which private dealers use the names of Army units  to carry out illegal business activities remains quite common.  In the first quarter of 1994, the ratio of corruption cases  involving party members was 52 percent. A total of 14 party  members were subjected to disciplinary measures. The number of  smuggling cases involving party members decreased by 32 percent.  A total of 27 party members were subjected to disciplinary  measures.    Regarding the movement against corruption, the number of  corruption cases has continued to decline since December 1993.  Nonetheless, the seriousness and sophistication of cases is on  the rise. The Military Organ of Control initiated legal  proceedings in five cases involving 10 defendants.    Regarding the movement against smuggling, according to  preliminary reports as many as 7,000 packs of foreign  cigarettes, 46 television sets, 62 ceiling fans, 14,000 meters  of fabrics, 100 tons of cement, and 24.4 kilos of opium were  seized.    To accelerate the movement against corruption and smuggling  in the days ahead, the minister of national defense issued a  decision on 28 March 1994 establishing a standing committee  against corruption and smuggling. The decision reminded all  echelons and sectors of the need to understand thoroughly the  policy on practicing thrift and fighting wasteful spending,  corruption, and smuggling. Efforts must be made to cope  effectively with the aforementioned negative phenomena and  restore order, discipline, and lawfulness. Steps must be taken  to enhance the efficiency of state management agencies. It is  necessary for agencies and units under the direct management of  the Ministry of National Defense to formulate well-defined  programs of action and adopt practical measures to implement  them. More efforts are needed to uphold the sense of  responsibility of party committee echelons and commanding  officers at all levels. Adequate educational activities must be  organized to help cadres and combatants thoroughly understand  and strictly abide by Army and state policies and lines  prohibiting illegal business activities and attempts to lend a  helping hand to smugglers and tax evaders. Continued efforts  are needed to conduct thorough investigations into cases of  mismanagement of public funds, housing facilities, land, and  military means of transportation. Drastic measures must be taken  to initiate legal proceedings against corruption and smuggling  cases. Violators must be dealt with to the full extent of state  law and Army discipline.    Dear comrades and friends, practicing thrift and fighting  corruption, smuggling, and wasteful spending constitutes an  important task to be carried out by all Army units. If we  implement this task satisfactorily, we will contribute to  building a firm and powerful Army; purifying social relations;  establishing order, discipline, and law; and enhancing the  efficiency of state management over socioeconomic development,  thereby continuing to advance the fatherland along the socialist  path.</p>

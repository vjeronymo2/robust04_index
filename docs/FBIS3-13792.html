			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] At last, in its Resolution 904 adopted yesterday  the UN Security Council condemned the massacre of the  Palestinians at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. The massacre, in which  over 65 Palestinians were killed on 25 February at the hands of  extremist Zionists, has focused worldwide public attention on  Zionist barbarity and on the grave dimensions of that ugly  crime. The UN Security Council was supposed to adopt a quick  and decisive resolution. However, with feeble excuses and  pretexts, such as the need for the Security Council to avoid  adopting any stand that might jeopardize the Middle East peace  talks, the United States forced the UN Security Council to act  outside the legal framework within which it was supposed to act  toward such events and developments.    It is evident that all this delay in the issuance of the  resolution of condemnation by the UN Security Council and the  clear U.S.-Zionist coordination were a planned affair designed  to encourage the Arabs and Palestinians and force them to rejoin  the peace talks.    The United States abstained on the second and sixth  paragraphs, which affirm the grave consequences that might arise  from the continuing heavy casualties among the Palestinians in  the occupied territories and the need to safeguard the security  and safety of the Palestinians through the application of the  Fourth Geneva Convention.    Although the new resolution affirms the need to safeguard  the  safety of the Palestinians inside the occupied territories and  the need for the Zionist authorities to prevent the inhabitants  of the Israeli settlements from carrying out acts of violence  against the Palestinians, and although the Security Council  calls on Russia and the United States to take the necessary  practical measures to ensure the implementation of Resolution  904, it is unlikely that any essential change will occur in the  current course of events inside the occupied territories.    The Zionist entity entirely depends on U.S. support.  Therefore, this entity will not hesitate to continue its ugly  crimes, as it has been doing for over 40 years.</p>

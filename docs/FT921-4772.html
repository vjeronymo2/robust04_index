			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Appointments: Powell: pulling together Just over a week after National Westminster announced losses on its UK lending portfolio of Pounds 1.45bn, word comes that it is setting up an international advisory board headed by Sir Charles Powell, a non-executive director of NatWest since October. Diversionary tactics? No, says the bank; the project has been long in the gestation. According to NatWest chairman Lord Alexander, the 11-member board will be there to 'strengthen our capacity to interpret international developments and draw the right conclusions for how we conduct our business'. Indeed, the project was Lord Alexander's idea, though Sir Charles says he made most of the approaches. 'On the whole we had a very gratifying batting rate. Where we didn't, it tended to be conflict-of-interest problems,' says Mrs Thatcher's former foreign policy adviser. Conflicts arose mostly in Germany where it is difficult to find a senior industrialist who is not locked onto the board of several banks; the solution was chief executive of Krupp, Gerhard Cromme. Other board members include John Whitehead, former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, Howard Davies, controller of the Audit Commission, Paul O'Neill, chairman and chief executive of Alcoa, and Peter Woo, chairman of Wharf Holdings in Hong Kong. 'This is very much a working board which will meet in London,' Sir Charles asserts, contrasting it with 'the chamber orchestra function' of a lot of American equivalents - smart rather than functional. Sir Charles himself gets his travel in other ways; he is an executive director of Jardine Matheson, and on the board of at least three other companies within that group. ***** Scholes, the Cheshire-based electrical products company, yesterday announced that its newly appointed group managing director Barrie Lawson had 'ceased' his job with effect from 26 February. Lawson joined the company less than two months ago from GPT, where he had been director, telecoms systems. He had been in line to take over as chief executive; Reg Harrington, who currently combines the roles of chairman and chief executive, favours splitting the functions. Scholes' finance director Bill Riches refused to comment yesterday either on the circumstances surrounding Lawson's departure or the reason for the delay in the announcement. 'The board are very very disappointed that things did not work out. We went to extreme lengths to try to select the right man.' Asked how Scholes intended to avoid a repeat performance, he said that was a matter for the board to decide.</p>

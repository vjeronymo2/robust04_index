			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Observer: Taxing affairs Norman Lamont's financial affairs may have slipped out of the headlines, but there is still interest in the accountancy world of how he will fill in his income tax return. According to Observer's tax expert, the payment of the chancellor's Pounds 23,000 legal bill for evicting the sex therapist from his London flat, would almost certainly qualify as income on which he is subject to tax. This includes the Pounds 4,700 of solicitors' fees paid by the Treasury and the Pounds 18,414 supplied through an anonymous donation to Conservative Central Office. In the opinion of one senior tax consultant, the legislation is clear cut on the subject - it should be declared on the chancellor's form P-11D. The 1988 Income and Corporation Taxes Act states that expenses are taxable unless the taxpayer is 'obliged to lay out and expend money wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties in respect of which' the fees are paid. That includes payments made from official emoluments. While Mr Lamont might claim - as the Treasury did for the Pounds 4,700 payment - that the costs partly related to his official position, it would be difficult to argue that the eviction did not provide some personal benefit unrelated to his official duties. It does not matter that the Pounds 18,414 gift towards eviction costs was not paid for by Mr Lamont's employer. Income tax would apply on any money paid on his behalf by reason of his employment. Only if this money was a gift purely on personal grounds and unrelated to Lamont's status as chancellor would it be considered non-taxable. The Inland Revenue never comments on the details of any individual taxpayer's affairs and the Treasury remains mum insisting it's an 'an entirely private matter'. Presumably, the chancellor will have retained the accountancy equivalent of Peter Carter-Ruck.</p>

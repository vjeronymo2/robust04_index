			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Aegis Shares in Aegis, the London-based holding company of Europe's largest media-buying and planning group, plunged 11p to 21 1/2 p yesterday as the group put forward a plan to raise new equity finance and restructure its capital, writes Diane Summers in London. Omnicom, the US-based advertising giant, will, for the first time, become a significant shareholder in the group, prompting speculation that it could eventually combine its advertising activities with Aegis' media-buying. Aegis intends to raise Pounds 61.2m (Dollars 92.41m) of new equity finance through an open offer of Pounds 46.2m of new ordinary shares. Lex, Page 24; Details, Page 23</p>

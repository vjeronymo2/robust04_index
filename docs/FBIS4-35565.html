			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] Israel promised the PLO that the Palestinian  institutions in Jerusalem will continue to exist and operate in  an orderly fashion. This pledge was made in a letter sent by  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres several months ago to former  Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst, who was to convey the letter  to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat.    In the letter, Peres quoted from his Knesset address of 9  September 1993, in which he said that Israel would be committed  to the "orderly functioning of the various religious  institutions which exist and operate in the city" and that  "coexistence in Jerusalem is a matter of mutual respect among  all its residents and of the orderly functioning of the relevant  institutions and systems." Peres noted the "social, religious,  and other institutions" of each ethnic community in the city, as  well as the existence of each ethnic community's separate  educational system.    'Arafat asked Israel for the letter in order to preserve the  political status quo in Jerusalem in anticipation of the  discussions on the city's status in the course of the permanent  arrangement negotiations due to begin in about two years. In  response to his request, Israel sent the letter several weeks  after the Declaration of Principles [DOP] was signed in  Washington.    The letter's existence and contents were kept secret, and it  was not publicized along with other documents attached to the  Israeli- PLO agreements.    A senior political element associated with the peace talks  said yesterday that "the agreements with the PLO contain no  secret addenda or secret letters. There is nothing secret in a  speech delivered at the Knesset. We did not try to hide the  letter, but no one asked us to make its content publics."  According to this source, "'Arafat did not say that his  recognition of Israel and the signing of the DOP were contingent  on the receipt of a letter concerning Jerusalem."    The senior political element said that the letter received  by  'Arafat refers only to Palestinian institutions that operated in  Jerusalem at the time of Peres' Knesset speech in September.  According to him, Israel opposes the establishment and operation  of new Palestinian institutions that are political in nature.  "We will not touch the existing bodies, but we will not permit  new ones to be established," he stressed. [passage omitted]</p>

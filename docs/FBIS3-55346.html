			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jan 06, BNS -- Estonian Foreign Minister  Trivimi Velliste, to be replaced by Juri Luik under the current  changes in the Cabinet, is to take over as the country's  ambassador to the United Nations.    Estonia's current ambassador to the United Nations, the  country's oldest diplomat Ernst Jaakson has announced plans to  resign this year, Prime Minister Mart Laar said. It was decided  earlier that Velliste would take over the office in New York.  "It is in every way logical that the change takes place now,"  Laar said.    "The man to take over the foreign minister's office is the  so  far Defense Minister Juri Luik, of whom I believe that he will  be more useful in that position," Laar added. "I believe that  Indrek Kannik is able to successfully take over as the defense  minister," he said.    Finance Minister Madis Uurike, who is also to be replaced in  the same series of changes, will take up an adviser's position  with the government. Uurike is to focus on issues connected with  foreign loans, their usage and repayment, the prime minister  added.    But he also said the necessity of changes in the Finance  Ministry had been "long talked about."    "A certain working against the reforms or delaying them has  been felt in the Finance Ministry every now and then," Laar  said, pointing out the tax reform as one example. He said Heiki  Kranich, who is appointed to take over as the finance minister,  had been one of the parliament's main "driving forces" behind  the tax reform.    Laar said that Toomas Sildmae, who is to quit as the  economics minister, was to resume his office as the head of  Finest Hotel Group Ltd., one of the country's three largest  hotel companies.    The prime minister expressed the hope that Sildmae would  keep  up his ties with the government, but added that Sildmae as  minister was at variance with the majority of the ruling  coalition MPs.    "There is no reason to search where these variances had  their  beginning. But it is clear that in a parliamentarian system no  minister lacking the trust of and cooperation in the parliament  is able to work effectively," he added.    Toivo Jurgenson, to take over as economics minister, is to  continue Sildmae's policy, at the same time increasing the pace  of working out legislation in the sphere of the economy, Laar  assured.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Japan's unemployment rate stubbornly refuses to fall Japan's jobless rate hovered at 3 per cent for the fourth month running in October, as a fall in manufacturing jobs was absorbed by a rise in service sector workers, reports William Dawkins from Tokyo. The unemployment rate's refusal to decline from its seven-year high of 1.99m marks a potentially disturbing break with previous, job-creating recoveries. In earlier economic upturns, unemployment started to fall six to 12 months after the first signs of recovery, according to the government's Economic Planning Agency. Yet the agency believes the recession touched bottom in October last year, 13 months ago. This requires careful monitoring, said Mr Manso Hamamoto, labour minister. The number of job offers for every 100 applicants also stagnated in October at 64, for the second month in a row, well under half the number of jobs per applicant two years ago. This ratio is likely to stay low, because of a backlog of new graduates, which pushed up the number of applicants by 7.7 per cent in the year to October, much faster than the 1.5 per cent rise in the number of job offers. Total employment was almost stable at 64.8m workers, within which the manufacturing workforce fell by 3.3 per cent year on year, the sharpest drop since April 1987. This is a sign manufacturing industry is continuing to shed workers through a freeze on recruitment and failure to replace retired staff. Service sector jobs rose 1.6 per cent over the same period.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, the president's  representative in the Razoruzheniye (Disarmament) state owned  company (and former commander of the joint CIS forces), told  Interfax that if Russia's defense industries continue to be  neglected as they are now, a political party could be set up  which would lobby for the industries. This idea was advanced at  a recent conference of the industries.    Shaposhnikov did not object to cuts in military spending but  said that "the principles of sufficient reason as well as  reasonable sufficiency" had to be observed.    In his view, the proposed cut (to less than one fifth of the  1993 figure) of spending for military contracts might harm the  scientific and industrial potential of the country.  Shaposhnikov thought that the rocketry, air force and other  services using high technologies could be the worst hit.    In a more intelligent approach, Shaposhnikov thought, "the  number of design boards and factories specializing in  development and manufacture of the same products" could be cut.  This kind of competition would make it possible to preserve and  consolidate the most efficient producers while less fortunate  competitors could turn to other activities, probably for  peaceful purposes.    The defense industries must have better guidelines, he  thought. Four specific state programs had to be adopted, of  weapons production, reduction and utilization of non-promising  production lines, conversion to peaceful uses and weapons export.    "Even though I am with a mediator organization engaged in  sales of weapons, I don't think it fair that military hardware  producers cannot participate in exporting their products. They  must have the right of direct access to the world market so as  to enable them to use part of their proceeds for their immediate  needs and increase the national budget revenue by paying taxes,"  Shaposhnikov said.</p>

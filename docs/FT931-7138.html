			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / 1.5m lodge property claims FEWER than 15 per cent of all property claims in the former East Germany have been settled, and it will take another decade to resolve the outstanding claims, officials at the federal office for property questions said yesterday. In its first comprehensive report since December 31, 1992, when all restitution and compensation claims had to be registered with the local authorities, it shows that 1.5m people applied to claim 2.5m titles on property. Of that figure, over 119,700 claims for enterprises have been made, of which 23.16 per cent have been settled. Over 2m claims for houses have been registered, but only 281,902 have settled. Under the amended terms of the 1990 law on restitution and compensation of property in east Germany, not all property can be returned to their original owners, and compensation is neither full nor calculated at current prices. In principle property confiscated by the former east German communist regime between 1949 and 1990 can be returned, as well as property confiscated between 1933 and 1945. But compensation for the latter is calculated on the value of property in the 1930s, while a a ceiling of DM300,000 (Pounds 127,000) has been recommended by the finance ministry for property confiscated after 1949.</p>

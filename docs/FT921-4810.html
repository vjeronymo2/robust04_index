			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Irish bank dispute escalates A seven-week-old pay dispute affecting Ireland's banks escalated yesterday when 13,000 employees of the big four Irish clearing banks stopped processing bank charges to customers, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. Managements of the four banks, Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and National Irish Bank, have threatened a 20 per cent pay cut as of next week unless staff 'honour their contracts'. The dispute is over a 6.5 per cent pay rise demanded by the Irish Bank Officials Association.</p>

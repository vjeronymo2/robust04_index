			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> VOTERS TO DECIDE IF COUNCIL GETS A RAISE  </P> <P> Voters in this seaside community will decide in June whether City Council  members will get their first pay raise in 25 years.  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously earlier this week to ask voters to raise their  monthly salaries from $125 to as much as $300, despite the fears of at least  one council member that voters may question the ethics of the move.  </P> <P> Voters will be asked to amend the city's 1964 charter so that council salaries  conform with those set by the State of California Government Code. The code  sets standards for cities without charters and calls for those with a  population of under 35,000 to pay council members up to $300 a month.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joyce Risner, who proposed the ballot measure, said current  compensation is based on 1964 economics and is insufficient.  </P> <P> Risner said she serves the city an average of 20 hours a week, which she says  comes to about 10 cents per hour.  </P> <P> "I'm sure ($125) was pretty good for the early '60s," Risner added.  </P> <P> In Orange County, Seal Beach ranks next to last in council salaries. Villa  Park, which offers no payment to council officials, is last, she noted.  </P> <P> Risner said the $125 payment might also prevent qualified people from becoming  involved in city government.  </P> <P> "I don't think people run for City Council for the money. But some people might  not run because it is not worth their time or effort," she suggested.  </P> <P> Councilman Joe Hunt supported bringing the pay-raise issue to the voters and  said that if adopted, voters should also decide how much of an increase the  council should receive.  </P> <P> Hunt added that most residents he has talked with think an increase is fair.  </P> <P> Seal Beach is divided into five districts, with each represented by one council  member. Nine candidates have entered the race for the three Seal Beach council  seats up for grabs in the March 27 election.  </P> <P> Neither Risner nor Mayor Victor S. Grgas will seek reelection under a city law  that prohibits residents from serving more than two consecutive terms. Eight of  the nine candidates are seeking those two seats. Hunt is running unopposed.  SHELBY GRAD and MICHELLE NICOLOSI  </P></p>

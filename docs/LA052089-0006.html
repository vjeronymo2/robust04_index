			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF LAKERS ARE POETRY, WHAT ARE THE CLIPPERS?  </P> <P> I adjust the rabbit ears on my portable black and white.  </P> <P> I sit back and watch.  </P> <P> A picture perfect pass from Magic Johnson.  </P> <P> A vintage skyhook from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, followed by the inevitable:  </P> <P> Lakers win,  </P> <P> Lakers win,  </P> <P> Lakers win.  </P> <P> I should be elated, but somehow I fell empty inside.  </P> <P> I glance down and notice a pasta stain on my brand new white shirt. My shoes  have come untied again.  </P> <P> Alone in my room, it suddenly hits me.  </P> <P> I shudder.  </P> <P> Oh my, I miss the Clippers.  </P> <P> STEPHEN FELDMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

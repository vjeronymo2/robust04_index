			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (4): Workplaces open up to innovation - How the industrial relations scene has changed Britain's industrial relations system - once notorious in the outside world for its wildcat strikes, obstacles to change and low productivity  - is seen as an increasingly important factor in the country's attractiveness for inward investors. In the words of a recent study of the UK manufacturing sector's competitiveness produced by the House of Commons trade and industry committee, it is 'now widely regarded as a competitive strength'. Working days lost through strikes last year were the lowest since official records of industrial conflicts began in 1891 - following on 1991 and 1992 which were themselves remarkably trouble-free. But that alone does not explain the new mood of optimism about labour performance. More important has been the accumulation of evidence that suggests attitudes towards workplace innovation have been transformed. This has led to the widespread removal across much of industry of the old 'them' and 'us' divisions of the shopfloor, with the outlawing of the closed shop, the dismantling of demarcation lines between jobs and the removal of restrictions on recruitment. An increasing number of companies are replacing adversarial attitudes with a new spirit of partnership in the workplace. Of course, the techniques of Human Resource Management are still hardly the norm in British industry. 'The empowerment of employees has taken root in only a minority of UK manufacturing firms,' admitted the trade and industry committee report. a wide range of foreign companies operating in Britain suggests workplace change based on consent and co-operation is by no means uncommon, either. In recent months a number of them - Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Sony - have been parading the achievements of their UK plants before MPs in a number of separate inquiries. Dr Paul Marginson, of the School of Industrial and Business Studies at Warwick University, argues multinational companies are attracted to Britain nowadays because they face 'fewer statutory constraints' in the way they handle labour than in mainland European countries. As a result, there is 'greater scope' for them to introduce 'innovatory practices'. He also points to the attractiveness of the UK's low labour costs for some inward investors. This is not so much a case of low pay. Hourly earnings in the UK remain substantially lower than in Germany but are higher than in France and Japan. The big difference lies in the so-called 'on-costs' covering social welfare, training, holidays and welfare benefits which are met in the UK mainly by the state or the employee. Companies operating in Britain have a much lower non-wage labour cost burden to carry than those in any other European country except Ireland. This provides the UK with a distinct cost advantage compared with its main trading competitors. The latest comparative labour cost statistics (taking into account exchange rate differences) compiled by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics indicate that the UK manufacturing employers' labour costs in 1992 averaged Dollars 14.69 an hour compared with Dollars 16.16 an hour in Japan, Dollars 16.17 an hour in the US and Dollars 25.94 an hour in Germany. Many of the public agencies are keen to point to the low cost of labour as an attraction for inward investors. As Locate in Scotland declared: 'Wages and salaries in Scotland are lower than the UK average. Indeed, Scottish hourly scales are among the lowest in Europe, especially in manufacturing. 'Total on-costs are lower as a percentage of salary in Scotland than in other countries, with the cost of both company and statutory costs adding around 25 per cent (only 7.1 per cent of this being due to statutory requirements) to basic salary. This compares to over 40 per cent in some other countries.' The promotional effort also proclaims the fact that Scotland 'has one of the most progressive and flexible employment regimes in Europe'. The document points out: 'Part-time and shift working is common and there are no restrictions on the use of temporary labour. These conditions are considerably different from the more regulated environments in many other EC countries.' Promotional material for inward investors into Wales is similar in tone. 'Wales has benefited from a combination of lower relative wage costs and improved productivity during the 1980s,' says the Welsh Development Agency. It asserts that unit labour costs are nearly 10 per cent lower than the UK average, 'making Wales by far the most cost-competitive region in the UK.' On a different tack, the Northern Development Company emphasises the positive role of trade unions to companies in the region as 'social partners'. A recent study of 80 new inward investors into the region pointed to the 'progressive' character of organised labour in pursuing a 'philosophy appropriate to company needs' while 79 per cent of foreign companies surveyed in 1992 said industrial relations in their northern plants were 'comparable to or much better than their plants elsewhere'. In fact, low labour costs are by no means a positive factor for many inward investors. As the Commons committee pointed out, these only give Britain 'an important short-term competitive advantage, the breathing space to increase the UK's competitiveness in other areas'. It added: 'The efficient use of labour and the raising of its value through better education and training ultimately matter far more than low labour costs.' Indeed, lower productivity in the UK means unit labour costs remain higher than in France, Germany and Japan. This suggests Britain's competitive advantage stems from its low wage, labour intensive, low skill base. Moreover, the employment element in total industrial costs is quite small, commonly 25 per cent in manufacturing.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                  Manufacturing employers' labour costs          Production workers 1992: US Dollars per hour average  ---------------------------------------------------------------------             Pay for time   Holiday pay   Non-pay     Total                worked          etc        costs  labour costs  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Japan           9.44           4.61        2.11      16.16 US             11.45           1.07        3.65      16.17 Germany        14.47           5.55        5.92      25.94 France          9.23           2.84        4.81      16.88 UK             10.56           1.70        2.43      14.69  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: US Bureau of Labour Statistics, April 1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                Unit labour costs in manufacturing (1991)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------          Labour costs   Productivity   Unit labour costs  --------------------------------------------------------------------- UK           100            100               100 US           115            175                66 Japan         98            150                65 Germany      124            140                89 France       114            139                82 Italy        128            121               106  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Trades Union Congress  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

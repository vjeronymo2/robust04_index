			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: STUNT FLYERS PLAY IN 'BOXES' FOR AEROBATICS  </P> <P> High above orange groves near Santa Paula, stunt planes regularly dip, dive and  roll in one of two "boxes" or airspaces set aside for aerobatics in Ventura  County.  </P> <P> Designated by the Federal Aviation Administration at the request of pilots, the  boxes are like giant playpens for stunt pilots, said David Flick, an aviation  safety inspector for the FAA.  </P> <P> But commercial aircraft and private planes of all types may enter the  airspaces, which are away from congested airports and clearly marked as stunt  boxes on aviation charts, Flick said. Stunt pilots have to remain aware at all  times of other planes, he said.  </P> <P> "It's a big responsibility," said Rich Stowell, a professional stunt instructor  based at Santa Paula Airport.  </P> <P> Stowell, 32, of Ventura, was hanging upside-down recently in a single-engine  plane in the 7-mile-long by 2-mile-wide box above South Mountain Road. His  parachute strapped to his back, he was demonstrating a roll.  </P> <P> "Watch the left wing," he advised a passenger. "Halfway through, you'll feel a  little light in your seat."  </P> <P> The move perfectly executed, Stowell took a breather to explain that he is  afraid of heights and does not enjoy roller coasters. Then he demonstrated a  "hammerhead," flipping the plane over sideways, heading straight down to the  ground 2,000 feet below and pulling up at the last minute. JANET BERGAMO  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] China has claimed victory in curbing inflation,  arguing that economic data recorded in March show signs of a  slowdown of the price surge in the first two months of this year.    "We have achieved initial success in curbing price rises,  mainly as a result of the greater controls over prices and the  market at the central and local level," the State Statistics  Bureau's spokesman Ye Zhen said. He said the momentum of rising  prices had been effectively curbed in March and the rate of  increase in prices of services, industrial raw materials and  consumer products had gone down "remarkably".    Official figures showed that retail price inflation in  China's 35 major cities was 24.5 per cent in March, compared  with 25.9 per cent m February. Rural inflation dropped by a  10th of a percentage point from 20.9 per cent recorded in  February, Mr Ye said.    However, a Western diplomat said it "was too early" to  declare victory, pointing out that a slight drop in prices could  be attributed to a number of factors, even minor seasonal  differences. "Inflation is still a major problem in China this  year. We are keeping a close watch on it. "It remains unclear  whether prices will continue to go down in April," he said.    A mainland economist argued that bringing inflation under  control was an "uphill battle". "It's been clear that many  localities are unable to keep inflation within the levels set by  the central Government. The only positive indication is that  the central Government has really attached significance to  tackling the problem and is determined to control it. The crux  will still be the tightening of money supply. It depends on  whether China can curb fixed-assets investments and stop bailing  out those state firms who are facing heavy losses," he said.    The retail price index rose by 20.1 per cent across the  nation in the first quarter of this year. Last year's annual  inflation was 13 per cent. Mr Ye said the rate of increase was  still far ahead of the official target of keeping annual  inflation within 10 per cent this year. He blamed the rapid  rise of prices at the beginning of this year on the lack of  effective macro-economic control and supervision over prices.  Others had taken advantage of new tax reforms to increase  prices illegally, said the official. He called on all sectors  to maintain strict control over prices, adding that there should  never be complacency.    The price surge in food, clothing and other necessities had  already provoked fierce reaction from the public, he said.    Mr Ye's optimism was shared in a forecast by the China  Materials Information Centre, carried in yesterday's China  Business Daily. It cited reasons such as a balance in supply  and demand of most goods as well as curbs on hoarding and  speculative activities.</p>

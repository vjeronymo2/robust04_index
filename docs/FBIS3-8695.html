These attacks from infantry and artillery weapons  were responded to by shooting at the Croatian Army combat  positions and, it is said in the announcement, great losses have  been inflicted upon them.    When visiting that section of the Lika battlefield, Milan  Martic, president of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, and Major  General Milan Celeketic, commander of the Serbian Army of  Krajina, expressed satisfaction with the development of events.  After visiting the Kozjan region, Martic and Celeketic met the  local leadership of Teslingrad, the Lika town that was most  frequently attacked from Croatian soldiers' positions in this  war and to which huge material damage has been caused.    The Krajina Army General Staff reported that provocations by  the Croatian Army have also been registered in the Plasko region  in Lika, Zemunik Gornji, Smiljcic near Benkovac, and Novigrad,  as well as Kricke and other towns near Drnis and Velika Glava  near Skradin.</p>

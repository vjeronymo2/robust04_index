			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Heiton warns on second half HEITON Holdings, the Dublin-based steel and builders' merchants, and Atlantic Homecare DIY retailer, reported a 15 per cent improvement in interim profits but warned on prospects for the second half. Effects of the currency crisis and extraordinarily high interest rates would have their impact, said Mr Diarmuid Quirke, chairman. Investment projects were being deferred and consumer spending would be affected until interest rates returned to levels at which investment could be justified and mortgage repayments were at more manageable levels. For the six months ended October 31 the core businesses improved their trading performances to produce total sales of IPounds 30.1m (IPounds 29.7m) and a pre-tax profit of IPounds 945,000 (IPounds 820,000). In sterling terms turnover was Pounds 30.8m and profit Pounds 967,000. Earnings per share worked through at 1.9p (1.75p) and the interim dividend is again 0.65p.</p>

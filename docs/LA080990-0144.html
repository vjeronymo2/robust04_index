			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE PROJECTS ON BOND MEASURE;  </P> <P> TAXES: VOTERS WILL DECIDE IN NOVEMBER WHETHER TO FUND IMPROVEMENTS OF PARK,  RECREATION AND CULTURAL FACILITIES.  </P> <P> A host of Westside projects would be funded by an $817-million bond measure  placed on the November ballot Tuesday by the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors.  </P> <P> The measure, the largest bond act in the county's history, gives voters the  chance to decide whether to increase property taxes to improve local park,  recreation and cultural facilities.  </P> <P> The board voted 3 to 1 Tuesday to place the omnibus bond act before voters. It  would pay for projects ranging from a restoration of trout and steelhead  habitats to a $35-million refurbishing of the Hollywood Bowl.  </P> <P> If approved by two-thirds of the voters, the measure would also distribute $140  million to the county's 86 cities and to unincorporated areas to spend as they  see fit. Each community's portion of this money would be based on its  population. For example, the city of Los Angeles, with a population of 3.4  million, would get nearly $52 million; tiny Hidden Hills, with just 1,981  residents, would draw $32,703.  </P> <P> Additionally, the proposal includes $81.5 million for acquisition of land and  trails in the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> It also includes $50 million to upgrade facilities at county beaches. This work  is to include improvements to public restrooms and lifeguard towers.  </P> <P> Much of the rest of the money has been designated for specific smaller  projects, including many on the Westside. The following is a list of those  projects:  </P> <P> * $15 million for acquisition and development of the Kenneth Hahn State  Recreation Area in the Baldwin Hills.  </P> <P> * $10 million for the development of Pan-Pacific Park in Hollywood.  </P> <P> * $10 million for improvements at Venice Beach, including walkways and trails,  and for improvements at Venice Boulevard Park and Ballona Lagoon.  </P> <P> * $5 million for the trout and steelhead project, which would include Malibu  Creek.  </P> <P> * $3 million for improvements at Santa Monica beaches.  </P> <P> * $2 million for restoration of the Highland-Camrose bungalows in Hollywood, a  part of the $35-million Hollywood Bowl project.  </P> <P> * $1.5 for improvement of the John Anson Ford Theater in Hollywood, also a part  of the bowl project.  </P> <P> * $500,000 for development of a nature interpretive center in Malibu Canyon.  </P></p>

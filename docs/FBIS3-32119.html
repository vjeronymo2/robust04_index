Arciniega blames President Alberto Fujimori's government  advisers for not following through on a single strategy to  defeat the drug trafficking that has raged in the northeastern  jungle of Peru for several years.    "Those (advisers) have done us the greatest harm and are the  best collaborators the traffickers could have had because they  have not allowed the application of any strategy since taking  power," he stressed.    Arciniega says that despite the fact that "everything was in  place to do so," the advisers had obstructed all efforts and  even "kept us from implementing antidrug strategies at a time  when the American Government was willing to engage in joint  operations."    The 52-year-old general has been in political exile in  Argentina since last January, having left his country on the  heels of a military crisis involving him, one that eventually  turned him into an enemy of the current head of the Army,  General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza Rios. [passage omitted]    General Arciniega, who faces trial in his country for the  alleged crime of insulting a superior officer and offenses  against the nation, is one of the two Peruvian generals now in  exile in Argentina because of the political crisis in Peru.    The other is General Rodolfo Robles Espinoza, who left Peru  in May in fear for his life after denouncing members of the Army  as being behind the disappearance of a university professor and  nine students.    Having served as an Army officer for 34 years, 9 months, and  21 days, Arciniega has not lost hope of returning to his country  one day "in order to cooperate wherever necessary," mainly in  his area of expertise: the war on drug trafficking.    He says he bears no grudge against President Fujimori even  though the latter publicly leveled accusations against him.  However, he did criticize the chief of state harshly for the way  he has governed and "for the mistakes he is making" in Peru.    Arciniega now spends his time with his wife studying English  thanks to a scholarship provided by friends. He is also getting  ready to apply to Harvard, where his well-known antidrug  strategy and experience have been deemed worthy of study and  made into a course: C16-91-1044.0, in the John F. Kennedy School  of Government's catalogue.    Arciniega states that in 1989, while he was commanding  officer of the Huallaga Front (the area considered the biggest  drug trafficking factory and the strategic bastion of the  terrorist group known as the Shining Path [SL]), a strategy was  implemented that "enabled us to win the support of coca growers  numbering in the thousands and thus deprive the terrorists of  their social base."    "My antidrug trafficking operations enabled us to  destabilize  the Shining Path and led to the recovery of the Marginal  Highway, while at the same time winning the support of the  peasant population," Arciniega recalls.    He admits leading his troops into many battles against the  terrorist groups, but "my fundamental strategy was basically to  consider the coca growers--some 60,000 families--as peasants  rather than drug-trafficking criminals."    The general also claims that when he encouraged supporting  the peasants as they gradually replaced coca crops with other  products, the Shining Path began to suffer a resounding  political and social defeat.    "It was the peasants themselves who threw all the SL's out  while my troops and I engaged in simultaneous actions to break  up the Shining Path's first People's Guerrilla Army (EGP)  between April and December of 1989," he recalls.    He emphasizes that it was the Army and people together who  waged the fight against the Shining Path "until Abimael Guzman  finally lost his will to have another army and immediately  changed tactics."    He also recalls that in 1989, when a number of intelligence  reports stated that the leader of the Shining Path was  celebrating his birthday in a place in the jungle known as  paradise, "I went in that day to hit him with everything I had,  but did not find him...."    Arciniega admits that the first steps taken by the Fujimori  Government were positive, but only until just before the 5 April  1992 coup. On that date, with the support of the military, the  chief of state dissolved Parliament and assumed  extraconstitutional powers.    The former military official maintains that the drug  traffickers are the biggest capitalists in the world and that  they are capable of exerting their influence all over the world.    When asked whether he knew of the existence of a list of  persons presumably connected with drug trafficking, a list which  the then American undersecretary of state for Latin American  affairs, Bernard Aronson, had brought to Peru the very day of  the coup, Arciniega said, "I understand that that story has come  out in a book."    The general also leveled criticisms at the presidential  adviser for intelligence matters, former Captain Vladimiro  Montesinos, to whom he attributes great influence over the  Peruvian chief of state's decisions.    "The worst thing that could have happened to the Armed  Forces  is the presence of that gentleman, Vladimiro Montesinos, who has  exercised some kind of strange power over the president, whom he  originally considered as the right person for the times we are  living in Peru and given the fact that the political parties  have deteriorated," Arciniega says.    He accuses Fujimori's advisers and Montesinos of carrying  out  a series of political actions "that have done Peru great damage  because they followed the wrong strategies."    For example, he cites the problem of terrorism, charging  that  the government and its advisers "have done precisely what  Abimael wanted: to launch a campaign to put an end to  institutions that took many years to create, namely, the  political parties." "I agree that the political parties were not  doing their job, but when those parties are given their place,  they serve to guide public opinion, educating it politically,"  he explained.    He labeled the government's statement that the capture of  Abimael Guzman in September of last year was the result of the 5  April coup "a lie."    "That assertion is false because Military Intelligence had  Guzman and his entire clique on a list drawn up from the time  that terrorism started and they were all the targets of an  intense search," he said.    Arciniega laments the fact that a shadow has been cast over  the figure of Police Lieutenant General Antonio Ketin Vidal, who  executed the plan leading to the capture of Guzman and most of  his command.    "I am not surprised about what is happening to Ketin because  they also passed me over and froze my status when I returned  from Huallaga. They apparently look for weaklings to occupy key  posts so they will be servile to a regime. Otherwise they go to  prison," he observed.    For example, he criticized the current minister of defense,  General Victor Malca, who he said was "a little bully who only  fights from his desk, but who has never had a chance to get his  spats dirty in a combat zone."    General Malca signed the Cabinet resolution in January that  ordered Arciniega's trial by a special military court for  violating military regulations.    It should be recalled that as a military judge, Arciniega  tenaciously opposed the fact that a group of 30 Army officers,  including several generals, should be made to serve prison  sentences in a jail for common criminals for conspiring against  Fujimori's government in November of last year.    Arciniega repeated his accusation against presidential  adviser Vladimiro Montesinos, noting that his "recommendations"  to President Fujimori have caused him "to destroy an entire  institutional structure in the Armed Forces that took years to  create."    He emphatically blamed Montesinos for "hatching" an entire  scheme to get "many representative and highly qualified  officers" out of the military.    He warned that a "pruning" of the different levels of the  Army and Armed Forces as a whole occurred and continues to  occur, a pruning that "poses a threat to the very existence of  the Armed Forces as one of our nation's guiding institutions."    He lamented the fact that an attempt is being made to force  Army personnel, who were trained at the cost of great sacrifice,  "to start acting as a Pretorian guard, going on to claim that  the officers are not thinking about viable, appropriate  solutions for our people."    "President Fujimori and his advisers are governing Peru by  seeking weekly solutions to every national problem the country  has," Arciniega said, warning that the government does not get  at the root causes of the problems, but rather, encourages a  strategy consisting of making the people dependent on the  government.    "It is an erroneous strategy. I wonder: How long can such a  strategy be maintained? How long will all of this continue when  the president ignores the causes of our social problems?" he  asked, turning his focus to the secular problems that have  plagued Peru in recent decades.    He also wondered about the role of the Armed Forces given  the  state of politics in Peru: "How long will they go on adopting a  political role not suited to them?" "It is destroying the  military institution," Arciniega said in answer to his own  question. "What we are seeing now, with the arbitrary  replacements and retirements, breaks down morale and military  discipline."    "Fabrications are used against many officers to get them out  of the career path rapidly, without giving them any chance to  defend themselves," he said.    He recalled the experience of the military during the 12  years of the dictatorial Armed Forces regime (1968-80). "It was  an experience that taught us to respect democracy. We had been  trained to respect the democratic system, to think about  strengthening it."    "None of us in the military truly favored what is now  happening, i.e., a dictatorship," he said.    He recalled that the Armed Forces respected the governments  of Fernando Belaunde Terry and Alan Garcia Perez even though, in  his opinion, the latter had a poor government that was poorly  handled.    He said the military also respected Fujimori's election. "We  made sure Fujimori would take office as president," he added.    Arciniega bitterly observed that, far from following a  democratic path, Fujimori had yielded to advice from Montesinos,  whom he labeled as a "little Pinochet who probably thinks that  democracy is not a solution for these times."    Analyzing Fujimori's ascent to power in the midst of a grave  economic crisis and the Peruvian people's great disillusionment  with their political leaders, the former military official said  the victory had even surprised Fujimori. "I am sure he must also  have been surprised at becoming president," Arciniega said.    Concerning the constitutional referendum called by  Fujimori's  government following the coup, Arciniega warned that the people  "are beginning to realize, are reflecting upon Fujimori's  authoritarian plans. It all teaches us a lesson."    He insisted on blaming Montesinos for the political  direction  and institutional crisis that has occurred in Peru recently,  particularly, he noted, when a president comes to power "without  any political platform or party."    "That is why Fujimori is surrounded by a bunch of rascals  who  say `This is ours,' and who assume Machiavellian power over the  regime," he concluded.    "Montesinos is Machiavellian. He is not stupid. Since he  knows military structure--he was lucky enough to be an aide to a  foreign minister like General Edgardo Mercado Jarrin--he is  learning how to destabilize institutions," Arciniega observed.    Arciniega said that unlike under the military government of  the late General Juan Velasco Alvarado, when "there was  agreement" on committing the Armed Forces as an institution to  back a government, "the situation is different now because only  a small group supports the regime."    "Today we have precisely the opposite situation because,  little by little, they are removing the best officers who have  democratic convictions."    "What one foresees for the Armed Forces is not only very  serious, but dreadful," Arciniega warned, maintaining that Army  officers are quite bewildered because "future prospects for any  career military man are disappearing."    Echoing his comrade in exile, General Robles, Arciniega said  there is no need for a coup d'etat to change the current  political, economic, and social situation in Peru.    "I think the people are wise. The people will have to  marshal  their own courage because sooner or later they will realize that  this political platform is barbaric," he said.    He said that President Fujimori's "luck is running out" and  that international pressure after the 5 April "self-coup" forced  him to redraft his plan and offer a new constitution.    Arciniega said the new constitution is an "aberration,"  adding that the argument that the coup was necessary in order to  change the constitution "is a lie because the 1979 Constitution  even had its own procedures for modification. The only thing  needed was a consensus and not an outrage like the coup."    In the exiled general's opinion, "it is easy to foresee that  the new constitution will not last because sooner or later the  people will reflect and realize that it is a plan to keep one  group in power."    "I do not think that Fujimori and Montesinos ever read the  history of Peru or took the time to read the important things  thoroughly, (....) and now they are playing with Peru's fate,"  he emphasized.    He said the people will reflect and see "that this is all a  failure, that this man has been a liar, and they will not vote  for Fujimori. The next person elected will have to institute a  proper political trial of him and all of his advisers who have  tried to destroy Peru."    Concerning General Jaime Salinas Sedo, now in prison for  conspiring against Fujimori, Arciniega claimed that he would  have advised him "not to attempt the coup" because "it was  outrageous only two weeks away from the CCD elections. He played  right into Fujimori's hands."    With respect to his political future, Arciniega admits that  his military career is over, but says another phase is now  beginning for which "I have to prepare myself, take a course in  politics, and be ready to face challenges."    He said that Peru's future political leaders should be  transparent, authentic, and not deceitful or mediocre.    Arciniega did not conceal his sympathy for a possible  presidential candidacy of former UN Secretary General Javier  Perez de Cuellar, believing that "he is a man who has  demonstrated his ability at the highest level of international  politics." However, he said, the Peruvian people might not  understand him.    At the close of this lengthy interview, Arciniega asked to  listen to a tape of a band playing the national anthem and the  Army hymn, "to help me recall the most intense times of my life  in the military," he said. However, he confessed that he  occasionally hums the words of a well-known tango: "Remember, my  brother, the days when...."</p>

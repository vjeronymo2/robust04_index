			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Best troupers in the world - As they return home Alastair Macaulay pays homage to the Bolshoy dancers THE Bolshoy Ballet brings its 37-day season at the Albert Hall to a close on Sunday. Dire rumours about the bleak financial conditions that the company had to endure were rife; and some of them were surely true. And yet the company showed few signs of wear and tear. How they gave] For seven performances a week, the Moscow dancers kept returning to the Albert Hall stage, generous and expansive and open. They are the best troupers in the world. How they keep up their verve and good spirits is a mystery. Yuri Grigorovich's productions are blatantly weak: they do not tell their stories clearly; they insert meaningless 'pure-dance' waffle where some basic gesture would have been far more expressive; and they thwack out a dreadfully limited dance vocabulary for oomph impact. (The fact that they have been reduced to highlights 'suite' format here this season has done them little harm, because they are really just a string of highlights anyway.) Then there is the puzzling way in which the Bolshoy replaces one ballerina with another without making an announcement. One Saturday afternoon Inna Petrova and Yuri Vasyuchenko danced Giselle. The programme said that the audience was seeing Nadezhda Gracheva and Andrei Uvarov. If I were Petrova, I would stamp my little foot and have a tantrum. Maybe she did, offstage. Onstage, however, she danced calmly and devoutly. This kind of thing, as any Bolshoy fan can tell you, is nothing new. The powerful irony behind the season was that Irek Mukhamedov, the great star of the Bolshoy's 1986 and '89 seasons here, has been dancing with the Royal at Covent Garden. It was strange to see Spartacus at the Albert Hall and to find that Mukhamedov's massive intensity is still writ large all over the ballet's title role - writ into the music. Strange, too, to remember that he seemed to be the Bolshoy's figurehead, first-cast hero of such big Grigorovich productions as The Golden Age, Spartacus and Ivan the Terrible - whereas now he is often second- or third-cast with the Royal. Yet just look at the roles he has been dancing at Covent Garden while the Bolshoy was at the Albert Hall: the Prince in The Sleeping Beauty (a role the Bolshoy did not give him when it brought Beauty here in '89), the title role of Apollo (a ballet made by the century's two greatest Russian emigres, Stravinsky and Balanchine, both extending classicism as no Soviet art ever conceived), and the leading male role of Kenneth MacMillan's The Judas Tree (a piece of socialist realism beyond all Soviet practice). When Mukhamedov was with the Bolshoy, he still had an astounding jump. He hovered, in The Golden Age, like some dense thundercloud over the heads of the company. He has never jumped like that with the Royal; and, from his first Royal performance on, he has sometimes shown a heaviness of landing such as he never did before. But while the Grigorovich repertory capitalised on his sheer athleticism, it gave small range to his artistry. Dancing here in ballets by Ashton, MacMillan, Nijinska and Balanchine, Mukhamedov has displayed more musical acuity, range, and dramatic subtlety than the Bolshoy ever let him reveal. Of the Bolshoy - as of so many ballet companies these days - it can be said that the first time you saw them was the best. Spartacus and The Golden Age are altogether less galvanic without Mukhamedov. But then, tremendous as he was (is), film shows that Vassiliev (in the 1960s and '70s) was even more overwhelming. I could never forget my first sight of the Bolshoy on TV in 1969 (the Spartacus suite and Carmen). And it seems that nobody who saw Ulanova here in 1956 has been quite the same since. And yet, and yet. The Bolshoy remains uniquely endearing. Young Nadezhda Gracheva still has the phenomenal leg-extensions that made her electrifying with the Bolshoy School here in 1987, and with the Bolshoy Opera in 1990, and she has gained a new upper-body finesse. Galina Stepanenko is still steely, but she has more musical wit than before. Inna Petrova - who danced soloist role here in 1989 - is now taking ballerina, roles with assurance and shy, sweet grace. Andrei Uvarov's jump was one of the talking-points of the season; and his phrasing is nobility itself. As for Spartacus, it is true that it no longer has Mukhamedov, or Vassiliev, or Lavrovsky. It is true that it is actually trash (no better as art than Ben Hur, or Flash Gordon). But it is still Spartacus  - meaty, crude, thrilling, camp and fun. The daftest moment always comes at curtain-calls, when the Roman troops salute in answer to Crassus and then the slaves all salute in answer to Spartacus. This season, the BBC Concert Orchestra - the loyal band for this Albert Hall season - all waited for Spartacus's cue, and then joined in the slaves' salute too. Silly, lovable, marvellous.</p>

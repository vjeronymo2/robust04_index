			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] On 5 October, the Public and  Community Development Association, Thai Red Cross, Department of  Public Welfare, and private companies issued a statement on the  "Ban Than Nam Chai" project. This statement was issued by Mr.  Michai Wirawaithaya, president of the association; Mr. Wirasit  Titthitrai, deputy director for social affairs of the AIDS  Project, Thai Red Cross; Mrs. Suraphi Wasinon from the  Department of Public Welfare, and Dr. Usa Thitsayadon, an  obstetrician at Chulalongkorn Hospital.    Concerning the AIDS situation, Mr. Michai said that the  number of people with AIDS continues to rise. In particular, the  rate of infection among prostitutes and drug addicts is very  high. And a very worrisome group is pregnant women, among whom  the rate of infection has doubled since last year, increasing  from 1 percent to almost 2 percent this year. Every year, about  2 million women become pregnant. Thus, about 20,000 pregnant  women have AIDS. Almost 6,000 infants have been born with AIDS  and died.    About two-thirds of the children who survive, that is  approximately 18,000 [as published], will become orphans because  the mother will die of AIDS. The Department of Public Welfare  cannot look after all these children who have lost their  mothers, because the number of such children is double the  number that the department is now looking after. [passage  omitted]    Mr. Michai said that the risk of contracting AIDS is 10 to  30  times greater for those who have a venereal disease, which  includes syphilis, herpes, and chancroid. In particular, those  people who have syphilis and who contract the AIDS virus usually  die very quickly. The virus, which usually spreads to the brain  slowly, will spread to the brain very rapidly.    "AIDS will continue to spread as long as Thai men continue  to  have sexual relations with prostitutes. Today, there are about  600,000 to 800,000 people with the disease, or an average of  approximately 700,000. This figure comes from the Ministry of  Public Health."    Mr. Wirasit talked about youths and housewives. He said that  it is very difficult to control the spread of this disease in  these groups. The average age of these people is between 20 and  29. In these two groups, the number of people with AIDS is  increasing at a rate of 500 to 700 people a day.    "Women are at great risk of contracting AIDS because they  trust their husbands. Today, about 5 to 10 people a day are  dying from AIDS. I obtained this figure from the Epidemiology  Division, [reports on] military conscripts with AIDS, and  hospital reports on pregnant women and children with AIDS."    As for the number of people who have died from AIDS at  various hospitals, particularly hospitals in northern provinces,  about 1 to 2 people a day are dying at each of the hospitals. At  present, the ratio of men to women with AIDS is about 2:1.    Dr. Usa said that today, a large number of children have  AIDS. This is clear from the fact that approximately 300 infants  born at Chulalongkorn Hospital were born with AIDS. About  one-third of these will die within 2 to 3 years. The rest will  die by the age of 10. [passage omitted]</p>

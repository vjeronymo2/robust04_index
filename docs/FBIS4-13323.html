			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Munir al-Maqdah, a leader of the dissident </F> Fatah Movement in south Lebanon, by Najwa Marun; place and date  not given]    [Excerpts] [Marun] How do you view the progress of the  Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho?    [Al-Maqdah] Israeli withdrawal? What is happening is a  deployment. Rabin was very explicit when he said that  "redeployment in Gaza and Jericho by 13 April will need a  miracle." We feel that even if the Palestinians enter Gaza and  Jericho under the Israeli thumb to form a beachhead for the Arab  homeland, this would only last a certain period, not more than a  year. In the past we said that Yasir 'Arafat had entered a dark  tunnel but today we say that he is entering Hell. He can  neither retreat nor advance. As to what is happening in Gaza  and Jericho, we are against this return. We have stated our  position on the Oslo agreement and what has followed it. All  that has happened is treachery. Everyday we hear comments here  and there that there is progress in the negotiations or a delay.  Why is this so surprising? The Jews do not honor pledges or  promises. They will continue to prevaricate for years to come  and 'Arafat will continue negotiations but he will not even  "smell" Gaza or Jericho. [passage omitted]    [Marun] Are there still contacts between you and those who  oppose the peace negotiations in the Arab world?    [Al-Maqdah] Of course. We have recently stepped up these  contacts. "Fatah" is large and is everywhere, not only in  Beirut's streets, as you can see. Fatah is the Fatah of the  armed struggle, of the Katyusha, and of Dalal al-Mughrabi.    [Marun] There is increased talk on the part of the Lebanese  regime that the time to apply security measures to everyone is  coming.    [Al-Maqdah] The economic and non-economic siege against us  continues. Threats to remove or absorb the refugee camps are  intensifying, but we continue the struggle. We will not lay  down our arms (he said this three times with great  determination) until they give us our political rights. We are  not demanding anything more than our political rights so we will  not be treated like temporary guests, as in Syria. Our rifles  are for resistance and for the revolution. They are the rifles  of tens of thousands of martyrs, and not for blowing up  churches, killing old people and children, or disturbing  peaceful towns. We have had enough of them telling us who can  do what and when. Our camps have gates and we welcome anyone  who visits us. [passage omitted]    [Marun] It is known that Syria holds the "Hizballah" card in  Lebanon. Who is holding the "Palestinian" card?    [Al-Maqdah] Our position in the Middle East is bolstered by  the firm Syrian stand, which does not go along with everything  the United States wants. The Syrians cannot abandon the  territories or the principles laid down since 1947, which it has  followed to this day, especially under President Hafiz al-Asad.  This man does not tire; he is silent and patient; and he knows  how to lead the battle in the field. He holds all the Middle  East cards in his hand, and this reassures us deeply. There is  not a single Arab country on the map that is not frightened,  except Syria. Many of the Arab countries have succumbed; only  Syria stands alone in the arena despite the pressures and  threats to it.    [Marun] Does this mean that Syria is holding your card and  that is why you are continuing your opposition?    [Al-Maqdah] I did not ask anyone's permission when I chose  to  oppose [the Oslo agreement]. I was convinced, as were all those  who agreed with me, that the course pursued by 'Arafat would  result in Palestine being sold out. I have not met with any  Syrian officials to this day. We feel the Syrian stand is  sacred. We have said, and I reiterate, that our rifles are at  the Syrian army's disposal because time has proved the  credibility of this stand, which is honorable for the Arab  nation. [passage omitted]    [Marun] How are you living under the siege imposed on you?    [Al-Maqdah] We called on our contacts when all the  humanitarian organizations stopped helping us. The "Palestinian  Martyrs' Foundation" (an Iranian organization under Tabataba'i)  was the only one that supplied us with what we needed. It built  the huge "al-Ma'shuq" hospital in the camp and also gave monthly  allowances to the martyrs' families. This aid is not limited to  the Palestinians in Lebanon but also goes to those in the  occupied territories. [passage omitted]    [Marun] What do you think 'Arafat's fate will be?    [Al-Maqdah] 'Arafat's traits are unique. Only 'Arafat enjoys  strong support from European and reactionary Arab countries, and  all the Palestinian people's funds are in his own name.  Following the martyrdom of [senior Fatah officials]  Abu-al-Hawl, Abu-Jihad, and Abu-Iyad, I believe that if 'Arafat  were killed, Arab regimes from Egypt to Algeria would collapse  and there would be trouble in Tunisia. All the U.S. desires to  protect 'Arafat's life, the great Egyptian support for him, and  the major Western financial support for him would suffer from  'Arafat's death and not only with regard to the Gaza-Jericho  plan. I believe that his demise is imminent and our return to  Palestine is not that far off. "They see it far off but we see  it close," God willing.    [Marun] After what you have just said, if 'Arafat were  killed, then you would be the first to be accused.    [Al-Maqdah] This is a great honor for me. We know well the  fate of every traitor. 'Arafat's removal means return to the  Palestinian home, to collective decisions, to Arab coordination,  to the "Fatah" home, and to the Palestinian charter. There will  be great and numerous achievements when he disappears. Money  will be of no use when the day of reckoning comes. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dieter Teichmann, DIW Tax Expert, by W. </F> Jakobs; place and date not given]    [Text] [Jakobs] Herr Teichmann, according to your  professional colleague Ruediger Pohl of the Haller Institute for  Economic Research, the supplementary tax being demanded by the  SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] will have a "harmful  effect on the economy." A tax such as this would drive investors  out of Germany--is this a serious assessment or is it  scaremongering?    [Teichmann] Whether or not this is scaremongering, I cannot  judge. I do not believe that the will to achieve would be  decisively weakened by a supplementary tax of 10 percent, which,  because of the tax increase being planned by the government for  those in the higher income brackets, would actually lead to an  increased tax burden of only 2.5 percent. This same weakening  would also have to result from the 7.5 percent solidarity  contribution that has been decided upon by the government.    [Jakobs] You do not fear an economically counterproductive  overtaxing of the so-called achievement sustainers?    [Teichmann] One must consider that a three-tiered  (1986/88/90) major tax reform has taken place. It was especially  those in the medium and upper income brackets who profited from  this tax reduction program. For a single person with a yearly  income of 50,000 German marks [DM], the maximum tax rate went  down by 16 percentage points as a result. With the surcharge  being discussed now, persons in this income group would lose  only a small portion of what they gained through the tax  reductions of the past. Compared to the plans of the government,  the SPD proposal would equate in this income group to an  increased burden of DM27 per month. Circa 85 percent of those  paying taxes would pay no surcharge at all in the event the SPD  plans were implemented.    [Jakobs] The government wants to place the tax burden on  all,  the SPD only on those with gross incomes of more than DM60,000  or DM120,000 [single or married taxpayers]. Which of these  would be more appropriate for the promotion of the economy?    [Teichmann] The SPD plans would be better suited to  strengthen the economic situation, since the  consumption-intensive lower incomes would not be burdened, in  contrast to the proposal of the government. In the upper income  bracket, on the other hand, the savings quota would be higher.    [Jakobs] Former Munich Lord Mayor Georg Kronawitter (SPD)  has  made a plea for placing a greater tax burden on the enormous  "unearned capital gains" being realized by owners of real  estate. Would that be a practicable course to take, and how much  revenue would it generate?    [Teichmann] In view of the public financial need, I view the  greater taxation of such assets as appropriate and just.  Especially if one takes into consideration the fact that the  standard values serving as the basis for taxation have been set  far too low. A doubling of the standard values, for example,  would lead to two-digit billion [DM] increases in wealth and  property tax payments.</p>

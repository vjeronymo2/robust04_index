			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / International Company News: Girocredit cuts pay-out as profits slip to Sch1.3bn GIROCREDIT, Austria's third largest bank, has reported an 18 per cent fall in 1992 operating profits to Sch1.3bn (Dollars 113m) from Sch1.58bn. The bank employed Sch2bn in hidden reserves to cover provisions for bad loans last year - less than half the amount in 1991. The dividend to its shareholders, who consist of various Austrian savings banks, has been cut from 8 per cent to 3 per cent. Mr Hans Haumer, chairman, forecast an increase in 1993 earnings after operating profits for the first two months climbed 17 per cent from the year earlier level. Assets of Girocredit climbed 3 per cent to Sch324bn from Sch315bn. Girocredit, which acts as a clearing house for Austria's savings institutions, is in talks with Erste, the Vienna-based savings bank, and several leading provincial banks to combine most of the savings and loans sector.</p>

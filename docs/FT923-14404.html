			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Telecom talks to computer groups FRANCE TELECOM, the state-owned telecommunications company, is in talks with two of Europe's major computing services companies which could lead to it taking a stake in either or both. Telecom has relationships with a number of small computing services companies but has yet to take a stake in a large group. It already holds a 17 per cent stake in Groupe Bull, the state-owned computer manufacturer. Sema Group, the Anglo-French computing services company quoted in London, confirmed that it has been discussing a possible industrial partnership with Telecom in telecommunications. Sema is anxious to develop its telecommunications interests, which at present represent only 7 per cent of its Pounds 412.5m turnover. Sema disclosed that France Telecom is also having discussions with Paribas, the French bank which holds a 39.1 per cent stake in Sema. The discussions could lead to Paribas's shareholding being transferred to a new holding company, jointly held by the bank and France Telecom, in which Paribas would be the majority shareholder. A decision is expected within a month. Mr Michel Jalabert, a president of Cap-Gemini-Sogeti (CGS), the leading European-owned computing services group, confirmed that it was also talking to Telecom. CGS, he said, had enjoyed a close relationship with Telecom for 25 years but there was, as yet, no equity involvement. Mr Jalabert said the two sets of talks were linked, but this was fiercely denied by Sema. CGS holds a 29 per cent stake in Sema and cannot increase it beyond 30 per cent without making a full bid under London Stock Exchange rules. A Sema spokesperson said: 'We have an arms-length relationship with CGS and there is no question of roundtable discussions.' Another Sema shareholder, Schneider SA, with a 10.5 per cent stake, said it wanted to reduce its investment but would not do so without the consent of the Sema board. At one level, the talks are being seen as a minor adjustment of shareholdings, rather than a major reshuffle within the European computing services industry. Telecommunications companies worldwide, however, are seeking relationships with computing companies to broaden their service offerings.</p>

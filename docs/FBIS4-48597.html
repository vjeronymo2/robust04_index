			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Guy Rogers and Patrick Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg May 20 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela  said on Friday the first he heard of the "land deal" between  KwaZulu and the former South African Government was in media  reports.    In his reaction to the same issue, which hit the headlines  on  Friday morning, former President F W de Klerk denied the  transaction was a "secret deal" or that it was hatched up to  draw the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] into the elections.    The two leaders were reacting to a report that three million  hectares of land were transferred to Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini under the Ingonyama [King's] Land Trust Act in return  for the IFP's participation in the April poll. In its front-page  story, the WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN called it a "highly  secretive deal".    A senior source in the Department of Regional and Land  Affairs, who did not want to be named, told SAPA the impression  he had gained was the deal had been decided in talks between Mr  Mandela, former President F W de Klerk and IFP President  Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    But the statement from Mr Mandela's office on Friday night  said he wished "to state categorically that he only became aware  of the land deal today". Neither he nor any official in his  African National Congress had been involved in discussions on  the alleged deal.    Mr de Klerk said there was no truth in the allegation by the  WEEKLY MAIL that he had "secretly" handed land to King Goodwill.  The transaction had its origin in the adoption of the KwaZulu  Ingonyama Trust Bill, which was openly debated and adopted by  the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly (KLA) -- "so there can be no  question of any kind of secrecy or of any action 'behind the  backs of the people'."    Mr de Klerk said the bill was presented to him for signature  on April 25. In terms of his constitutional duties he was  obliged to approve legislation which had ben duly adopted by the  KLA on matters which fell within its area of competance. "I  nevertheless took special steps before signing... to ascertain  whether it did, in fact, fall within the competence (of the KLA).    "I was assured that in terms of Act No 21 of 1971 it did."    Mr de Klerk said the purpose of the act was not to place any  obstacle in the way of future land redistribution or to limit  the powers of any future government. Neither was the transaction  part of a deal between the government, the Zulu king, the IFP  and Mr Mandela to ensure Inkatha's participation in the  election, as had been alleged.    A statement from Home Affairs Minister and IFP President  Mangosuthu Buthelezi said accusations of a "secretive" deal were  nothing but "cheap politicking and mischief-making by people who  do not want peace in our troubled land". He said the intention  of the Ingonyama Trust Act was to "return the land to the tribes  and communities to whom it originally belonged before it was  taken away by statutory prescription after the Zulu conquest.    "It is our tradition that all land belongs to the king, who  holds it in trust for the people. He cannot dispose of it in  terms of the act."    Senior officials in the Department of Regional and Land  Affairs told SAPA it was widely understood the land transaction,  involving three million hectares, was a deal linked to a  constitutional settlement whose effect was aimed at ending the  IFP's elections boycott.    The effect of the legislation passed was to exempt KwaZulu  tribal land from the provision that all self-governing  territories land was to become the property of central  government under the new constitution.    One official who did not want to be named said KwaZulu  government officials made several approaches to the department's  legal advisers for assistance in drawing up the legislation.  They had been refused on the grounds that the self-governing  territories drafted their own legislation for the final approval  of the state president.    However, their approaches eventually resulted in the  department's legal advisers going to Ulundi on April 21 to draw  up the law in conjunction with the KwaZulu government's legal  advisers.    The law was passed by the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly on  April 22 and was approved by Mr de Klerk on April 25 when  Parliament sat to pass constitutional amendments whose effect  was to draw the IFP into the elections. The amendments conferred  greater powers on provincial structures and secured the position  of King Goodwill in Natal/KwaZulu's executive structures.    The WEEKLY MAIL reported the deal took ANC Chief Negotiator  Cyril Ramaphosa and new Lands Minister Derek Hanekom by  surprise. The story claimed the deal left little land for  redistribution under the new government's land redistribution  policies.    In a statement, Mr Hanekom said he became aware of the land  deal only after enquiries by the media. "It has been ascertained  that senior leaders of both the IFP and the ANC in Natal had no  knowledge of the passage of this act.    "The Ministry of Land Affairs is deeply concerned about this  issue and is at the moment investigating both the process that  led to the passage of this act as well as its legal  implications," he said.    Mr Mandela said on Friday night he would issue a more  comprehensive statement as soon as he had studied the act and  consulted all the concerned parties.</p>

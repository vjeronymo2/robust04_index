			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Proposed Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Student Assistance General Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.57(c)&blank;Acceptable Documentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The verification regulations contained in subpart E of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations (34 CFR part 688) govern verification of the information that is used to calculate an applicant's expected family contribution (EFC) as part of determining an applicant's need for student financial assistance. The EFC is the amount that an applicant and the applicant's family reasonably can be expected to contribute toward the applicant's cost of attendance at an institution of higher education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, dependent applicants are required to provide the signature of both parents when verifying the number of family household members enrolled in postsecondary institutions. The Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;668.57(c) to require the signature of one parent instead of both parents. If only one parent's income is considered in the title IV, HEA aid awarding process, that is the parent who must sign. Otherwise, either parent may sign. This amendment is being proposed in an effort to reduce the administrative burden imposed on applicants and institutions by the verification requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Campus-Based Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 674.2 and 675.2&blank;Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulations restrict eligibility for Federal Perkins Loan and FWS assistance for undergraduate students to those who have not already earned baccalaureate or first professional degrees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amendments changed the Federal Perkins Loan and FWS programs to provide that a student is not ineligible for assistance because he or she has previously received a baccalaureate or professional degree. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to amend the definition of ``undergraduate student'' to delete the restriction from the current Federal Perkins Loan and FWS regulations. The statutory restriction remains for the FSEOG program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 674.4, 675.4, and 676.4&blank;Allocation and Reallocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;&sect;674.4, 675.4, and 676.4 in accordance with amended sections 413D(e)(2), 422(e)(2), and 462(j)(4) of the HEA to state that if an institution returns more than 10 percent of its Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, or FSEOG allocation for an award year, the institution will have its allocation for the next fiscal year for that program reduced by the dollar amount returned. The Amendments established this requirement for the Federal Perkins Loan and FSEOG programs. The same requirement was provided for the FWS Program by the Technical Amendments. These statutory provisions authorize the Secretary to take appropriate measures to ensure effective use of program funds when an institution fails to expend its allocation. The Secretary may waive these provisions if enforcement would be contrary to the interest of the programs. To accomplish the purpose of the statute, the Secretary expects to find enforcement to be contrary to the interest of the program in very limited circumstances, such as a natural disaster.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 674.10, 675.10, and 676.10&blank;Selection of Students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;&sect;674.10, 675.10, and 676.10 in accordance with amended sections 413C(d), 443(b)(3), and 464(b)(2) of the HEA to state that if an institution's FSEOG allocation, FWS grant, or Federal Perkins Loan capital contribution is directly or indirectly based in part on the financial need of less-than-full-time or independent students and if the need of all of these students exceeds 5 percent of the total need of all students at an institution, then at least 5 percent of that allotment for FSEOG, 5 percent of that grant for FWS, or 5 percent of the dollar amount of the loans made for Federal Perkins must be made available to these students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 674.14, 675.14, and 676.14&blank;Overaward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A financial aid administratrato may not award or disburse aid from a campus-based program if that aid, when combined with all other resources, would exceed the student's need. Before awarding aid from campus-based programs, the aid administrator must take into account the aid that the student will receive from other student financial assistance programs and other resources that the aid administrator knows about or can reasonably anticipate at the time aid is awarded to the student. If the student receives additional resources at any time during the award period that were not considered in determining the student's eligibility for aid, and these resources combined with the expected financial aid will exceed the student's need, the amount in excess of the student's need is considered an overaward.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the situation in which an institution learns that a student has received additional resources that were not included in calculating the student's eligibility for financial assistance, the regulations for the three campus-based programs currently permit a student's resources to exceed the student's financial need by no more than $200. Further, the current regulations allow an institution to continue to employ a student under the FWS program after the full financial need has been met until the student's cumulative earnings from both need-based and non-need-based employment exceed his or her financial need by more than $200.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 443(b)(4) of the HEA has been amended to allow a student employed under the FWS program to earn up to $300 from need-based employment in excess of his or her financial need before employment under the FWS program must be discontinued. In addition, for the purpose of determining when FWS funds may no longer be used to pay the student, an institution will not be required to monitor the student's non-need-based earnings. (However, as in the past, earnings from non-need-based employment will be counted as income for the following year.) Therefore, the Secretary is proposing to amend the regulations for the FWS program in accordance with the statute to provide that a student employed under the FWS program may continue to receive FWS funding after the student's full financial need has been met until the student's cumulative earnings from need-based employment exceed his or her financial need by more than $300.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute does not address the common situation whereby a student receives a financial aid package consisting of an FWS award in combination with a Federal Perkins Loan or FSEOG award or both. The Secretary is proposing to change the current $200 overaward threshold for this situation. Under the proposed change, if FWS is awarded to a student by itself or in combination with one or both of the other campus-based programs, then a $300 overaward threshold will be in effect. However, under the proposed change, if a student is not employed under the FWS program but is receiving a Federal Perkins Loan or FSEOG, the current regulatory $200 overaward threshold will still be in effect for those programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In making awards, an institution may not make campus-based awards in excess of the amount of the student's need. Although a threshold is allowed subsequent to the packaging of campus-based aid, the threshold does not allow an institution deliberately to award campus-based aid that, in combination with other resources, exceeds the student's financial need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

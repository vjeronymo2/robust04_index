			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (CNS) -- Chairman of the Chinese  Association for the Handicapped Mr. Deng Pufang said that to  talk of humanitarianism and human rights without taking into  account clothing and food problems was insincere and unrealistic.    In a press conference on a sports meeting for the  handicapped  in the Far East and South Pacific region, Mr. Deng, the son of  Deng Xiaoping, made these remarks in reply to a question on the  relationship between humanitarianism and human rights. He said  that humanitarianism and human rights were closely related with  the former regarded as an ideal to be sought for which covers  the fact that every person is entitled to enjoy the rights of  man and humanitarianism can help realize the value of mankind.  He added that China put a strong emphasis on humanitarianism  and human rights. During the last few years China did its very  best to protect the rights and interests of the handicapped.    With China's reform and open door policy going further, Mr.  Deng said that the living standard of the general public was  becoming better while that of the handicapped was improving  gradually. He added that there had been dramatic changes in  China in the past few years when people's lives took a turn for  the better. People could achieve their goal and hopes through  their own efforts.    Mr. Deng pointed out that generally speaking the living  standard for handicapped people in China had to some extent  improved while many disabled people were still facing various  kinds of difficulties including clothing and food problems with  their economic life in no way guaranteed.</p>

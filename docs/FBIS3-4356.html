On display are equipment and technology of nuclear power  plants, recycling of nuclear fuel, radioisotope products and  nuclear waste treatment equipment.    About 80 nuclear companies from China and abroad contributed  to the exhibition, including some of the world's leading nuclear  companies, such as the Framatome company, the Power Industry  Corporation from France and Westinghouse from the U.S.    The exhibition is co-sponsored by the China Council for the  Promotion of International Trade, the Chinese Nuclear Society  (CNS) and the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation.    The exhibition aims to promote foreign exchanges and  cooperation in this industry, and to promote peaceful use of  nuclear technology, said a CNS spokesman.    He said that as a standing member of the International  Atomic  Energy Association [as received], China has had relations with  more than 40 countries and regions and has trade relations with  100 foreign clients.    With China's rapid economic development, the country has  made  great progress in isotope and radiation technology, radiation  processing and nuclear instrumentation, he said.    The first Chinese nuclear power plant, Qin Shan nuclear  power  plant in east China's Zhejiang Province, is now safely and  efficiently operating, while the first unit of the Daya Bay  nuclear power station bordering Hong Kong in Guangdong Province  recently went into commercial operation.    Some other provinces and cities, especially coastal areas,  are planning to build more new nuclear power plants.</p>

The  Bosnian ambassador to the United Nations, Muhamed Secirbegovic,  announcing the planned boycott request on Dutch television, said  it would go out mainly to Muslim countries. Mr. Secirbegovic  said that the Bosnian Muslims feel betrayed by Western countries  that make pledges but fail to translate them into action. The  Bosnian ambassador said the international boycott must be  directed against countries that obstruct military intervention.</p>

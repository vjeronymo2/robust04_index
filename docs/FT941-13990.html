			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Single premium side ahead at Allied Dunbar Allied Dunbar, one of the 10 largest UK life insurance companies, yesterday announced its new business figures for 1993, showing steady growth in single premium business. The figures reflected the pattern elsewhere in the life industry, with single premium business gaining, while annual premium business fell back, as economic uncertainties such as fear of unemployment have made people more reluctant to commit themselves to long-term policies. Allied Dunbar's new single premiums rose sharply from Pounds 631m in 1992 to Pounds 865m. Within that total, however, there was a switch of business, as single premium investments rose by 79 per cent to Pounds 548.6m (Pounds 307m), but single premium pensions fell slightly from Pounds 323.5m to Pounds 315.8m. New annual premiums also dropped slightly, from Pounds 162.1m to Pounds 158.5m. New critical illness cover almost doubled, from Pounds 887m in 1992 to Pounds 1.62bn. The company said the rise suggested a market trend towards buying life and critical illness together, rather than buying just life cover. The company, which is a subsidiary of BAT Industries, attributed much of the overall increase to its direct sales force, which numbers some 4,200 sales agents. National Mutual Life, a pensions specialist which markets entirely through independent financial advisers, said yesterday that its new business had risen to Pounds 236.1m, compared with Pounds 133.9m in 1992. There was a particularly steep increase in its single premium new business from Pounds 87.5m to Pounds 151.8m. Its regular premium new business also rose, from Pounds 16m to Pounds 27.2m.</p>

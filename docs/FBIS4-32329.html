			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Czech President Vaclav Havel at a dinner given in </F> his honor by Romanian President Ion Iliescu, in Bucharest on 21  June -- recorded; Havel speaks in Czech with passage-by-passage  translation into Romanian; translated from the Romanian]    [Text] Esteemed Mr. President, esteemed ladies and  gentlemen, it is a great honor for me to be present here in the  capital city of Romania, a country that has for our homeland  such friendly, open, and cordial relations. I wish to thank you  for the pleasant welcome and warm hospitality extended to me.    Mr. President, we have held negotiations that tomorrow will  be crowned with the signing of the basic treaty between our two  countries. This treaty is going to bring our relations to where  I consider that they should be, that is, to the level of states  that not only demonstrate their natural mutual interests and  respect for each other, but, first of all, have decided to move  on to the path of effort and intensive work, which should bring  them to where their rightful place is, that is, among the  developed countries of Europe, because our states respect the  same values and nurture the same ideals. These feelings are  strongly rooted in the traditions of the European cultural  space. Talking about this cultural space, I cannot help  recalling that what inextricably binds Romania, its culture and  history, to this space is the work of certain creative Romanian  personalities such as Eugen Ionesco, Tristan Tzara, Mircea  Elide, Constantin Bancusi, and others.    In the 19th and 20th century, first of all it was Prague  that  meant the magic city for them, with an irresistible force of  attraction. Prague was visited by [Mihai] Eminescu, the  greatest Romanian poet. Constantin Brancusi exhibited his work  here before World War I. In the twenties Lucian Blaga came  here, and Nicolae Iorga worked hard for Czech-Romanian relations.    Allow me also to recall some more painful elements that are  preserved in our minds. We recently laid wreaths in (?Klovcie)  in Moravia at the monument that commemorates Romanian soldiers  who fell in battles 50 years ago, fighting for the liberation of  our country. I have realized how close our countries can be.  Thousands of soldiers lost their lives in our homeland,  fighting far from their homes to free us from the chains of  slavery that they themselves had to endure for several years.  We never want to forget these ties.    Mr. President, certainly we are all aware that our  countries,  just as in the past, are still connected by a series of  historical, cultural, and economic relations. Romania and the  Czech Republic represent an image of history and of ancient  cultures to which our countries have been host. The traces of  this common cultural history can be found everywhere in our  countries. And this is not the only thing that attracts us  here. Your country is a place with a lot of beauties highly  valued by all those who have had the chance to become acquainted  with them and I believe this to be essential.    Mr. President, I followed with deep emotion the struggle of  the Romanians against dictatorship, under whose yoke they were  suffering. This dictatorship had very special dimensions and  also special consequences. Unlike our struggle, yours could not  avoid victims, which seriously marked contemporary Romanian  history. Similarly, we have been close witnesses of the stormy  events that followed your revolution, and those events made a  great impression on us. That is how I got to understand even  better how difficult it is for a country to move from  dictatorship to a normal, functional democracy. I understood  that serious work awaits us, which, in order to be crowned with  success, cannot tolerate any delay.    Mr. President, it is my wish that our countries should be  side by side with other countries in Europe, which will no  longer know borders in the traditional sense of the word. There  will no longer be borders of misunderstanding and other types of  separation but rather borders of frankness and sincere  cooperation. Allow me on this occasion to propose a toast for a  future full of promises of relations between our countries, to  the increasing intensity of these relations, not determined by  geographic proximity but rather by the aspirations and joint  goals toward which we are advancing together.    I am also convinced that our current talks and negotiations  will represent a new small brick among those with which we will  be building on the certainly very complicated road that leads to  the achievement of our goals. I propose a toast to your health,  Mr. President, and the health of all our dear hosts, to the  health and happy future of Romania's citizens, with whom I am  confident that we will always be connected in the future through  lasting and friendly relations.</p>

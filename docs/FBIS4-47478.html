Inasmuch as most advantageous is  transition of noble gases to a condensed phase and among all  excimer lasers these lasers emit shortest- wave radiation,  lasers, the most easily achievable Xe[.sub]2[/]-laser is  considered for specificity. The first problem is avoiding  absorption of emission-wavelength radiation under conditions of  high gas densities. The solution of this problem is based on  analysis of the known structure of lower energy levels and  origin of molecular luminescence bands, also helpful being the  known luminescence spectrum of crystalline solid xenon at 5 K  temperature. The most difficult next problem is adequate pumping  of the entire solid or liquid active medium, electric-discharge  pumping being preferable to inefficient pumping by another laser  and difficult to arrange pumping by a lamp. The necessary  conditions for attaining a homogeneous electric discharge with  sufficiently high energy for excitation of Xe atoms by electron  impact are established by analyzing the drift of fast excess  electrons through gaseous and liquid or solid xenon with  attendant elastic scattering by its atoms. As the intensity of  the electric field is increased above E*  _e_/b= 2 kV/cm  for  xenon (_e_- electron energy, b- mean displacement of electron  prior to its thermalization), the energy lost by ``hot''  electrons during their collisions with Xe atoms is increasingly  compensated by the energy imparted to the field so that the net  loss becomes negligible in an electric field of intensity E  &gt; &gt;  E* (3 kV/cm for xenon). A solid Xe-laser constructed according  to these guidelines has an H-form cell with already liquid xenon  between two plane mirrors parallel to its two wide walls. Two  electrodes,anode and cathode, are lining the cell wall on  opposite sides along the narrow middle segment so as to produce  a transverse electric discharge through xenon within this  segment. No electron multiplication takes place in this system  and use of an external electron source is inconvenient. Instead,  for sustaining the discharge, the metal cathode is covered with  a layer of a radioactive target material and a photoemissive  coating of a high-yield (low work function) material on top.  This ensures an electron avalanche by chain multiplication and  thus makes it very likely feasible to build 30 kW lasers  emitting ultraviolet radiation in pulses of up to 1 ms duration  with an up to 30 % efficiency, not only Xe- lasers (172  nm) but  also Kr-lasers (145 nm) and Ar-lasers (128 nm).

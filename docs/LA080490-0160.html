			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOESAK SAYS FUTURE ROLE WILL BE POLITICAL  </P> <P> The Rev. Allan Boesak, a prominent anti-apartheid religious leader in South  Africa, has confirmed his resignation as minister of his church and moderator  of the Dutch Reformed Mission Church in the wake of a reported sex scandal.  </P> <P> Boesak said he is now open to a purely political role in the anti-apartheid  campaign to bring a united, non-racial democracy to South Africa.  </P> <P> Boesak originally announced July 8 that he was leaving his church and his  position as the highest official in the mixed-race denomination. This was two  days after reports in the South African press that he and television journalist  Elna Botha spent four days together at a seafront hotel.  </P> <P> Later reports by his lawyer indicated that Boesak was reconsidering his  decision to leave as minister of his church. Boesak is president of the  Geneva-based World Alliance of Reformed Churches, but he has not resigned from  that organization.  </P> <P> Boesak also said he and his wife, Dorothy, will divorce and that he will  continue to see Botha.  </P></p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Porter fails in move to make auditor quit Dame Shirley Porter, former leader of Westminster City Council, has failed in an attempt to have Mr John Magill, the district auditor, replaced before public hearings this October. Her move was supported by at least one of the other nine former Westminster councillors and officials who, with Lady Porter, Mr Magill has recommended should be surcharged a total of Pounds 21.5m. Lady Porter applied to the Audit Commission, the local authority watchdog, in April to have Mr Magill replaced by a new auditor. Mr Bill Phillips, former chief executive of the council, made a similar application in the month before but both have been rejected. The row follows Mr Magill's preliminary findings in January that 'designated sales' of council houses in the late 1980s were unlawful. He ruled that the policy of removing 500 council properties a year from public ownership was designed to increase owner-occupancy in eight marginal wards and boost the Conservative party vote. It was also at the price of failing to fulfil obligations to the homeless and other priority housing groups. In her letter of complaint to the Audit Commission Lady Porter, through her solicitors Brecher &amp; Co, criticised Mr Magill over the press conference he held in January. The letter says: 'The behaviour of Mr Magill is in our view ill-judged. In these circumstances the removal of Mr Magill is a necessary step in the interests of justice.' She also complained that 'the report and summary prepared by Mr Magill and provided by him to the media go far beyond merely provisional findings'. Mr Magill, in his submission to the Audit Commission, said: 'My note of provisional findings and views makes abundantly clear that my findings and views are provisional only. I retain an open mind.' Mr Roger Rosewell, a spokesman for Lady Porter, said yesterday that it was likely that she would personally ask Mr Magill to stand down before public hearings start in London on October 17 or at the beginning of the hearings. Mr Rosewell said yesterday: 'We have no confidence in his impartiality. We have to persuade him that what he said at the press conference in January was disgraceful.' Mr Magill said earlier this month that he hoped that any approach to him to disqualify himself would come before the beginning of the public hearings to avoid inconvenience.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Requirements for structural assemblies, components, connectors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fasteners, and a number of other areas will be strengthened so that parts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of the home will be able to resist the same wind forces as required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for site-built and modular housing. In addition, the increased wind loads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by this rule are applicable whether structural systems, components,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other aspects of the design are substantiated by engineering analysis or by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitable load tests (see subpart E of part 3280). The revised standards also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that the ground anchoring and foundation support systems continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be designed by a registered engineer or architect in a manner adequate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withstand the higher wind forces specified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Section-by-Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has determined that the following changes should be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the standards:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 3280.4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added to the list of organizations issuing standards that are incorporated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference. The street addresses are corrected for two other organizations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 3280.5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Technical and conforming corrections are made to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standardize paragraph designations to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  format and clarify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to be included on data plates. The new requirements also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporate changes to the data plate adopted in the Energy Rule (58 FR 54975,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 55003) for effect in October 1994, in order to avoid having inconsistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements become effective within a short time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data plate is also being expanded to indicate that manufactured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homes should not be located within 1500 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; of the coastline in Wind Zones II and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III unless the home and its anchoring or foundation system are designed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the increased requirements of Exposure D in ASCE 7&hyph;88. The data plate will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now also indicate whether the home has been equipped with storm shutters and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if shutters are not provided, will strongly recommend that the home be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ready for these devices in accordance with the method described in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sections 3280.302(a)(8), 3280.303(d), 3280.305(c) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and references to ``hurricane resistive design'' in these sections are deleted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in favor of the Wind Zone II and III designations in the revised Basic Wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zone Map. These changes will result in the identification of design wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forces and wind speeds for which the home has been designed, rather than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation of homes as ``hurricane resistive.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 3280.304 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The incorporated standards are amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that the minimum design loads be based on ASCE 7&hyph;88, which replaces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the obsolete ANSI A58.1&hyph;1982 standard currently referenced in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the National Design Specification for Wood Members (NDS),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated by reference, is updated to the most current specification issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA). Because manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will need to redesign the structure's resistance to wind forces, the redesign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be accomplished with the most current design values for wood.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the 1991 NDS is incorporated in its entirety into the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 3280.305(c) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The standards are amended to require that for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured homes in high wind areas, the home and each wind resisting part,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including components and cladding, be completely designed to resist the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wind pressures specified for a 50-year recurrence level by ASCE 7&hyph;88 or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressures specified in a table of equivalent design wind load provisions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department has designated three wind zones: Zone I (current wind design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for Zone I); Zone II (design wind speed of 100 mph); and Zone III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (design wind speed of 110 mph).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Table of Design Pressures in the proposed rule is clarified and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded. Editorial revisions to clarify the application of the uplift  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure requirements for exterior roof coverings, eaves and gables. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, footnotes are included to indicate:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Distributional pressure effects between windward and leeward walls;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The application of the Table is limited to roof slopes between 10 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 degrees and that horizontal drag pressures need not be considered for roof  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slopes under 20 degrees;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The design uplift pressures are the same regardless of whether they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are applied normal to the roof surface or to the horizontal projection of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roof; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Exterior roof and wall coverings (excluding glazing), sheathing, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fastenings need not be evaluated for the design pressures specified by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table, when fastened to a 3/8 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; structural rated sheathing and the sheathing is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oriented and secured to framing members in accordance with the fastening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule specified in the Table.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Basic Wind Zone Map is revised by delineating the boundary between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wind Zones I and II as the 90 mph isotach, and the boundary between Wind Zones  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II and III as the 100 mph isotach, on the ASCE 7&hyph;88 basic wind speed map.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change will result in certain areas of existing Wind Zone II being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located in the modified Wind Zone I. The boundary between Wind Zones I and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III in Alaska is now designated as the 90 mph isotach on the ASCE 7&hyph;88 map.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / The deciding factors It may, so far, be a voteless UK recovery, but it has certainly not been without profit. The healthy earnings figures seen in this reporting season will not excite the electorate, but they highlight the unusually buoyant state of the UK company sector. Given what came before, the divergence between public and corporate sentiment is somewhat to be expected. Whether it continues will depend less on how much cash companies have and rather more on how they decide to spend it. The UK corporate sector's record cash surplus in the first quarter of 1994 crowned a rapid turnround in company balance sheets since the recovery began. This was achieved largely through heavy repayment of debt, made possible, in turn, by the prior resilience of profits. Non-oil profits, currently 28 per cent of on-shore gross domestic product, never fell below 25 per cent in the 1990-92 downturn compared with troughs of about 18 per cent in 1974-75 and 1980-81. How was this achieved? Companies reacted unusually quickly to the onset of recession, running down stocks and labour so as to maintain profit margins, which were given support anyway by the relatively shallow slump in output. As a result, sterling unit labour costs rose by a total of only 12 per cent over the 1990-91 period compared with a cumulative rise of one-third and 57 per cent respectively at a comparable stage in the past two downturns. Continued falls in manufacturing employment and subdued wage growth have helped build profits further as the economy has picked up, though they have done little to raise consumer spirits. High margins Those at the receiving end of that disquiet, notably retailers, have found their profit margins under pressure. But for the economy as a whole margins are high by historical standards. This is one reason why the fear that companies will make up for rising commodity prices by raising prices might be misplaced. Another is that the cost of such materials accounts for a mere 8 per cent of UK companies' direct costs. If companies choose to raise prices nonetheless, that would strengthen the case for reining in the recovery with a rise in interest rates. But its long-term sustainability will depend just as critically on how companies decide to spend the cash they already have. Cash-rich companies can do any (or all) of three things: raise dividends, engage in mergers or take-overs, or invest in real assets. Dividend growth As noted in the latest Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, a higher percentage of companies were willing to reduce dividends to pay off debt in the past recession. Nevertheless, this had little impact on overall company sector dividend payments, which were at a 20-year high of 3.6 per cent of GDP in 1993. The financial markets seem to expect even higher payouts in future. Gallup's latest institutional investors' survey reports expected all-share dividend growth of 8.5 per cent in 1994 and 8 per cent next year, compared with the 6 per cent expected for both years when January's poll was taken. Mergers and acquisitions have picked up somewhat over the past year. But, while a new takeover boom would distract companies' attention from investing in higher capacity, it need not prevent it. A more important barrier, some argue, is the high rates of return which companies demand of their investment projects. Investment has yet to rise significantly in this recovery: manufacturing investment was 3.7 per cent lower in the first quarter of 1994 than it was in 1993. As a percentage of GDP, investment may appear to have held up better during this recession than at the start of the 1980s, but the recent sharp fall in the price of investment goods makes it more difficult to find a clear contrast. Certainly, other investment expectations are as subdued as they were in the middle of 1983, at precisely the same stage in that recovery. Conditions then were ripe for the seven-year upturn in investment which began a few months later. With company profitability much higher now than in the early 1980s, it is difficult to believe that the same factors favouring investment will not reassert themselves. In the meantime, the chancellor must focus on ensuring that the factors favouring inflationary growth do not.</p>

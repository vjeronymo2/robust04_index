			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'AMERICA'S CUP DECISION'  </P> <P> This is the dumbest court decision I've ever heard! What is that judge in New  York smoking, awarding the America's Cup to the losing team?  </P> <P> First, you rule prior to the race if a catamaran is not a suitable boat, not  six months later after it has beaten the competition from here to Sunday.  </P> <P> And second, you don't award the cup to the team that lost. Call the race  invalid, but reserve the decision on the cup award, which means it still  belongs to the San Diego Yacht Club. You don't give the cup to the losers just  because they showed up!  </P> <P> THOMAS C. DORSEY  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Bomb-damaged church to reopen ONE of the oldest victims of the Baltic Exchange bomb is about to resume duties. After careful restoration of its stained-glass windows and stonework, the 12th-century St Andrew Undershaft is to reopen on September 1, 18 months after the IRA bomb that exploded in the heart of the City. The church, in St Mary Axe, was about 100 yards from the centre of the blast and its three large stained-glass windows were severely damaged. Yesterday craftsmen were beginning the final phase of replacing the most badly damaged panels of the window in the church's east wing. The repair work has been undertaken by Goddard and Gibbs, the stained-glass manufacturers. Its craftsmen removed the remains of the 15ft by 30ft windows to the company's workshop for the painstaking task of reconstruction. Because few photographs of the windows existed, the blast area had to be carefully swept for traces of glass fragments. For the east window, the designers had to work from a small photograph showing just one-third of the 100-year-old depiction of the crucifixion and resurrection. Much of the time since has been spent redesigning the missing elements. Installation will take up to three weeks as the workmen replace each panel individually. These are slotted into the grooves of the surrounding stonework and held in place by horizontal supporting bars. Copper tie bars are used for additional support. So far one window, on the north side of the church, has been fully restored. However, the third and west window was almost completely blown out. Its restoration is not expected to be completed before October. Mr Christopher Borst, Goddard and Gibbs sales director, said that the main difficulty had been in trying to track down detailed photographs of the windows. He said: 'The information has not been comprehensive and there have been several large holes where we have been working fairly much in the dark.' The company is one of about a dozen stained-glass manu-facturers and restorers in the UK.</p>

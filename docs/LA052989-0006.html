			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Mostly mild Memorial Day weekend weather across the nation was punctuated by  storms in the Midwest, squalls in the East and a brief return to winter in  parts of the Rockies. In Montana and Idaho, snow was expected in the mountains  and eastern slopes above 5,000 feet and two to three inches of slush was  reported on roads in the Cutbank, Mont., area. Thunderstorms extended across  much of Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Minnesota and South Dakota, where high winds  downed trees and blew a semi-truck off the road. Boaters returned under clear  skies to Boston Harbor for the John F. Kennedy Regatta competition, where a day  earlier 20 young sailors were tossed from their small sailboats and into the  40-degree waters when a squall suddenly hit the area. All were rescued.  Michigan residents awoke to clear skies but unseasonably cold temperatures as  Alpena hit a record low of 31 degrees.  </P></p>

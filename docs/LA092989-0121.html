			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIGGING OUT ON SCRAPPLE  </P> <P> Re: "Scrapple -- The Way To a Philadelphian's Heart," Sept. 24, by Charles  Hillinger.  </P> <P> Excuse me, Mr. Hillinger, but "scrapple" is much more prominent than you think  and goes farther than just Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> I'm from Ottawa (pop. 5,000) in northwest Ohio, and all through my childhood I  ate scrapple with apple butter on it for breakfast before school. However, we  didn't call it scrapple. It actually has various names -- "liver pudding," "pan  pudding" and, in a German influence, "pan hausen."  </P> <P> However, you are right, Mr. Hillinger: You can't get the delicacy out in Los  Angeles unless you know someone that can ship it. By the way, do you know  someone - my apple butter awaits in the refrigerator!  </P> <P> CAROL S. OSTERHAGE, Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

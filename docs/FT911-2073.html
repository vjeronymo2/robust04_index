			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Muppets squabble with Disney ends THE LEGAL squabbling between Walt Disney and the makers of the Muppets ended yesterday when both sides 'amicably resolved' their differences and reached an out-of-court settlement which will allow Disney to exhibit two Muppet attractions at its Orlando, Florida theme park. The altercation started nearly two weeks ago when Henson Associates, a family-run company founded by the late Jim Henson, filed a suit accusing Disney of violating copyrights and trademarks of the Muppets. A Disney spokesman expressed deep regret for what was described as a serious misunderstanding, and apologised to the Henson family and their company for any harm that may have been caused. Mr Brian Henson, son of the late Jim Henson and president of Henson Associates, said that they had granted Walt Disney a licence for the Walt Disney World resort in Florida. The licence is for an initial term of 18 months, and contains an option for an extension by another 3 1/2 years. Disney will have exclusive rights to the attractions and to the Muppets appearing in them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jagodina, 6 Jan (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the assembly of the republic of Srpska, stated for  Jagodina Radio this evening that in talks in Belgrade yesterday  between Slobodan Milosevic, international mediators Owen and  Stoltenberg, and representatives of the republic of Srpska, an  agreement was reached that enables the peace process to be  brought to an end on 18 January in Geneva.    By this, conditions have been created for lifting the  sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Krajisnik  said.    "The Serb side yesterday confirmed its readiness for Muslims  to be given 33.3 percent of former Bosnia-Herzegovina territory,  and accepted a proposal that in the next two years the province  of Sarajevo, including its nine municipalities, be administered  by the United Nations, during which time a final solution for  Sarajevo will be found."    "The third thing that we discussed yesterday was our demand  for access to the sea in the area of Molunat and Prevlaka. The  last demand by the European Union and the Muslims has been  fulfilled by our acceptance of the percentage of territory to be  given to the Muslims and of the status of Sarajevo; therefore  there is no reason not to abolish the sanctions against the Serb  people," Krajisnik said.    If the negotiations on 18 January in Geneva do not yield  result, it will be clear that the Muslim side is to blame,  Momcilo Krajisnik said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Vlasov under rubric "Portrait of a Firm": </F> "The Best Infantry Fighting Vehicles in the World Are the  Product of the Kurgan Machine-Building Plant, but They Make More  Than Military Equipment Here"]    [Text] The Kurgan Machine-Building Plant, known by us  and abroad for the best infantry fighting vehicles in the world,  began its history as an enterprise for producing heavy  bridgebuilding cranes. It was being laid down back in prewar  time, but the war did not permit construction to be completed.  The Kurgan Machine-Building Plant put out the first product,  reduction gears and trolleys for travelling cranes, only in  1950. At that time it belonged to the Ministry of Transport  Machine-Building.    Beginning in 1954 the Kurgan Plant began mastering  production of defense products--the ATS-712 medium artillery  prime mover.    A specialized design bureau was established here for  developing prime movers and other combat equipment. Construction  of the forge shop, foundry and assembly shop was in full swing.  At that time the plant was manned by experienced  engineering-technical cadres of the Omsk Plant imeni October  Revolution, the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant and other defense  enterprises.    Following the first vehicle, whose series output began in  1955, a new one, the ATS-650 artillery prime mover, was designed  and went into series production in the early 1960's.    When the Kurgan Machine-Building Plant was assigned in 1968  to produce an infantry fighting vehicle (BMP-1) that was  fundamentally new from the standpoint of military equipment  design and technology, over 40 percent of manufacturing  equipment already was operating here in an automatic or  semiautomatic regime, numerical control machine tools and  automatic lines were being actively introduced, and instrument  making shops were being developed intensively. Not many know  that it was in Kurgan that series production of thin-walled  armor hulls with use of original manufacturing processes was  adjusted for the first time in the world, which permitted  cutting the labor-intensiveness of work in half and achieving  high quality of manufactured products.    The BMP-1 was mastered at the Kurgan Machine-Building Plant  in a rather short time and 2,000 vehicles per year were  produced. This number was sufficient to completely satisfy the  Army's needs for infantry fighting vehicles [IFV's] and spare  parts for them. The plant was awarded the Order of Labor Red  Banner for mastering and organizing production of this machine.    [Box insert]    Our reference    The BMP-1 represented a fast, highly maneuverable, armored  and very reliable fighting vehicle. It was armed with the 2A28  Grom 73-mm smoothbore gun, a coaxial 7.62-mm PKT [Kalashnikov  tank machinegun] and Malyutka ATGM system. A spacious passenger  compartment equipped with firing ports and periscopes permitted  assault troops to conduct massed fire without leaving the  vehicle. [End box insert]    The BMP-1 received high recognition not only in our Armed  Forces, but in many foreign armies as well, above all of Warsaw  Pact countries, and also in many states of the Near East and  Africa, in India and in others to which they were exported.    The concept of infantry fighting vehicles as a kind of  combat  equipment proved very successful. The BMP-2 was a further  development of the BMP-1.    [Box insert]    Our reference    The BMP-2 already had automatic weapons and antitank  missiles  of a new generation. In particular, the Malyutka ATGM system was  replaced with the more advanced Konkurs antitank system. The  Grom gun gave way to a new 2A42 30-mm automatic cannon  stabilized in two planes and with a double-belt feed. The BMP-2  is capable of destroying even helicopters. Even today, it is one  of the best IFV's. Many designers, engineers and workers of the  Kurgan Machine-Building Plant were recognized with high awards  and the State Prize for developing and organizing production of  the BMP-2.    [End box insert]    The BMP-2 was used widely in Afghanistan and showed itself  to  be a very effective means in conducting combat operations in  rugged areas, also including the mountains. Our soldiers called  it the "swallow," and the enemy dubbed it the "devil wagon." Its  appearance at positions struck panicky fear in them.    When the BMP-2 was placed in series production, not even  everyone at the plant knew that the design of a fundamentally  new IFV, the BMP-3, already was in full swing in a specialized  design bureau under the direction of Doctor of Technical  Sciences Major General A. Blagonravov in close cooperation with  the Tula Specialized Instrument Making Design Bureau (General  Designer Academician Shipunov).    [Box insert]    Our reference    The BMP-3 differed from its predecessors not only by the  weapons complex, but also by its configuration and chassis. A  more powerful (500 hp) engine was installed in the BMP-3. A  hydromechanical transmission with power takeoff to water-jet  propellers was used for the first time on domestic armored  equipment, which permits it to cross water obstacles at a speed  of 10 km/hr. On the highway the BMP-3 easily develops a speed of  up to 70 km/hr and it has a range up to 600 km.    The BMP-3's arsenal includes the 2A70 100-mm gun/launcher,  2A72 30-mm automatic gun and PKT machinegun. All this is  installed in a single unit in the turret. The IFV combat team  has at its disposal two PKT machineguns in independent mounts in  the fighting vehicle's hull front section, two Kalashnikov PK  machineguns in stowage, six AK-74 assault rifles and a 26-mm  signal pistol.    [End box insert]    The BMP-3 was demonstrated at a 1993 arms exhibition in  Abu-Dhabi, where it received high acclaim from military and  technical specialists. A number of countries expressed a desire  to purchase our IFV for their own ground troops. One lot of them  already has been delivered to the United Arab Emirates.    Today, when the volume of the defense order has been cut  sharply, the Kurgan Machine-Building Plant, along with mastering  the BMP-3, is forced to engage actively in conversion programs,  particularly the output of machine-building products for the  national economy and sophisticated household equipment. Plant  shops now assemble not only IFV's, but also the KMZ-012  minitractor with a full set of detachable equipment, trailers,  and MKSM-800 small, multipurpose, self-propelled civil  construction vehicles. The civil construction vehicle, for  example, can be used as a loader, for grading and moving soil,  digging trenches and pits, stacking pallets, bricks and concrete  elements, and performing other work.    Under conditions of an extremely difficult economic  situation, all this permitted preserving a more or less stable  position of the enterprise and unique specialist collectives.  The proportion of civilian products in the overall production  volume was 45 percent in 1993. The Kurgan Machine-Building Plant  has been one of the best defense industry enterprises for more  than two decades.    Speaking of the plant and its establishment, it is  impossible  not to note that all combat equipment developments were carried  out here in close collaboration with specialists of Transmash  VNII [All-Union Scientific Research Institute], the Military  Academy of Armored Troops, Kubinka Scientific Test Institute of  Armored Equipment, and officers of the Russian Ministry of  Defense Main Armor Directorate.    Along with creating and producing a new type of equipment,  much attention always has been given to solving social and  everyday problems. Every fifth resident of Kurgan (350,000) is  connected with plant activity in one way or another.    Several years ago the plant was reorganized as an open  joint-stock company and now is developing along the path of  reorganization as a major financial-industrial group. Under  conditions of clear insufficiency of the state defense order and  practical absence of other kinds of budget financing, the  enterprise is forced to seek new mechanisms for preserving  scientific and production cooperation. Essentially the only  solution is to orient itself toward carefully calculated market  needs and conquer the market, relying on support of nonstate  financial and investment institutions.    A key point in creating such an infrastructure is the  determination and development of an optimum model of  relationships which would permit using the industrial and  financial potential with greatest effectiveness. The  Kurganmashinvest Investment Company is being established for  this purpose at the initiative of the plant, of the specialized  Russkoye oruzhiye Corporation, and of MENATEP Bank. The  Spetsialnoye mashinostroyeniye i metallurgiya AO [Joint-Stock  Company] and a number of major suppliers and traditional  partners of the Kurgan Machine-Building Plant also became part  of the company. Founders of this company see their main task to  be a unification of efforts for developing and producing  advanced, competitive models of armored equipment by attracting  nonbudget funds of commercial as well as state structures;  supporting an active marketing program; and providing legal and  financial support to the sale of products in markets and to  their servicing.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Major stands firm on economic policy THE prime minister yesterday labelled advocates of a sterling devaluation in the European exchange rate mechanism 'pessimists and defeatists' in his most forthright defence yet of the government's economic policy. 'There will be no return to the competitive devaluations of the 1960s and 1970s. We did terrible damage to British industry in the process,' Mr John Major said. His steady-as-she-goes message immediately ran into a co-ordinated barrage of criticism as senior Labour figures led by Mr John Smith, the new leader, charged the prime minister with 'drift and complacency'. Demanding that Britain, as European Community president, should be taking the lead in co-ordinating Europe-wide interest rate reductions, Mr Smith questioned whether the prime minister understood how 'desperately serious' the situation had become. As world currency and stock markets again registered their deep unease at the economic outlook, comments by both party leaders coincided with further grim news on the UK economy. Money supply figures from the Bank of England showed that narrow money - which comprises mostly notes and coins in circulation and is a barometer of underlying demand pressures - fell by 0.8 per cent in June, the first monthly drop since August. The weak state of consumer demand was further underlined by the latest consumer confidence survey from Gallup, the market research company, which showed that confidence in the first two weeks of this month fell to levels below those recorded before the general election. Mr John Townend, Conservative backbench finance committee chairman, confirmed that there was considerable disquiet at the economic outlook. But he insisted it was 'vitally important' that there was a tough stance on public expenditure. At a National Free Enterprise awards ceremony in London, Mr Major said his government was not prepared to use devaluation or a withdrawal from the ERM to bail out inefficiency or poor control of costs and wages. 'In future we will have to adjust our costs to our exchange rate rather than the other way round.' Acknowledging that businesses were undergoing 'difficult times', he said this made it all the more important to keep bearing down on inflation and maintain a consistent economic strategy. This strategy applied equally to the public sector.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WE, NOT BIRD, ARE ENDANGERED SPECIES  </P> <P> I have always considered myself a strong supporter of UC Irvine. By and large,  it has been one of the truly great influences on Orange County for these past  25 years.  </P> <P> BUT! The idea of spending $3 million, no matter how it was raised, for a  chancellor's residence on campus ("Whose Habitat?" Oct. 29) is almost  indescribably obscene.  </P> <P> At a time when the entire nation is staggering on the brink of recession, when  the homeless are flooding our parks, streets and sidewalks, when industrial  layoffs are becoming a daily story, when gasoline prices, taxes, etc., are  imposing even greater burdens on most of us, and worst of all, when health  clinics for the poor, infants, children and the mentally ill are being forced  to close left and right, I can't imagine the thinking behind all this.  </P> <P> Forget the California gnatcatcher, rare as it might be. The truly endangered  species here is us. Once again, it seems, the powers-that-be who run or control  our educational system have vanished from the world of reality.  </P> <P> Wake up, folks, before it is too late. I'm sure the poor chancellor and his  guests could struggle along with a mere $1-million shanty on that hilltop. That  would give them $2 million to do something worthwhile, like helping those who  really need it.  </P> <P> Just sign me, "Disgusted once more."  </P> <P> DON SMITH, Santa Ana  </P></p>

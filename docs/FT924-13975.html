			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Observer: Dispenser of privilege Card-carrying ex-comrades have just gained a new privilege in Moscow, although in today's world there are only about 600 of them in Russia's population of 150m-plus. The cards in question are needed to work a newly installed cash-dispensing machine which Visa claims is the first in the former Soviet Union. Located in Moscow's exclusive Metropol hotel, it disdains the plunging rouble which the authorities are trying to make convertible. The system will dispense only dollars to tourists and the 600 inhabitants with Visa cards. The cards - fastidiously issued to elite holders of hard-currency accounts through a local commercial bank called Credobank - were instituted by Visa last year as a contribution to the development of a market economy. But the blessings are going mainly to foreigners who have found it near impossible to get cash on their plastic while visiting Moscow. Although Visa says it will proceed step by step until a mass market for cards evolves in Russia, it looks forward to having cash machines at other tourist centres in the country by the end of next year. By then, who knows, a bit more than 0.0004 per cent of the indigenous population will be deemed rich enough to benefit, too.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Observer: Pet-speak Called on to justify the superior attitude they take to dog-owners, cat-lovers are apt to say their pets are more individual in character. Not so, however, according to marketing consultant Freddie Marsh, who has sent in a glossary of dog and cat noises in pet-food advertisements around the world. Dogs of different nations vary markedly in their tongues. The Woof-woof of the British, for instance, must seem like Greek to the Spanish who say Bup-bup, let alone to the Ao-ao-saying Portuguese. And surely none of the Europeans could make head or tail of their Indonesian counterpart's Gong-gong. Cats, on the other hand, express themselves everywhere with a close approximation to Miaow. Admittedly the glossary has Czechoslovakia's cats emitting a marginally eccentric Nnou. But a call to the Czech embassy established that what they really say is Mnou.</p>

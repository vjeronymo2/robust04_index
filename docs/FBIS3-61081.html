			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Grigoriy Karasin, director of the department </F> of information and the press of the Russian Federation MFA, by  unidentified SEGODNYA correspondent; place and date not given:  "Grigoriy Karasin: There Is No Alternative Diplomatic Service"]    [Text] [SEGODNYA] The subject of personnel reshuffling in  the MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] of Russia and Russian  embassies is not abating in the Russian press. It is difficult  at times for the ordinary reader who is not initiated in the  diplomatic "realm" to compose a complete picture of what is  happening on Smolensk Square. Can you talk briefly about the  latest appointments?    [Karasin] The interest of the Russian press, and indeed of  the public as a whole, in the personnel policy of the MFA can be  explained and is completely understandable. We are talking about  people to whom protection of the foreign policy interests of the  state is to be entrusted.    The diplomatic service has a specific character. There are  two main criteria for selection of personnel for this  work--devotion to the state interests of Russia and the  professional ability to defend them and resolve the tasks set by  the leadership of the country.    The specific character of the MFA does not permit  sluggishness; it is a living, lively organism that is  permanently searching. Together with mandatory specialization  according to regions, problems, and languages, diplomats of a  good level develop a universality in themselves. This makes it  possible to use them in many sectors of the diplomatic service.  Experience has shown that if a diplomat sits in one chair  perpetually and is occupied with some single problem, this means  stagnation, which is not beneficial to him or to the resolution  of problems. Work in the central apparatus in Moscow alternates  with long and short assignments abroad. This is the kind of  rotation of personnel along the horizontal and vertical that  refreshes professional perception and promotes new approaches.  Therefore, when we talk about the appointment of deputy  ministers, or the managers of individual sectors as ambassadors,  this is by no means a reason for sensations. Rather, vice versa,  this is an affirmation of the established practice, which  justifies itself under the new conditions.    I would like to emphasize one sensitive point associated  with  the appointment of ambassadors. The fact is that after the  confirmation of one or another candidate, the leadership of the  state to which an ambassador is being sent must give its  official concurrence in his appointment--an agrement. In a word,  until an agrement is issued, it is not possible to talk about  the fact that an ambassador has been appointed.    And one more thing. No one is making a secret of the  appointments of new ambassadors under current conditions, and as  soon as the fact has been accomplished, the information becomes  public property. The most reliable source of such information  are the official channels of the MFA, and they must be believed.    [SEGODNYA] Many readers are interested in the mechanism for  appointing Russian ambassadors for work abroad. First of all,  how is the selection of candidates made? At the same time, which  is given more attention--professionalism, loyalty? Do any  normative documents exist that regulate the activity of  ambassadors and define their rights and duties?    [Karasin] An ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of  the Russian Federation is an outstanding figure in many  respects. He represents not the MFA but the state as a whole,  and it is precisely on him that the image of Russia abroad  depends. Moreover, the ambassador is the director of the  diplomatic collective and, indeed, of the Russian colony as a  whole. For this, you will agree, it is necessary to possess high  business and personal qualities. Naturally, we will add to this  a high professional standard and competence in area studies and  international affairs.    Ambassadors are not born. It is the cherished aim of any  diplomat to become an ambassador, for the sake of which he works  for decades, and sometimes his entire life. Incidentally, by far  not everyone achieves this aim. This makes the post even more  honorable and crucial.    It should be noted that in our country, as in other  countries, not only regular diplomats become ambassadors but  also statesmen, scientists, and journalists. In their practical  work, these ambassadors rely on professional diplomatic  employees.    As far as I know, the normative acts that regulate the  activity of the diplomatic service, including that of  ambassadors as well, have been developed. However, they have not  been approved yet, inasmuch as the former Supreme Soviet did not  adopt the law on state service. Thus, the problem has remained  unresolved.    [SEGODNYA] The opinion exists that the reform of the  diplomatic service did not disappear completely for the MFA. As  a result of the reorganization, old established structures were  disrupted, but new and more capable ones have still not been  created. How much does this correspond to reality?    [Karasin] I will not begin to conceal the fact that the  reorganization that was conducted two years ago was not painless  for us. It affected people's destinies. But such a reform was  the result of the fundamental internal political changes that  occurred in the country and the necessity to give Russia a new  look in the international arena. In this sense, it was justified.    A nucleus of experienced and promising diplomats remained  with us. They, I am confident, will be able to withstand all  possible kinds of temptations on the side. Today, we are  practically going through the same material difficulties as  scientists, doctors, teachers, and other workers in the  budgetary sphere, but we like our work, and we do not intend to  leave it.    Nothing stays put in the world, everything evolves. This is  also the way the situation stands in diplomacy. Therefore,  organizational modifications will be continued. This is  indicated by the meeting of the MFA collective on 12 November at  which a decision was adopted on the further activation of work  with CIS countries and the introduction of appropriate changes  in the structure of individual subunits. This, however, does not  envision any kinds of reductions.    [SEGODNYA] Does the appearance of numerous parties and  movements on the domestic political landscape have an affect on  the foreign policy of Russia? What will be the effect of the  existence of various points of view on pressing international  questions on the activity of Russian foreign missions?    [Karasin] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Russian  embassies abroad were and will be general state institutions.  Under conditions of political pluralism, we are interested in  constructive interaction with all branches of authority, and all  sensible political forces and parties. One of the most important  tasks of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is elucidating the  essence of our positions on all international problems in order  that our foreign policy be understandable and accepted by  millions of Russians.    And one more thing. By virtue of various internal political  processes and the conflict of ambitions, torrents of groundless  accusations were poured out on the diplomatic service. Diplomats  in the center and at embassies in essence were subjected to  continuous moral-psychological pressure, which created  additional difficulties and, frankly speaking, did not  contribute to strengthening the prestige of our country and to  confidence in its representatives. After all, to consider  foreign policy problems and criticize individual actions does  not mean to recklessly defame our own diplomats. It is  necessary, apparently, to be aware that there is not and cannot  be an alternative diplomatic service, and that the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs is the only structure for the conduct of foreign  policy. Russians need have no doubt in our ability to defend the  interests of the country.</p>

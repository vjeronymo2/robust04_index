			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zhou Zhengqing, vice president of the </F> People's Bank of China, by staff reporters Li Zhengping (2621  3630 1627) and Wang Zhi (3769 2535); place and date not given:  "The Financial Situation Is Developing in a Stable and Healthy  Manner; the Reform of the Financial Structure Is Progressing  Smoothly"]    [Text] In June last year, the CPC Central committee and the  State Council put forward in good time a series of measures to  strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control,  which rapidly changed the situation and maintained the good  momentum of the healthy economic development. Since the  beginning of this year, the financial system has resolutely  implemented the principle for the financial work of "continuing  the consolidation of the financial order, steadily pushing  forward the financial reform, strictly controlling the total  volume of credit, and earnestly strengthening supervision over  finances" put forward by the State Council. How has the  financial situation been over the past few months? What  progress has been made in financial structure reform? A few  days ago, our staff reporters interviewed Zhou Zhengqing, vice  president of the People's Bank of China, on these issues.    [Reporter] People from all circles of society are very  concerned about financial operations. Will you please give us  an account of the current financial situation?    [Zhou] On the whole, the current economic and financial  situation is continuing to develop in a favorable direction, and  the financial situation is stable and healthy. This is  manifested in the following aspects: First, currency continues  to be withdrawn from circulation. From January to April, a net  total of 5.07 billion yuan of cash was withdrawn, while a net  total of over 30 billion yuan was put into circulation in the  same period last year. The withdrawal of currency from  circulation was mainly attributed to the increase in bank  savings and the good situation in the sale of state treasury  bonds. Second, bank deposits have increased by a relatively  large margin. In the first four months, various kinds of bank  deposits at state banks increased by more than 260 billion yuan,  over 110 billion yuan more than the same period last year, of  which deposits of enterprises increased by 100 billion yuan.  The payment ability of enterprises has further increased, and  their funding difficulties have been eased further. Third,  loans granted by state banks have greatly increased. This has  effectively met the funding needs for industrial production  enterprises and key state construction projects. From January  to April, the amount of loans granted by state banks increased  by more than 75 billion yuan, 20 billion yuan over the same  period last year, of which loans to provide working funds for  industry increased by nearly 10 billion yuan. According to  statistics from the People's Construction Bank of China, by the  end of April, loans for key state construction projects  accounted for 63.4 percent of the total in plans for loans  already issued. Funds for key construction projects were  delivered in good time. Fourth, the payment ability of state  banks has increased. Fifth, the sales of state treasury bonds  have progressed smoothly. By 28 May, 64.8 billion yuan of state  treasury bonds had been sold (of which three-year bonds  accounted for 41.8 billion yuan and two-year bonds accounted for  23 billion yuan). Some provinces have fulfilled the sales plans  assigned them. Sixth, the reform of the foreign exchange  structure has been carried out smoothly. The exchange rate of  the renminbi has basically been stable at a ratio of about $1 to  8.6 yuan. The operation of foreign exchange business among  banks is normal, and the state's foreign exchange reserve has  increased considerably.    [Reporter] In the beginning of this year, the reform of the  economic structure in our country had already gotten started in  the areas of finance, banking, foreign exchange, foreign trade,  investment, and the enterprise system. Please tell us about the  progress of financial structure reform.    [Zhou] As is known to all, in accordance with the resolution  of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  the implementation of the plans for reforming the financial  structure and for reforming the foreign exchange management  structure officially began at the beginning of the year.  Various quarters have reacted favorably to the new measures for  reforming the financial structure since their implementation.  To ensure the smooth implementation of measures to reform the  financial structure, the People's Bank of China has, with the  approval of the State Council, formulated and promulgated a  series of new management methods and rules, such as the "Interim  Methods for the Management of Credit funds," "Interim Monitoring  and Control Indexes for the Management of Assets and Liabilities  of Commercial Banks," "Interim Rules on the Capital and Assets  Insurance Weight of Commercial Bank," "Interim Rules on  Settlement, Sales, and Payment of Foreign Exchange," and so on.  The State Development Bank and the China Import and Export Bank  have officially been organized and established, and preparations  for the establishment of the China Agricultural Development Bank  are in full swing. This is one step toward separating financial  business of a policy nature from that of a commercial nature and  is of great importance to guiding the orientation of the input  of society's funds, to implementing the state industrial policy,  and to the rational distribution of economic resources.  Besides, to improve macroeconomic financial regulation and  control, we have set up a central bank open market trading  office in Shanghai, and, in order to coordinate with the reform  of the foreign exchange structure, we have set up the China  foreign exchange trading center. At present, various branches  of the People's Bank of China are, in accordance with the  arrangements of the headquarters of the bank, further  strengthening their functions and roles in "financial  supervision and management, investigation, statistics, and  analysis, horizontal money supply regulation, management of  state treasury, procurement and allocation of funds, foreign  exchange management, and settlement among banks," and are  shifting their emphasis from the division of funds and the  division of scale to doing a good job in macroeconomic  regulation and control, strengthening financial supervision and  management, and conducting investigation and study. On the  whole, various financial reform measures are being energetically  and steadily implemented.    In the course of steadily pushing forward financial  reform, we have attached great importance to drawing from the  experience and lessons of similar efforts in the past. While  making clear and adhering to the orientation of market reform,  we have put special emphasis on always proceeding from reality,  paying attention to coordinating financial reform with the  progress of reform in other aspects, and adopting steady  progress as the reform strategy. Practice over the past few  months has proved that we are on the right track. The smooth  progress of reform in various aspects has also confirmed this.    [Reporter] The summer harvest has begun. What policies and  measures have the banks adopted to ensure sufficient funds for  the procurement of agricultural and sideline products this  summer?    [Zhou] In recent years, the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council have repeatedly stressed that banks should ensure  the supply of funds for the procurement of grain, cotton, edible  oils, and other agricultural and sideline products and that  "IOU" notes should never be given to peasants. To ensure that  sufficient funds for procurement will be available at the right  time this year, the People's Bank of China, along with various  special banks, has energetically organized investigation and  study in April and has made concrete arrangements for the supply  and management of funds for the procurement of agricultural and  sideline products this summer. We have primarily adopted the  following measures: 1) Continue to implement the responsibility  system of raising funds for the procurement of agricultural and  sideline products through various channels under the unified  leadership of governments at various levels. Various banks are  being asked to cooperate closely with local financial  departments, procurement enterprises, and other departments  concerned to seriously ensure that various kinds of funds are  available. 2) Continue to implement methods for the management  of special accounts of funds for the procurement and sale of  major agricultural and sideline products. Loans earmarked for  procurement can only be used for procurement, and  misappropriation of such loans is prohibited. In view of the  establishment of the branches of the Agricultural Development  Bank this year and in order to avoid affecting the summer  harvest, we have made concrete arrangements in the division of  work and responsibility. The general principle is that  institutional reform should never be allowed to affect the  supply of funds for the procurement of agricultural and sideline  products. 3) Energetically give play to the supervisory role of  banks. The departments concerned should be urged to have funds  for procurement available at the right time. Regarding  procurement enterprises which have misappropriated procurement  loans, banks should withdraw the loans and should ask them to  pay, as a fine, interest for the loans misappropriated. 4)  Demand that all banks at various levels adopt effective measures  to strengthen the procurement, allocation, and regulation of  funds to ensure the supply of funds for procurement and try  every possible means to overcome difficulty of funds in the  course of procuring agricultural and sideline products.    [Reporter] At present, some state enterprises have  encountered some difficulties. How do you look at this issue?  What policies and measures will the banks adopt toward it?    [Zhou] We have organized various banks to coordinate with  the departments concerned to conduct an investigation into the  current difficulties of state enterprises. Viewed from the  situation reflected in the investigation, the number of state  enterprises that have stopped production or are running at  half-capacity is still small, and they are mainly small and  medium enterprises. However, from January to April, the profits  of state enterprises increased instead of decreasing, and their  losses decreased instead of increasing. The growth rate of  production in state industrial enterprises rose from 2.2 percent  in the first quarter to 5 percent in April. The causes of  difficulties encountered by some state enterprises are many.  For example: the excessive growth of investment in fixed  assets, the failure to raise funds, and the misappropriation of  working funds; the serious phenomenon of delay in the payment of  debts among enterprises; and the excessive production capacity  of some trades, the improper internal management of enterprises,  the products that could not be sold, and the increase in idle  funds used to stockpile products. These problems cannot be  solved merely by increasing the money supply or increasing loans  from the banks. To fundamentally solve the problems,  enterprises can only take the road of "deepening reform,  transforming mechanisms, making efforts to improve internal  management, and increasing economic results."    On the whole, the national economy is still growing at a  relatively high speed, and the economy and finances are  developing in a favorable direction. However, the pressure of  inflation has not yet been fundamentally eliminated. Therefore,  the financial departments should continue to implement the  principle of exercising strict control over the total credit  volume formulated by the State Council, and in particular, over  loans for fixed assets. They should never increase the scale of  loans fixed by the state. They should continue to consolidate  the financial order, should resolutely stop arbitrary  fund-raising activities, borrowing money, increasing interest,  or setting up financial organs, and should put a halt to  operations that go beyond their business scope. They should  earnestly strengthen financial supervision and management. In  the second half of this year, they also should make special  arrangements for consolidating the settlement order, strictly  enforce discipline in settlement, and solve problems of putting  bills and notes aside and misappropriating or retaining  customers' funds.    Regarding the current difficulties of some state  enterprises,  banks have adopted some policies and measures in accordance with  the arrangements made by the State Council: Loans should be  granted in good time to all state enterprises whose products can  actually be sold and which can produce good economic results,  and banks should energetically support and help money-losing  enterprises which have reduced their losses or have started  making profits. For those state enterprises that have stopped  production and are having difficulty paying wages to their  workers and staff members, banks should coordinate with the  local governments and grant some loans to solve their actual  difficulty on the condition of giving play to the role of the  social security system. Besides, local governments or  departments in charge of these enterprises should pay the  appropriate interest and help such enterprises resume production  and overcome their difficulties. Regrading enterprises which  have no hope to stop losing money and whose assets cannot be  used for a mortgage, preparation should be earnestly carried out  for declaring them bankrupt according to law by stages and in  groups. Experiments should first be carried out before this  practice is made widespread.    The tasks of macroeconomic financial regulation and control  are still heavy. To do a good job in financial work, we have  demanded that leaders at all levels of the financial system go  deep into the grass-roots units, pay close attention to changes  in the local economy and finance, report on the situation in  good time, and put forward methods and suggestions for  strengthening and improving macroeconomic financial regulation  and control. I believe that, under the leadership of the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council and with the concerted  efforts of the entire financial system, the tasks in the  financial work for the whole year will certainly be successfully  fulfilled.</p>

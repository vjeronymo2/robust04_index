			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELUS STARS WIN IN DARING FASHION  </P> <P> An unlikely hero and an unexpected play helped the Angelus League all-stars to  a 6-3 victory over the Sea View League all-stars Sunday in the opening game of  the Seniors All-Star baseball doubleheader at Anteater Field in Irvine.  </P> <P> St. Paul outfielder Rich Castillo, a late addition to the Angelus League  all-stars, hit a double down the left-field line that triggered a three-run  rally in the ninth inning. He was named the game's most valuable player.  </P> <P> "He wasn't even originally picked to play," said Bob Ickes of Mater Dei, who  coached the Angelus League all-stars. "I thought he was a second baseman."  </P> <P> The Angelus League all-stars also scored three runs in the seventh inning to  overcome a 2-0 deficit. The big play of the inning was a daring double steal  that was executed only after some quick thinking by Ickes.  </P> <P> Outfielder Mark Tacconelli of Servite stole home on the front end of the double  steal, giving the Angelus League all-stars a 3-2 lead. Afterward, Ickes said it  took two coaches and two different sets of signals to put the play in motion.  </P> <P> "We never practiced or met before the game because the schools are so spread  out," Ickes said. "We got together just before the game and went over some  basic signals like bunting, but there was nothing set for a play like this."  </P> <P> Ickes huddled with assistant Mark McNary of Servite and the two coaches took  turns giving their respective double-steal signs to Tacconelli, who was aboard  at third, and Mater Dei outfielder Juan Zarate, who was on first. After Zarate  took off for second and drew the throw, Tacconelli sprinted down the line and  beat the throw home.  </P> <P> "You don't expect a play like that in a game like this, so it's perfect in a  game like this," said Vince Brown of Tustin, who coached the Sea View League  all-stars. "They certainly had the right guys to make the play happen . . .  they both can run well."  </P> <P> Both teams received impressive pitching. Estancia's Gabe Javage and  Saddleback's Mike Arroyos shut out the Angelus League all-stars through six  innings, limiting them to only four hits. Arroyos, who pitched three hitless  innings and struck out three, was named the most valuable pitcher.  </P> <P> St. Paul's R.C. Chavez pitched three shutout innings for the Angelus League  all-stars, and although Mater Dei's Tony Pena didn't pitch, he contributed a  double in a pinch-hitting role.  </P> <P> "The pitching was very good," Brown said. "You want to be careful with your  pitchers in the summer. There's a lot of games, and you have to limit them to  how much they throw. They all want to pitch as much as they can."  </P> <P> The Sea View League all-stars opened a 2-0 lead after two innings. Leadoff  hitter Jason White of Estancia scored the first run on a throwing error by  Mater Dei's Jason Gill and Corona del Mar's Greg Haack drove in the second run  with a double.  </P> <P> The Angelus League all-stars had three hits in the third inning but failed to  score off Javage. They got three more hits in the seventh inning and this time  scored three runs, thanks to some impressive baserunning.  </P> <P> In the second game:  </P> <P> Pacific Coast League 8, South Coast League 1 -- Ron Kortman of Laguna Hills  pitched the first six innings, allowing a run and four hits for the victory. He  also had a two-run single to cap a five-run first inning for the Pacific Coast  League. Kortman was voted the outstanding pitcher of the game.  </P> <P> Mike Helm, a catcher from Laguna Hills, had two hits, scored a run and had an  RBI single. He was voted the most valuable player.  </P> <P> The South Coast League scored in the second on a single by David Nemeth of  Mission Viejo and an RBI triple by Scott Vollmer of Irvine.  </P></p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / US leads fresh surge in markets Equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic surged yesterday in the wake of further encouraging economic news from the US this week. The FT-SE 100 index of leading UK stocks rose 30.9 to 3,265.1 - its highest closing level since mid-March - rounding off a week of strong gains that have left the index up 2.2 per cent. On Wall Street higher bond prices, encouraging economic news, a firmer dollar and heavy computerised program buying lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average 51.16 to 3,881.05, a level not seen since mid-March. After the Dow's 25-point rise on Tuesday and Wednesday's 70-point surge, the average of blue-chip stocks has risen 125 points, or 3.3 per cent, since Monday. This week's buying was the most sustained on Wall Street since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in February in an attempt to restrain inflation. Yesterday's gains were mainly due to a jump in US government bond prices prompted by only a slight upwards revision of second quarter economic growth estimates to 3.8 per cent. Traders had feared a larger upward revision would make a further rise in interest rates more likely. Frankfurt ended a cautious week by posting a 1.6 per cent rise in post-bourse trading. Paris went 1.8 per cent higher, and Zurich rose 1.2 per cent. GDP growth, Page 3; Currencies, Page 13; London stocks, Page 15; World stocks, Page 21; Lex, Page 24; Markets, Weekend, Page II</p>

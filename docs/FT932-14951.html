			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Russia and The G7: Doubts on aid disbursement THE AID package announced by the Group of Seven ministers yesterday gave a strong message of western support to Russia, but it may not have removed the obstacles to aid disbursement. Mr David Roche, head of global strategy at Morgan Stanley International, said that only between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 6bn would be available relatively quickly. 'This is far short of the mega sums in the plan's headlines,' he said. 'Just as hyperinflation is part of the Russian scene, so hyperbole is a part of the western aid package to save Yeltsin.' This assessment was borne out by economic commentators in Moscow. One said that the package risked duplicating the mistake made last year, when the headline sum of Dollars 24bn remained partly unspent because of IMF conditionality, and the remainder - about half - was given in the form of tied credits, further increasing the overall Russian debt. As these funds went in, an estimated Dollars 15bn-Dollars 25bn was illegally squirrelled away by Russian companies and individuals in western bank accounts. Further, the success of the package is, as ever, dependent on the politics within Russia. Only if Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, wins the referendum on April 25 and, more important, acts on that victory by giving the go-ahead to his government to restrain credit and create the conditions for a stable currency, can the 'black hole' of Russian reform be closed and the reforms be implemented.</p>

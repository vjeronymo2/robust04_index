			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Management: Training lessons from Germany - Alcan's UK mill needs to catch up Ask Rheinhold Wagner why productivity is so much higher at Alcan's aluminium rolling mills in Germany than at those in the UK and immediately he points to vast differences in the way employees are trained to look after the expensive equipment they operate. Alcan Deutschland employs 3,800 people and 250 of them are apprentices, each one being trained for 3 1/2 years. The total includes 175 craft apprentices, and Wagner says that, as a matter of policy, Alcan always finds craft apprentices a job at the end of their training, even though the work at first might not be what they were trained for. The idea, he says, is to keep them in the production system. 'This gives us a tremendously skilled workforce.' In 1991, when he took over responsibility for Alcan's UK metal rolling operations, which employ about 1,450, Wagner was surprised to find no similar apprentice programme existed. When he began, each UK employee was taking twice as long to produce a tonne of finished metal. But that has been improving. UK operations are now 10 to 15 per cent less productive than in Germany. One way Wagner measures productivity is mill 'uptime' - or time the mills are working normally against the total time available. Wagner says Germany needs to improve because 'uptime' is about 85 per cent. In the UK it is only 70 per cent. The big deficiency in the UK he says, is that equipment is not maintained carefully enough. 'And if the mill is not reliable, you can't expect to deliver on time.' At the begining of the rolling process, aluminium is heated in re-melt furnaces. Wagner says that furnaces at Alcan's mill in Rogerstone, south Wales, consume 40 per cent more energy than comparable furnaces in Germany. Partly this is due to differences in equipment, but it is also partly 'because of less attention to detail. And that comes back to training.' Alcan, based in Canada and the western world's second-largest aluminium producer, started to reorganise its European operations as long ago as 1976 in order to prepare for the unified European market. In 1987 Wagner, already chief executive of Alcan Deutschland, was handed extra responsibility when the parent company disbanded its European headquarters in Geneva to save money and to flatten its international management structure. He was also put in charge of Alcan's operations in Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Another reorganisation in 1991 gave him responsibility for Alcan's rolling operations in the UK and, therefore, all the European rolling operations. Alcan has been spending heavily on these rolling operations. It has a half-share in Aluminium Norf in Germany, already the world's biggest aluminium rolling mill, where annual capacity is being doubled to 1.4m tonnes at a cost of DM900m (Pounds 360m). Another Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.2m) has been spent on a new, wholly owned foil mill in Italy linked with Norf. This has raised fears at Rogerstone that the 240,000-tonne-a-year plant has no future. These concerns intensified last month when another 200 job losses were announced there and 46 at associated mills in Glasgow and Falkirk. Rogerstone employed 3,000 at its peak; now the workforce will drop to 770. But Wagner insists the cuts simply reflect the sharp drop in demand from export markets, mainly Germany, and a need to bring capacity and costs into line with depressed circumstances. He points out that Alcan has spent Pounds 64m modernising Rogerstone since 1984 - including Pounds 8m of the Pounds 23m spent in the UK last year - and the plant is needed to provide specialised rolled products for the whole of Europe. It is also part of his strategy to build Rogerstone's share of the UK market to 60 per cent, a target it is close to achieving. That is why, says Wagner, he must find ways of improving training - and consequently productivity - at the UK mills.</p>

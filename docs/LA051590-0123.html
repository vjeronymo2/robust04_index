			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> THAT'S THE WAY IT IS: When Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev wanted to get  the word out about the Baltic states Monday night, his statement was read on  the Soviet national news program Vremya (A1), a show that up until recently had  been broadcast in Orange County, too. . . . It was on Huntington Beach's  KOCE-TV Channel 50 for three weeks in February and was offered to PBS stations  nationwide for a trial run. But it has yet to become available on a permanent  basis. . . . Proponents say they need to raise $1 million a year in donations  to make the show available for American viewers.

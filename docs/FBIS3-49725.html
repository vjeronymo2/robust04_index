So far 6,700 Croats  have been released, Kostovic said, and we trust the others will  also be freed. He added that normal constructive negotiations  on this issue conducted with the representatives of the  so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had opened other  possibilities of successful negotiations in the future.</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: N.Y. PLANS TO 'BASH' WASHINGTON  </P> <P> New York City is planning to throw a big anniversary party for George  Washington. In fact, Mayor Edward I. Koch promised that the ceremonies to mark  the 200th anniversary of the inauguration of the nation's first President will  be "bigger, bigger, bigger" than other recent celebrations, including the  centennial tribute to the Statue of Liberty in 1986. "This is the most  appropriate place to celebrate this historic anniversary, because New York City  was the first capital of the United States under the Constitution," Koch said  at a news conference in Federal Hall, where Washington was sworn in on April  30, 1789, and where Congress met for the first time. Organizers have invited  President Reagan, President-elect Bush and former Presidents Jimmy Carter,  Gerald R. Ford and Richard M. Nixon to attend the observance on April 29 and  30. Events will include fireworks, a parade of 13 Navy and Coast Guard ships  representing the original colonies, an ecumenical service in St. Paul's Chapel  on Lower Broadway, where Washington attended religious services after his  inauguration, a parade up Broadway and an inaugural gala dinner.  </P> <P>  -- Young Stormie Jones, the world's first recipient of a simultaneous heart  and liver transplant, was reported to be in good condition after a checkup at  Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pa. Stormie, 11, of White Settlement, Tex.,  had undergone blood tests in Texas that found elevated levels of body toxins  the liver should be removing, said hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon. Doctors  performed Stormie's transplant at Children's Hospital in February, 1984,  because she suffered from hyper-cholesterolemia, which causes fat to accumulate  in the blood. She returned last October for bile duct reconstruction. McMahon  said it was not yet clear if her new symptoms are related to the bile duct  problem.  </P> <P>  -- Elena Ceausescu is more than the First Lady of Romania. Now the wife of  President Nicolae Ceausescu is officially a national heroine, the Agerpres  agency said. She was awarded the title "Heroine of the Socialist Republic of  Romania" at a special luncheon marking her 70th birthday, attended by leading  Communist Party officials. Elena Ceausescu, a prominent member of the Romanian  Politburo, is regarded by many Western diplomats as second-in-command to her  husband. Agerpres said party officials praised her activity in the country's  underground movement during World War II. SHIRLEY MARLOW  </P></p>

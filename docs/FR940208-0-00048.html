			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Third, at subsection (c), the Iowa proposal requires that any noncoal mine waste defined as ``hazardous'' under section 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Federal regulations at 40 CFR Part 261 shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of Subtitle C of RCRA and any implementing regulations. This portion of the Iowa proposal is substantively similar to a former Federal provision that existed at 30 CFR 816/817.89(d).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (48 FR 43994, 44006) September 26, 1983. The Federal provision was suspended on November 20, 1986 (51 FR 41952, 41962) to implement the decision of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In re: Permanent Surface Min. Regulation Litigation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 620 F. Supp. 1519, 1538 (D.D.C. 1985). The court remanded the rule because OSM failed to comply with the public notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;500&hyph;706, in promulgation of the Federal provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM subsequently deleted 30 CFR 816/817.89(d) in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice dated December 17, 1991 (56 FR 65612, 65635&hyph;65636). As discussed in the December 17, 1991,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice, in deleting the provision, OSM reasoned that Congress had assigned permitting, inspection, and enforcement responsibilities under RCRA to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and that SMCRA did not require OSM or the State regulatory authorities to assume such responsibilities. It was further reasoned that Congress would not appropriate funds to OSM or State regulatory authorities for this task. With the deletion of this requirement, OSM stated that it would continue ``consistent with its jurisdiction under the Act, to coordinate its regulatory program with EPA to facilitate the implementation of RCRA regulations.'' However, OSM's action does not prohibit or prevent a State regulatory authority from choosing to assume such responsibilities in coordination with EPA. Under section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart provision exists. Section 505(b) and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because there is no Federal counterpart provision to the paragraph (c) of proposed IAC 27&hyph;40.63(12), OSM evaluated Iowa's proposal based upon its consistency with section 515(b)(14) of SMCRA. Section 515(b)(14) of SMCRA generally requires that all debris, acid-forming materials, toxic materials, or materials constituting a fire hazard, are to be treated or buried and compacted or otherwise disposed of in a manner designed to prevent contamination of ground or surface waters. Because Iowa's proposal here provides for the handling and disposal of ``hazardous'' noncoal mine wastes in a manner designed to prevent contamination of ground or surface waters, i.e., pursuant to the provisions of subtitle C of RCRA, the Director finds that Iowa's proposed provision at paragraph (c) of proposed IAC 27&hyph;40.63(12) is not inconsistent with section 515(b)(14) of SMCRA and is approving the provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, then, the Director finds that Iowa's proposed revisions at IAC 27&hyph;40.63(12) are consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations and is approving them. The Director, by way of this notice, is requesting that Iowa correct a typographical error in its rule in the phrase ``along with and other toxic wastes.'' The word ``and'' should be corrected to read ``any.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 27.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> IAC 27&hyph;40.68, Special Permanent Program Performance Standards_In Situ Mining <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Iowa proposes, at IAC 27&hyph;40.68, to delete the incorporation by reference of 30 CFR Part 828, dealing with performance standards for in situ mining operations, and to reserve IAC 27&hyph;40.68. Therefore, in situ mining operations are prohibited in Iowa and the State cannot approve any such operations since there are no rules to govern such operations. In accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental control and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Therefore, the Director is approving the proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.68. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 28.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, May 31 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces shelled  Tuzla airport in northeastern Bosnia a few minutes after a UN  relief plane landed there Tuesday [31 May], UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] officials said here. UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi  immediately condemned the attack and said he had protested to  Serb leader Radovan Karadzic over the incident, which comes  ahead of peace talks scheduled in Geneva Thursday. The  aircraft, an Ilyushin-76 arriving from Split in Croatia, took  off again without unloading after nine shells landed in the  close vicinity of the airport within a 20-minute period. There  were no casualties.    One of the shells landed 20 metres (yards) away from the  emergency services' base, and another 200 metres (yards) from  the airport's control tower, an UNPROFOR statement said. A  radar system operated by a Jordanian contingent attached to the  UN Nordic Battalion revealed that the shells were fired from  Bosnian Serb position 16 kilometers (10 miles) southeast of the  airport, the statement added.    "Mr. Akashi said that such deliberate targeting of UNPROFOR,  only a few days before scheduled talks in Geneva on a general  ceasefire agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was regrettable,"  it said. "Mr. Akashi has expressed his deep concern regarding  this incident to Dr. Karadzic."    Tuzla airport was targeted by Serb artillery Monday  afternoon  when two shells were fired at it. Previous to that there had  been no bombardments since May 17.</p>

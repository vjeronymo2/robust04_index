			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- The formulation of the  Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence is applauded as a great  invention in the history of international relations with  historical and realistic significance by a PEOPLE'S DAILY  editorial today.    Today, June 28, is the 40th anniversary of the proclamation  of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, namely, mutual  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual  non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal  affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence.    The five principles, co-initiated by China, India and  Myanmar  (Burma), were born at a time of rising national independence,  the editorial says. "The five principles, following the new  trend of international relations after the Second World War,  reflected the newly-independent countries' common aspirations,  which were to preserve sovereignty, oppose aggression and  maintain peace."    The past 40 years have shown that the five principles,  summarizing the fundamental tenets in world affairs in simple,  clear language and in line with the United Nations Charter,  embodied the basic features of the new international relations,  the article explains.    As noted by Deng Xiaoping, observing the five principles is  the best way to handle state-to-state relations, the article  says. The five principles have stronger vitality than "big  family", political grouping and sphere of influence ideas among  all norms directing international ties.    Now, with the end of the Cold War, a new international  pattern is emerging, featuring multi-polarization. The world is  undergoing profound changes and great adjustments, so all  countries have an urgent need to establish new international  political and economic order which is fair and reasonable.    Mutual respect of sovereignty and non-interference in each  other's internal affairs are at the core of setting up the new  international order. Every country's people have the right to  choose their own social system and life style. Only the five  principles, not hegemonism and power politics, can stand trials  and work to build the new world order, the article stresses.    Equality and mutual benefit are important parts of the five  principles, and are of major realistic significance in  concerting international economic relations.    At present, each country, in order to formulate the new  international order, should adhere to the five principles to  strengthen co-operation, as the world economy coalesces and  economic factors play an even more important role in  international ties.    China, initiator and loyal observer and defender of the five  principles, has enormously enriched the spirit of the five  principles by pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace,  the article points out.    From norms regulating relations between countries with  different social systems, China has developed the five  principles into standards guiding and dealing with affairs  concerning all other countries.    In conclusion, the article says, the five principles will be  honored in the future for their contribution to constructing a  better world.    The Chinese people have made up their mind, it notes, to  continue their efforts together with other peoples to carry  forward the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.</p>

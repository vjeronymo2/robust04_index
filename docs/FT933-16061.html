			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / People: Daiwa Europe Bank Nicholas Clegg, co-chairman of Daiwa Europe, is taking on the chairmanship of Daiwa Europe Bank when Geoffrey Taylor, 65, retires at the end of July. After 22 years at Hill Samuel, Clegg, 57, joined Daiwa as a managing director in 1986. With fluent French, German, Dutch and 'dormant Russian', he has been involved in Daiwa's expansion into continental Europe, including Hungary and Russia. Taylor, who had been chief executive of Midland between 1982 and 1986, had been chairman, in a non-executive capacity, since the Japanese bank first obtained its licence in 1987. He stays on as a non-executive director and as a member of the audit committee. The bank does only a limited amount of straight lending business, its main thrust being foreign exchange, derivatives and financial engineering as well as offshore banking out of Dublin. While all four of the big Japanese securities houses have a European banking off-shoot, it is unusual for the most senior European in the securities house also to run the bank.</p>

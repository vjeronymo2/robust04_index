			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Maia Toradze article: "Nationalists, Stand to Attention! </F> Or the Nationalist Party Has Been Created in Georgia" -- words  between slantlines published in boldface]    [Excerpts] Reason: "Up to now, not one of the  parties in existence has been able to create such a society  where each Georgian is able to harness his potential to the  maximum for the well-being of the nation."    Aim: "To ensure the permanent existence of the  nation."    Mission: "To guide the efforts of the Georgian  nation toward great aims."    Naturally, there is nothing bad in the fact that one more  party has been formed but why, after all, a nationalist party?    Zaza Vashaqmadze, chairman of the Georgian Nationalist  Party: "Nationalist means the same as national and our  direct aim proceeds from this. The essence of our activities is  to place national consciousness above everything else! If we do  not elevate our own national [awareness], nothing will save  Georgia." [passage omitted]    Whether we like it or not, one more party -- the Georgian  Nationalist Party -- has been created in Georgia. In the main,  it unites young people aged between 18 and 30, students,  lawyers, and economists. [passage omitted]</p>

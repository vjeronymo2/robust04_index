			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK SCARS, WHITE FEARS  </P> <P> When I was a little girl and my mother would speak of conditions in South  Africa, I would ask, "How can a handful of white people control all those black  people?" My mother said that they didn't know the difference.  </P> <P> I am about to have my first child, and I seek concrete answers for the day I am  asked about South Africa, Germany, the Middle East and conditions in the United  States.  </P> <P> This article was very informative and honest.  </P> <P> What we, as human beings, need to engrave in our lives is that life, liberty  and the pursuit of happiness are natural inalienable rights of all people that  no one may infringe upon.  </P> <P> Scars can be healed through nurturing, and fears can be removed through  education. From D. Ikeda: "All people are equal. There are absolutely no  distinctions of superior and inferior among human beings."  </P> <P> Keep up the outstanding work.  </P> <P> JACKI SAM  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

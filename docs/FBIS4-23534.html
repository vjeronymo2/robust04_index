			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 7 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela  said on Tuesday night his government would pursue negotiations  with right-wing whites in spite of severe criticism from his  supporters.    "In negotiations with representatives of the far-right  parties we have found a new determination to resolve problems by  peaceful means," he told a gathering organised by the National  Peace Secretariat in Johannesburg to honour peacemakers.    "We do differ and differ sharply. But it is our obligation  to ensure that these differences are thrashed out in rational  discussions and negotiations."    He said many of his supporters believed that by talking to  the right-wing the African National Congress was conceding too  much. "They (our supporters) forget that when we launched the  peace process the National Party [NP] was in the same position  as the right-wing today. Today the NP is part of the government  of national unity."    Mr Mandela said the most effective method of dealing with  the  right-wing was to use the power of persuasion and to point out  the need to love other people. "Our obligation is to draw their  attention to those issues that bind us, not separate us. The  government will continue to pursue this course with a patient  determination. We do recognise the moral and historical  obligation to ensure that the wounds of the past are healed," he  said.    Mr Mandela added his government would ensure maximum  openness  and disclosure so the healing process was meaningful, permanent  and a beacon to future generations. In this regard, the "truth  commission" announced earlier on Tuesday by Justice Minister  Dullah Omar was aimed at reconciling the nation and not at  retribution.</p>

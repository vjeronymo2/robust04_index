			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITISH VIEW  </P> <P> I am an Englishman who has spent the past two weeks on vacation with relatives  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> I am writing to comment on the subject of proportional representation, as  raised by Matthew Shugart (letter, Jan. 1). He claims that Britain's electoral  system "works," although the majority party almost never has a majority of  votes. It does not work.  </P> <P> We desperately need proportional representation and the coalitions that are  likely to result from it. Only these can rescue us from the extremes of  pendulum politics in which each government tends to undo the work of its  predecessor. (This tendency is much more marked than in America, with its  checks and balances). It has also intensified the divisions between the  prosperous south and the economically disadvantaged north of England, Scotland  and Wales.  </P> <P> This apart, what kind of democracy can we really claim to be when, in the 1987  election, 43% of the votes cast for Conservatives gained 60% of the seats in  Parliament, but over 20% who voted for the center alliance gained 3% of the  seats?  </P> <P> TONY NOAKES  </P> <P> Middlesex, England  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Slovak state budget deficit reached 4.5 billion  Slovak korunas [Sk] in January 1994 and was caused by assistance  given to the National Insurance Fund. This is what Julius Toth,  minister of finance and deputy prime minister, told journalists  during a break in the government's meeting today. According to  Toth, Slovakia's imports from the Czech Republic are clearly  specified, and Slovakia is linked to our western neighbor  through several commercial agreements and operations that cannot  be abandoned merely because Slovakia is faced with temporary  problems.    Toth ruled out [the introduction of] the import surcharge.  However, he went on to say that the introduction of special  checks on the borders [between the Czech Republic and Slovakia],  as reported by TA SR [Slovak news agency], is being considered.  In the first phase, these checks should concern only  foodstuffs. In the second phase, they should cover all goods en  bloc.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / The limits to promoting high-technology industry THE DOMINANT position of the US in 'high-technology' industry in the postwar era is eroding, largely in favour of Japan. Does this matter and can anything be done about it? What makes these questions both timely and important is that leading figures in the Clinton administration think that the US government can and, indeed, should do something about it. The signal was the controversial appointment of Laura D'Andrea Tyson as President Clinton's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors. Her starting point is a belief that comparative advantage in the industries she labels as high technology - chemicals, pharmaceuticals, military equipment, advanced engineering, computers, telecommunications, electronics, aerospace and scientific instruments - 'can be created by government action.' The reason for concern is evident. In the early 1970s the US accounted for almost 30 per cent of world high-technology exports. By the late 1980s, this share was down to 21 per cent (see chart). Meanwhile, the great successes have been Japan, whose share rose from 7 to 16 per cent and Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, whose combined share rose from just over 1 to almost 9 per cent. 'Revealed comparative advantage' is another way of looking at the process (see chart). A country has a high (low) revealed comparative advantage in a product group if its share in world exports of the product group is higher (lower) than its share in total world exports of manufactures. The revealed comparative advantage of the US in high-technology industry has, indeed, declined a little since the early 1970s, while it has soared in the cases of Japan and the east Asian NICs. What might this mean for policy? One question is whether the US government should respond to this decline by focusing its efforts on supporting particular high-technology industries. Certainly, Prof Tyson does not prove that countries thrive economically because of their success in particular high-technology industries, rather than succeed in high-technology as a result of their general economic success. A prior question, however, is whether these trends can be reversed by policy. In a recent article, Richard Nelson and Gavin Wright conclude that postwar American technological leadership has been eroded because fundamental US advantages - notably, market size and superior higher education - have diminished.(2) 'Over the postwar era,' they argue, 'commodity and resource trade, business and finance, and technological communities, have all become increasingly transnational rather than national.' Their conclusion is that 'techno-nationalism,' policies aimed at giving national companies an edge in an area of technology, does 'not work very well any more.' Internationalisation is an important limit on the effectiveness of policy. Yet there is another one. A country's comparative advantage may, indeed, not be determined by natural resources, but governments can still not make it whatever they would like it to be. As Prof Tyson recognises, for example, the causes of high-technology trade include what must be deep-seated 'national differences in educational systems and technological capabilities.' The point should be pushed further. Japanese success in high-technology industry is to be explained by high rates of savings, attitudes to education, relationships inside and among companies, the goals and structure of government and relationships between companies and governments. Nothing an American administration can do will make the US like Japan in these respects. Nor will Japan become like the US. But a huge amount of effort and international goodwill can be wasted in trying. (1) Laura D'Andrea Tyson, Who's Bashing Whom?

adjusted, except for the Italian series and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government and central bank sources.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLARK TO TEST FAITH BAPTIST IN TITLE GAME  </P> <P> Faith Baptist High basketball Coach Stuart Mason's first order of business  Friday was to find out as much as possible about the El Cajon Christian  basketball team.  </P> <P> Mason found all he needed to know in two words: Tony Clark.  </P> <P> Clark, a 6-foot-8 senior forward, is averaging 43 points a game for Christian  (18-11), which will play Faith Baptist (21-10) at 4:30 p.m. today at Cal State  Dominguez Hills for the Southern California regional Division V championship.  The winner advances to the state finals Friday in Oakland.  </P> <P> Clark, who will attend the University of Arizona in the fall, is reportedly one  of the best players to come out of San Diego County. He holds section records  for points in a career (2,474), season (1,264) and game (63, vs. La Jolla  Country Day this season).  </P> <P> Clark scored 52 points against San Juan Capistrano St. Margaret's in the  regional opener Tuesday and added 30 against Paramount Brethren on Thursday in  the regional semifinals.  </P> <P> "I've heard about all those records and numbers," said Mason, whose team  advanced to the regional final with a 61-57 upset of Ribet Christian on  Thursday. "He sounds like a very good player. It also sounds like if we can  shut him down, we'll shut their team down."  </P> <P> Christian, the San Diego Section Division V champion, sputtered early in the  season as Clark received little support. But Coach Randy Wright said the rest  of the Patriot lineup has developed, providing more relief for Clark.  </P> <P> Christian has plenty of size with 6-6 forward Dave Piester and 6-2 center  Dwaine Lee.  </P> <P> The tallest player for Faith Baptist, the Southern Section Division I champion,  is Peter Rasmussen, a 6-6 sophomore center who scored 18 points and grabbed 13  rebounds against Ribet Christian.  </P> <P> The Contenders' leading scorer, Alex Estrada, a 5-8 sophomore guard, is  battling the flu. But Estrada played in Tuesday's 67-52 win over Calipatria and  scored 17 points against Ribet Christian.  </P> <P> "Several of our guys are feeling a little under the weather," Mason said.  "We've been doing a lot of praying this week. We've got some more still to do."  </P></p>

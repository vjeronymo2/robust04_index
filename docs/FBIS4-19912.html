			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed CET (JWI) (MTH): "EU Promises Any Aid The </F> Future Government of South Africa Might Require"]    [Text] Luxembourg, 19 Apr (BELGA) -- Meeting in Luxembourg  on Tuesday [19 April], the foreign ministers of the European  Union [EU] promised the future government of South Africa "any  aid it might require and wide-ranging political and economic  collaboration in the long term."    The ministers of the Twelve, meeting in Council session,  adopted a whole series of measures intended to offer support to  the new government that will emerge from the elections on 26 and  28 April 1994. The promise of aid to South Africa is a  Community action falling under the heading of European foreign  policy.    From the outset, however, the EU specified that respect for  human rights and democracy were an essential element of  relations between the EU and South Africa.    First of all, the Twelve promise to work toward canceling UN  sanctions against Pretoria, which are still being imposed.    The current support program for the peaceful transition to  democracy in South Africa is continuing provisionally, and the  Union must continue to earmark the funds required for this  action, maintained the ministers. They recalled that they  intend to contribute mainly toward improving the standard of  living of the poorest sectors of the population.    As for long-term relations, the Twelve emphasized that they  do not consider South Africa as a developing country, but that  they are inclined to allow it to benefit from the same  commercial advantages as such countries. They also promised to  contribute toward the establishment and development of regional  cooperation between southeast African and Indian Ocean  countries. The EU is calling for mutual investments, encouraged  and guaranteed by various agreements. To this end, it will ask  the EIB (European Investment Bank) to extend its activities to  South Africa.    The Twelve said they were ready to collaborate in a large  number of areas, such as education and training, industry,  trade, telecommunications, research, and technology.    As soon as the new government takes office, the EU intends  to  support the establishment of political dialogue and encourage  the South African cabinet to work toward social justice and to  eliminate all forms of racial, political, religious, and  cultural discrimination.    The Twelve also confirmed that they wanted to hold an  international conference on 6 and 7 September 1994 in Berlin,  gathering together all the countries of southern Africa.</p>

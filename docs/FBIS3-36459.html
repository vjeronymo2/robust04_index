Many plants and factories  in the country have stopped working, and in the next few weeks  this process may acquire the nature of an avalanche, the union  declared in a statement published on Monday.    Under the circumstances, the union considers it necessary to  take a range of urgent measures designed to overcome the crisis,  such as work out a mechanism for regulating prices and incomes.  According to the authors of the statement, the prices of many  goods, above all food products, are already above the world  level.    In addition, the union calls for taking steps aimed at  decreasing the volume of free funds handled by commercial banks,  and at limiting the activity of commercial structures at  currency exchanges. Its statement says it is necessary to  announce increases in the cost of basic types of fuel two or  three months in advance in order to prevent continuing  uncontrolled price hikes on essential types of raw materials.    According to the statement, the clamor about "the only  slightly reshuffled government" poses an attempt by some  political forces "to lay the blame for economic blunders on the  president and prime minister." "The record fall in production --  by over 25% in the first month of the current year, and  the  runaway price hikes -- in January prices rose by 20%, are  a  consequence of the shock therapy policy adopted by the  monetarist reformers in January of 1992," the statement says.</p>

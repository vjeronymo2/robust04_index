MK Binyamin  Netanyahu told Juppe that the concept that every ethnic minority  should have a state is dangerous for Europe even more than it is  for Israel. That is why Likud is offering autonomy for the  Palestinians. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the  meeting was attended by MK's Moshe Qatzav, Eliyahu Ben-Elisar,  and Tzahi Hanegbi.</p>

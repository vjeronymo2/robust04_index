			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Germany today refuted  news reports that Bonn will export submarines to Taiwan through  the United States.    The German Government will continue to abide by the decision  made by the Federal Security Council to ban submarine export to  Taiwan, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today on behalf of  Minister Claus Kinkel.    Meanwhile, an Economic Ministry spokesman told reporters  that  the German Government had ruled out the possibility of exporting  submarines to Taiwan via the United States a year before, adding  that no German shipyards are currently applying for such exports.    The denials followed reports in HANDELSBLATT and some other  German papers that Germany may ship parts of submarines to the  United States to be assembled there for sale to Taiwan.    The reports said the deal is related to Germany's export of  high- speed trains to Taiwan.    On January 28, 1993, the German Federal Security Council had  rejected requests from business circles for exporting submarines  and corvettes to Taiwan.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Obituary of Peter Jenkins: Leading political journalist PETER Jenkins, who died yesterday at the age of 58, was one of the most accomplished British political journalists and one who was equally at home writing about foreign affairs. Although he spent the last five years as associate editor and political columnist at The Independent, and was initiated into national journalism by two years at the Financial Times, it is probably for his long spell at The Guardian that he will be most remembered. Jenkins made his breakthrough at The Guardian as labour correspondent during the first years of Harold Wilson's premiership - a time when industrial disputes and trade union law topped the political agenda. He went on to become the paper's Washington columnist. When he returned to London as political commentator and policy editor in 1974, he watched the decline of the Labour party and the rise of Thatcherism. The latter did not attract him and he was saddened by the Labour government's failure to tame the excesses of the unions. Jenkins's political sympathies were with the Social Democrats and he recorded with pleasure the emergence of the SDP in 1981. He saw himself as part of the political process, helping the politicians and the public to communicate with each other. His book, Mrs Thatcher's Revolution, published in 1987, concluded that it was only 'half a revolution', which perhaps seems a more accurate judgment now than it did then. Jenkins moved briefly to The Sunday Times in 1985, but the paper's style did not suit him and he settled at The Independent two years later. Some of his best columns appeared only recently, when he assessed the current state of Germany, a country he had always followed closely. He was a member of the Konigswinter conference, which fosters Anglo-German relations. Outside politics and journalism, one of his chief interests was theatre. Jenkins had one child with his first wife, Charlotte. In 1970 he married the journalist Polly Toynbee, with whom he had three children.</p>

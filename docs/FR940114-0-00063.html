The allowable deflection shall be (2 x Lc)/180, where Lc is the measured horizontal eave projection from the wall.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fastening of structural systems.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Roof framing shall be securely fastened to wall framing, walls to floor structure, and floor structure to chassis to secure and maintain continuity between the floor and chassis, so as to resist wind overturning, uplift, and sliding as specified in this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For Wind Zones II and III, roof trusses shall be secured to exterior wall framing members (studs), and exterior wall framing members (studs) shall be secured to floor framing members, with 26 gage minimum steel strapping or brackets or by a combination of 26 gage minimum steel strapping or brackets and structural rated wall sheathing that overlaps the roof and floor. Steel strapping or brackets shall be installed at a maximum spacing of 24 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; on center in Wind Zone II and at a maximum of 16 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; on center in Wind Zone III. The number and type of fasteners used to secure the steel straps or brackets or structural sheathing shall be capable of transferring all uplift forces between elements being joined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Section 3280.306 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) introductory text and (b); adding a heading for paragraph (c) introductory text; revising paragraphs (c) (1) through (3) and (d) through (g) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;3280.306  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Windstorm protection_support and anchoring systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provisions for support and anchoring systems.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each manufactured home shall have provisions for support/anchoring or foundation systems that, when properly designed and installed, will resist overturning and lateral movement (sliding) of the manufactured home as imposed by the respective design loads. For Wind Zone I, the design wind loads to be used for calculating resistance to overturning and lateral movement shall be the simultaneous application of the wind loads indicated in &sect;3280.305(c)(1)(i), increased by a factor of 1.5. The 1.5 factor of safety for Wind Zone I is also to be applied simultaneously to both the vertical building projection, as horizontal wind load, and across the surface of the full roof structure, as uplift loading. For Wind Zones II and III, the resistance shall be determined by the simultaneous application of the horizontal drag and uplift wind loads, in accordance with &sect;3280.305(c)(1)(ii). The basic allowable stresses of materials required to resist overturning and lateral movement shall not be increased in the design and proportioning of these members. No additional shape or location factors need to be applied in the design of the tiedown system. The dead load of the structure may be used to resist these wind loading effects in all Wind Zones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Contents of instructions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The manufacturer shall provide printed instructions with each manufactured home specifying the location and required capacity of stabilizing devices on which the design is based. The manufacturer shall provide drawings and specifications certified by a registered professional engineer or architect indicating at least one acceptable system of anchoring, including the details of required straps or cables, their end connections, and all other devices needed to transfer the wind loads from the manufactured home to an anchoring or foundation system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

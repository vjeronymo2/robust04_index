			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / US bond market dips as Fed holds rates steady The US Federal Reserve indicated yesterday there would be no immediate move to increase interest rates, despite continuing concern in financial markets about inflation. In its traditional elliptical style, the Fed announced that yesterday's meeting of its policy-setting Federal open market committee had adjourned after more than four hours of discussions and would make no further announcement. Financial market economists said the Fed could still act to tighten monetary policy before the next FOMC meeting on November 15. Bond markets, which have shown much more anxiety about the possibility that inflation might accelerate than either the Fed or the vast majority of professional economists, fell by about half a point after the Fed declined to raise its rates. Equity markets remained largely flat. The Fed has not always announced its interest rate moves. But so far this year, to make clear it is taking action, the Fed has announced all five of its increases in short-term interest rates. When it raised both the discount rate and the Federal funds rate by half a percentage point last month, it said that was 'expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, non-inflationary growth'. Many economists believe the Fed has succeeded in slowing the economy to a steadier and less inflation-prone pace, but markets have been taken aback in recent weeks by signs that growth remains strong. Most alarming to bond investors was the jump in industrial production in August which took the capacity utilisation rate calculated by the Fed to 84.7 per cent, close to the 85 per cent level at which many economists believe industry starts to hit production bottlenecks, pushing prices upwards. While the Fed's first steps to tighten monetary policy earlier this year were widely accepted as necessary, its more recent rate rises have provoked opposition from Democratic members of Congress and business groups. Both feared that the Fed could kill off the economic recovery by raising interest rates too much. New York Comex gold broke Dollars 400 an ounce and surged to a fresh 13 1/2 month high after the committee adjourned. The dollar initially fell against the yen and the D-Mark, but quickly regained its footing, rising above Y98.0 and DM1.543.

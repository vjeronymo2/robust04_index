In a joint press conference following their meeting, both  government chiefs underscored the importance of the major  political events in their respective countries, the elections  and EU membership, and stressed the "excellent" relations  between their two countries which they agreed were highlighted  by economic and cultural exchanges of "the utmost quality."    Premier Ciampi added how Rome and Vienna had consolidated  their collaboration not only on a bilateral level, but also on  an international one, and reiterated Italy's full support for  Austria's membership in the European Union. Looking at the  political evolution in Italy, the Austrian chancellor observed  how "every nation, from time to time, goes through more or less  strong political change" adding how it was the duty of  neighboring countries "to take note of the rhythm of this change  and draw the consequences for themselves."    Vranitzky had words of praise for Premier Ciampi, whom he  described as "one of the interpreters and fundamental promoters"  of Italy's political and institutional renewal, and that he  wished him all his best.    Turning their attention to the ex-Yugoslavia, Ciampi said  both he and the Austrian chancellor agreed on the need to  intensify their common commitment in international forums in the  search for a solution. In reference to the ex-Yugoslavia's  territorial closeness to both Italy and Austria, the Italian  premier stressed how their common frustration for the duration  and brutality of the conflict had to be translated into a  stimulus for a greater commitment in the search for a solution.    Ciampi then went on to deny criticisms that the policy of  the  European Union towards the ex-Yugoslavia was being carried out  on the front line by France, Germany and Britain. Italy, he  argued, was on the front line with its participation through the  European Union and NATO and its contribution to United Nations'  efforts, but as a neighboring country its actions were limited.    Nevertheless, Ciampi stressed, this was in no way an apology  for the failure, up to now, of the international community to  find an effective solution and this has created "a felling of  frustration which must be transformed into a motive for greater  commitment."    For his part, Chancellor Vranitzky voiced Austria's  "enormous  admiration" for Italy's commitment in the ex-Yugoslavia and  expressed his and his nation's condolences for the deaths of the  Italian three-man television news teams in Mostar last week.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Letter: Reality of PowerGen pay talks Sir, The headline to your report on PowerGen's pay offer ('PowerGen grants pay deal of up to 5 per cent', March 12) talked the level of the settlement up to 5 per cent but, as was correctly reported in the latter part of the story, the reality is different. Such exaggeration damages the process of open and fair negotiation. The offer which is now to be subject to a ballot of the trades unions' members in PowerGen is for a 2.5 per cent increase in basic salaries for all staff. A further one-off lump sum bonus in recognition of productivity improvements is attached to the offer. Both sides recognise the substantial nature of such 'improvements', which have come from staff reductions of about 1,000 in the last year and nearly 4,000 since privatisation. Although the government does indeed still own 40 per cent of PowerGen it has maintained a consistent refusal to take an active role in the company's affairs (even when the coal crisis may have justified it). I have no hesitation in defending the freedom of both sides in the negotiations to reach an agreement tailored to PowerGen's circumstances.

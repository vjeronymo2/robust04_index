			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> TRUCK TERMINAL STANDARDS STRICTER  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol is starting to inspect commercial truck terminals  this week under new vehicle safety standards, Commissioner Maury Hannigan said  in Sacramento. The inspections were to begin this past summer under 1988  legislation, but the CHP held up enforcement because of several questions about  the statute that were clarified in subsequent legislation. Under the program,  commercial truck terminals are to be inspected at least once every two years.  Penalties range from fines to suspension or revocation of operating authority  for carriers that fail to meet standards.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DROPS CHARGE IN VAN NUYS SLAYING  </P> <P> A first-degree murder charge against a Van Nuys man was dismissed Thursday by a  Van Nuys Superior Court judge who ruled that the defendant's confession had  been obtained illegally.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said charges will be refiled  because prosecutors believe they have enough evidence against Stephen Rusty  Lockett, 29, to convict him without the confession.  </P> <P> Lockett was accused of killing Tracy Shay White, 33, whose body was found along  a road in Griffith Park, wrapped in blankets and sheets, on Sept. 9, 1988. She  had been killed by a blow to the head with a heavy object about 10 days  earlier, court documents said.  </P> <P> Lockett had called White's boss and said she would not be at work because she  was attending a funeral, said Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Berry. Lockett was  arrested on Oct. 14 in Las Vegas with White's car and credit cards.  </P> <P> Questioned by Los Angeles police in Las Vegas, Lockett said, "I'd just feel  more comfortable if I had an attorney," according to police transcripts of the  interview.  </P> <P> But he waived his right to counsel after being told an attorney was not  immediately available and that talking to police could help his case, the  transcript shows.  </P> <P> The transcript also quotes the detectives as emphasizing to Lockett that they  would in no way harm him or force him to talk if he did not choose to.  </P> <P> Lockett went on to tell detectives that he struck White with a hammer after she  attacked him with it. He said he wrapped her body in sheets and drove her to  the park.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Superior Court Judge James A. Coleman dismissed the charge because he  said Lockett clearly had tried to invoke his constitutional right to an  attorney before he confessed.  </P> <P> Lockett was rearrested Thursday and was returned to jail.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 27 March, Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet  secretary and chairman of Sakigake [Harbinger], commented on  such issues as deregulation and the controversial plan for the  formation of a new political party while he addressed the public  at three separate locations in Yokohama city to support an  election campaign by a party-backed candidate running in the  city's mayoral election.    Regarding deregulation plans, which are to be the  centerpiece  of a new market-opening package that the government plans to  issue on 29 March, Takemura said, "Our country has created  itself a handicap in that when it tries to import goods such as  automobiles, rice, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products, it  requires much time and cost for various inspection procedures  and paperwork." He stressed, "We must at least bring it  (deregulation) down to the level found in other major  industrialized nations."    As an example, Takemura cited inspection procedures for  automobiles. Noting that there are many people whose jobs are  linked to this system, while there are also people who seek its  abolishment, the chief cabinet secretary said, "Deregulation is  not a simple matter, but if we fail to carry it out, we cannot  revitalize our economy, nor can our country be able to associate  with the rest of the world on an equal partnership basis."    There are three candidates running in the ongoing Yokohama  city mayoral election. One is the incumbent mayor, who is  backed by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ], Komeito, Democratic Socialist Party  [DSP], and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which have all  jumped onto the same bandwagon. The second candidate is a  political newcomer who is being backed by Sakigake and the  United Social Democratic Party [USDP]. The third is a newcomer  backed by the Japan Communist Party [JCP].    Regarding this election, Takemura said: "Currently, the  general direction toward which Japanese politics is flowing is  determined by a handful of politicians engaged in back-room  collusive dealings. This election is an opportunity for the  people to decide whether they approve of such practices."  "Matters are often decided somehow through collusion, and this  is still the situation with central government politics," he  added. Apparently, Takemura's remarks are directed at Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, and others, in  criticizing them about how they have been proceeding with their  plans to form a new political party, as well as a large  parliamentary group.</p>

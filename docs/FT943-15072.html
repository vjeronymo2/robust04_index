			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / No fences for the world's party animals: Fans have mellowed the forces of law and order For fans visiting the US, the World Cup has been one long party, and they have joined in with gusto. They came prepared. They brought their flags and their face-paint, their hats, shirts, drums and horns. Every match has been played to the rhythm of songs and music quite alien to US sports fans. Early games involving the American team were strangely genteel compared to other matches. By the later matches they had begun to learn, though they still have a long way to go to match the Brazilians, for example, with their samba bands (which have to take turns to play), or the Mexicans and Irish. Even the Saudi Arabians - where did all those Saudi fans come from? - arrived with drums and mizmars (traditional horns), and sang their own version of the unofficial World Cup anthem: Ole; Ole, Ole, Ole; Ole, Ole. Every match has been a sea of colour: bobbing blocks of yellow or green for the South American tour groups, all in matching caps; lumps of orange where the Dutch sat; and everywhere the tricolour green, white and red or orange of Bulgaria, Italy, Ireland and Mexico. The friendly atmosphere has surprised the police. They were ready for hooligans. The weeks before the big start were filled with dickering between Fifa, soccer's governing body, and local police over temporary fencing around pitches. The police wanted it. Fifa said pens were for animals. Every ground has been full of police and guards. At Orlando an armed policeman stood by each staircase. The cop who stood just below the press box, crew-cut and black-garbed, was a master of menace. During the Mexico-Ireland match he kept his back to play, staring unsmilingly through huge mirrored sun-glasses, daring some unwise fan to make his day. By the the time the Irish returned to play Holland in the second round, however, he was going with the flow. Now he smiled. He batted a beach ball back and forth with fans and allowed them to pose for pictures in his OPD baseball cap. Expectations on both sides have been confounded. So far as I know, no visiting fan has been car-jacked while no law-and-order official has had his (or her) eyeballs sucked out by a defeat-crazed fan. Yesterday, the authorities said they had more trouble from American football and basketball crowds than they have had from the World Cup, which has attracted record crowds of 3m-plus. Fifa said there had been about 400 World Cup-related arrests in the nine host cities, mainly for black-market ticket sales. Fifa secretary-general Sepp Blatter said that the fans' behaviour - sometimes in heat of 100'F-plus  -had been 'grand.' There are plenty of English supporters here, though many are not England fans. It is difficult to know how England fans would have behaved if their team had qualified. Why did it have to be two English fans giving the harassed gate attendant so much abuse when it looked as if the flight from Dallas to Orlando last week was over-booked? I ran into them again in Dallas last Friday night, watching the Brazilians samba from a slight distance. 'What would it have been like if England had been playing here tomorrow?' I asked. 'They'd've been smashing the place up,' came the confident reply. But they were not very observant. The place was crawling with police. Just round the corner I saw four cops, looking faintly ridiculous in summer shorts. They, too, were smiling. But they carried guns and long night-sticks. Party on Ricardo] Party on Krassimir]</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / PLO to set up Palestinian police force: First fruits of peace agreement appear THE first fruits of the agreement signed this week between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation began to emerge yesterday. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, flew to Egypt for talks on setting up a Palestinian police force, an Israeli team made plans to visit Tunis for talks on refugees, and the US confirmed that it would release Dollars 30m in security assistance to Jordan which it had blocked since the Gulf war. The establishment of Palestinian police units to take responsibility for security in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho after the first stage of Israeli troop redeployment is one of the main priorities for the PLO. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, stressed on Tuesday that he would judge the PLO commitment to peace on its ability to end violence in the occupied territories. The PLO is expected to hold talks with Hamas, its main rival in the territories which has opposed the peace process, in Yemen later this month. There has been no indication yet from Hamas leaders they are prepared to halt attacks on Israeli forces in the West Bank and Gaza, even after the troops have withdrawn from the main areas of population. Mr Arafat said after talks in Alexandria yesterday with President Hosni Mubarak that he was grateful for Egyptian assistance in training a police force and other professionals. He also described Egypt as the principal architect of the plan to introduce limited Palestinian autonomy first to Gaza and Jericho, asserting that Mr Mubarak had first put the idea to Mr Rabin when the two men met in April. 'It would be unjust to say that Egypt played a role. Egypt was more than a participant in what we achieved. It was a complete and full partner,' said Mr Arafat. His statement followed criticism in Cairo newspapers that Mr Arafat had not mentioned Egypt's role during his speech at the White House on Monday. Mr Amr Musa, the Egyptian foreign minister, said the talks had also focused on convening committees to flesh out the peace pact and arrangements to be taken before the actual transfer of authority from Israelis to Palestinians. 'We discussed certain steps such as negotiations on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Jericho and Gaza, the committees that will prepare for elections there, and the arrangements and co-ordination with Egypt and Jordan concerning the return of displaced people and matters pertaining to the established administration,' he added. In Amman yesterday officials expressed their satisfaction at the US decision to release the Dollars 30m in blocked aid. The released funds comprise Dollars 15m in economic support, Dollars 9m in military aid, Dollars 500,000 for military training and the remaining Dollars 5.5m for general projects. The decision also reflected US satisfaction at Jordan's improved participation in the imposition of sanctions against the Iraqi regime of President Saddam Hussein. US officials said yesterday they were examining other ways of pushing forward the process, including convening a meeting of potential donors to back the Israel-PLO accord. The State Department on Wednesday hosted a day-long meeting with senior officials from the White House, National Security Council and US Agency for International Development to discuss a possible aid summit. President Bill Clinton also made a 40-minute telephone call to President Hafez al-Assad of Syria to assure him of US support for an eventual Israel-Syria deal. He also urged Mr Assad to rein in 'rejectionist' Palestinian opposition to the PLO-Israeli accord. At least 10 rejectionist groups are based in Damascus. Israel confirmed yesterday that it was sending officials to Tunis for talks on Palestinian refugees. The visit is intended primarily to prepare for next month's multilateral round of talks on refugee issues which were scheduled to run in parallel with main bilateral peace talks in Washington. Jordan also yesterday began asking Palestinians living in the country illegally to register with the police. The measure appeared to apply to residents of the West Bank and Gaza who came to Jordan on temporary visits. Most of them have Jordanian passports but are limited to one-month stays in the kingdom. 'This is only a routine measure to allow them to rectify (the status of) their stay,' said a Jordanian official. 'We will not take any action against anyone.'</p>

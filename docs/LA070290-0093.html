			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANONYMOUS CALLER OFFERS BICYCLE TO RAPE VICTIM, 13  </P> <P> Moved by the story of a 13-year-old Westminster girl who was raped and her  bicycle stolen, an Anaheim woman Sunday offered to replace it with her own  15-speed bike.  </P> <P> The woman asked to remain anonymous.  </P> <P> "Just tell her somebody loves her," she told police.  </P> <P> Westminster officers got the woman's Schwinn bike, gave it a license and sent  it to a shop to fix a flat tire and add a pump. They expect to present it to  the girl today, Lt. Andrew Hall said.  </P> <P> The youngster was attacked Friday afternoon by a man who lured her to a  secluded area at Warner Intermediate School with a ruse about needing help with  some puppies, police have said. The rapist then took her new 15-speed mountain  bike and was last seen heading west on Westminster Avenue near Newland Street.  </P> <P> Lt. Hall said the bicycle donor "called out of the blue" Sunday morning after  reading about the rape. She insisted her name be withheld, even from the  teen-ager, who was recuperating at home from her ordeal.  </P> <P> "Really and truly, people out there are good," Hall said. "It's people like the  woman who donated the bike today who make you get up in the morning and do it  all over again."  </P> <P> Investigators this week will try to put together a composite drawing of the  rapist, who police said may be responsible for other recent attacks in the  area.  </P> <P> Authorities described the attacker as 19 to 20 years old, about 6 feet tall,  weighing about 175 pounds, with blue eyes and brown hair that was cut short on  the sides and long on the top. He was wearing blue jeans and a white T-shirt.  </P></p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Observer: Craven A and B John Craven, chairman of Morgan Grenfell and member of the board of Deutsche Bank, is used to playing in the big league. So the sight of his name as the contact for a small deal done yesterday by P&amp;P, a computer software company, raised a few eyebrows. Business at Morgan Grenfell must be pretty slack when the chairman gets involved in a deal for a company with a market capitalisation of Pounds 45m. However, it seems that there are now two John Cravens. How long will it be before Craven junior gets the Deutsche Bank board minutes?</p>

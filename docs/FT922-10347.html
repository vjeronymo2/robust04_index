			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Optimism on demand boosts oil price OIL PRICES moved ahead again yesterday after edging upwards for most of the week as traders began to take a more optimistic view of oil demand. North Sea Brent crude oil for June delivery rose by 47 1/2 cents to Dollars 19.67 1/2 a barrel and traders said there were few signs of it weakening. The market was strengthened earlier this week when two Norwegian shipping unions went on strike. The industrial action was short-lived and had no effect on oil deliveries, but nevertheless lent some strength to oil prices. Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London said there had been some strong buying from oil refiners in the US. 'The second quarter is providing shopping opportunities for those who like to line up barrels for later in the year: when the market started to run, they thought they'd better buy or miss the boat.' Some traders say they are expecting higher oil demand than forecast, particularly in the US, amid signs that the world economy is tentatively picking up. Ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last Friday agreed to stick to their production ceiling of some 23m barrels a day. They stressed their intention of getting all members to cut output as agreed in February. The Opec agreement set a slightly firmer tone for the market but traders say it was not a major factor in pushing up prices. In New York, June futures prices edged up from Dollars 20.77 a barrel to Dollars 20.85 a barrel in late trading.</p>

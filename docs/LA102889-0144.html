			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUPED-UP SEWAGE PLANT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY IN LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> PRESERVATION: THE CITY'S OLD WASTE TREATMENT FACILITY WITH 'MEDITERRANEAN  INFLUENCE' HAS WON A SPOT IN ITS NEW HISTORIC REGISTER.  </P> <P> An old silo-shaped building, wrapped by a winding staircase, nestles against a  hillside on Laguna Canyon Road, its former purpose nowhere in evidence.  </P> <P> But the old cylinder at Forest Avenue in Laguna Beach once had a most definite  purpose, which its design was meant to hide. The 54-year-old building was the  city's sewage treatment plant.  </P> <P> "It was built to look like anything but what it is," said Jack Cressman, an  architect in Laguna Beach. "They tried to make it look like a little Normandy  castle with a Mediterranean influence. There was a lot of revivalism going on  at that time."  </P> <P> Because of its design and architecture, the plant recently was listed on the  city's new Historic Register, perhaps the only sewage treatment facility to  have that honor, city officials say.  </P> <P> SH Part to Be Demolished for Parking  </P> <P> The listing means that the cylinder and adjacent office will be preserved. The  rest of the plant, however, will be demolished to create more parking for city  employees and tourists.  </P> <P> In 1932, the council hired Frank Currie of Currie Engineering Co. to design the  plant. According to a 1935 article written by Currie, the city applied for  Works Progress Administration money after an attempt to sell bonds for the new  plant failed.  </P> <P> Funds received totaled $161,500 -- about the same as the cost today of  demolishing part of it.  </P> <P> The Laguna Canyon site was chosen because it was zoned non-residential. It was,  however, within a block of the Woman's Club and two blocks from City Hall and  the fire station. Therefore, the council wanted to use every known method of  odor control and state-of-the-art sewage treatment, the article said.  </P> <P> As a result, technology at the old plant is not much different from that used  in modern facilities.  </P> <P> After several treatments, effluent was discharged through a cast iron pipe to a  point 300 feet offshore. Sludge was dumped into the ocean every six months via  that same pipe but "out of bathing season" and while the tide was going out.  </P> <P> For odor control, sewage was prechlorinated at a manhole about 50 feet from the  plant. A ventilation system changed the air in the plant every 10 minutes, and  exhaust air passed into a flue which extended up the hill into a  lighthouse-shaped chimney 200 feet above the plant.  </P> <P> The plant served the city until 1983, when a new one was built in Aliso Canyon.  </P> <P> "Now, 2.1 million gallons are processed each day," said Terry Brandt, director  of Laguna Beach municipal services. "The treatment plant itself is not  overburdened, but the city is budgeting funds for repairs on certain problem  areas. . . ."  </P> <P> The City Council this month gave final approval to a $700,000 upgrade of the  city's sewer system, a response to a rash of raw sewage spills. Since July,  1987, more than a dozen spills have contaminated beaches.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Incentives Offered for Preservation  </P> <P> The old cylindrical sewage plant joins 771 other structures on the city's list  of historic places, a compilation begun in 1980. The Historic Preservation  Ordinance, enacted this month, gives owners of those historic buildings  incentives for preserving their places. For example, it gives latitude in  zoning for additions to those properties to discourage owners from demolishing  the old structures.  </P> <P> "Part of the charm of Laguna Beach is our older cottages," said associate  planner Tamara Campbell. "Land prices are astronomical and people were buying  the cottages and tearing them down. We had to find a way to help people keep  them by adding on and increasing living area to accommodate modern needs. Now,  if the old places are torn down, buildings are limited to new, strict building  code requirements."  </P></p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / A fragile peace turns to dust on Beirut's blasted streets: Hopes of a new beginning are evaporating THE WAR was supposed to be over; the barriers were bulldozed by the Lebanese army last summer. Peace was supposed to mean freedom of passage  - an end to barricades of burning cars and tyres. The Lebanese thought they had exorcised the bad memories of 1975, when the civil war started with riots similar to those that wracked the country this week. How quickly Lebanon's impoverished peace reverted to anarchy; how unnerving to see pistol-toting militiamen striding purposefully down Hamra Street again, among the small boys wielding sticks festooned with devalued Lebanese pound notes. They delighted in the sound of shattering windows, in the shouted obscenities against the government. When the riots which toppled Prime Minister Omar Karami's government were over, only the glass merchants would benefit from the orgy of breakage. There hadn't been such demand for new window panes since the artillery bombardments of 1990. Was it premature then, the refurbishing of shops and restaurants? Had Beirutis been too quickly seduced by an elusive peace? In the Unesco quarter, just 100 metres from the home of the speaker of parliament, the elegant, newly-erected facade of the Bank of Kuwait and the Arab World was devastated. Chunks of white marble, chipped off by the rioters' crowbars, lay in the street, alongside felled pink granite columns. The Middle East insurance executives who convened in Beirut this week will not forget their lunch at the seafront, marred by a crowd throwing empty bottles. 'Why should you eat when we have no food?' the people shouted. And  -shades of Marie-Antoinette - President Elias Hrawi is sure to remember the housewives and children who marched to his home in Zahle in the Bekaa Valley crying, 'Give us bread, we are hungry.' Until this week, it was easy to forget those dispossessed by peace, the ragged thousands who took to the streets to the cheers of their better-off compatriots. Since the beginning of May, the street lamps were lit on the Mediterranean Corniche for the first time in nine years. On balmy evenings, families walked along the promenade, buying coffee from the sidewalk vendors while Arabic music blared from pushcarts offering audio-cassettes, the sesame-studded bread known as ka'ak, peanuts, sunflower seeds and pistachios. There was a profusion of florists and stalls offering exotic fruit. Smith's grocery store had revamped its facade with bright red awnings. For a price that few Lebanese could afford, there was duck liver pate, imported crab meat and champagne. In Hamra Street, the shopowners who yesterday assessed the damage had stocked the latest 'roulette' five-disc CD players, French designer clothes and copies of the same clothes from Turkey. But housewives bemoaned the price of tomatoes; from LPounds 600 per kilo in January to LPounds 2,000 this week. And Filipino maids were hard hit by government corruption. As the rioters began burning tyres on Tuesday night, the most wealthy member of an old Beirut Moslem family told his dinner guests that he had been offered Dollars 55m for his 19th century mansion and grounds, but wouldn't consider selling. The owners of a grand Ottoman house on the heights above Raouche were asking Dollars 12m  - but of course the house would be torn down to make way for a high-rise building immediately after the sale. Like many of their fellow Lebanese, the dinner guests betrayed their nostalgia for the exiled Lebanese General Michel Aoun. 'There has never been any problem between the Lebanese  - Moslems and Christians want to live together, if only the foreigners would leave us alone,' went the old, unconvincing refrain. The Syrians have launched a timid public relations campaign, prompting their clients in the Shia Moslem Amal militia to cover walls with posters showing clean-cut, smiling Syrian soldiers handing out toys to Lebanese children. 'The sons of (Syrian President Hafez) Al-Assad are here to protect the future of Lebanon,' the posters proclaim. But the Syrian soldiers melted away before the mobs who swarmed through Beirut on Wednesday. Former Prime Minister Karami's government said it wanted them to stay in Beirut beyond the September 1992 deadline set by the Taif peace accords. No one knows what the next government will say. No one knows whether the first parliamentary elections in 20 years will take place this summer. Once again, the Lebanese are mustering their famed skills of survival. The economic crisis has denied them simple pleasures that even the war never touched. Yet again, the promise of a new beginning lies in streets strewn with broken glass and burning rubbish.</p>

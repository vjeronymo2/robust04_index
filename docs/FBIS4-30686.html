			<p>CSO     [Text] Movements in the foreign exchange market, which  resulted in the dollar dropping below the 100 yen mark, have  imposed a new burden on the conference of the seven principal  nations' finance ministers and central bank presidents (G-7)  which aims to put the world economy on a course of stable  expansion. Up to this point, the strong yen reflected "political  pricing" influenced by statements of high-ranking U.S.  Government officials, but this time the major difference is that  the strong yen has been triggered by fears of U.S. inflation and  changes in economic trends encompassing an economic recovery in  Japan and Europe. Japan and Europe take the position that the  United States must raise its interest rates to calm fears of  incipient inflation, but the U.S. Government is cautious out of  fear that such a move could interrupt the economic recovery. It  appears that the near-term focus will be on whether differences  in views among the respective nations can be coordinated at the  conference of principal nations (Naples summit) in early July.    A factor underlying the recent weakness in the dollar is a  move to reduce interest differentials between the United States  and Germany. At the beginning of the year, the market rate on  30-year government bonds which serves as a barometer was at 6.3  percent, but recently has risen to around 7.5 percent. On the  other hand, the German economy recently showed signs of hitting  bottom and market interest rates on 10-year government bonds,  which stood at 5.7 percent at the beginning of the year,  recently rose to 7.3 percent. Interest rate differentials  between the two nations, which stood at about 1 percent in the  spring, have shrunk to about 0.2 percent.    Such trends have recently encouraged money that was  concentrated in dollar-denominated assets to shift to European  investments such as mark-denominated assets, causing the recent  weak dollar-strong mark relationship. Further, the rise in crude  oil and grain markets because of the favorable U.S. economic  climate has magnified fears of inflation. Moves to buy marks  have also influenced similar moves in yen-denominated assets,  leading to the recent strong yen.    Market intervention in this cycle has been limited to  actions  by the Bank of Japan and the expected intervention by the  Federal Reserve Board did not take place, accelerating the  disposal of dollars while reflecting a lack of any effective  measures by the G-7. Further, the quick break in the value of  the dollar at 100 yen which was believed to be a line of  resistance symbolized the fragility of any cooperative actions  to support monetary values.    In the near term, the focus will be on whether the G-7  nations will be able to take coordinated intervention action in  currency markets. There is the view in certain quarters such as  that held by former Ministry of Finance official Makoto Utsumi:  "The United States should be formulating tactics and strategy to  respond appropriately to speculators." On the other hand,  opinions exist such as that of Managing Director Toshiaki  Kakimoto of the Japan Research Institute, who says, "If the  United States is unable to formulate appropriate tactics and  strategy, the weakness in the dollar will persist."    On a medium- and long-term basis the markets reflect the  view  that "the U.S. Government has failed in its efforts to calm  fears of inflation," and unless the U.S. authorities quickly  prepare clear-cut inflationary measures, pressure to sell the  dollar will remain.    It appears that Japan and Europe will express the view at  the  Naples summit that the United States needs to implement a fifth  series of interest hikes. The United States fears a decline on  three fronts--including stocks and bonds as well as the  dollar--causing it to be cautious and posing difficulties for  any coordinated action.    On the other hand, Japan has already played its financial  and  fiscal policy cards and manifests conspicuous signs of striking  a barrier. It is unclear as to what responses it can effectively  formulate in the face of political turmoil.</p>

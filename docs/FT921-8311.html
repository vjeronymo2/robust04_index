			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Howard condemns Labour's 'evil' links THE CONSERVATIVES yester-day fielded no fewer than six ministers at a press conference in an attempt to raise the profile of Labour's union links in the election campaign, Philip Stephens writes. Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, warned that a government led by Mr Neil Kinnock would return Britain to the industrial relations chaos of the 1970s. He described Labour's policies as 'made for the unions by the unions' and referred to the 'evil' links which gave union leaders control of Labour's policymaking machinery. His comments were derided by Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, as 'a pathetic attempt to divert attention from the Conservatives' mismanagement of the economy'.

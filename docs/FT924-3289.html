			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Ford to raise prices by up to 10% in January FORD yesterday announced plans to increase car prices by between 4 1/2 per cent and 10 per cent, surprising the industry and provoking consumer group and political protests. Ford, which has made heavy losses and whose UK market leadership is under severe pressure, blamed the rises on sterling's devaluation and other cost increases. The rises - effective from January 3 - include 7.5 per cent increases for Sierras and Granadas and are larger than any imposed or indicated by rivals. The Consumers' Association and opposition politicians said Ford appeared to be seeking to lead the industry, not consumers, in reaping the benefits of the recent abolition of 5 per cent special car tax, averaging Pounds 400 a car. Ford rejected the allegation, saying: 'Our costs have risen far more than the increases we have put forward as a result of the devaluation.' Nevertheless, its move was seen as a potentially risky gamble by some industry analysts. As market leader for many years, Ford has led several rounds of increases and been able to rely on rivals following suit. But Vauxhall is challenging its leadership. With other rivals professing little inclination towards further rises, Ford may find itself isolated while bearing the brunt of consumer criticism over the already stormy issue of perceived high UK car prices. Rover said it had no plans to raise prices, as did Vauxhall, which announced a 3.25 per cent rise just before car tax was abolished. German manufacturers, worst hit by devaluation, have already put up prices and may raise them again in the new year. Mr Stephen Locke, the Consumers' Association's director of policy, said Ford's move 'confirms all our worst fears about the manufacturers' desire to see the UK as a high-price, high-profit market'. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, accused the industry of failing to pass on car tax savings. 'The chancellor is being walked over by the manufacturers,' he said. Mr Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, said the rises may indicate a strategy change by Ford to a lower market share but with profitable sales.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL VOTES MORE LOWER-COST HOUSING  </P> <P> Concerned about the availability of low-cost housing in this affluent beach  town, the City Council has increased the proportion of low-cost homes  developers must provide as part of new projects.  </P> <P> The city's housing plan now requires that 20% the of all developments larger  than five units be set aside for low-cost housing and that the housing remain  in the possession of low-income families for 20 years. The previous standard  required 15% of new projects to be low-cost units and remain so for 10 years.  </P> <P> Developers have the option of paying a fee to the city in lieu of building  low-cost homes. The fee would go into a fund for building low-cost housing.  </P> <P> As part of the plan, the council also created a committee to monitor  developers' compliance with the housing requirements. The committee, called the  Housing Authority, will also oversee the resale of low-cost homes to make sure  they remain in the hands of low-income people.  </P> <P> The council has not yet determined the size of the committee or who will serve  on it.  </P> <P> State law requires that every city have provisions for low-cost housing and  that the standards be revised every five years.WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

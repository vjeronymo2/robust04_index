			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Management: In the very best of company The largest European employers are a virtuous lot - or at least they claim to be. More than 90 per cent have equal opportunities policies, almost that number sponsor cultural or sporting events, and more than 60 per cent say they have carried out environmental audits. These are the latest findings of a survey* from the Henley Centre for Forecasting which has questioned the top 500 employers across sectors in the European Community about their employment practices. A surprising 32 per cent of organisations - half in the public sector - claim to have a woman on the board or in a similar top function. Job sharing is offered by 48 per cent, career breaks by 59 per cent and maternity leave beyond legal requirements by 40 per cent. However, the Henley researchers say the survey shows that women's careers remain hampered by lack of childcare: on-site childcare is provided by 9 per cent of companies and an additional 16 per cent have off-site provision. Dissatisfaction with employers' childcare facilities is high, particularly in countries with a relatively weak family structure, such as the UK, France and Germany. On training and education, 87 per cent of employers say they have formal management development programmes and 85 per cent subsidise employees' studies. Meanwhile, 66 per cent offer retraining programmes and 42 per cent offer extended study leave. Henley notes the increasing effort that organisations are having to make to impress consumers with their green credentials and social awareness. The proportion of EC manufacturing companies which have carried out environmental checks on their activities, or intended to carry out such audits, is nearly 70 per cent. Overall, Henley considers the survey results give a positive impression of employment practices and conditions in Europe's largest companies. However, without increases in childcare provision, there is likely to be little growth in the numbers of women achieving executive and managerial grades, the report concludes. *Contact Eric Salama, Henley Centre, 2 Tudor St, London EC4Y OAA.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Accountancy Column: Pieces of Cadbury still await consumption - Andrew Jack explains that two of the report's mostvital recommendations have yet to be implemented An unlucky 13 months or more after launching his report on the financial aspects of corporate governance, Sir Adrian Cadbury must be beginning to wonder whether its final chapters will ever be completed. While companies are now frequently making reference to the code in their accounts, they have had to be assured that they need only comment on those aspects for which final guidelines have been issued and come into force. Two vital elements are still missing. Introduced into the committee's debates relatively late in the process, and squeezed almost as a casual aside into the draft text, are a couple of points with which companies are expected to comply but for which guidelines have still to be finalised. The first says that 'directors should report on the effectiveness of internal control, and the auditors should report on their statement'. The second says 'directors should state in the report and accounts that the business is a going concern, with supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary, and the auditors should report on this statement'. The two phrases seem innocuous enough. But rarely have so few words triggered such ferocious debate, lengthy expositions and inordinate delay. The disputes are still very much alive. In fact, the way things are going, it may well be early next year, if at all, before companies are in a position to start complying with the going concern and internal control recommendations. That would be just a few months before Cadbury's sponsors are charged with appointing, by the end of June 1995, a new group to assess progress and develop new suggestions. Existing guidance is certainly weak. Present companies legislation requires directors to maintain adequate accounting records to enable them disclose the financial position of the company at any time with reasonable accuracy. That suggests the need for internal controls without any explicit requirement. The companies acts also require accounts to be prepared on the presumption that the company is a going concern, defined in SSAP 2, the accounting standard on disclosure of policies, as likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Auditing guidelines, in turn, say this is normally six months after the date of the audit report or a year after the balance sheet date, whichever is the longer. The specific requirements are vague. The sting in the tail is the second sentence of each of the two Cadbury recommendations: that the accountancy profession together with preparers of accounts should develop criteria and guidance on the topics for companies and auditors. Getting a group of accountants and company executives to agree has proved far harder than probably anyone initially expected. How useful any final wording will be remains open to question. The troubles first began last June with a speech by Michael Lawrence, the former finance director of Prudential and chairman of the 100 Group of finance directors of leading companies, who recently became chief executive of the Stock Exchange. He was critical of 'corporate overload' as a result of so many new sets of guidelines. The result was the 'overload group', which has since met regularly to help co-ordinate discussions and ideas. In practice, this has meant delays for the guidelines on internal controls and the going concern statement. One of Lawrence's prime concerns - echoed by much of business - was (and remains) that the internal controls proposals ranged far more widely than Cadbury's initial suggestions, with excessive and potentially meaningless disclosures. Even the accountancy profession, which might stand to gain new fees from auditing and advising on more extensive internal control statements, is divided. For example, Gerry Acher, making his mark as head of accounting and auditing at KPMG Peat Marwick, says it focuses too far on the minutiae. Mr Roger Davis, head of auditing at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, takes a similar view. 'The profession has taken a fairly simple concept - is the board doing the right sort of thing on internal controls? - and turned it into dozens of pages of technical detail,' he says. 'We are in danger of shooting our clients in the back and ourselves in the foot.' On the other hand, Paul Rutteman, a technical partner with Ernst &amp; Young, who chairs the internal control working party, remains convinced of the need for a statement. He argues that directors are already responsible for maintaining internal controls, so they are not being placed under new obligations; nor should they need to incur additional expense to provide a statement. However, he does concede that the existing guidance is too lengthy, and is now working on a revised version with a remit to make it substantially shorter. The going concern debate has until recently taken place more behind the scenes, because it has primarily been seen as an internal technical debate for auditors and accountants. Yet its implications are as significant. That all changed when the Auditing Practices Board issued its own draft going concern guidance in December. This called for an extension of the period over which auditors should gain reassurance that the company is viable: for one year from the date on which the accounts are approved. Meanwhile, the working group convened at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales to develop the Cadbury guidelines has developed a different view: that rigorous going concern assurance is only feasible up till the date of the next balance sheet. Beyond that, their budgets and other information are more limited and the the assurance cannot be as firm. What this ignores - and the board has tried to rectify - is that companies in financial difficulties may well delay signing the accounts until long after the year-end, and just a few months before the next balance sheet date, giving going concern assurance over a very short period. Now Henry Gold, technical director of the institute, is suggesting a compromise: that reassurance over an extended period should be provided in the operating and financial review section of the annual report. It is clear that both the internal controls and going concern issues still deserve considerably more debate before final conclusions are reached. But that still ignores a more fundamental question: whether either statement will make any real difference to corporate governance. The risk is that the wording chosen will veer in the direction of the text in US annual reports, heavily vetted by lawyers and saying little that would provide a public clue to any financial problems. Mr Gold argues that the fact that directors are forced to make a public statement on either subject will concentrate their minds and force them to be more rigorous in meeting their legal obligations. But if directors need to be reminded more fully of their obligations to maintain internal controls and state whether their company is a going concern, that would probably be best achieved by a change to the law. If auditors are to be required to comment or contradict any such directors' statements they believe to be false, there will also need to be far firmer guidelines to force them in this direction. Merely adding new text triggers the danger of simply producing more bland text in the annual report, which readers will justifiably skip knowing that its contents are all but meaningless.</p>

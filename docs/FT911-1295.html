			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (11): 'A hand on the tiller for a long time' - Patti Waldmeir and Michael Holman speak to President F. W. de Klerk ARE you encouraged by the outline of constitutional principles put forward by the ANC? What do you have in common and where are there potential differences? Areas of potential difference are definitely there, but there are some interesting facets in their proposals (and) there are many areas of agreement on certain basic principles. Areas of difference focus on the (ANC) philosophy of very strong central government, as opposed to the concept of decentralisation of power, and absence of adequate provision for checks and balances to handle the problems arising from the diversity of South Africa's society. There is no doubt that a broad consensus now exists, that apart from a new constitution, there must also be a bill of rights, and that individual rights - we also put heavy emphasis, for example, on the protection of private property ownership - to a great extent can best be protected in a bill of rights. Even collective rights, in the religious field, in the cultural field, can be dealt with in a bill of rights (but) I don't think one can write policy into a constitution. You can write fundamentals into a constitution, you can write rules into a constitution, but you cannot write economic policy or social policy into a constitution. And inasmuch as their programme tries to do that, I don't think it is acceptable. On the issue of power sharing, do you feel that the principle of proportional representation should apply to the executive? Yes, the National Party has publicly stated that is its view. The Swiss model provides an interesting model, where the main role players are represented in the executive and where the executive operates on the basis of consensus. (Our) fundamental departure point is that a winner-takes-all constitution is very wrong for South Africa, it cannot work. I'm also on record as saying that there should not be a State President with so much power as I have. How well do you think the National Party might do in an election, and what kind of coalition might be formed? I think firstly that the National Party itself definitely has the potential to attract wide support across colour lines. But I also believe we must bring together those who share the same principles . . . but we're not pressing now for alliances . . . any impression of ganging up at this stage will threaten the negotiation process itself. But I have no doubt that when the real electoral process is in the offing, alliances will be formed, and that there will be a moderate alliance in which the National Party will play an important part, which has more than an even chance to win an election. Would you consider Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party a natural partner in that alliance? It's quite possible that the Inkatha Freedom Party and the National Party can move into an alliance, but I don't think they will be alone if the two of them decide to do so. The only definite statement which I have made is that I can't see us in alliance with the ANC, as long as the ANC is in alliance with the South African Communist Party, because the National Party is strongly opposed to communism. Is the National Party becoming over-confident? And is it taking seriously enough the degree to which violence is undermining Mr Mandela's authority? We are definitely not over-confident. The leadership of the party is deeply aware of the risks involved, of the fact that we are dealing with something which is fragile, of the dangers of continued violence as a factor not only undermining the ANC, but undermining stability. We are constantly involved in further planning to prevent violence and where it occurs, for impartial handling of violence. Individual members of police forces across the world sometimes make bad errors of judgement. But there is definitely no pattern . . . Police are there to safeguard the lives and property of all South Africans. Cannot more be done? Let's just look at it from another vantage point, Mr Mandela also says he's against violence. Have you seen some of his supporters participating in violence? In our case it's the exception, in his case it's the rule. The real perpetrators of violence, in the overwhelming number of cases, are the supporters of either the ANC or some other party. The funny thing is that the common denominator is that on one side you will always find ANC supporters. The government's recent White Paper on Land Reform took a strong line on the restitution of land to those forcibly evicted under apartheid . . . The White Paper states that a programme for the restoration of land would not be feasible. That does not meant government is unapproachable. Government's general approach to this issue is to address the cases concerned with sympathy and reason What is the next step in the negotiating process? We envisage a multi-party conference. Its aim is to reach consensus on underlying principles for a new constitution, as well as on the structure and functioning of a forum for constitutional negotiations. If consensus was reached on the principles of a new constitution, could this be put to a larger body, going some way towards meeting the demands of the ANC that the constitution be drawn up by this constituent assembly? As I say, the conference's aim is to reach consensus on underlying principles as well as on the structure and functioning of a forum for constitutional negotiations. Almost at the top of the agenda will be - if and when we agree on basic principles - how do we formalise this? What is in a name? The ANC will no doubt say, let's have a constituent assembly in terms of their proposal. We don't agree with the concept of a constituent assembly, but we are prepared to give structure and formality to such a forum. But the one principle over which we feel very strongly is that . . . we cannot create a constitutional vacuum in the sense of abdicating power to an interim government, or a constituent assembly, or a negotiating forum. In the final analysis, a new constitution will have to be passed by parliament, as an act of parliament, and by parliament as it is. Instead of using the term interim government, is it conceivable that the consultative process could take on a more formal structure, so that there might be a consultative body on education, on health, and so on? That type of thing is not out of the question and if agreement is reached on such a general approach I have nothing in principle against it. While rejecting an interim government, we accept that there must be certain transition arrangements. What are your thoughts on the concept of affirmative action? If affirmative action is to mean retribution, restoration, taking away from those who have, dishing it out, I'm absolutely against it. But I'm fully in favour of specific strategies to improve the quality of life of all South Africans, to wipe out backlogs, to improve education, to in a dramatic manner broaden the base of private home ownership, we're already doing all those things. Human development is the major challenge of the future, not constitution-making . . . I don't think one should ever, however, relinquish the principle of merit just for the sake of numbers. I'm not in favour of racism in any form. How concerned are you about the right wing, the Conservative Party? You earlier referred to over-confidence. About one thing I am confident: I will win a referendum among whites. With regard to the extra-parliamentary threat, I am not unduly concerned, but I think that might become a very serious threat if we were not to succeed in offering to the public of South Africa a well-balanced constitution with proper checks and balances. In terms of power sharing, can you foresee any time when the National Party will not have at least one hand on the tiller? In essence a political party exists because it believes in its policy. And the main goal of a political party is to be a winner at the polls. I believe the National Party, because of its very capacity to adapt to realities, is a young and dynamic party at this moment, although it has a long history. And that it will play a leading role - not in a dominating sense, but an important, fundamental role in government for as long as it retains its character of thinking along lines of principle, and of not being opportunistic, of having an open mind, and of constantly submitting itself to the question whether it needs to adapt and reform within the framework of its principles. I therefore think that because of its inherent strength, it will have one hand on the tiller for a very long time.</p>

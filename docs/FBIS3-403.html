			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Erna van Wyk and Norman Patterton] </F>   [Text] Pretoria March 5 SAPA -- Nothing would change the  Afrikaner Volksfront's [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] decision  to boycott the elections unless there was finality on the  volkstaat [homeland] issue, AVF leader Gen Constand Viljoen said  on Saturday. Addressing a news conference in Pretoria after the  rightwing transitional assembly's decision to boycott the  elections, Gen Viljoen ruled out all possibility of continuing  with the electoral process.    His dramatic 11th-hour registration of the Freedom Front on  Friday night would be allowed to lapse and no candidate lists  would be submitted, Gen Viljoen said. The "provisional"  registration of the Freedom Front had been a "strategic option"  to put to the transitional assembly but was rejected at the  session.    The decision had not been taken unanimously but by a "vast  majority."    Both Gen Viljoen and transitional assembly "President" Ferdi  Hartzenberg denied there was a split looming in the AVF's ranks  over the issue of going to the polls.    Gen Viljoen said he was happy with the rightwing  transitional  assembly's decision.    Dr Hartzenberg said the boycott would diminish the  legitimacy  of the polls and the AVF would not be part of subjecting the  Afrikaner people to communist rule. Continued pressure would be  placed on the polls, he added. They still wanted a plebiscite or  a referendum to determine support for the volkstaat and its  borders.    "I have an obsession to arrive at a position where my people  will survive," the general added. International mediation was  still an option and negotiations would carry on, he said.    Said Dr Hartzenberg: "We and others are not accommodated and  the ball is in court of government and the African National  Congress."    The borders of the volkstaat were not made known on  Saturday,  but the map had been distributed among transitional assembly  members and would be discussed at a later stage, he added.    Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]  leader Eugene Terreblanche also expressed his satisfaction with  the decision.    Dr Hartzenberg said AVF Gen Constand Viljoen's decision to  register the organisation on Friday night for the election was  "good," but the assembly had considered all the benefits and  drawbacks and decided not participate in the election.    Referring to the "provisional" registration for the polls by  the Inkatha Freedom Party, an AVF Freedom Alliance [FA] partner,  Dr Hartzenberg said the FA members were free to each make their  own decision as to whether to participate in the poll. Different  decisions would not affect the FA's unity, he said.    Dr Hartzenberg's announcement was applauded by rightwing  supporters who attended the open session of the assembly's  meeting in the Dutch Reformed Church synodal centre. All the  leading rightwing figures, including the Mulder brothers, were  present. Outside the venue, rightwingers displayed a banner  criticising Gen Viljoen's provisional registration. It said  participation in the election would amount to treason.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FREED ENRILE ASSAILS AQUINO OVER RISING PRICES, CORRUPTION  </P> <P> Philippine opposition leader Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, accused of involvement in  a coup attempt against President Corazon Aquino, launched a sharp attack on her  government Wednesday, a day after being freed from prison on bail.  </P> <P> The former defense minister, jailed last week on rebellion and murder charges,  said in an address to the Senate that prices in the Philippines are rising  rapidly and the value of the national currency is being eroded.  </P> <P> He also said there are worsening energy and water shortages and accused the  government of doing little to curb corruption.  </P> <P> Enrile, accused of involvement in last December's attempt to overthrow Aquino,  denied that he was doing anything to undermine the government.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court on Tuesday freed Enrile on bail pending its consideration of  the validity of the charge.  </P> <P> After the court's decision, retired army Gen. Felix Brawner, also charged with  rebellion for his alleged involvement in the December coup attempt, gave  himself up on Wednesday, the National Bureau of Investigation said.  </P> <P> Brawner told reporters the court ruling had prompted him to give himself up.  </P></p>

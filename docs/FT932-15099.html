			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Arts: Royal Opera House forecasts operational surplus of Pounds 266,000 for present financial year The Royal Opera House is projecting an operational surplus of Pounds 266,000 for the financial year 1992-3. At yesterday's press conference, Sir Angus Stirling, the ROH Chairman, was in a quietly bullish mood as he revealed how the house managed to confound gloomy forecasts for the period. The sum had been achieved by a 'year of steely endeavour' - economies in night-work, Sunday rehearsal and overtime, a wage freeze from last September, and alteration of the performance schedule by means of production cancellations and extra performances. The opera and dance companies have notched up an average 85 per cent capacity, more than the house's achievement previously, which compares very favourably with the West End's 64 per cent during the same period. The surplus, together with an anonymous donation of Pounds 500,00 (the first part of a gift of Pounds 2.5m, which is to be spread over the next three years), will go further toward reducing the accumulated deficit. Since the house is also budgeting for a surplus in 1993-4, they expect that deficit to be eliminated by the end of the next season. At the same time as giving these figures, the ROH published a response to the recent Arts Council Appraisal under Baroness Warnock in the form of a point-by-point listing of the committee's recommendations - the majority accepted by the management - together with the steps that have already been taken to implement them. Among these is the decision to widen the constituency of the ROH Board so as to render it more accountable: in future, all appointments will be made with the approval of the Heritage Minister.</p>

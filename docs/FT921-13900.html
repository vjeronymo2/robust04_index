			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Costs of equities INVESTORS regularly need to establish acquisition costs of their equity holdings for estimating capital gains. When various classes of shares, scrip issues and warrants etc. are involved, this can be a difficult and time-consuming problem. Are there any references that list and update this information on a regular basis? In a local library, look for either the Extel Capital Gains Tax Service published by Extel Financial Ltd or Stubbs Adjusted 31.3.82 Base date Prices published by Dunn &amp; Bradstreet International. The cost of both services puts them out of the reach of most private investors. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

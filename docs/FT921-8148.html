			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Abitibi-Price maintains dividend despite reverse ABITIBI-PRICE, the newsprint and paper producer controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family, is continuing to pay a dividend despite posting a substantial loss for the second year in a row. The Reichmanns own 82 per cent of Abitibi, which cut its annual dividend from CDollars 1 to 50 cents a share in 1990. The decision to pay the 12.5 cents-per-share quarterly dividend is widely interpreted as evidence of the financial strains being felt by the Reichmanns' heavy exposure to the depressed real estate market through their holding company, Olympia &amp; York Developments, whose interests include London's Canary Wharf project. Abitibi contributed about CDollars 28.4m (USDollars 24.40m) in common-share dividends to O&amp;Y last year. Last year's net loss at Abitibi was CDollars 75.9m, or CDollars 1.12 a share, compared with a CDollars 50.4m, or 76 cents, loss in 1990. The figures include charges of CDollars 44.4m last year and CDollars 54.1m in 1990 for restructuring to cope with the severe downturn in the Canadian forest products industry. Sales fell to CDollars 2.8bn from CDollars 3.1bn, while fourth-quarter sales tumbled by 23 per cent to CDollars 652m as the newsprint market continued to be hit by weak demand and intense price competition. The fourth-quarter net loss deepened to CDollars 48.1m from CDollars 34.7m last time. Abitibi said the outlook for newsprint remained poor in 1992 and further cost-cutting measures would be required. The company is expected to announce the closure of at least one of its eastern Canadian newsprint machines within the next few months. An operating loss at Provincial Papers, Abitibi's coated papers division, wiped out a small operating profit earned by the rest of the company. The company said a turnround at Provincial was one of its top priorities. Abitibi said that its balance sheet remained strong, with a debt-to-capital ratio of 30 per cent. Cash reserves increased by CDollars 100m last year and cash-flow had been improved by asset sales and belt-tightening.</p>

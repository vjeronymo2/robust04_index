			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Travel: Rome, the only speed is slow - Michael Thompson-Noel steps gingerly from sight to sight THURSDAY, 9am. I am about to board a coach for a 3 1/2 -hour tour of central Roman sights. It should not be over-strenuous: the Trevi fountain, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, St Peter's and then back across the Tiber to my hotel near the Villa Medici so I can gather my wits. I have not been to Rome before, and already I can see that I will not be disappointed. Rome is almost as I had imagined it, a giant pop-up postcard crammed with so much stuff - large, important stuff: ancient, medieval, Baroque and modern - that my head is spinning. Yet it is also strangely different: more dynamic, but also more intimate; noisier and crowdier in parts, but also more subdued; messier, nastier traffic, but also less flamboyance than I had expected. After a short drive we strike out on foot, and soon reach the Trevi fountain. I distrust people who are snobbish about sight-seeing, and would dislike anyone who had a rude word to say about this fountain. It is larger than I had imagined, and so far over the top that I warm to it at once. On a bench near the fountain a couple are canoodling. It is only 9.27, yet they are whispering and licking ears. I borrow a coin, and am about to throw it into the fountain - backwards, as instructed - when the guide rushes up. He is not a happy man. He jabs his finger at me. 'You must keep up,' he says. 'If you do not follow me you are certain to get lost.' We stroll towards the Pantheon. There is something to enjoy, some small or large delight, at almost every step. I notice that even the smallest cafes have Caravaggios on the walls and the bones of saints stashed beneath the floors. We are approaching St Peter's. On the sidewalk, a tramp shuffles past. A woman tourist recoils from him in horror. His feelings are badly hurt. 'Go on,' he shouts. 'Go and look at St Peter's, and then sod off home. Rome doesn't need tourists like you.' I spend a miserable 40 minutes in St Peter's Basilica, which depresses and saddens me. I am intimidated, and know that I am meant to be, for this is the architecture of totalitarianism. On the other hand, I recall what the writer Malachi Martin said: that Romans have long memories, and remember the time when the popes deserted them. Rome became the refuge of robbers preying on a few farmers, its monuments overgrown, so dank and smelly that it was known across Europe by the nickname 'Cowpatch.' Romans, says Martin, 'know with surety Rome will always house the Great Fisherman. Or cease to be Rome.' 1pm. I am restored to full happiness, for I am now enjoying lunch - an American Thanksgiving lunch - in the rooftop restaurant of the Hotel Hassler, one of the best in Rome, which is at the top of the Spanish Steps, next to the twin-domed Trinita dei Monti Church. In his latest travel book, The Happy Isles of Oceania, Paul Theroux warns against the corrupting effect of staying too long in luxury hotels. Their comfort and solitude, he says, can become an addiction. 'After even a short experience of luxury, anything less is like punishment.' Theroux is a wise man. But I am staying at the Hassler for only two nights, so my risk is a small one. Its location is superb, and the comforts it offers are complemented, as so often with grand hotels, by a zephyr of eccentricity. 3pm. Siesta. 5pm. I still haven't clapped eyes on the Colosseum, though I am reading a first-rate book by Roberto Luciani (The Colosseum, Istituto Geografico) which is telling me many things I did not know about the Flavian amphitheatre and its circuses. For example: what high-society women most longed for in ancient Rome was 'a gladiator of the Thracian speciality' (shield and short sword). 7.30pm. I am half-way down the Spanish Steps, which are crowded with flirts. There are knots of police, armed to the teeth. At the top of the steps, a six-strong Peruvian pipe band is playing something mournful from the Andean charts. The entire scene is heartwarming. Nor is it cold. Although it is late November, the temperature is 15`C. Malachi Martin says that May is the time to be in Rome, when the city is filled with flowers and sparkling fountains and the sky is the one that Raphael called 'the casement of Heaven.' But perhaps the thinning of the ozone layer is changing things around. Perhaps, next century, Rome in May will be as hot as Casablanca now, and tourists will only visit it in December and January. 9.15pm. Still haven't caught sight of the Colosseum. I am dining at El Toula, an extremely fine restaurant on Via della Lupa. I am in the company of three intimidatingly senior UK female travel writers - women who know the price of everything in 140 currencies and the value, when they encounter it, of flakes of white truffle sensuously scattered across a plate of risotto. We just keep on eating; nothing seems to stop us; soon we can hardly move. Friday, 11am. I have spent the morning pottering, avoiding major sights, concentrating on small stuff, the infilling of 20 centuries. Now I am in the Keats-Shelley Memorial House, the Casina Rossa, on Piazza di Spagna, at the foot of the Spanish Steps, chatting to the curator, Bathsheba Abse. Keats spent the last three months of his life here, dying, of tuberculosis, on February 23 1821. He was barely 25. At Keats' death, the room in which he died was thoroughly disinfected to comply with papal government regulations. The furniture, including windows and doors, was burnt in the square. Ms Abse is planning to turn the room back into a bedroom. You can still see the pale blue rosettes between the ceiling rafters. There was little else for Keats to stare at. He said the rosettes gave him the feeling of flowers growing over him. 1pm. Lunch in Piazza Navona. I am amazed, studying my map and glancing through a guidebook, at the sheer tonnage of Roman sights I have not yet been near. But you cannot hurry Rome, so what is the point of rushing? 4.30pm. Stretch limo to the airport. The traffic is appalling. Finally, in the livid twilight, I pass the Colosseum. God, but it's . . . huge.

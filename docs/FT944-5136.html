			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Brazil Brazil has been attracting a raft of positive recommendations from brokers in the course of the past week, and the outlook looks bright, writes John Pitt. Merrill Lynch has forecast that the equity market will grow by 50 per cent during 1995 and out-perform the rest of Latin America. The country's economic stabilisation programme, masterminded by president-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and the introduction of a new currency, the Real, in July, has so far cut inflation to around 3 per cent last month from around 50 per cent in July. Baring argues that 'the ingredients are now in place for Brazil to complete its transition to stability and for companies to start to reap the benefits of a more predictable environment'. Consequently, the broker has raised its overweight asset allocation to 39 per cent from 35 per cent. Foreign &amp; Colonial reckons Brazil could be one of the best performing emerging markets in the world throughout next year. While the new administration, which takes office in the January, will have numerous problems to tackle immediately, F &amp; C believes that the backdrop of a strong currency, strong president and economic package in place, will outweigh the difficulties.

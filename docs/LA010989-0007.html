			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE OF THE EARTH  </P> <P> Regarding your editorial "Children of Calamity" (Dec. 22) and Lawrence E. Bruce  Jr.'s article on Third World debt (Op-Ed Page, Dec. 22):  </P> <P> "We have met the enemy and he is us." While the UNICEF report makes for sad  reading, it is not nearly as important as the worldwatch "State of the Earth"  report.  </P> <P> UNICEF would have us stop sending axes to the Third World and start sending  chain saws and bulldozers to cut the rain forests down faster. We send oral  rehydration kits for 2 year olds, then we have to send boatloads of grain for  12 year olds, then the 18 year olds become either rebels or refugees. The  leftists blow up the power lines while the rightists kill the teachers.  </P> <P> This planet will support 1 billion living like Americans, 2 billion living like  Western Europeans, 3 billion living like Eastern Europeans, 5 billion living  like Chinese or 10 billion living like Ethiopians. If we insist on breeding  like rabbits, we will wind up living like rabbits; a handful of vegetation per  day, a dirt house and no clean water.  </P> <P> Bruce says we must import more from the Third World, so should we turn Africa  into a giant strip mine? He calls for "real aid" and "essential services." What  is really needed all over the world is a bottle of the new French birth-control  pills in every slum shanty and village hut. China is improving the quality of  life of its citizens and what is its reward? We call its population control  policies "draconian" and cut off funding. They have learned you can have  quality of life or quantity of life, not both.  </P> <P> WOODROW J. HUGHES  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

Estimating the patrol consisted of around three soldiers  from  the Reconnaissance Battalion of the Second North Korean Army  Corps, they said a rust-covered M-16 rifle and ammunition  indicate the weapons had been there for one or two years.    The North Koreans probably disguised themselves as South  Korean Army soldiers and tried to cross the river to observe  construction of a freeway along its southern bank, which was  completed more than a year ago, they observed.    The weapons, including a .66-caliber Soviet pistol with 17  North Korean-made ammunition rounds, German binoculars, an M-16  rifle with 213 rounds and two hand grenades, were found by Yi  Hui-un, 35, of Munsan, Paju-gun, Kyonggi Province, and two  friends along the river at 8:00 A.M. Sunday.</p>

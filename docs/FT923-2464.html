			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / China resists US pressure to cut tariffs THREE days of talks between the US and China, aimed at heading off the threat of a trade war over access for US goods, have ended in failure. Mr Michael Moskow, the deputy US trade representative, said nevertheless he remained 'hopeful' of progress. The dispute over access to the Chinese market for US goods threatens to blow up into a trade war. The US deficit with China stands at Dollars 12.7bn and is rising. Washington argues that China cannot be allowed to run up a huge trade surplus while keeping its own markets closed through tariffs, import licensing and other barriers. The US has warned it will impose punitive tariffs on about Dollars 4bn of Chinese products if the row is not resolved. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, last month issued a 44-page list of Chinese imports, including footwear, silks, luggage and electronic goods, that could face a doubling of tariffs unless China takes significant action to open its market by October 10. China retaliated with a threat to impose higher tariffs on US imports. The war of words between the two hotted up with the decision of President George Bush to sell F-16 fighters to Taiwan. Beijing reacted furiously, adding to the strain on bilateral relations. Outraged commentaries in the Chinese media accused the US of deceit, lies and interference in China's domestic affairs. Beijing said it would refuse to co-operate with the US in the UN and would stop buying American wheat if the F-16 sale went through. Mr Moskow said in Beijing yesterday the Chinese side had commented on US arms sales to Taiwan but it was not a serious part of the discussion. He stressed that the negotiations, which began a year ago, had focused on trade. Further talks are to be held in Washington in early October. One observer said he expected China to respond to US pressure at the eleventh hour, as it did in negotiations with the US on copyright and intellectual property. Heavily dependent on exports to fuel its economic boom, China would come off worst in any trade war and is unlikely to risk a confrontation. Only 2 per cent of US exports go to China, but America takes 20 per cent of Chinese exports. Mr Moskow said the outcome of the negotiations would affect US treatment of China's most-favoured-nation trade status and on US attitudes to China's accession to Gatt.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Arts: A sinuous, sadistic Giovanni At Covent Garden, in Johannes Schaaf's production, Don Giovanni is a Marquis de Sade figure - grey at the temples, sinuous in movement, permanently bent on exploring the extremes of pleasure, pain (for others) and freedom from the confinements of 'nice' behaviour. When not stalking the streets in search of new victims, or hovering in corners relishing the misfortunes of old ones, he goes home to eat dinner off a naked woman's body or refine the appurtenances of his bondage-sex studio. The sky glows red when he sinks to Hell - and, after that, bourgeois proprieties can be restored to Seville. There are many things to be said against the whole conception: they came to mind in growing number during Tuesday's revival of the one-year-old production. But since the show still elicits a riveting performance of the title role from Thomas Allen, there are points in its favour as well. Mr Allen is not 21 - the age of Luigi Bassi, the first Giovanni, at the time of the premiere - but a mature artist of astonishing stage potency, with a knack of closing an eyelid, pointing a finger or swivelling a hip-joint to convey menace that is the distillation of expressive economy. His singing, though perhaps a degree less fresh or strong throughout the range than in the past, achieves similar mastery: a flicker of colour or verbal accent speaks volumes. What he lacks is any kind of charm, wit, or sensual attractiveness. This, surely, is not Mr Allen's fault, but a consequence of production slant, which he supports with absolute steadfastness, suppressing in the process almost all his natural audience-wooing facilities in the presentation of an unredeemed reptilian brute. As in so much of Schaaf's work (at least as Royal Opera audiences have experienced it in his four Mozart stagings), this produces an immediate frisson of dramatic intelligence but a sacrifice of long-term logic and sustaining dramatic architecture. On a second viewing, indeed, I find much in this Don Giovanni production that simply will not bear a moment's scrutiny. (Anna so excited by bloodlust after 'Or sai chi l'onore' that she kisses Ottavio's sword-hilt? Elvira an Ophelia figure wistfully garlanding daisies while singing 'Mi tradi'? Come on now]) The fussy over-detailing and the finding of plausible (but usually banal) formulas in which to 'fix' characters' motivation may be one method of containing this untameable and all-but-unplayable masterpiece, but the steady promotion of theatrical momentum is not one of its benefits. This was underlined by the conducting of Bernard Haitink: the performance started solidly and rather ponderously, and for a good deal of Act 2 seemed to go dangerously limp. Much affectionate detail, much exquisitely shaped phrasing, not much electricity - the high-voltage excitements of Haitink's Glyndebourne Giovanni a decade ago were here no more than a distant memory. The stop-start pacing of recitative was one of the evening's minor irritations. At least, however, the cast is almost entirely first-rate: the revival, whatever problems it may place in the way of people seeking an intelligible 'overall' account of this opera, is a feast of good Mozart singing. Ann Murray's first London Elvira, vigorous, passionate and expertly controlled, and Angela Gheorghiu's first London Zerlina, delicate and fragrant of timbre, give particular pleasure; Hans Peter Blochwitz, the production's first Ottavio, sings 'Dalla sua pace' with wonderful gentleness and poise. Karita Mattila, who on Tuesday blurred some of her rising scales, is nevertheless very near achieving an Anna of heroic vocal stature. Bruno Caproni's Masetto is an asset in every scene. Of the original cast-members Claudio Desderi's Leporello shows greatest gain in authority: the voice may still sound a shade small for the house, but the pungent Italian utterance and thrusting characterisation are alone worth the ticket-price. Royal Opera House: in repertory until July 23.</p>

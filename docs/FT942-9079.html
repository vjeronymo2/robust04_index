			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Telecoms groups eye India: Liberalisation plans leave some tangled lines Mr Nagarajan Vittal, chairman of the Indian government's Telecommunications Commission, reads a letter handed to him by a secretary. It is an appeal from a VIP for two telephone lines. 'Tell him he can have one. He can't have two,' says Mr Vittal, handing back the letter and moving on to the next item. It is a measure of the shortage of telephone lines in India that the telecommunications department's top civil servant spends time allocating individual connections. 'I have to play God here,' says Mr Vittal, 'in big things and in small.' If Mr Vittal, a strong advocate of pro-market reform, has his way, in a few years the telecommunications commission's chairman will not have to help VIPs secure priority lines. Last week the government approved a new telecommunications policy, designed to provide telephones on demand by means of a huge expansion of the telephone network. Since the government cannot fund this transformation, it is ending the state monopoly of basic telephone services and inviting private companies, including foreign groups, to invest. Potential investors have welcomed the news but have said that much will depend on how changes are implemented. If bureaucrats drag their feet, as they have in the past, then Mr Vittal and his successors could still be dispensing VIP connections well into the next century. With only eight lines per thousand people, India has one of the least developed telephone networks in the world; China has 17 per 1,000 people, Malaysia has 130 and the global average is 100 lines. The country needs telephones, not only to fulfil its aim of increasing international trade and investment but also to provide a basic domestic communications network. Until last week, the government's aim was to increase the number of lines from 5.8m in early 1992 to 13.3m by the end of the current five-year plan in March 1997. But this would have left about 2.5m people still on the waiting list, so the target has been raised to 10m new lines. The government is relying on private companies to raise much of the extra Rs230bn (Pounds 4.8bn) it needs on top of Rs330bn ear-marked from public funds for 1992-97. Even before last week's announcement, private groups, including foreign companies, submitted 21 plans for telephone networks together worth Dollars 4bn. Among the foreign companies are industry leaders such as US West, AT&amp;T, and Motorola of the US, Siemens of Germany, and Japan's Fujitsu. Ms Boli Medappa, director of international projects at US West, which plans to invest up to Dollars 1bn in basic services, says: 'The new policy will stimulate the rapid expansion of communications networks.' But it will be difficult to meet the government's demanding timetable, given the department's past record in accommodating the private sector. With 46 trade unions, representing 470,000 workers, the telecommunications department has long been suspicious of changes which curb its influence. Since 1992, when value-added services such as cellular telephones and voice mail were liberalised, the department has been entrusted with handling potential competitors from the private sector. The result has been confusion and delay. Cellular telephones contract awards made in October 1992 have been challenged by unsuccessful bidders in a case now before the Supreme Court. As Mr Amit Sharma, Motorola's executive director for south Asia, says: 'Much depends on the speed and transparency with which the (new) policy is executed. Hopefully, the problems and delays that have occurred in licensing of value-added services will not be repeated now.' The prospects are not good. The department's trade unions lobbied against the early entry of private companies and found an ally in Mr Sukh Ram, the telecommunications minister, who argued with Mr Vittal over the admission of private companies. The result is a compromise; while private companies are being admitted, the department will be responsible for overseeing their entry, acting as both a competitor in providing services and as a regulator. The unions successfully resisted plans for splitting the department into a state-owned corporation and a separate regulatory body. Mr Vittal yesterday disclosed plans to divide the department into service and regulatory divisions, and, as head of the department, he alone would have authority in both areas. Mr Vittal said detailed guidelines would be laid down soon for the operation of private companies. These will include a requirement that companies operate in both urban and rural areas and that tariffs and arrangements for sharing revenue with the telecommunications department be approved by the government. Mr Vittal said he expected the first private operators to secure licences in two months. Proposals involving foreign capital will still be required to win separate approval from the government's Foreign Investments Promotion Board, which oversees foreign investment. The permissible level of foreign participation is to be decided 'case-by-case' but Mr Vittal said he hoped investments of up to 100 per cent should be permitted. Even if no new conditions emerge, there are more than enough hurdles for private companies to clear. Until last week it was not certain that they would be permitted to enter the race at all; now at least they are under starter's orders.</p>

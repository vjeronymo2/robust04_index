			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Books: Change and decay - A reassessment of the Nehru legacy OF DREAMS AND DEMONS: AN INDIAN MEMOIR by Patwant Singh Duckworth Pounds 16.99, 216 pages There has been a dearth of good political memoirs in India since Independence. Civil servants have felt too inhibited by the constraints of the Official Secrets Act to tell much that is new - or else have been unable to break free from the colourless bureaucratic style that has long cramped the growth of the English language in India. Politicians have been unwilling to rattle the skeletons gathering dust in the long years in which the Nehru family have dominated Indian politics. Thus the few good memoirs to have surfaced have been from writers/diarists like Raj Thapar, whose All These Years shed light on some of the humiliating compromises and failures of nerve amongst politicians and officials that allowed Mrs Gandhi to ride roughshod over the country's political institutions during the Emergency in the 1970s. Patwant Singh is in this tradition. He is neither civil servant nor bureaucrat. But like Raj Thapar, he is part of the relatively small elite whose connections have had a place in most administrations. Son of a wealthy Sikh business family, he founded India's first design magazine. He developed a taste for politics and international affairs, and branched out as columnist, author and crusader over issues close to his heart - saving Delhi's architectural heritage, or human rights in the Punjab. Self confident in his opinions, and never frightened of expressing them, he writes clearly and wittily. He is sharp in his comments on politicians but disappointingly reticent in his judgment of many other contemporaries. Patwant's theme is decay. He draws on the two sides of his career - design and politics - to underline the same message. The deterioration of Delhi's urban landscape through ugly high rise buildings and urban sprawl has been matched since independence by the erosion of political institutions and values. He holds Mrs Gandhi's short term political manoeuvring and unscrupulousness as largely responsible for many of the ills from which India now suffers - the accelerating pace of corruption, the undermining of the the judiciary, and the growth of regional conflicts in the Punjab and in Kashmir. As a Sikh, Patwant's anger is focussed on the hatred Mrs Gandhi stirred up in the Punjab - which resulted in the end in her own assassination and the barbaric anti-Sikh riots that followed. He curtly sums her up as 'an irresponsible politician whose basic shortcoming was an absence of permanent values.' He has much more respect for her father Jawarhlal Nehru - matched by a greater contempt for her two sons Rajiv (who also became Prime Minister) and Sanjay. But it is clear that with India now turning away from the socialist, pro-Soviet policies that marked most of the long period of rule by the Nehru family, we are in for a major reassessment of their legacy. Patwant is at his best in the first two thirds of this book. He weaves together incidents from his personal life with the history unfolding before him. The opportunities that open up to him personally have their parallels in the challenges facing a country newly independent. In the final chapters, his personal voice is drowned as indignation takes over. His conclusions are too gloomy. He was writing before the last state assembly elections when it had seemed that the Hindu BJP party would come to power and the country be torn by renewed conflict. The BJP did badly and for the moment is demoralised. At the same time, India is getting a much needed injection of fresh ideas as it opens up its economy. Patwant, like many Indian nationalists, has divided views about the growth of foreign influence. But without it, India would have got stuck in a rut - both economic and intellectual.</p>

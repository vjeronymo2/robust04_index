			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cross-borderbanking Sir, I read with interest articles on payments and settlement systems by Peter Norman and John Gapper (Economics Notebook, August 8; 'What to do when Chaps can't cope', August 9). Reading Chapter VIII of the BIS's recent annual report would show that increasing volumes and values in the international payment systems are coming from banks of all sizes, not just leading clearing banks in the various markets. One of the primary reasons Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander created IBOS (InterBank On-Line System), the cross-border payments and banking system, was to address the lack of direct account-to-account processing for all banks, not just clearers. Providing such efficient services greatly reduces any likelihood of systematic failure. Industry initiatives along the lines of IBOS are representative of the type of response the banking industry should advance and embrace, and mitigate the need for regulatory action. As virtually everything today is tradeable, delivery v payment is the backbone of non-cash settlement. This is well covered by the Group of 30 recommendations. Cash should be similarly treated. By being able constantly to check to ensure funds are available and accounted for at the time of trade, the financial world would be safer than at present.

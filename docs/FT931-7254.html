			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Smith loosens Labour's union ties: Opposition leader supports end to block vote in selection of candidates MR JOHN SMITH loosened Labour's historic links with the trade unions yesterday by backing a reduction and reshaping of their role and power within party. At a meeting of the party's ruling National Executive Committee, Mr Smith made it clear that he wants to end the unions' ability to vote in the selection of parliamentary candidates and to vote in the election of the leader and deputy leader. The move, if implemented, could mark a watershed for the trade unions which have dominated the Labour movement throughout this century. But Mr Smith was more cautious about the share of votes accounted for by trade unions at the party conference. He supported 'individualising' each union's block vote - splitting it among the union's delegates - but made it clear that cutting the total union vote below the 70 per cent level agreed for this year's conference, should depend on a rise in individual party membership above the current figure of 280,000. The aim is to give local parties an incentive to recruit, so that the unions' share of the conference vote would fall to 50 per cent. It would not, however, fall lower. In spite of the evident desire not to alienate those who want to retain traditional union links, there was thinly disguised anger from some trade unionists. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Union, emphasised that the proposals were still subject to consultation. Mr John Prescott and Ms Clare Short, leftwing members of the NEC, said that yesterday represented the beginning of consultations on the issue - not the end. The NEC will agree in July on recommendations to be put to Labour's annual conference in October. These will also cover the unions' role in elections to the NEC itself. Attempting to head off criticism, Mr Smith said the reforms he envisaged were, 'in no sense a divorce between the Labour party and the trade union movement. It is a modernising and strengthening of the links between the Labour party and the trade union movement and should be understood as that.' For the election of party leader and deputy leader, Mr Smith proposed 50 per cent of votes should be for MPs and MEPs and 50 per cent for constituency parties on a 'one member, one vote' basis. Despite the unhappiness voiced by some leading union figures, Mr Neil Kinnock, former Labour leader, believed that 'common sense dictates and the welfare of the party dictates' that the trade unions would back Mr Smith's proposals.

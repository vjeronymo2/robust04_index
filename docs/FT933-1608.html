			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Higher gilts investment hailed as recovery signal NET INVESTMENT by institutions in UK gilts jumped sharply to Pounds 5.6bn in the second quarter of this year from Pounds 3.3bn in the first quarter, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. Investment in overseas company securities dropped to below Pounds 2bn during the period compared with Pounds 3.6bn in the first quarter, further reflecting a shift to investment in the UK. Net investment in UK company securities rose to Pounds 6.1bn from Pounds 5.6bn. Mr Paul Walton, an analyst with James Capel, welcomed the figures as a long-term indication of recovery. He said there was plenty of money to fund gilts and rights issues in the UK. 'Liquidity is not an issue,' he said. Total net investment by institutions fell slightly to Pounds 11.8bn from the record Pounds 12.5bn in the first quarter. Net investment by long-term insurance funds fell by Pounds 300m between the first and second quarters, while unit trust investment declined by Pounds 300m. This was partly offset by a rise of Pounds 700m in net investment in insurance funds classified 'other than long term'. Total net investment in pension funds was Pounds 2.1bn in the second quarter of the year, almost unchanged on the first quarter. Investment trust companies' total net investment was Pounds 544m in the period, financed by net capital issues of Pounds 300m and an increase in bank borrowing of Pounds 278m. Net sales of unit trusts reached Pounds 2.3bn against Pounds 1.6bn in the first quarter. Mr Walton also said the shift into equities and bonds and away from the housing market was attractive because it showed the money was being used more productively. He stressed that the figures were significant because for the first time institutions were obliged to supply data, and they were also externally audited. 'In the past they were seen as a bit of a joke,' he said. But Mr Angus McIntosh, head of research at Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors, argued that the figures could not be relied on to produce an accurate picture of the commercial property market. He said the figures were 'suspect' because the 1991 and 1992 statistics on new investment by institutions had been revised upwards; the figures took no account of investment from overseas or owner-occupier purchasers; and the trend shown of net disinvestment in UK property in the second quarter by insurance companies contradicted other evidence.

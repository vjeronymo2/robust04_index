			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei advances as new cabinet takes up office SHARE prices firmed as the new cabinet of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa was appointed, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average rose 135.11 to 20,493.05 as a rise in the futures market prompted arbitrage related buying. It opened at the day's low of 20,339.83 and rose to a high of 20,553.06 during the morning session. Volume remained flat at 190m shares against 191m. Investment trusts supported prices, while foreign investors were also seen small-lot buying. Advances led declines by 552 to 378, with 214 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 4.42 to 1,659.01. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.07 to 1,262.89. Hopes grew of a discount rate cut to bolster the economy. Market participants interpreted comments by Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the new finance minister, denying the possibility of a government bond issue to cover a revenue shortage, as an indication that the new government will try to stimulate the economy through monetary measures. High-technology issues were higher on hopes that the new government will allocate public spending to telecommunication infrastructure projects and computers for education. Sharp, the most active issue of the day, rose Y10 to Y1,400 and Matsushita Electric Industrial gained Y30 to Y1,380. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y11,000 to Y927,000. Reports that Fuji Oil, a palm oil manufacturer, had discovered a substitute for natural oil, encouraged investors, pushing the issue up Y46 to Y1,040. Takasago International, an aromatic chemical maker which supplies flagrances for Japan Tobacco, the state owned tobacco company, rose on JT's listing early next year. However, it later fell on profit-taking, closing down Y15 to Y880. Higher property sales and hopes of lower interest rates supported real estate companies. Mitsui Fudosan rose Y20 to Y1,310 and Mitsubishi Estate gained Y10 to Y1,080. Nippon Kayaku, a chemical maker, rose Y17 to Y910. The company expects to raise its production of epoxy resin due to the explosion at Sumitomo Chemical's plant last month. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 56.96 to 22,352.06 in volume of 8.6m shares. Roundup Profit-taking was a feature in a number of Pacific Rim markets. Singapore and Bombay were closed for public holidays. NEW ZEALAND closed at its highest level since July 1990, powered by an 8 cent gain in Telecom to NZDollars 4.10. The NZSE-40 capital index rose 7.64 to 1,903.64, in turnover of NZDollars 40.1m, high for a Monday but about half last week's daily average. AUSTRALIA edged higher as gold bullion prices picked up and the All Ordinaries index rose 2.1 to 1,844.3 in turnover of ADollars 345.9m. News Corp was a star performer, rising 23 cents to a record Australian Dollars 8.88 in the wake of strong demand in New York on Friday. Foodland rose 20 cents to ADollars 8.80 after a day's high of ADollars 9 on news of a possible merger. Heavy fallers included the building and sugar products group, CSR, which tumbled 31 cents to ADollars 4.19 after sinking to ADollars 4.01. A US court awarded USDollars 2m against the company last week for distributing products containing asbestos. TAIWAN closed higher, but profit-taking as the weighted index edged above 4,100 pulled prices off their peak. The index ended 66.09 ahead at 4,092.73, after a peak of 4,109.10, as turnover climbed to TDollars 20.3bn. Buying was fuelled by news the Bank of Tawan cut its prime lending rate to 7.875 percent. HONG KONG was unable to sustain strong early gains which took the Hang Seng index 101 points higher and profit-taking left the index 14.55 lower at 7,382.22 as turnover shrank to HKDollars 4.41bn. MANILA was sharply lower at the start of an anticipated consolidation and the composite index dropped 28.18 to 1,715.79. PLDT dropped 10 pesos to 1,085 pesos but the newly-listed JG Summit Holdings closed at 6 pesos after an opening high of 6.50 pesos which compared with its offer price of 4.40 pesos. SEOUL was lower for the third consecutive session in lethargic trade which saw the composite shed 7.29 at 709.59. BANGKOK gave way to what was seen as overdue profit-taking after the rally of the previous eight sessions and the SET index dipped 6.07 to 952.77 in heavy turnover of Bt9.89bn.</p>

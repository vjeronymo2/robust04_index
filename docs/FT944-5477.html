			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: UniChem Pounds 19m expansion Shares in UniChem rose yesterday as the pharmaceuticals retailer and wholesaler bought another 43 chemists' shops. The deal takes its chain of pharmacies to 351 - well ahead of AAH, its main competitor - and consolidates its position as the third biggest in the UK, behind Boots and Lloyds Chemists. The shares closed at 258p, up 11p. UniChem is acquiring Molescroft Holdings and Investment, a Humberside group that also has, in addition to the Selles shops, a small wholesale operation and a business providing occupational health and first aid supplies. The maximum cost will be Pounds 19.24m, comprising Pounds 16m plus a sum in respect of net assets. It will be made up through the issue of 663,852 ordinary shares, valued at 256.2p, and Pounds 12.7m of loan notes. The balance will be paid in cash. Mr Jeff Harris, chief executive, said Molescroft was one of the few independent chains of chemists still available for acquisition. In September, UniChem announced a Pounds 58.4m rights issue to underpin its expansion. The group planned to use the funds to wipe out short-term borrowings, acquire retail outlets and move into other health-related businesses. Molescroft made pre-tax profits of Pounds 738,000 on sales of Pounds 23.7m in the year to October 1993 - the last available accounts. It is expected to contribute at least Pounds 2.6m of profits in its first year. Selles will join UniChem's Moss chain. However, the Selles name is well known in Humberside and will be retained for the foreseeable future. Selles Medical, with sales of Pounds 2m, will be merged in UniChem's existing occupational health business. The Molescroft wholesale operation, which has external sales of Pounds 1m, will be merged in UniChem's national operation.</p>

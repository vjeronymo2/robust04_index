			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Policy doubts hit value of rouble The rouble lost a further 2.6 per cent against the dollar yesterday after tumbling 22 per cent last week and a central bank official renewed speculation that Moscow could return to a system of fixed exchange rates, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. The ailing Russian currency, suffering from a chronically thin foreign exchange market, high inflation and expectations of a loosening of monetary policy, fell to Rbs210.5 to the dollar from last week's low of Rbs205. Mr Alexander Hrandruyev, a deputy chairman of the Russian central bank, was quoted as saying the bank might set the rate at an average for the previous month's trading.</p>

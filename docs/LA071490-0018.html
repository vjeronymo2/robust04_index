			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SETTING HIM STRAIGHT ON HISTORY OF COLTS  </P> <P> Jim Murray's account of the genealogy of the Indianapolis Colts is incorrect.  </P> <P> The Colts were descended from the AAFC New York Yankees, not the NFL Boston  Yanks (1944-48), which became the New York Bulldogs for the 1949 season. Both  the AAFC Yankees and the NFL Yanks/Bulldogs existed simultaneously. After the  1949 season, the Bulldogs were disbanded and the New York Yankees, Cleveland  Browns, San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Colts were absorbed into the NFL,  with the Colts dropping out after one year and the Yankees migrating to Dallas  and then Baltimore.  </P> <P> DAVID M.

			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY BESET BY SNOW AND ICE  </P> <P> Rain, snow and ice combined to create numerous traffic problems and accidents  this morning but no serious injuries in northern Los Angeles County, the  California Highway Patrol said.  </P> <P> Overnight snow and ice slowed traffic on the Golden State Freeway near Gorman  during the morning commute, and at least 12 accidents occurred between 7 and 9  a.m., said CHP Lt. Bob Caldwell.  </P> <P> "We've had a pretty good snow -- a couple inches," said Caldwell, who was  heading Operation Snowflake, in which CHP cruisers escort motorists on the  freeway at safe speeds. "We haven't had any serious accidents. Mostly spin-outs  and people off to the side."  </P> <P> Caldwell said nine California Department of Transportation trucks were plowing  the snow and dropping sand on a 15-mile stretch of the freeway. He said four  lanes remained open to traffic but the going was slow.  </P> <P> Earlier in the morning, rain caused accidents that forced the closure of the  truck lanes of the Golden State and Foothill freeways near Sylmar for about  four hours.  </P> <P> A northbound truck pulling a double set of trailers jackknifed in the rain and  the rear trailer overturned about midnight near the interchange of the two  freeways, CHP spokesman Ralph Elvira said. Two other big-rig trucks skidded off  the freeway nearby a short time later.  </P> <P> The northbound and westbound truck lanes were closed in the area for about four  hours while the trucks were cleared -- an operation slowed because the  overturned trailer was loaded with household chemicals that had to be unloaded  before the trailer was righted.  </P></p>

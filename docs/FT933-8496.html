			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Two men barred in Fimbra probe FIMBRA, the self-regulating organisation for financial intermediaries, announced yesterday that it had suspended the registration of Mr Paul Hogarth and Mr David Warnock of Bankhall Investment Management of Altrincham, Cheshire. It said it had issued a Rule Seven direction against the two men ordering them to cease conducting investment business 'while investigations continue into the transfer abroad of investment funds in circumstances which make it difficult to value those funds'. Bankhall Investment gained Fimbra membership in 1988 and is classed as Category Three. That means it can arrange transactions through a dealer but not act as a principal or handle clients' money.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Travel (The Caribbean): Colour-coded cruising - Blue is the colour. Bahamas is the name The Bahamas, apparently, are favourites with spacemen and satellite photographers. They are thousands of emerald green islands, cays and isolated rocks ribboned with bright white sand, scattered over hundreds of square miles to the east of Florida, just across the Gulf Stream. But it is the sea which makes the Bahamas so beautiful from above. Framed in the rich royal blue of the deep ocean, the islands stand on sandy-bottomed banks, in clear and shallow water, which shines with a vibrant turquoise glow. There are about 15 main groups of islands, radiating around the central island New Providence, the site of the capital Nassau, and linked to it by mail boats and regular flights. The islands are all similar in appearance - they are low-lying with pines that roar in the wind - but each group has a distinctive feel. The Abacos are an open crab-claw of islands in the north of the Bahamas. It was less than an hour after touchdown at Marsh Harbour that I was sitting on a boardwalk looking out on to a bight, taking in the last of the evening light. Life has always centred on the sea in these barren islands (as the name Marsh Harbour hints). The old docks are still there, but now the bay is steadily encrusting with brightly painted restaurants and bars which have the familiar, cheery feel of Florida. Just a short hop from the US in a yacht, the Abacos are very popular as a sailing destination. About half the marinas in the Bahamas are situated there. Many of the island groups have ribbons of cays standing a couple of miles offshore. They enclose calm stretches of water ideal for sailing and so I took a trip aboard a yacht, pausing at an isolated beach of brilliant white coral sand and merciless sunshine. The Bahamian sea is impressive. With currents on three sides of the archipelago, its waters are constantly cleansed and they are strikingly clean. From gin-clear shallows they recede through a colour chart of blues to a turquoise that Magritte might have used. If school ever taught me why the sea is blue, I could not remember the answer; certainly no one ever explained how it could be that blue. The question began to tickle the brainstem and so I took to asking people. We put in to Hope Town, a perfect, pretty waterfront town. Pastel houses were laid out beneath a proverbial pink candy lighthouse; it is as though it was always destined to be a holiday town. The setting, gingerbread houses standing behind white picket fences and festooned with bougainvillaea, brings on a delicious holiday buzz. Sitting on a waterfront deck with the waves lapping beneath me and tucking into a lobster and lime butter I felt it all teetering on the brink of cliche, but it was a good three hours before sunset. As for the colour of the sea, my question did the rounds of the restaurant staff: the waitress came back saying it was the reflection of the sky. Looking around, I decided that somehow that might not be the complete story. Nassau is the nerve centre of the Bahamas and if you travel between the out-islands (or Family islands as they are known) you are quite likely to put in there. Nassau, Cable Beach and Paradise Island have been the heartland of Bahamian tourism for 30 years, doing a brisk trade as the all-American rest-cure in the sun; beaches, cabarets, casinos and shops, all just a short flight off the coast of Florida. In a good year, more than 10 times as many tourists pass through here as there are Bahamians altogether. But travellers are beginning to venture beyond Nassau. I picture them as migrating lobsters, which head off in groups of 50 and 60, nose to tail, along the sea-floor. The Family islands are beginning to develop. And so I flew off to the Exumas, to the south-east of the capital. These islands announce themselves with the silver glint of a line of breakers and then you run along them, a 100-mile string of sandbars and spits of land set in a luxurious blue sea. Beneath the surface the currents have left their mark, with ripples and swirls in the sand and deep cuts between the islands. Few of the Exuma Cays are inhabited. And if they are, civilisation is nothing more than a hotel and a marina. At the foot of the chain we touched down at Great Exuma, the largest island and site of the main settlement, George Town. The town stands on a magnificent harbour, protected from the Atlantic swells by the usual line of cays a couple of miles offshore. The Tropic of Cancer cuts through the bay. The Exumas have a rawer, stronger West Indian quality than the more developed islands to the north, and they are largely untouched as yet by the pastel tourist revolution of waterfront bars. They are beginning to change, but they offer a hint of the older Bahamas, still to be found further south, on Rum Cay, Crooked Island-Acklins and the Inaguas). Local rumshops are as much the source of entertainment as the waterfront bars here. An old commemorative photograph, yellowed even under the lamination, showed George VI and the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret in pinafore dresses. It seems that patterns of human life in the Exumas are almost as timeless as those of the waves. There are places in the Bahamas where the sandy-bottomed flats stretch for miles offshore - you can saunter off the beach, walking for miles in calf to thigh-deep water. And it is for shallow flats like these that the Exumas are famed because they are home to bonefish, which are known to be fearsome fight-ers. Flushed fishermen were telling ecstatic tales in the bar at the Peace and Plenty Inn when I arrived. We got on to the colour of the sea and it was decided that its intensity comes from the clear water and the white sand on the sea floor. I am not a fisherman, so instead the next day I took a Boston Whaler and pottered around the harbour, still continually struck by the colour of the water, nosing into isolated coves and eventually washing up on Stocking Island, a classic, almost-desert-island, with just a couple of houses and a beach bar. A large local lady was cooking up conch fritters. We chatted about Exuma's curious barrage balloon, the 'Fat Albert', which flies high above George Town. It is used to watch the traffic in the local waters. Things have tightened up considerably in recent years as the South American influence has come into play, but living so conveniently close to the US, the seafaring Bahamian folk have traditionally been big smugglers. Bimini used to be a favourite transhipment point. The two islands lie about 50 miles from downtown Miami, just a short ride across the Gulf Stream in a power boat. 'Now, that a story,' the lady from Stocking island had said. Whole suitcases of cocaine and Dollars 1,000 bills used to change hands there. But American visitors have been coming to Bimini since the 1930s for a different reason. The island is the traditional haunt of deep-sea fishermen, who have been trawling the depths of the Gulf Stream since the invention of the outboard motor. Hemingway and his strong-arm cronies were here, fishing for marlin by day and fighting in the bars at night. I stopped over on the way out to Miami. Bimini is an odd mix of the raw West Indies with its ragged, tin- roofed houses, and the steady tourist gentrification. Top-heavy cruisers stand in glinting lines in the marina. Hemingway's brawls do not erupt much any more, and the most riotous behaviour is usually the flailing of arms and legs on the dance floor. The man himself has museum status nowadays; at the Compleat Angler Hotel you will see his writings and pictures of him standing by 1,000lb monsters. He would have been more at home with the smugglers than the tourists I guess, so I wondered what he would have thought of it all. I suppose I have missed the spaceman's promotion scheme by now, so I am unlikely to see the Bahamas from the Shuttle, but you certainly get a fine view of the Bahamas and all their glory from the window of a DASH 8. As for why the sea is blue, that's one for the encyclopedia when I get home. The Bahamas Tourist Office can be contacted on tel 071-629 5238 and Bahamasair on 071-437 8766.

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Observer: Potty talk It is rare indeed for an Australian teapot to be the centre of a diplomatic incident. However, Australia's ex-prime minister Bob Hawke has managed to elevate the case of his disappearing antique tea-pot into something of a cause celebre. Indeed, future chroniclers of late 20th century Australian politics may well date the breakdown in friendly relations between Bob Hawke and Australia's current prime minister, Paul Keating, to the tea-time dispute in Bob Hawke's sitting room one weekend in the early 1980s. The spat is culled from Hawke's just published memoirs. Apparently, Keating, well known for his love of antique clocks and cutlery, had left a favourite and carefully wrapped antique tea set with Hawke to look after for a weekend while he was out of town. Hawke thought the tea set was a gift and used it to serve Keating tea when he returned to collect it. 'Paul, close to apoplexy, grabbed the pieces, went to the kitchen, wrapped them up, took them home and repeated the loving process of polishing and wrapping,' is Hawke's version of what happened next. After that, it seems, their relationship was all downhill. Keating has tried to maintain a statesmanlike attitude to his predecessor's revelations published yesterday. However, he could not avoid taking a side swipe when launching a television university learning programme. 'This, of course, is not the only launch today, but I'll bet pounds to peanuts that this one has a longer-term influence on Australia than the other one.' As for Hawke, he insists his book is a balanced history, but has backed down from an earlier undertaking to take a lie detector test to defend it.</p>

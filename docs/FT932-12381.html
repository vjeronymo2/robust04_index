			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI market Official turnover in ICI shares was cut by the opening of a new unofficial market offering prices for the two parts of the company due to be split shortly. US brokerage Salomon Brothers was yesterday offering a price for Zeneca, the bioscience side of ICI, of around 705p. For the new slimmed down ICI the firm was quoting 525p in early trading, rising to 535p by the close. The 'grey' market is expected to run until May 28. Demerged Zeneca is set to see its shares begin trading on June 1 following a Pounds 1.3bn rights offer. No other securities houses were said to be quoting prices yesterday, although some conceded that there had been considerable institutional interest, particularly from the US. The joint valuation of 1240p is in line with many forecasts, but some analysts said the split undervalued the chemicals side and overvalued Zeneca. ICI shed 3 to 1234p on turnover of 1.5m.</p>

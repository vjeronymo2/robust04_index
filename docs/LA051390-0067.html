			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESPONSE TO 'ALLIED WAR CRIMES'  </P> <P> I was taken prisoner in the first days of April 1945 near Hamen in Westphalia  by the 1st U.S. Army. I was then just out of medical school, not yet an officer  but an MD.  </P> <P> We German prisoners were transported in open trucks and closed cattle cars on  trains into France. In the train we did not get water or food for over 48 hours  and the doors were never unlocked.  </P> <P> I ended up in Camp Attichy near Attiguy in N.E. France where I remained until  approximately August, 1945.  </P> <P> This camp was a starvation camp. I figured out that we received 350 to 500  calories per day. We had one slowly running water faucet for approximately  3,000 men. This was in an open meadow and no facilities.  </P> <P> My weakness soon was such that any slight physical activity caused fainting and  getting up off the ground took a long time and had to be accomplished in  stages.  </P> <P> We never saw the Red Cross. The only organization that came to the camp and  gave us some musical instruments was the YMCA.  </P> <P> I did not get any mail for over one year. My parents did not know whether I was  dead or alive for almost 15 months, although I had written every occasion we  were permitted to send "Red Cross post cards" (pre-printed with blanks to be  filled in).  </P> <P> In August I was transferred to the 1811th labor supervision company where I  remained until my discharge in August, 1946. There, the prisoners and I (as the  camp doctor and able to speak German, French and English) were treated very  well and had more than enough food.  </P> <P> James Baque is absolutely correct in his description of the camps. We had many  deaths due to causes exacerbated by malnutrition.  </P> <P> WALTER SCHILLING, MD, La Quinta  </P></p>

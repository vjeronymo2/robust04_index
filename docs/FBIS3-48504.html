The Ministry of Finance [MOF] said the government will not  check the "quality of foreign technology and contents of  contracts between importers and exporters of foreign technology"  when it reviews reports for introducing foreign technology in  Korea.    The government has sometimes blocked the influx of foreign  technologies because of expensive royalties on foreign  technology or their obsolescence.    It will also shorten the processing period for accepting  foreign technology inducement reports to 10 days, compared with  the current 30 days.    The Bank of Korea will no longer be an exclusive window for  accepting reports from foreign investors in local industries and  such banks as the Korea Development Bank and Industrial Bank of  Korea will deal in foreign direct investment reporting services  from March 1.    The MOF said other foreign exchange banks will be authorized  to accept reports from foreigners on their investment plans here  from July 1.    The diversification of banks accepting foreign direct  investment reports is designed to help banks compete against  each other to attract foreign investors. So far, the BOK has  monopolized the business as the government wanted to "control"  who invests in domestic industries.    Thus from July 1, local banks will be able to accept reports  from foreign investors when their equity stakes are less than 50  percent or when they invest less than 3 million dollars in joint  ventures in which their stakes exceed more than 50 percent.    The MOF said it will revise the enforcement decrees on the  Foreign Capital Inducement Act (FCIA) next week for  implementation from March 1.    The MOF said the revision of the FCIA enforcement decrees is  to simplify foreign investment procedures, enhance transparency,  ease rules and provide administrative services for foreign  investors in Korea.    Under the new FCIA enforcement decrees, it will take only  five days for foreign investors to get government approval for  investing in Korean industries, compared with the current 30  days. Even when the MOF needs consultations with other  government ministries for reviewing the applications, it will  not take more than 15 days for international investors to get  approval from Korea.    For projects that do not need government approval,  foreigners  can immediately initiate business in Korea as soon as they make  a notification to Korea. Currently, it takes 20-30 days for  foreign investors to make a report on their investment plans to  the government.    The government will reduce its intervention in business  diversification activities of foreign enterprises and joint  venture firms following their investment in local industries, it  said.    For example, foreign enterprises and joint venture firms  will  diversify into other projects, and easily sell and buy stocks to  invest in or divest themselves from their Korean operations  after they invested in local industries, the MOF said.    Foreigners which hold less than 10 percent equities stakes  in  local companies will not be subject to various restrictions.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / CBI backs pensions for all at 65 THE Confederation of British Industry, the employers group, yesterday urged the government to stop dithering and raise women's retirement age to 65. It said: 'The present indecision is causing real concern in the business community. It is time they made up their minds. A decision needs to be announced soon with a lengthy phasing-in so that the position of women currently planning to retire at 60 is fully protected.' A survey by William M Mercer, actuarial consultant, for the CBI concluded that lowering men's retirement ages to match those of women would increase existing occupational pension liabilities by Pounds 21bn. It would also add Pounds 2bn a year to the cost of offering the existing level of occupational pension benefit. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said: 'Faced with such costs, more firms would have to consider cutting the pensions offered or moving away from pensions linked to final salaries.' Many European countries have equal retirement ages for men and women, but while British women are generally eligible to receive pensions from age 60, most men must wait until 65. A government white paper on pensions policy has already been delayed and it not likely to be published until the autumn. The National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, has urged the government to make a speedy decision. Mr Davies said: 'The present indecision is causing real concern in the business community. A decision needs to be announced soon with a lengthy phasing-in (period).' He argued that if the pensionable age were reduced, the government would be stepping 'out of line with international trends.' Mr Davies said: 'The Germans plan to move to an equal pension age of 65 by 2012 and the Italians by 2016, while the Americans are moving by stages to equalisation at 67 by 2027. 'The UK government should similarly make it clear its intention to move over a period of years to an equalised state pension age of 65.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Sri Lankan President, Mr. D.B. Wijetunga, has  dissolved the country's parliament and called for general  elections on the 16th of August -- six months ahead of schedule.  A presidential proclamation in Colombo said the parliament  stands dissolved from midnight tonight and the election process  will be set in motion from next week. The presidential election  will follow some time in October-November. Our Colombo  correspondent reports that the present parliament elected in  1989 was scheduled to continue till February next year. The  main opposition, Sri Lanka Freedom Party, has described the  president's decision to advance parliamentary elections as  political hari-kari, but said it was fully prepared to face the  electorate.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The solution to a  Japan-U.S. dispute over cellular phone trade cannot be applied  to other trade issues, a senior Japanese trade ministry official  said Wednesday.    The approach taken by Japan's Posts and Telecommunications  Ministry in settling the dispute involving Motorola Inc. and  Nippon Idou Tshushin Corp. (IDO) is of a different nature from  autos and other trade issues covered under the "framework"  talks, said Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy international trade and  industry minister for international affairs.    At a luncheon sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents Club  of  Japan, Okamatsu was responding to remarks by U.S. Ambassador to  Japan Walter Mondale in which he welcomed last Saturday's phone  trade accord as "a model" for getting the stalled framework  talks rolling again.    Citing part of the accord that says Tokyo will take "all  available measures to ensure compliance with the commitments"  shown by IDO, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the  Japanese Government "guaranteed the fulfillment of the  agreement."    Telecommunications trade is a regulated sector, requiring a  government license or permission to start business while autos  and auto components are "completely free trade areas," Okamatsu  said.    This remark indicates Japan's renewed opposition to setting  "numerical targets" guaranteed by the government by clarifying  it has no control over private businesses such as the auto  industry.    Okamatsu said a market-opening package to be announced at  the  end of this month will contain macroeconomic measures.    But he withheld comment on details of the measures,  including  whether or not the politically sensitive issue of tax cuts will  be included.    A specific framework of macroeconomic measures, which is  being worked out at the moment, will not be announced at the end  of March but will be unveiled around the time of the Naples  summit of the seven leading industrialized countries in July,  Okamatsu said, echoing an earlier remark made by Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.    Okamatsu denied rumors that a discrepancy of views exists  over Japan's macroeconomic policy among the trade, finance and  foreign ministries.    The Foreign Ministry is said to be receptive toward setting  objective criteria on the macroeconomic front, taking into  account Japan's current-account surplus as against its gross  domestic product, while the Finance Ministry is opposed to the  idea. "We have no discrepancy over the issue at  vice-ministerial levels," Okamatsu said.    On voluntary plans now being formulated by Japanese  automakers to increase imports of U.S.-made auto parts and  automobiles, Okamatsu said such plans will not be included in  the market-opening package.    "Auto trade is an activity of the private sector," Okamatsu  said. "MITI is not in a position to force automakers to do this  or that."    Okamatsu said MITI has yet to decide if Japan will extend  voluntary restraints on auto exports to the United States for  fiscal 1994 starting in April.    He said MITI will "carefully watch the situation" and make a  decision on the issue in line with a global trade accord under  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that calls for the  repeal of such practices within four years.</p>

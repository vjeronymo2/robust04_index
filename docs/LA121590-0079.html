			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT LASER BIN: PIONEER HAS AMBITIONS FOR MADONNA CONCERT DISC  </P> <P> Can Madonna sell laser-disc players as well as she sells herself?  </P> <P> Pioneer Artists, the nation's leading distributor of music-related laser discs,  hopes so.  </P> <P> In a move virtually unprecedented in the video industry, Pioneer has just  released Madonna's "Blond Ambition World Tour Live" exclusively on laser disc.  </P> <P> Normally, video packages of this nature are released on videocassette two to  six weeks before they are released on laser disc. In this case, however, "Blond  Ambition" won't be released on videocassette for at least a year.  </P> <P> Steven Galloway, president of Pioneer Artists, said he hopes the fact that an  artist of Madonna's stature would release a video only on laser disc will send  a signal to millions of potential laser customers that the new format has  finally come of age.  </P> <P> Because laser discs offer substantially better picture and sound quality than  videocassettes, there have been predictions for years that laser discs will  eventually capture a large share of the prerecorded video market, much the way  that its sister format the compact disc has become a major force in the album  market. But it hasn't happened yet.  </P> <P> Though the price of laser players has fallen dramatically in recent years (now  less than $400 in some combination models that play CDs and lasers), there are  still fewer than 500,000 players in homes around the country -- a statistic  that has left laser manufacturers understandably frustrated.  </P> <P> One reason for the public's slowness to move into laser-disc players is that,  unlike videocassette machines, you cannot yet make your own laser recordings  with home laser equipment. Still, it is so much more fun to watch a movie or  music program, such as "Blond Ambition," on laser disc that almost everyone  exposed to the format becomes a salesperson for it.  </P> <P> In most cases, these converts hold on to their VCRs to record programs off  television the same way pop fans keep their tape decks for specialized uses  even after they've begun buying most of their new albums on compact discs.  </P> <P> Galloway said that the laser exclusive with Madonna grew out of an agreement  last spring for Pioneer, the electronics hardware and software giant, to  sponsor her tour.  </P> <P> "I contacted her manager, Freddy DeMann, long before the tour started in hopes  of getting the laser-disc rights to any video that was going to be shot in  association with the tour," Galloway said. DeMann was meeting with potential  corporate sponsors at the time, Galloway said, and he asked if Pioneer would be  interested in sponsoring the tour. The company apparently jumped at the  opportunity.  </P> <P> "Madonna is the ideal artist to reach the new demographics that we are hoping  to attract with the new, low-priced combination CD and laser players . . . the  young, hip 18-35 audience," Galloway said.  </P> <P> "Until these low-priced players arrived, laser discs were considered something  just for the high-end market . . . a rich man's toy. But that has changed and  Madonna seemed the ideal artist to drive that point home."  </P> <P> And what about the "Blond Ambition" package itself?  </P> <P> The video is based on the same concert in Nice that HBO broadcast live last  summer, but the new, edited laser version offers much more of the vitality and  charm of the show itself than the HBO special.  </P> <P> At just $29.95 for a two-hour concert program, the laser disc is also a much  better buy than the five-minute "Justify My Love," the much-ado-about-nothing  video single that sells for $9.98.  </P> <P> It's still hard to believe that a program as distinguished as "Nightline" would  devote an entire half-hour to showing the video and asking Madonna the same  question 22 different ways: "Haven't you finally gone too far?"  </P> <P> There's nothing in "Blond Ambition" that is likely to earn the singer a return  appearance on "Nightline" -- though it is interesting to see how the mock  masturbation sequence during "Like a Virgin" appears to have been a model for  the bedroom fantasies outlined in "Justify My Love."  </P> <P> What "Blond Ambition" does, however, is show that Madonna isn't just a  masterful pop strategist. She's also someone with considerable imagination and  talent. She's not a great singer or writer, but she infuses her music and her  concerts with a sense of personality, spirit and, yes, ideas.  </P> <P> A few of the sequences in "Blond Ambition" are silly and self-conscious, but  most are witty and engaging, making it an especially winning package.  </P></p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Hurd for Brussels streamlining Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, has thrown his weight behind calls for a streamlined European Commission and a 'flexible' European Union, while rejecting the idea of a 'hard core' of the most committed member states. In an interview with Handelsblatt, the German business newspaper, he welcomed a fundamental debate on the future shape of the EU, which is supposed to culminate in a new constitutional conference in 1996, and insisted that Britain wanted more than a 'free trade zone' in Europe. 'I believe very strongly in a common foreign and security policy,' he said, which should be expanded step by step to include the countries of central and eastern Europe. But flexibility meant that 'not everyone will do everything at the same time, or in the same way'.</p>

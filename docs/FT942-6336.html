			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Observer: Clive's postmortem Here's a challenging subject for a lecture - Information, technology and management 1944-2044: did we go wrong? Big picture stuff. But the City University, which is hosting the event on June 15 as part of its centenary celebrations, has found just the man for the job. A round of applause please for Professor Clive Holtham, young accountant of the year 1974, inventor of the Business Flight Simulator, active innovator in the use of information technology for improved planning, control and customer service etc . . . The promotional handout notes that he moved to the City Business school in 1988 after six years as a director of finance and information technology. Surely, he's not the same Clive Holtham who was director of finance for the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham when it got itself into such a pickle in the sterling interest rate swap market in the late 1980s?</p>

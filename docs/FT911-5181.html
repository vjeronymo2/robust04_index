			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Arts: Today's Television BBC1's drama series about a lawyer whose partner has absconded with the firm's cash, Kinsey, is proving quite a superior bit of entertainment. Kinsey's smirking competitor, who was appointed as minder by the Law Society, has been replaced by pretty Miss Mabbott. Kinsey was awfully shirty with her last week so he must be about to fall for her (9.30). The word 'investigative' is used loosely to describe too many sorts of journalism, including the kind practised in Taking Liberties (9.50 BBC2). Exculpatory journalism might be a better description: the championing of people who have fallen foul of the law or been wrongly judged guilty. Today's episode considers difficulties in suing for medical damages. Channel 4's 'Banned' season includes a look at current Soviet comedy in From Russia With Laughter (10.00) and then Monty Python's Life of Brian, a film which should not be watched by Christians whose faith is so weak that they cannot bear jokes about their religion.</p>

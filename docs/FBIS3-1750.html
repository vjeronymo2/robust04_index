			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kunming, February 27 (XINHUA) -- Overall economic  development of Southwest China's Yunnan Province has entered a  new stage thanks to the reform and opening drive implemented  more than a decade ago, according to He Zhiqiang, governor of  the province.    Its GNP [as received] reached 64.9 billion yuan last year,  tripling that of 1978, with a growth rate higher than the  country's average.    Yunnan's total revenue also topped 20 billion yuan in 1993  and the province was finally relieved from the state's long-term  financial subsidies.    Rich natural resources and a 4,000-kilometer border have  long  put Yunnan at a very advantageous position to develop its  economy. But substantial progress was not gained until the  tidal wave of market economic reforms swept over this  southwestern frontier of the country.    Local people, especially the large population of minority  nationalities, who used to cling to quiet and unchallenging  lives, have gradually adapted to new ideas and abandoned such  conservative ones as the rejection of and disgust at trade  activities.    Areas in southern Yunnan, bordering Burma, Laos and Vietnam,  and mainly inhabited by minority nationalities, have become the  vanguard for the opening-up of all of Southwest China.    Scattered across this area are eight state-level trading  ports and 11 provincial trading ports, linked with China's  inland commercial centers and foreign countries by 80-plus roads  and highways. The total volume of border trade grew to 2.8  billion yuan last year.    Last year's trade volume in imports and exports saw an  increase of 29 percent over the previous year, markedly higher  than the country's average.    Newly approved foreign-invested enterprises number 509,  almost doubling the total established during the last 15 years.    The amazing success of Yunnan's tobacco industry on the  domestic market has greatly bolstered yunnan's confidence and  determination to achieve more economic gains.    The province has also taken pioneering steps in the reform  of  the construction system. By calling for bids on the huge lubuge  hydropower station project, it managed to import advanced  technology, management experience and construction skills,  enabling the project to be completed in the shortest possible  time while ensuring high quality.    The province jointly funded the construction of Manwan  hydropower station with the former Ministry of Water Resources  and Power Industry instead of the traditional practice of  totally depending on state allocation of funds for large power  station construction.    During recent years, the provincial government has  altogether  earmarked 30 billion yuan for infrastructural construction.  Along with the improvement of its investment environment,  Yunnan is striving to be the country's major electricity  generation and tourism province.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salih Brkic from Tuzla] </F>   [Text] Dramatic appeals have been sent from Tuzla to Split  and other seats of the UNHCR organization, to improve, finally,  the quality of aid for people and refugees accomodated in Tuzla.  The UNHCR working meeting is taking place in Split. The  letters sent by Izet Hadzic, Tuzla District governor, Prof. Dr.  (Sean) Avdic, government official in charge of aid to the people  of northeastern Bosnia, and Tuzla Mayor Selim Beslagic,  specifically point to the possibility of a tragedy befalling the  population in the Tuzla District. The top officials of the  Tuzla District and Commune are asking the UNHCR whether 632,000  people, including 236,000 refugees and approximately the same  number of social cases, can survive January with the 1,345  tonnes of food that is to be brought to the large free territory  of Tuzla District in the form of humanitarian aid.    Can one survive January with 3.26 kg of food including 2.5  kg  of flour? And there is only one in three chances of that  happening, people from Tuzla say.    The UNHCR has recorded several cases of starvation in Tuzla  District, as well as dozens of suicides as a consequence of  mental derangement, exhaustion, poverty, and hunger.    All this has prompted representatives of the 14 communes of  the region of northeastern Bosnia to decide jointly to refuse  the plan offered by the UNHCR, and to propose to the war  presidencies of their respective communes that humanitarian aid  be refused as of 18 January if the UNHCR fails to consider the  possibility of increasing humanitarian aid to Tuzla District.    At the same time, the peaceful protests, thus far, of  refugees in front of the UNHCR (?agency) are more noticeable.  According to district and communal authorities, the situation  is being kept under control despite all the ordeals to which the  population is exposed.    In his letter, Tuzla Mayor Selim Beslagic also says that  convoys are not arriving in Tuzla District this month; soup  kitchens and refugee hostels have food for only five more days,  hospitals and orphanages for only two more days.    All of this signifies yet more political pressure on the  Bosnian delegation on the eve the continuation of Geneva talks;  we therefore demand that a decision on unrestrained movement of  humanitarian convoys toward Tuzla be made, along with the  establishment of UN entities that would guarantee the security  of the convoys, state the Tuzla authorities.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Austerity package helps Brussels to record high A number of themes attracted attention yesterday in the absence of Frankfurt, which was closed for a holiday, writes Our Markets Staff. BRUSSELS finished at a record high following a cut in two leading interest rates and the announcement by the government of its new austerity measures. The Bel-20 index added 21.84 to 1,397.76, but was off an intraday high of 1,406.42. Turnover was some BFr4bn. The government's plans included measures to control social spending, slow increases in wages and control unemployment. Among the day's performers, Petrofina rose BFr130 or 1.3 per cent to BFr9,880 and Solvay BFr150 or 1 per cent to BFr14,525. AMSTERDAM fell back towards the close, with the CBS Tendency index closing down 0.6 at 137.0, after a day's high of 138.8. KLM was again among the most actives, slipping Fl 1.70 to Fl 38.60 on continued uncertainty about the Alcazar talks, and reports of further rumours concerning the choice of a US partner by the four European airlines involved. Nedlloyd, the shipping group, hit a new year's high during the session on unconfirmed reports that Far Eastern container tariffs were to be increased. The shares finally settled up Fl 1.40 at Fl 51.30. Polygram also hit a new intraday high for the year, Fl 77.10, as more buyers came into the market, partly as a result of the developing interest multimedia. The shares finally closed up Fl 1.20 at Fl 76.30. Elsewhere, Nutricia, the food group, saw its price tumble 7 per cent after it said that it was recalling one of its products. The shares closed down Fl 11.00 at Fl 136.80. PARIS was lifted by hopes of an interest rate cut, and by a stronger bond market. The CAC-40 index put on 32.14 or 1.5 per cent to 2,147.99. More turnover figures were released to whet the appetites of investors, while Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez added FFr12 to FFr538, helped by news that it had won a FFr400m US contract. Three new additions made their entry to the index yesterday, BNP, CLF and Promodes, showing respective losses of FFr4.80 to FFr294.20, FFr6 to FFr479 and FFr31 to FFr1,169. These companies replace Cap Gemini, Chargeurs and Club Med, and thereby increase the market's total capitalisation by some 5 per cent. MADRID was lifted by Wall Street and interest rate hopes, but its sheer buoyancy brought profit-taking and the general index closed off its best at 306.93, up 4.00, or 1.3 per cent. Turnover rose from Pta29.4bn to Pta43.2bn. The best gains came in electrical utilities, where Endesa gained Pta170 to Pta6,530 and Iberdrola, the most active stock of the day, rose Pta18 to Pta879. In banks, Argentaria closed Pta150 lower at Pta6,260 after setting the price for its second share offer overnight at Pta6,050 per share. MILAN rallied late to finish higher on the first day of the new account, and the Comit index adding 3.23 at 537.36. Banks were firm, helped by a short selling ban on stock in Credito Italiano ahead of the announcement of the privatisation price on December 4. Credito added L103 to L2,460, for a cumulative two-day rise of 9.2 per cent, while BCI was L227 ahead at L4,378. Telecoms picked up after Tuesday's pressure. Sip added L111 to L3,121 and Stet was L73 higher at L3,644. Sme, the retailer rose L116 to L3,755, after a day's high of L3,990, on speculation about an offer for divisions which have not yet been privatised. Mediobanca, trading ex-dividend and launching its rights issue, rose L153 to L11,519. Ifil, also launching its capital increase, rose L21 to L4,555. ZURICH was steady in moderate volume, awaiting the outcome of last night's Nafta vote. The SMI index eased 1.2 to 2,711.1. UBS bearers, up SFr11 at SFr1,298, were helped by the bank's optimistic statement on the outlook for this year and 1994. A SFr17 rise to SFr1,409 in Zurich Insurance registered shares was attributed to a new option issue and expiry of an old one. Foreign demand for cyclicals took BBC Brown Boveri up SFr11 to a year's high of SFr1,029. Alusuisse registered shares rose SFr9 at SFr523. STOCKHOLM's advance was helped by a rally in Electrolux, the B shares gaining SKr18 at SKr305 on a 30 per cent rise in nine month profits. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 11.2 to 1,399.7. OSLO rose in the wake of gains in domestic bonds, and a rise in the dollar which was good for exporters and oil stocks. The all share index rose 8.53 to 608.55.

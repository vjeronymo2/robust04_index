			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Jun 22, BNS -- The 16.3-million-lat state  budget deficit on June 1 was completely covered with state  treasury bills, Finance Ministry's Budget Department Director  Gatis Kaminskis told reporters.    In the first five months of this year, the budget earned  211.8 million lats, or 36.9 percent of the projected yearly  revenues, while the spendings hit 219 million lats, or 35.6  percent of the planned yearly expenditure.    Commenting on the budget situation in the first five months  of this year, Kaminskis noted that budget incomes exceeded  spendings 2.8 million lats what reduced the prevalence of  spendings over incomes from 10.4 million lats late in April to  7.19 million lats late in May.    The Latvian economy currently enjoys a process of  stabilization because in May the inflation rate was the lowest  this year, only 0.2 percent compared to April. In total, the  inflation grew 12.4 percent since the beginning of this year.    Kaminskis underscored that the prediction that the inflation  would soar after the introduction of the uniform 18 percent  sales tax on all food stuffs in the beginning of June has not  materialized. He also called for the improvement of the  taxation system because the debts of sales tax and profit  tax-payers to the national budget have increased.    Sales tax payments formed 66.2 million lats of the state  budget earnings in the first five months of this year but the  sum is 1.8 times smaller than in the same period last year. The  debt of sales tax-payers to the state budget makes up around 3  million lats and the State Income Service should find out the  reason for the tendency of this debt to grow, Kaminskis noted.    The excise duty payments have also been unsatisfactory  between January and May as they formed only 23.5 percent of the  projected excise revenues.</p>

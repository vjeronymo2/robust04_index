			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Brooke Tool in the black at Pounds 76,000 An increase in export business helped Brooke Tool Engineering (Holdings), the components, cutting tools and springs company, to report a turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds 397,000 to profits of Pounds 76,000 for the six months to end-March. The outcome was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 7.22m to Pounds 7.71m, of which some 40 per cent was in export sales. There had been little improvement in the home market, the directors said. The interest charge was cut to Pounds 166,000 (Pounds 257,000) and earnings per share emerged at 0.2p (1.1p losses). There is, however, no interim dividend.</p>

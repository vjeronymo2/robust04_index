			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report in the "Parliament" column: "The </F> Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Ministry: The NATO Program  Is `An Instrument To Consolidate the CIS.' Apparently the  Deputies Will Not Be Allowed To Ratify Partnership for Peace"]    [Text] The Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry is going to  propose to today's session of the CIS heads of state council to  include in the final document a description of the NATO  Partnership for Peace program as "a mechanism to create a  collective security system in Europe." This was announced by  Yuriy Ushakov, director of the Foreign Ministry's Department for  European Cooperation, at yesterday's hearings in the State Duma  on "The NATO Program and the Future of the CIS." He recalled  that "whether Russia wants it or not," Ukraine, Moldova, and  Georgia have already signed the Partnership documents and their  example is soon to be followed by Kazakhstan and Turkmenia  [Turkmenistan]. According to the diplomat, "even if this is not  quite the `partnership' Moscow would like to have, the Foreign  Affairs Ministry sees only two ways out of this situation for  Russia: Take offense, shut itself up, and thus find itself in  isolation; or join the program and use its elbows vigorously to  uphold Russia's interests" and so prevent NATO's expansion.    Major General Pavel Zolotarev, who spoke at yesterday's  hearings on behalf of the Russian Defense Ministry, fully  supported such a position by the Foreign Affairs Ministry. "We  will never be able to force NATO to dissolve itself anyway," he  complained, calling on the house to work to achieve a status  desirable for Russia "from within."    CIS Council of Ministers Secretary Leonid Levashov expressed  active disagreement with Russia's and the East European  countries' signing the Partnership, stating that in that event  "NATO allies will appear in Russia's rear."    This opinion is also shared by a considerable part of State  Duma deputies. The Party of Russian Unity and Accord has  circulated demands on obligatory ratification by parliament of  the deed of accession to the Partnership (with an obvious hint  for a subsequent refusal by the lower chamber to do so), while  the Agrarian Party faction even prepared a corresponding Draft  Federal Law. Foreign Affairs Ministry department chief Yuriy  Ushakov explained, however, that the signing of the Partnership  is "not an agreement or a treaty but a declaration of intent,"  and therefore it does not call for special parliamentary  approval.</p>

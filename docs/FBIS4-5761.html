			<p>CSO     [Text] Prologue for Multimedia Revolution--Wave of  Japan-U.S. Rivalry    Sources confide that Isamu Miyazaki's Communications Policy  Section of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' [MOPT]  Electrical Communications Council will "present a report  reflecting a radical plan" calling for a "primary goal of  nurturing the competitive strength of the NTT." This signifies a  modification of the past concept of "calling for NTT to be  responsible for the next-generation communications  infrastructure."    The Communications Policy Section is working at a rapid pace  in concluding its work on the "Plan for a Japanese edition of  the Information Infrastructure," a so-called Japanese  Information Infrastructure (JII), in competition with the  National Information Infrastructure (NII) proposed by Vice  President Gore. The plan examines 21st century concepts such as  who will build the optical fiber cable network and at what pace?    Seminars concerning multimedia are being held actively by  coalition party Diet members such as those belonging to the  Shinseito, Japan New Party and Sakigake. The  Information-Communications Working Section of the government's  Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters, chaired by Prime  Minister Hosokawa, will promote JII from the standpoint of  deregulation. It seems that we will see a rush of new policy  launchings concerning multimedia at the sacrifice of existing  projects. MOPT officials such as Kanichiro Aritomi, chief,  Policy Section, Communications Policy Bureau, does not conceal  his sense of crisis in saying, "There is a need to organize a  major joint government-industry project to catch up with the  United States which has established a lead in this area."    However, the seed for the information super highway concept  created in the United States, in reality, originated in Japan.    The concept was originally born as the Visual Intelligent  and  Personal (VI&amp;P) Communications Services launched by NTT in  October 1990. The service envisioned the laying of optical fiber  cables in homes by the year 2015 and the provision of television  shopping and remote medical treatment through television images.  It envisioned all of the elements now addressed for the  multimedia society.    Those sources engaged in the VI&amp;P plan admit, "The  concept  involved a degree of `pie in the sky.'" The original plan called  for linkage of "40 percent of households" to the optical fiber  network, but when the plan was announced it gave the impression  that "all households" would be connected to the network.    That took place when Japanese industry was believed to  occupy  a superior position under Japan-U.S. competitive situations.  When Senator Gore learned of Japan's plan to connect Japanese  homes to optical cable systems, he sensed a strong feeling of  crisis. Critical U.S. sensitivities were jolted by "Japanese  pie-in-the-sky concepts." Both JII and VI&amp;P are scheduled for  completion in 2015, but it was not mere coincidence that this is  the case.    In January 1993, immediately prior to assuming the vice  presidency of the United States, Gore energetically asserted in  a speech at the University of California at Los Angeles that,  "If the United States should command leadership in the  information-communications area, we can increase domestic  employment, rebuild our exporting competitiveness and once again  export products to Japan and Latin America." Quick action was  taken in announcing U.S. government action plans in September  1993 and submitting NII-related legislation in January 1994.    Now, the ball thrown by the United States bounced back into  the Japanese court as a "government-industry crisis." Surprised  by the developments in the Gore plan, the MOPT announced that,  "optical fiber cables will be linked to households by the year  2010, five years earlier than originally scheduled."    Amidst a heated exchange of conceptual statements concerning  this area which involved government prestige and the exchange of  statements like a ping pong ball, we witnessed the rapid spread  of enthusiasm for multimedia based on exaggerations and  misunderstandings. Professor Hirobumi Takahashi, former NTT  official and currently on the staff of the Integrated  Information Faculty of Kansai University, points out, "Even the  goal of 2015 was in doubt, but the U.S. NII concept inspired  Japan into taking action."    However, there are crucial differences between the United  States and Japan. Board member Norio Murakami of Japan DEC  states, "The United States has three systems which it can use to  build its next-generation infrastructure, whereas Japan has only  one available system."    The three systems available in the United States are based  on  cable television (CATV), Internet, and the major communications  firms.    CATV firms, servicing 57 million households with a market  penetration rate of 60 percent, have launched experiments to tie  into communication systems. The world's largest computer  communications network, known as Internet, is in the process of  adapting computer imaging services. The AT&amp;T long-distance  carrier, AT&amp;T born as a result of the split up of AT&amp;T  in 1984,  and the seven regional telephone companies are in the process of  devising a variety of new highly functional services under the  pressure of competition.    The ultimate goal for each of these three services is the  same. That goal is embodied in multimedia communications  providing for the integrated transmission of alphabetical and  numerical data along with images and voices.    On the other hand, in the case of Japan, urban multichannel  CATV subscribers total just over 1 million, while personal  computer modem connections total 2 million--incomparably fewer  than in the United States. Comparable figures exist only in the  area of telephone services provided by NTT. Differences between  Japan and the United States are vast. That is why we must assume  bold policies which will nurture the competitive strength of and  stimulate competitiveness on the part of NTT.    The European Union (EU) requested the chief executive  officers of the 19 leading European communications firms to  prepare a European Information Infrastructure (EII). A plan  patterned after the U.S. NII is scheduled for submission by  June. Even Europe has started action to make up for lost time  after seeing moves made by Japan and the United States in  building information infrastructures.    International infrastructure competition is assuming a  colorful start in connection with NII, JII, EII, and multimedia.</p>

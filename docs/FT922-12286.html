			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Taking a long-term view of German steel: Gerhard Cromme talks to Christopher Parkes about Krupp's plans IN the three years since he took over the chairman's seat at Krupp, Mr Gerhard Cromme has sold off the rump of the German group's armaments business, returned its steel business to profit, won control of arch-rival Hoesch, and converted the whole group into a public limited company, ready for the stock market this summer. Despite this flurry of activity, Mr Cromme is uncomfortable with his popular tag as the model new-generation German manager. He oozes traditional conservatism; twitches at the thought of Anglo-American aggression in the mergers and acquisitions arena. Yet was he not the man who hijacked Hoesch? 'I am not a raider,' he replies. 'I am an industrialist with a sensible industrial concept.' In the controversy over his takeover of Hoesch, people had lost sight of the fact that the rationale for the merger was accepted by both supervisory boards, politicians and unions 10 years ago. 'It was not realisable at the time, (because Krupp backed away) but I have realised it,' he says. He has been called clumsy and short-sighted by those who prefer German industry's traditional painstaking consensus-building. Within 12 months of returning to Germany to take charge of Krupp's tired steel division, Krupp Stahl, after 15 years at Saint-Gobain in France, Mr Cromme had run into his first wave of criticism. Outrage, flying tomatoes, and the epithet 'the grave-digger' accompanied his closure of the 4m-tonne Rheinhausen integrated steel mill in Duisburg. The mill was losing DM200m (Pounds 68m) a year. In 1989-90 Krupp Stahl paid its first dividend for 16 years, and will pay another for 1991. Mr Cromme was promoted to head the whole group. Last autumn, criticism resurfaced over his acquisition of Hoesch, pride of Dortmund. Once again, said his critics, he had used un-German tactics, adding momentum to his ambition by secretly acquiring a 25 per cent stake in the target and teasing enough pledges out of other shareholders to give Krupp a majority. 'There was a wide consensus. The only problem was that the people in Dortmund were taken by surprise.' To his colleagues, Mr Cromme is Krupp's - maybe Germany's - best international manager. He has polished French, sound English, and he is relatively young. He has an uncommonly straightforward demeanour, and a preference for action. Before the takeover, Hoesch's management was working on a restructuring plan called Hoesch 2000. Fat would be trimmed, sales would fall to DM10bn from around DM13bn at present, but the reinvigorated Hoesch would bounce back and report DM18bn turnover at the end of decade. Krupp believes, however, the merger will achieve a comparable revival of Hoesch within 12 months once the deal is completed this summer. The German cartel office has required only one small disposal. Brussels anti-trust officials are still looking at some minor aspects of the merger but they are not going to block it. The main thrust of Mr Cromme's thinking is doggedly long-term. Ten or 20 years from now, he says, the corporate cultures of Europe will grow naturally together. Takeover rules will be agreed, possibly through Brussels, assimilating the best from all worlds. 'On the other hand, I think we will not see wasteful, world-scale financially-motivated takeovers. We will only do deals which have industrial logic.' And Mr Cromme himself has no taste for more takeovers. The company will now concentrate on building competitiveness in its strongest businesses, and in the meantime try to find partners to improve this quality in others. Five years on, Mr Cromme says, the enlarged Krupp group will stand on the legs which support it and Hoesch today: steel, plant construction, steel processing, engineering, trading and vehicle components. He entertains no dreams of ironing out the cyclical bumps, to which all his businesses are prone, by rampant diversification. 'If we do it right, even with steel, we can make money - not every year perhaps - but over the years we can climb,' he says. The other German steelmakers are now urgently examining merger deals to allow them to compete with the two leaders, Krupp and Thyssen. The half-dozen significant steel producers in Germany at present will eventually come down to two or three, says Mr Cromme. 'We have to have the synergies of scale to compete internationally.' The British, French and Italian giants have three hot strip mills each. 'Is it possible for a steel company in Germany to have the same synergies with just one?' As well as critical mass, Krupp and Hoesch together have gained another advantage, he says. 'We are so close to one another - just 20 miles apart. Everyone in capital intensive industry knows it is important to be close together. It gives you a big advantage in moving people and products around,' he adds. It also provides a firm base for Mr Cromme's next long-term move: expansion beyond what he calls his 'regional' market in Europe, reaching out with advanced, bespoke products for customers the world over. He is naturally not immune to the immediate concerns exercising German industry. But he is uncommonly cool on the subject. Other industrial leaders have complained about excessive pay claims and the risks to 'Standort Deutschland', Germany's role as a manufacturing base. The situation is not just a matter of high labour costs, he stresses. The debate also reflects concern about the state of the market, corporate taxes, infrastructure and education. 'Things are not bad, but they could be better,' Mr Cromme says. And he believes that eventually, 'when the going gets really tough' trade unions will see the signs and accept that changed conditions demand changed attitudes. His assured tone falters for a moment. 'Germans have always been flexible enough in the past to cope with changes in the environment. Now the question is, will that flexibility be as great in the future?' He accepts that with reunification to pay for, resources are stretched and the country needs to set new priorities 'for one or two years'. It has to decide if the economy can cope with costly environmental policies, rising wages and consumption, shrinking working hours and increasing social costs and at the same time assimilate the east. But in the long run, as east and west Europe grow slowly together, so Germany's advantage - its central position - will improve, he says. Meanwhile, the country's relative advantage remains undamaged, in Mr Cromme's eyes. 'One thing is certain, if Standort Deutschland is not in a good condition, things will be even worse in other European countries,' he says.</p>

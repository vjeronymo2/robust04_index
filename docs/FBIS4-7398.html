			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, April 28 (ANEX/ANTARA)- Indonesian  businessmen engaging in textile and textile products needed  modernization in the post-multifibre agreement (MFA) era marked  with tougher competition in the international market, said  Minister of Trade Sastro Budiharjo quoting President Suharto as  saying here on Thursday.    He briefed the head of state on the signing of the Uruguay  Round in Marrakesh, Morroco recently.    Budiharjo told journalists that the abolishment of MFA  resulted in the wiping out of quota system which arranges  categories of textile and textile products of certain countries.    He added that the phasing out of quota systems until 2005  will in turn lead to stronger competition made by China,  Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh.    "The government gives full support to Indonesian exporters  of  textile and garment," he said.    The elimination of MFA in stages for the last ten years has  reduced quotas of certain categories of textile and textile  products while increasing other categories of commodities, he  noted.    Reporting to the President on importing rice from certain  countries, he said that Indonesia was forced to do so as the  Uruguay Round required all countries to open their markets.    However, he added Indonesia has a concession preventing  excessive imported rice which may pose threats to local farmers'  livelihood.    Indonesia, therefore, may import rice in case of lower  prices  of imported rice compared to those offered by domestic market,  he said.    Indonesia, which is expected to import 70,000 tons of rice  annually, will provide 90 percent of duty to the lower prices of  imported rice.    The government will keep on protecting local businessmen  while fulfilling the requirement of the Uruguay Round, he  assured journalists raising questions on the possibility of  importing of rice from a certain country.</p>

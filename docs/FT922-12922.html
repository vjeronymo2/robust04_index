			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Letter: Business leaders appeal to governments for successful conclusion of Uruguay Round Sir, We the undersigned are chief executive officers of some of the world's leading corporations and officers of leading business organisations in our countries. Most of us have supported the Uruguay Round from its inception, and have given advice on its contents to our governments. At the initiative of the International Chamber of Commerce, we are writing to governments to convey our concern that deadline after deadline for concluding the Round is not being met and that the Round might be stalled indefinitely. Such a prospect impels us to express our strongly felt views to our leaders once again. We have consistently emphasised our conviction that a successful Round is crucial to the long-term growth prospects of our economies. A reformed and strengthened multilateral trading system with substantially improved market access for goods and services is the key to that success. The industrialised countries are plagued by recession directly attributable to a pervasive lack of business confidence impeding investment and prolonging retrenchment. Failure to complete the Uruguay Round would be a further serious blow to confidence. We know from our own experience and from that of our business colleagues that the continuing stalemate over the trade negotiations has contributed to the deterioration of the economic climate and the postponement of many business initiatives around the world, and thus to persistent and growing unemployment. Governments must demonstrate the political will necessary to conclude a strong and comprehensive agreement. In addition to the negative impact on jobs at home, we want to draw our leaders' attention to the impact such failure to complete the negotiations would have on the situation of the developing countries and the former communist countries, most of which are trying to reform the structure of their economies and work their way out of large debt burdens. The ability to provide markets for them will be critical to the success of their efforts to develop sound market economies and maintain healthy democracies. Convinced that a failure of the negotiations may have serious adverse repercussions on a global level and may threaten emergence of a new and better world order, we urge our leaders to use upcoming bilateral and multilateral meetings to bring the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion.

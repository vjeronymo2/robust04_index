			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Three inspectors of  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived here today  to begin a further inspection of nuclear facilities of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).    Eyewitness saw more than ten boxes belonging to the  inspectors at the airport. The inspectors told XINHUA that the  boxes contained equipment for the inspection.    However, they refused to reveal any details about the  inspection but said that their activities would last about one  week.    In March, the IAEA inspected the Yongbyon Radioactive  Chemical Laboratory which is located 100 km north of Pyongyong.  But the agency is not satisfied with the results and so  inspectors have to carry out another inspection, according to  reports.    However, the reports say that the new inspection will not  include monitoring the change of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt  nuclear reactor.</p>

The tension surrounding the indefinite transportation  strike,  which is in its 10th day, decreased at dawn today after strike  leaders promised police not to cause disturbances during their  demonstrations. The Sandinist transportation sector is  insisting on its demands that the government "freeze" fuel  prices, abolish the sector's taxes, and execute the plan to  reorganize transportation in the nation.    Hundreds of buses and taxis are still parked at the four  entrances to the traffic circle at the Metro Center on the  southwestern periphery of the capital, blocking the normal flow  of private vehicles. Some 200 meters from the traffic circle  are Nicaragua's main police headquarters and the Metropolitan  Cathedral. The concentration of buses and taxis in this area has  forced the suspension of bus services which, since last Sunday,  had provided the public with almost five routes.    Gustavo Aguiluz, CNT spokesman, which called the strike on  24  January, today asserted that the CNT will continue trying to  work out with the government the possibility of a dialogue to  end the protest. Nevertheless, Aguiluz said the strike will  continue if the government refuses to fulfill the agreements  signed in September, which ended a nationwide transportation  strike that had resulted in two deaths, dozens of casualties and  arrests, and the loss of some $16 million.</p>

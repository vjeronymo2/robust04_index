			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Economics Notebook: Emu still firmly on central bank agendas Mr John Major thinks that calls for full economic and monetary union in Europe 'have all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same potency'. Tell a continental government official about the prime- ministerial jibe in a recent issue of the Economist and the reaction is one of pained surprise. Britain's European partners are again working towards Emu, even if the ambitious timetable of the Maastricht Treaty that envisages union by 1999 may slip. Germany's ratification of Maastricht after its Constitutional Court found in favour of the treaty on October 12 has brought Emu back up the European agenda. The special EC summit in Brussels on Friday this week will decide the location of the European Monetary Institute, which, as forerunner of the planned European central bank, will prepare for the third and final stage of Emu with its single European currency and monetary policy. Although August's changes to the European Monetary System mean that the European exchange rate mechanism no longer exercises its former tight discipline over EC currencies, Europe's central bankers are not ignoring Emu. Indeed, at a seminar on monetary policy, organised in Amsterdam last week by the Dutch central bank and the Centre for Economic Research at Tilburg University, both the Bundesbank and the Bank of England were making their cases for how monetary policy should operate once European economic monetary union is under way. Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist and a member of the Bundesbank board, put forward an uncompromising vision of Emu's operating according to German rules and urged that a decision on such a programme should be made now. The planned European central bank should have a money supply target to steer its policy, just as the Bundesbank steers German policy by reference to M3, the broad measure of German money supply. In that way, the new institution would inherit the counter inflationary credibility of the Bundesbank. Worries that financial innovation might undermine such targetry on a European level, as it has in the US or Britain, were probably overdone, Mr Issing suggested. Innovations tended to multiply in periods of high inflation and after regulation and deregulation in the financial sector. If stage three of Emu were to begin with prices stable, the chances of minimising the dangers of innovation would be good. By advocating a European monetary policy 'made in Germany' in this way, Mr Issing put the Bundesbank on collision course with the Bank of England. It is not so long since Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, threw his weight behind UK government efforts to scale down the EC's monetary ambitions by suggesting that other European member states should emulate the British practice of having an inflation target and use these to aim for economic convergence. In Amsterdam last week, Mr Andrew Crockett, the Bank's executive director for international monetary affairs, argued in favour of mixing rules in monetary policy with discretion. It is fine, Mr Crockett argued, to have rules for the final objective of policy such as price stability. But monetary authorities must use judgment rather than intermediate targets such as money supply in pursuit of such objectives. The pursuit of a broad money target to control inflation was too vulnerable to economic and financial change. If nothing else, the Amsterdam symposium highlighted the gulf between Anglo-Saxon and central European thinking about how monetary policy should be managed to achieve price stability. Canada and New Zealand also target inflation rates rather than intermediate goals (and introduced inflation targets before the UK) while the Bank of England's more judgmental approach has support in US academic circles. Germany's near neighbours in what is left of the ERM are keeping faith with the Bundesbank's counter inflation record by not moving aggressively to cut their short-term interest rates. Such a debate might appear abstruse. But the Bundesbank's credibility in continental Europe gives it the confidence to set the monetary policy agenda for Emu in other ways. Mr Issing made clear that a decision to use money stock as an intermediate target in monetary policy in Emu 'would only be a first step'. He spoke warmly of the German experience of controlling money market liquidity through minimum reserves - the non interest-bearing deposits that commercial banks have to place with the Bundesbank. The adoption of such a policy on a European scale could reduce the competitiveness of international banks in the City, which at present face no such rule. As Mr Issing does not look like a rain dancer, Mr Major should perhaps take note of what he says. There is another point about the debate on future monetary policy in Emu that should weigh with all 12 EC leaders when they meet in Brussels at the end of the week. Such issues as the ideal EC monetary aggregate, the merits and demerits of inflation targeting and the best way of implementing a Europe-wide monetary policy threaten to tie up some of Europe's brightest economic policy makers at a time when more urgent questions, such as how best to tackle Europe's high and rising unemployment, are crying out for an answer. This risk became clear when Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, head of economics at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, noted that 20 of the OECD's 24 member states are projected to have inflation rates below 3 per cent and asked whether the industrialised countries should not now err on the side of economic expansion rather than combating inflation. The absence of growth, Mr Shigehara warned, was fostering trade tensions and protectionism that threatened global prosperity. Sadly, and perhaps significantly, his intervention was not followed up by the 70 or so central bankers and academics at the Amsterdam meeting.</p>

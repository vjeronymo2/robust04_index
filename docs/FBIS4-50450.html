			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bayani Cruz] </F>   [Text] The Chinese government is making it more difficult  for foreign joint ventures to repatriate their foreign exchange  earnings, in a bid to exercise more control over the country's  foreign exchange transactions. The new restrictions are  contained in provisional regulations drafted by the State  Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC) Commission in  coordination with the Bank of China (BOC), according to the  China Newsletter published by Price Waterhouse.    Although the new regulations had not yet been released, they  reportedly contained stiffer procedural requirements regarding  the repatriation of foreign exchange earnings by "foreign  investment enterprises". "Foreign investment enterprises" are  joint ventures between foreign investors and local Chinese.    Under the new regulations, there will be an increase in the  number of approvals required of foreign investment enterprises  that wish to repatriate forex earnings. For example, if, at the  application stage, a new foreign investment enterprise did not  envisage it would be able to balance its foreign exchange books,  it has to seek SAEC approval, according to Price Waterhouse.    Without SAEC approval, a foreign investment enterprise may  not be granted access to the forex swap centres at a later date,  Price Waterhouse said. The new rules would also make it  mandatory for foreign investment enterprises with overseas  offices to remit any foreign exchange "hard currency" earnings  back to China instead of keeping them abroad. However, the  foreign investment enterprises would be allowed to keep the  remitted foreign exchange earnings in their own accounts, rather  than being required to sell their foreign exchange to the Bank  of China.    Few foreign investment enterprises are expected to be  affected by the mandatory remittance requirement, because, while  there are currently many foreign joint ventures on the mainland,  few of them have existing overseas offices.    Also under the new regulations, the State Planning  Commission  may draw up two lists of businesses: those that are restricted  (class A) and those that are promoted (class B) under current  policies, Price Waterhouse's newsletter said. Foreign  investment enterprises engaged in class A businesses may only be  given access to swap centres for a three-year period, during  which time they would be required to demonstrate their ability  to balance their foreign exchange books. Those engaged in class  B businesses, such as power station projects, would be granted  SAEC approval to use the swap centres without the additional  restrictions imposed on class A enterprises, Price Waterhouse  said.    There has been a lot of activity in the area of foreign  exchange controls by Beijing since the beginning of this year,  according to bankers. The SAEC and the BOC have been drafting a  number of regulations intended to restrict repatriation of  foreign exchange and strengthen remittance requirements. The  policies of restrictive trend towards foreign exchange stems  from the Chinese government's efforts to cope with its balance  of payments difficulties.</p>

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange is proposing to expand the categories of organizations which are eligible to become member organizations to include entities with new organizational structures. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange is proposing to amend its Rules relating to the admission of entities with new organizational structures as member organizations. Specifically, the proposed amendment would permit the Exchange, in its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as the Exchange may prescribe, to approve limited liability companies (``LLCs''), business trusts or other organizational structures as member organizations so long as the characteristics of the entity in question are essentially similar to those of corporations or partnerships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An LLC is a hybrid business entity, combining the limited liability characteristics of a corporation with the pass-through taxation attributes of a partnership. Currently, approximately 45 States and the District of Columbia have adopted LLC statutes. New York State recently adopted legislation, effective October 24, 1994, authorizing LLCs. The Exchange has been advised that a number of existing member organizations are considering altering their business structure to that of an LLC. Both the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'') and the Chicago Stock Exchange (``CHX'') already permit membership by an LLC, and the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') recently received SEC approval to amend its rules to do so. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 33124 (November 1, 1993), 58 FR 59282 (November 8, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;40); 34604 (August 26, 1994), 59 FR 45316 (September 1, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;94&hyph;17) (``CHX Approval Order''); and 34664 (September 13, 1994), 59 FR 48346 (September 20, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;01) (``NYSE Approval Order''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``business trust'' is generally used to describe a trust in which the managers are principals, and the shareholders are cestuis que trust. As stated in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Black's Law Dictionary, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ``[t]he essential attribute [of a business trust] is that property is placed in the hands of trustees who manage and deal with it for use and benefit of beneficiaries.'' <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Black's Law Dictionary <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  180 (5th ed. 1979). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to adopt new Commentary .01 to Definition 2 of the Exchange Rules to provide that entities may be accepted as member organizations by the Exchange if they have characteristics essentially similar to partnerships, corporations or both. At the present time, the Exchange intends to consider both LLCs and business trusts as eligible to become member organizations. These entities would be subject to all rules applicable to member organizations, and existing references to member firm or member corporation, as appropriate, and member organization would be deemed to include any such entity which is approved as a member organization. Of course, in order to be a member organization, an entity must be able to qualify as a broker or dealer registered with the SEC pursuant to the Act. In addition, the Exchange staff would review applications on a case-by-case basis as it does with all member organization applicants. Prior to approving any such organization for membership, the staff would have to be satisfied that: (1) the Exchange would legally have appropriate jurisdiction over such an entity; and (2) the permanency of the entity's capital is consistent with that required of other member organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(2) in particular in that it is designed to ensure that the rules of the Exchange provide that any broker or dealer or natural person associated with a registered broker or dealer may become a member of the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

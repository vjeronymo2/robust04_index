Sectoral  Ministers Will Get Economic Freedom Instead of Money"]    [Text] Aleksandr Lifshits, head of the Russian Federation  president's economic experts group, one of the writers of the  presidential message, stressed in his press conference yesterday  that Viktor Chernomyrdin's speech at the Council of Ministers  enlarged session "was fully proceeding along the channel of the  presidential message as regards all the postulates and  priorities." Lifshits told about "signals" attesting to "a  great degree of understanding by State Duma deputies of the new  economic program," announced by the president and the premier.    Saying this, Aleksandr Lifshits, however, vouched:  "According to my lights...prices and wages are not supposed to  be frozen," something most people in the Duma talk about as a  fact decided on by Chernomyrdin's government. "I have seen all  the recent government documents -- there are definitely no such  things in there," Lifshits said. In the meantime he recognized  that "in the government apparatus, there are such top-class  artists that there already exist several various projects for  freezing prices." Lifshits termed their implementation as  "madness owing to their being impossible to carry out  technically -- they will pull the wool over your eyes but  nothing will come of it all the same."    Besides, Lifshits hopes the government will not cave in to  "the pressure of local commodity producers" who demand  protection from foreign goods "by such crude methods as colossal  customs tariffs."    The experts group head also expressed the hope that "the  budget will still not be made to provide for a 12-15 percent  deficit." He affirmed that these figures were named in the  Council of Ministers presidium session where the budget was  discussed.    Sectoral ministers "who, one by one, clamored for money in  that session and stated: cut down on funds for anyone else but  me, while they irritably motioned to a grinning Andrey Kokoshin  [first deputy defense minister]," according to Lifshits were not  "a sight for nervous folks." Lifshits believes that one can  only hope that during the week the government "revises" the  budget, it will make up its mind to "give, instead of money  (which is not there), economic freedom, which still does not  exist."</p>

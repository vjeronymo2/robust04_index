			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER OWLS AND TIMBER IN NORTHWEST  </P> <P> In regards to your editorial on forest management, please be more careful. The  issue is in fact better management of our forest resources. The issue is not  addressed in any productive manner by emotion-charged, attention-grabbing  editorials!  </P> <P> We are not running out of trees! We in the U.S. have had great success in  harvesting and renewing our forest lands. Current estimates are that we have up  to 70% of the trees that the country had when the Americas were discovered. The  industry has for many years planted four to five times the trees it harvests.  </P> <P> When will the ancient forest be cut down? Never! We have already set aside the  best of the best forever. Not just in the well-known parks like Yellowstone and  Yosemite, but in the seldom-traveled and remote millions and millions of acres  of our state and federal park and wilderness systems, 12 million acres (12% of  the land base) in California alone!  </P> <P> Of the great California redwoods, the giant redwoods of the Sierra are for the  most part totally protected from all but nature itself. Of the smaller,  commercial specie, the coastal redwood, the protected forest lands are so large  (more than 255,000 acres) that if consolidated in one strip, it would be 1 mile  wide and stretch from Los Angeles to San Francisco (more than 375 square  miles). Already preserved in Redwood National Park, the least visited of all  the national parks, are the tallest and some of the oldest of the coastal  redwoods.  </P> <P> Can we do a better job of managing the forests and protecting the environment?  We can never stop trying to be better at it. What we need is more responsible  efforts. That's why we should not support Prop. 130 or Prop. 128. They don't  offer a reasoned and responsible approach. We need to vote yes on Prop. 138 for  reasonable forest management and responsible protection of the environment.  </P> <P> DENNIS L. RICHARDSON, President  </P> <P> Oregon-Canadian Forest Products  </P> <P> of California, Orange  </P></p>

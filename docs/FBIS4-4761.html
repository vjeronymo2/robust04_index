			<p>BFN     [Text] The continuing dispute between the Government and  the Opposition-plus-Senators has jeopardised the country's  status in multinational trade talks, Deputy Prime Minister  Suphachai Phanitchaphak said yesterday. The political wrangling  also sent the Stock Exchange of Thailand [SET] index below 1,200  points to its lowest level in five months. Hard hit by  political uncertainty coupled with unfavourable situations in  foreign exchanges, the market lost 35.94 points or 2.92 percent  to close at 1,196.59, the first time since October 27 that it  had slipped below 1,200.    Dr Suphachai said the disagreements over the Constitution  have nothing to do with the country's economy and despite  political differences, various projects are still moving  forward. However, the parliamentary infighting has a  psychological impact on the economy. The international  community is questioning whether the political situation would  affect government policies, he said.    "We will have to explain to them that the current situation  has nothing to do with the Government's policies, that means the  Government will have to work hard to explain this to them," said  Dr Suphachai. "In other words the Government will have to  rebuild the credibility of the country."    He said that if the Constitution is not amended this time,  it's not the end of the world; there will be time to try again.    "We should focus on developing our economy first. If the  economy is well developed and the people have a better living  standard, then they will pay attention to the amendment of the  Constitution."    Amid rumours of possible dissolution of the House of  Representatives, the SET index tumbled and analysts forecast it  would decline further.    The investment mood yesterday was bearish from the  beginning.  The three worst performers in prices were: finance (down 4.38  percent), commerce (down 3.46 percent) and banking (down 2.97  percent).    Wichet Tantiwanit, marketing manager of TFB Asset Management  Co, said investors were worried about possible dissolution of  the House of Representatives.    Even if Prime Minister Chuan Likphai does not dissolve the  Lower House, uncertainty would linger, he said. However, he  suggested that dissolution would create positive hope of getting  a new prime minister. Dissolution would also provide a clearer  investment picture, but only in the short term only, Mr Wichet  said. He said his firm had to slow down its plan to launch more  funds for sale to the public because of prevailing bearishness.    Asia Securities Trading Co managing director Prathip  Yongwanit admitted that foreign investors were now sellers of  local stocks as they feared political uncertainty. He added  that HG Asia in Hong Kong, which normally channelled foreign  funds for investment on the SET through his firm, had sold out  its holdings for the moment.    According to the SET, between March 28 and April 1, sales by  foreigners of local stocks accounted for 27.86 percent of total  sales by four parties including brokers' portfolios, local  mutual funds, foreigners and local investors. Foreigners'  bought stocks amounting to 16.56 percent.    Sa-ngat Sathapatthana, a director of Baring Research Ltd,  said that rising overseas interest rates had also caused the  bearishness. The Easter holidays also accounted for slim trading  value.    He said the Lower House would definitely be dissolved --  it's  just a matter of when. Mr Sa-ngat said it could be next month.    He added that foreign investors realise there would be no  major change in local fiscal and monetary policies after  dissolution since any finance minister normally listens to  suggestions of his permanent secretary.    He forecast a further decline in the SET index since  companies must pay corporate tax in May. However, Mr Sa-ngat  suggested investors gradually buy into fundamentally sound  stocks since the local economy's long-term prospects are good  and exports are on the uptrend.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestine National Liberation Movement, Fatah,  has asserted that the Jabalyah camp massacre is a premeditated  murder meant to liquidate Fatah elements.    In a statement distributed in the occupied territories  yesterday, the Fatah Movement added: This new massacre will  negatively affect the course of the negotiations.    The Fatah Movement held the Israeli Government and the  Israeli military establishment responsible for the massacres  committed against our people. It reiterated that the six  Palestinian victims were deliberately killed by the bullets of  the terrorist Israeli undercover units.</p>

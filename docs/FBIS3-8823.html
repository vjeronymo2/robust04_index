			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, March 15 (AFP) -- The office of the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) denounced Tuesday  [15 March] the Bosnian Serbs' continued refusal to allow  humanitarian aid convoys from reaching the besieged Bosnian town  of Maglaj. UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said his agency's  repeated requests to the Serbs to allow humanitarian convoys  into the north Bosnian town have so far fallen on deaf ears. No  relief convoys have managed to get into the enclave, which  shelters about 100,000 people, since October 26, when two UNHCR  Danish drivers were killed. Since then the UN has carried out  food air-drops over the region, some of which have missed their  target, Kessler said.    Radio Sarajevo reported Monday that Serb troops had fired  upon a group of people trying to retrieve some of the food but  the UN, which helicoptered 10 British liaison officers into the  enclave Sunday, was unable to confirm the report. The radio also  reported that the Serbs had shelled the town on Tuesday.    Meanwhile a UNHCR aid convoy was waiting in the central town  of Zenica for the Serbs to give it the green light to head to  Maglaj, some 80 kilometers north (50 miles). The convoy of about  10 trucks is being escorted by British peacekeeping troops.    Kessler said although Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic  has given his approval for the passage of the convoy, local Serb  authorities say they have received no word from their superiors.    The Maglaj region has become one of the hottest spots in  Bosnia in recent weeks as the Serbs intensified their  stranglehold on the enclave, formerly linked to territory held  by the mainly Moslem Bosnian army and Croat troops. Bosnian  military leader Hasim Sedic said the situation in the region  escalated last June when the Bosnian army and Croat defense  forces (HVO) -- allies until then -- began fighting. The Croats  subsequently formed an alliance with the Serbs in order to  isolate the Moslems.    Sadic added that since the March 1 Moslem-Croat accord to  form a federation, the HVO has adopted a "passive" attitude  concerning the fighting in the Maglaj region. He said the Serbs  have some 80,000 troops deployed around the enclave and have  helicopters and heavy artillery at their disposal. This could  not be independently confirmed.</p>

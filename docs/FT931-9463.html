			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei dips below 17,000 as yen improves A FURTHER rise in the yen against the dollar weakened sentiment, and the Nikkei average slipped below the 17,000 level for the first time since January 27, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index closed 238.39 lower at the day's low of 16,851.51, 2.8 per cent lower on the week, depressed by arbitrage selling and profit-taking by investment trusts and foreigners. It had registered a day's high of 17,120.40 in early trading, on buying linked to February option settlements. The morning impetus pushed up volume to 270m shares after Thursday's holiday, against Wednesday's 199m. Declines led advances by 598 to 313 with 192 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks lost 6.98 to 1,288.95 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.54 to 1,036.29. Most investors remained on the sidelines ahead of the meeting in Washington between Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury security. The dollar continued its slide against the yen, as dealers expect Mr Bentsen to press for a higher yen to reduce Japan's swelling trade surplus. Amid the currency uncertainty, dealers focused on short term trading in stocks reflecting domestic demand. Morinaga, the confectionery maker, was the day's most active issue, gaining Y42 to Y581. Reports that the company will develop a new system to detect lung cancer cells encouraged some dealers. Utilities rose on the strength of the yen, with Tokyo Electric Power gaining Y10 to Y2,580. The sector has also been popular recently on a dividend yield of around 2 per cent, against an average of 0.9 per cent for the Nikkei index. 'Investment trusts seem to be buying steels and utilities on the back of higher dividends,' said Mr Hiroshi Nasu at James Capel. High-technology issues were sold on worries over the higher yen. Matsushita Electric Industrial declined Y30 to Y1,070 on reports of a sharp profit decline for the current year to March. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 101.23 to 18,373.15 in volume of 14.4m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mostly firmer. TAIWAN turned in the strongest performance in the region as the market gave its approval to the nomination of the governor of Taiwan province, Lien Chan, as premier. The weighted index ended 153.76 or 4.3 per cent higher at its intra-day high of 3,775.19, up 4.2 per cent on the week. Turnover nearly doubled to TDollars 36bn, the heaviest since last June. Strong retail demand emerged, particularly for financial issues in the wake of Lien's nomination, which is seen as improving the prospects for political stability. HONG KONG edged ahead after some late buying emerged after a day in which trading continued to be inhibited by worries about the political outlook. The Hang Seng index was rose 1.15 to 5,858.15, 1 per cent higher on the week, in turnover of HKDollars 2.03bn. AUSTRALIA saw foreign demand take the All Ordinaries index up 4.4 to 1,603.5, 3.9 per cent higher on the week, in turnover of ADollars 341.21m. Blue chips led the upturn, Western Mining and Commonwealth Bank both rising on positive interim results. Western Mining, which plans a major nickel expansion, finished up 16 cents to ADollars 4.56. Commonwealth Bank rose 14 cents to ADollars 6.44. SINGAPORE went against the higher trend and the Straits Times Industrial index shed 7.95 to 1,613.52, down 0.3 per cent on the week. MANILA saw demand shift from commercial and industrial issues into oils, and despite some late profit-taking, the composite index closed at a four-month high, 1.04 higher at 1,404.65 for a weekly rise of 4.6 per cent.</p>

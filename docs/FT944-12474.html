			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasury prices fall back on profit-taking US Treasury bond prices fell victim to profit-taking yesterday as traders showed a muted reaction to the first in a series of important economic reports due out this week. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/8 lower at 94 23/32 , with the yield rising to 7.959 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 6.824 per cent. After the market rang up solid gains on Friday, prices receded in early trading yesterday. With the long bond jumping by about a point to close last week's action, traders prudently decided to step back a little. In spite of the retrenchment, the positive mood appeared to hold. Last week's shift in sentiment suggested that the market may have touched bottom before Friday's disclosure that the economy had expanded at an annualised rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, much stronger than analysts had forecast. Although the headline figure could well have rattled the inflation-sensitive long end, bonds held steady on Friday and then climbed on relief over the initial calm reaction. During the session, the yield slumped below 8.00 per cent, an important psychological mark breached a week earlier. Yesterday, however, traders were looking ahead for fresh guidance. The first piece of news in this week's busy schedule came at mid-morning. The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago announced slight gains in both its October index of business activity and the prices-paid component of the monthly survey. The mildly unfavourable developments had little impact, however. Instead, attention was directed at today's national survey of purchasing managers and Friday's crucial report on conditions in the labour market. In general, the reports were expected to be benign for bonds. European government bonds drifted lower in moderate volume, dragged down by weaker US Treasuries. With France closed for the day and market participants in other countries winding down for today's All Saints' holiday, flows were thin and dealers reported little investor activity. After opening on a stronger note, German bunds ended the day nearly 1/2 point lower, slipping on a bout of futures selling which pushed the December bund futures contract on Liffe as low as 98.08, down 0.41 on the day and close to the 89.00 level considered to represent key technical support. The slippage was attributed to the weakness of US Treasuries and to dealers paring back long futures positions established last week. Adding to the softer tone was the Bundesbank's announcement that it plans to issue a new 10-year bund on November 8 and 9. After its recent floating-rate issue, it has returned to its more traditional fixed-rate bonds. UK gilts also slipped in light trading, shedding some of the gains posted on Friday. Weakness in neighbouring bond markets and slightly stronger than expected money supply data fuelled the profit-taking, which pushed the December long gilt futures contract down  13/32 to 100 9/16 . The short end of the yield curve came under particular pressure from reviving talk of an imminent increase in base rates. Interest rate jitters have turned the market's focus to today's release of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report and tomorrow's meeting between Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer. The December short sterling futures contract fell 0.11 to 93.47. Swedish bonds opened lower after Moody's Investors Service, the international rating agency, said late on Friday that it was placing Sweden's foreign currency debt on review for downgrading on concerns about the country's public-sector deficit. However, with few foreign investors left in the Swedish market and domestic investors reluctant to sell, prices held up relatively well and ended the day only slightly lower. The market remains partially underpinned by widespread hopes for a 'yes' vote in the European Union referendum on November 13. Moreover, Moody's threat to downgrade Swedish debt may serve Finance Minister Goran Persson as a tool to help push budget cuts through parliament in January, observers said.</p>

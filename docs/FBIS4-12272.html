			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 6 Apr (INA) -- The Arab Liberation Front  [ALF] this evening held a speech rally to mark its 25th founding  anniversary, which coincides with the the Arab Socialist Ba'th  Party [ASBP] anniversary.    Sa'di Mahdi Salih, member of the Iraq Command of the ASBP  delivered a speech at the function, also attended by  'Abd-al-Majid al-Rafi'i and Badr al-Din Muddathir, members of  the National Command of the ASBP. Salih first communicated  greetings from His Excellency President Saddam Husayn to the  people of the intifadah in Palestine. He emphasized that the  party leadership is absolutely confident of complete victory,  notwithstanding the unsavory character of certain incumbent Arab  politicians and leaders.    The Mother of Battles agenda has forced the  Zionist-American tyrants to expose all the agent puppets,  leaving none of the agents in the ranks of the Arab nation  capable of concealing their treasonous connections.    Salih was followed by 'Azzam al-Ahmad, the state of  Palestine's ambassador in Baghdad. 'Azzam said that, led by  Saddam Husayn, Iraq is bound to bring its ambitions to fruition,  since they are those of the Arab nation. He said he was certain  Iraq will ride out the sanctions crisis and mount a successful  challenge to all types of aggression, and, in the end, emerge  the victor.    The Zionist enemy, he went on, is working to liquidate the  Palestinian cause and extinguish the freedom of the Palestinian  people to pursue their advancement and independence.    The next speech was delivered on behalf of the professional  and popular Palestinian organizations, which voiced their  appreciation and recognition of the support they have been  receiving from President Saddam Husayn in pursuing their  programs in Iraq.    Mr. Anwar Daklas, president of the General Union of  Palestinian Engineers said: We have learned from President  Saddam Husayn's Iraq all the militant values that will help us  attain our liberation and advancement.    Mr. Abu-Mahmud, deputy secretary general of the ALF  delivered  a speech in which he stressed that over the past 25 years, the  front has fought all the battles in which the national existence  and legitimacy of the Palestinian people were at stake and stood  up to the Zionist and anti-Arab enemies.    He called for severing all forms of contacts pursuing a  settlement with the enemy and quitting the policy of making free  concessions. He also urged that all forms of struggle, armed  struggle in particular, be intensified against occupation and  that all resources be mobilized to refine the valiant popular  intifadah.</p>

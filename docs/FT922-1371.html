			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: HKFE plans Hang Seng Index launch THE Hong Kong Futures Exchange hopes to launch Hang Seng Index options late this year or early in 1993, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. A decision will be taken in October, according to Mr Gary Knight, the exchange chief executive. He said a decision on whether to introduce electronic matching and to start new currency and interest rate contracts would follow the options move. He warned against expecting heavy turnover immediately. 'When we launch options we will not see the big volumes on day one,' he said. Mr Knight said options trading would continue for some time under the open outcry system used for existing contracts. The exchange was studying the possibility of introducing electronic matching, although he stressed that a decision was not imminent. 'The electronic dealing system decision is in process. Our focus is on options right now,' he said. If electronic trading went ahead, new interest and currency products could follow.</p>

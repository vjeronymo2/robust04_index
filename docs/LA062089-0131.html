			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. URGES CLEMENCY FOR CHINA STUDENTS  </P> <P> The United States has urged China to grant clemency to demonstrators sentenced  to death in Beijing and Shanghai and to pardon those who were arrested in  pro-democracy protests, the White House said today.  </P> <P> "Sentences of death in Shanghai and Beijing could only deepen the wounds of the  past few weeks," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in  announcing that the U.S. appeal had been delivered to Chinese Ambassador Han Xu  on Monday night.  </P> <P> Fitzwater declined to say what, if any, steps the United States might take if  China goes ahead with executions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Intensify Condemnation  </P> <P> The White House announcement came on the heels of demands in Congress and  elsewhere that the United States intensify its condemnation of Chinese  repression and consider further sanctions against the Beijing government.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said Han was called in to the State Department to hear what the  spokesman called "the strong United States position."  </P> <P> Hinting at worsening relations between Beijing and Washington, Fitzwater said  "the United States raised this subject in the spirit of a country that has  worked with China over the past two decades to improve relations."  </P> <P> "We believe that human rights are universal, and our duty to comment on them is  great," Fitzwater said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN OLD STORY BROUGHT UP TO SPEED;  </P> <P> 'STAND-UP TRAGEDY'S' FULL-COURT PRESS  </P> <P> Click/Click/Click/Click. It's the way we take our home entertainment now, and  it has had its effect on the way we watch theater and movies. Maybe even on the  way we watch life.  </P> <P> A bad effect, in some people's view. Kids raised on "Sesame Street," teachers  tell you, can't follow a traditional story. All they want is the ups.  </P> <P> Others argue that it's just the reverse. TV has exposed us all to so many  traditional stories that a couple of images give us enough to infer the rest.  </P> <P> I tend toward the second view. Theater audiences in the 1980s can still process  a long narrative, if it's well told. A longer narrative than ever, in fact.  Look at "Nicholas Nickleby" and "The Mahabharata."  </P> <P> But we are impatient with filler. We don't like being told everything twice.  Scenes that spend a lot of time explaining themselves begin to seem labored and  old-fashioned.  </P> <P> Oddly, we are perfectly happy with the laconic small-town characters of Horton  Foote, who tend not to say anything when they don't have anything to say -- and  sometimes when they do. That strikes us as true to life. A well-observed  silence in a play like "The Widow Claire" can speak volumes.  </P> <P> And we're happy to listen to August Wilson's characters as they tip their  chairs back after supper and start telling stories. Language here generates its  own voltage, as in Shakespeare. We can still listen to him, too.  </P> <P> It's the good gray playwrights who have to worry, the ones who see no problem  with a line like the dreaded "We've got to have a talk." Click!  </P> <P> Bill Cain's "Stand-up Tragedy" at the Mark Taper Forum (through June 25) is  aware of all this. It is not an avant-garde play. It has a beginning, a middle  and an end. It has characters you care about. It has ideas. It is written, not  shot from a laser-gun.  </P> <P> But it's quick. Rather than being written for the slowest person in the room,  it presumes that he no longer exists -- that today's viewer not only gets the  picture right away, but can process two images at once.  </P> <P> It is actually telling a rather old-fashioned story, the one about the  idealistic young teacher who comes to a slum high school and vows that he's  going to make a difference (Jack Coleman).  </P> <P> His adversaries include the case-hardened principal who has seen these hotdogs  come and go (this being a Catholic school, the principal is a priest -- Vaughn  Armstrong). His fellow teachers include an anal-retentive type who is just  putting in his time (John C. Cooke) and an outrageous pragmatist whose methods  include letting his kids cheat (Dan Gerrity.)  </P> <P> The student our hero most wants to reach is a quiet youth with a flair for art,  an obsession with superheroes and an addiction to his sick, destructive family  (Michael DeLorenzo.) If only, if only he could be sprung from that grim  apartment. This kid is college material!  </P> <P> You have seen the movie, yes? You have even seen the TV series. So has  everybody at Nativity Mission School. They are not interested in being a  learning experience for our hero. They know how things work in real life. To  rescue a kid from a "bad home situation" in this neighborhood (the Lower East  Side) is to run the risk of throwing him into a worse situation.  </P> <P> It also may put his rescuer at risk. You don't get half-way get involved with a  kid's life and then go home to the suburbs for Christmas vacation, not without  consequences. Forces have been set into motion -- and at a Catholic school in  the barrio, the idea of "forces" is not an abstraction. They believe in evil at  Nativity Mission, and some of them -- or their families -- are hooked on it.  </P> <P> This begins not to sound like "Room 222." Playwright Cain knows this school --  he has taught there -- and he remembers how confusing and perverse things can  get around spring break.  </P> <P> How to convey the welter of life at Nativity Mission, the heart-lifting moments  and the heart-stopping ones? How to convey the eternal tension and the odd  cameraderie between the kids and the faculty at an all-male school, not unlike  the strains of boot camp? How to convey the hilarity of a faculty-student  basketball game, and the despair of yet another 7 a.m. funeral? How to get in  the neighborhood in as well?  </P> <P> A movie could flick from image to image, and the viewer could put it all  together. It's not so easy to do these things in a play. On the stage, images  have weight -- they're usually attached to actors. "Stand-up Tragedy" doesn't  see that as a problem. If your actors know how to break-dance, and chant rap  poetry, and dribble a basketball, and do raunchy jokes, and jump from role to  role at the pop of the director's fingers (Ron Link is the director) -- then  the show can be set at whatever tempo it needs.  </P> <P> When first performed at Taper, Too, "Stand-up Tragedy" may have been set too  high. On the mainstage, it's as fast as a basketball game, without blur. There  are silences, too, after something has been said that won't be taken back.  Discussions at Nativity Mission become confrontations without even trying, some  of the best ones being between Armstrong and Coleman. Watch for the moment  where the old man fakes the new man out with intimacy -- so to speak -- and  drives by him for an easy layup. Moral: "Affection is coercion."  </P> <P> But the play's younger actors, in their torn Levi's, convey the fact that this  isn't a playground game. They are stuck in this neighborhood forever, and  they've got to find a way to deal with that, whether it's in the syllabus or  not. Ray Oriel is particularly strong as a kid whom the system dumps on his  rear just as he's about to graduate. Does he whimper? No, he just gives the  faculty a look and goes off. To what kind of life?  </P> <P> Anthony Barrile, Marcus Chong, Marvin Columbus and Lance Slaughter are also  part of the gang, which functions as a sort of double-time Greek chorus,  specializing in the baddest sort of rap lyrics. Like everyone and everything  else in "Stand-up Tragedy" they do six things at once, with perfect  articulation.  </P> <P> Things do start to drag toward the end of the evening, and the climax isn't  pointless enough -- not as representative of the "ecology of evil" as it could  have been. (This is one of the play's chief concerns and another reason not to  see it as just another "Blackboard Jungle." Social engineering as currently  practiced wouldn't help these kids a bit.)  </P> <P> Even with this energy lag, "Stand-up Tragedy" is the most propulsive and  exhilarating show in town, and one of the most thought-provoking. Your hand  won't stray to the remote control.  </P></p>

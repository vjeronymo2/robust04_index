			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLY'S PIED PIPER ;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL COACH FRED CUCCIA EFFECTS TURNAROUND WITH PERSUASIVE SALES PITCH,  COMPASSIONATE TOUCH  </P> <P> It is difficult to miss the biggest symbol of the turnaround in the Poly High  football program. Eddie Moreno, a 6-foot-2, 260-pound senior tackle, has helped  improve the Parrots as much as the program has transformed him.  </P> <P> A year ago, the Parrots stumbled to a 1-8-1 record as part of a legacy of  futility.  </P> <P> A year later, Poly has forged a 10-3 record and takes a four-game winning  streak into the City Section 3-A Division championship game. Poly will play  Lincoln (9-3-1) at 7:30 tonight at East Los Angeles College.  </P> <P> But Poly's turnabout pales in comparison to the transformation of Moreno. Two  years ago, he was an admitted campus bully who found himself inside a juvenile  detention center.  </P> <P> He already had been shot three times and figured more bullets were headed his  way.  </P> <P> Now, he's an All-East Valley League selection and so popular on campus that the  student body voted him homecoming king last month.  </P> <P> Moreno says it's easy to explain his new life style. Like many at the Sun  Valley school, he's become a member of the Fred Cuccia fan club. Cuccia, 45,  has worked his rebuilding magic at his third high school in the past decade as  the second-year Poly football coach and has enjoyed the Parrots' resurgence so  much he might even stick around for a while.  </P> <P> "They like me and I like them," Cuccia said of the players. "It's like a family  and I'm the big daddy -- I'm the old man. They know I care about them. I chew  their butts out and I holler at them, but we always try to do everything in a  positive manner."  </P> <P> The recruitment of Moreno attests to the Cuccia method. He spotted Moreno on  campus and asked him to try out for the football team.  </P> <P> "It was the first time anybody ever asked me to do something," Moreno said.  "Usually everyone is always telling me what to do."  </P> <P> He soon joined the team even though he was a stranger to football. He tried out  at linebacker but soon moved to the offensive line where he has emerged as one  of the area's top players.  </P> <P> Moreno is just one of the positive stories associated with the team. Glance  down the roster and more abound, even among the assistant coaches. Bob Mesa,  who works with the offensive line, graduated from Poly in 1975. He has been an  assistant for 12 seasons under four different head coaches. No coach has taught  him more than he's learned under Cuccia.  </P> <P> "The way this program is run now, it's like night and day," Mesa said.  "(Cuccia) has brought back pride. I finally know what a program is.  </P> <P> "I've learned more in the last two years with him than I've learned maybe in  the last six, seven years. I remember going home and calling my father on the  phone and saying, 'You know what, dad? We got a program at Poly High."  </P> <P> Donald Senegal, who coaches the running backs and graduated from Poly in 1987,  echoes Mesa's sentiments.  </P> <P> "If I could have played for him, I'd probably be in college (playing) somewhere  right now," Senegal said.  </P> <P> Cuccia has always loved a good challenge but the Poly program gave new meaning  to the word. He was hired just days before practice started in 1989, inheriting  a team that had won just four games the previous two seasons.  </P> <P> In addition, Poly did not have a strong football tradition, qualifying for the  playoffs just five times in 33 years and advancing to the championship game  just once.  </P> <P> "I guess I like the challenge . . . the challenge of building a program where  no one thinks it can be good," Cuccia said.  </P> <P> He's been there before. He turned around programs at Hoover and South Pasadena  in the 1980s, but moved on once the task was complete.  </P> <P> At Hoover, he took over a team that scored just seven points in league play in  1982. Three years later, the Tornadoes posted an 8-2 record and were ranked  second in the Coastal Conference at the end of the regular season. They were  bumped from the playoffs after they were forced to forfeit games for use of an  ineligible player.  </P> <P> South Pasadena came calling after the 1985 season. He inherited a team that had  won just one of 19 games in two previous years and led the Tigers to a 7-2-1  record in his second season. Cuccia was unhappy with the administration at  South Pasadena and when the athletic director at California High in Northern  California called to offer him a job, he and his family packed their bags.  </P> <P> But after his first football season at California, Cuccia and his wife Carol  decided to return to Southern California for economic reasons.  </P> <P> Thanks to a friend of Cuccia's wife who had coached at Poly, word reached Poly  Athletic Director George Tideback that Cuccia was available. Tideback, 61, was  desperate to replace Kevin Kennedy, who resigned as coach four days before the  start of practice in '89.  </P> <P> "He's the best thing that ever happened to Poly," Tideback said. "Somebody up  there in the big sky was looking down on us when he came to Poly."  </P> <P> Tideback claims the phone hasn't stopped ringing during Poly's run through the  playoffs as alumni and members of the community call with congratulations for  the Parrots and their coach.  </P> <P> Cuccia squirms when asked about the accolades, deflecting credit to the  players. He claims his formula for success is simple: provide an atmosphere of  mutual respect and let the players have fun.  </P> <P> "I just gave them the opportunity to be successful and they took advantage of  it," he said. "My job is to make sure they have the best coaches to coach them  and to get them prepared to play the best game they can possibly play. And if I  don't do that, I've failed."  </P> <P> The reason Poly hadn't been a winner in recent years was simple, Cuccia said.  </P> <P> "They didn't know how to win. They didn't know how to practice. You can  practice to practice, or you can practice to win," he said.  </P> <P> Poly finished 1-8-1 in Cuccia's first year and some people were skeptical. But  those close to the program knew that there was something different about this  coach.  </P> <P> "There is something about the guy," Tideback said. "You can see it in the kids.  The guy is just a winner."  </P> <P> After the first season, Cuccia really went to work. He ordered new uniforms and  changed the colors from royal blue and yellow to Air Force-blue and Notre  Dame-gold.  </P> <P> "I wanted different uniforms for a different attitude," Cuccia explained. "I  wanted something that told the kids we were going to be a different team  overall."  </P> <P> Cuccia also implemented a year-round weight program, a spring and summer  conditioning regimen, and a mandatory study hall. He brought in defensive  coordinator Hank Swanson to complement assistant coaches Mesa and Senegal.  </P> <P> Having upgraded the coaching staff, he then turned his attention to the  players. He knew he needed better ones and his search brought him to the  baseball diamond. Poly has been a traditional City power under Coach Jerry  Cord.  </P> <P> Cuccia actively pursued the baseball players and attended nearly every Poly  home game. He then enlisted the help of such two-sport players as Jonathan  Campbell, a running back and defensive back, and wide receiver Marlon McKinney,  who pitched the football program to their baseball teammates.  </P> <P> The formula worked: Eight baseball players will suit up tonight for the City  championship game. Catcher Steve Chavez, first-baseman Francisco Flores and  utility-player Raul Torres have made the most dramatic impacts on the team.  </P> <P> Torres, a senior and second-team All-Valley defensive back, leads the area with  nine interceptions and has become a genuine college prospect after just one  season of football. Flores is a 6-4, 235-pound offensive lineman who earned  All-East Valley League recognition this year as a junior and projects as one of  the top college prospects in the area for next season.  </P> <P> Chavez, a starting linebacker, was a hard sell. His family and baseball  teammates objected to his interest in football, but Cuccia's sales pitch was  more persuasive.  </P> <P> "He builds something inside you. He builds character," Chavez said.  </P> <P> Cord has been forced to start his winter-league baseball season without some of  his best players. Still, he remains a Poly football fan.  </P> <P> "No one has ever gone after them," Cord said of his players. "In the last six  or seven years, no one has been a motivator around here to go get kids. Fred is  the first one in a long time."  </P> <P> The numbers bear that out. The turnout for football nearly doubled from 57 to  107 between his first and second season.  </P> <P> Once recruited, players become loyal because of Cuccia's sense of fairness and  compassion. Moreno, a burly player with a quick wit and a short temper, again  is a prime example.  </P> <P> In a game early last season, Moreno grew frustrated by an overly aggressive  opponent and showed his anger by twisting the player's helmet off and hitting  him over the head with it.  </P> <P> Moreno was thrown out of the game, but thought he'd suffer a bigger punishment  from Cuccia. His reception on the sideline caught him by surprise.  </P> <P> "He hugged me and said, 'It's all right,' and then he sat me down and that was  it," Moreno recalled. "I mean, he hugged me. It was the first time a guy ever  hugged me."  </P> <P> No wonder, Cuccia has little trouble putting tonight's game in perspective.  </P> <P> "We've come so far -- we're a Cinderella team," Cuccia said with asmile.  </P> <P> "If we lose, hey, a lot of people's hearts will be broken. But I think you have  to reflect back on the season." Cuccia, who has two kids of his own, takes  pride in building not only football players, but disciplined, responsible  citizens.  </P> <P> "If we can accomplish that, we'll be successful," he said. "Not only on the  football field, but in the classroom and beyond school."  </P></p>

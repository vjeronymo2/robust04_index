			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 8 Apr (MENA)--Chinese Ambassador in Cairo  Yang Fuchang has said his country's government and people  welcome President Husni Mubarak's forthcoming visit to Beijing.  In an interview with MENA, he said President Mubarak is an old  friend of China and that this visit will be his sixth trip to  China. He noted that every time he visits China, President  Mubarak gives new momentum to the good traditional bilateral  relations. [passage omitted]    The Chinese ambassador stressed the need to honor Security  Council Resolutions 242 and 338 on the Middle East and hoped  that the Jerusalem issue will be resolved through negotiations.    On lifting the economic sanctions on Iraq, he explained that  they were imposed under particular circumstances but that if we  now look at the situation objectively, we will find that Iraq  has responded to the Council's recent resolutions. So, he said,  sanctions on the humanitarian level must be lifted, primarily to  secure food and medicine for the Iraqi people and, as the  implementation of the resolutions continues, other sanctions can  be lifted, something that is currently being discussed at the  Security Council.    On China's arms sales to Pakistan, he said the purchase and  sale of arms is something normal in relations between states.  The United States, France, and other big powers also sell arms.  He added: Our selling arms to Pakistan does not mean we  support one party at the expense of another. And it does not  mean there is intervention in other countries' internal affairs,  so the situation in the region is not aggravated.    Commenting on the Korean issue, the Chinese ambassador said  his country believes that the best way to solve the problem is  through negotiations between the United States and Korea,  between Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency, and  between the two Koreas. He said China stresses that the Korean  Peninsula should be free of nuclear weapons and it believes the  imposition of sanctions does not help to solve problems but  rather complicates them.

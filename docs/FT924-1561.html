			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Medicine replaces champagne for Ford of Europe: The restructuring in the wake of losses and falling demand FORD of Europe executives had planned to spend New Year's Eve at the Hilton in London's Park Lane celebrating, to the sound of popping champagne corks, the launch of the new Ford Mondeo, the car that replaces the Ford Sierra next spring. Now the New Year's Eve ball has been cancelled, and the champagne has been shelved. Instead Ford's European operations are being forced to swallow more bitter medicine with heavy job cuts and further restructuring measures, as the US carmaker seeks to staunch its renewed losses in Europe. After a record loss last year of Dollars 1.079bn (Pounds 685m) on its European automotive operations, including Jaguar, Ford believed it had begun to turn the corner. 'In April I thought the horizon was bright and sunny,' said Mr Bill Fike, president of Ford of Europe, but that was before demand began to weaken in Germany, Italy and Spain and when UK recovery appeared closer. The operations had returned to the black in the first half of 1992 and Ford of Europe had optimistically launched its 'Drive for Leadership' campaign with the two aims of gaining 'world class product delivery and a fully competitive cost structure'. The return to profit in the first half has proved a false dawn, however, and Ford's European operations, once one of the group's best profit earners worldwide, face another round of restructuring. The announcement yesterday that Ford of Europe is to cut more than 10,000 jobs by the end of 1993 means the workforce of its European automotive operations (excluding Jaguar) will have shrunk 28 per cent to 83,000 in three years, from 115,000 in 1990. The need to cut costs became so acute that Ford was forced to cancel its European automotive operations management meeting late last month 'because of the continuing serious deterioration in our financial performance and the absolute need, therefore, to avoid discretionary expense', according to Mr Lindsey Halstead, Ford of Europe chairman. In many respects Ford's productivity and cost base in Europe were 'uncompetitive', said Mr Halstead, who retires at the end of the month. He will be replaced by Mr Jacques Nasser, the 44-year-old former chief executive of Ford of Australia. Mr Nasser faces an uncomfortable introduction to Europe. New car sales in western Europe are forecast to fall 3.5 per cent next year, the second successive annual decline. And the industry is facing the growing spectre of overcapacity as new plants, planned in the era of record sales at the end of the 1980s, are brought on stream. At the same time competition is intensifying. Europe has become the main battleground of the car industry in the 1990s, as the leading Japanese carmakers establish their first car plants inside the world's biggest market. Ironically Ford's announcement of job cuts coincided with Toyota, Japan's leading carmaker, opening its new Pounds 700m, 200,000-a-year car assembly plant in the UK. Ford is not alone in facing growing woes in Europe  -Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, admitted yesterday that it had slumped into loss in the fourth quarter. However, Ford has lost ground in Europe where it has slipped from leadership of the car market in 1984 to fifth place this year. More damaging is the loss of profitability. Ford's production planning in Europe for 1992 has proved painfully over-optimistic and it has had to resort to far-reaching short-time working since the summer in order to cut excess stocks and bring supply into line with falling demand. In September Ford calculated it would need, in the UK alone, 150-160 downshifts at its Halewood and Dagenham car assembly plants. This number has now increased to 210 downshifts in 1992, and there have also been increasing production shutdowns at the Cologne, Saarlouis, Genk and Valencia plants. Ford of Europe is now attacking the continuing losses with emergency measures announced yesterday, which include: the elimination of more than 10,000 jobs across Europe; the reduction of capacity at the four car assembly plants in the UK and Germany; the transfer of several in-house components manufacturing operations, such as seat making, to outside suppliers; the removal of further layers of management; a cut in corporate bureaucracy and the elimination of dup-lication between Ford's national sales companies and its European headquarters in the UK. 'We are trying to concentrate on the core business, the design, manufacture and sale of cars and light commercial vehicles,' says Mr Fike. 'The engineering of components for systems and the manufacture of some non-core items will be eliminated.' The biggest move in this direction is Ford's decision to transfer seat making for its next generation Fiesta and Escort/Orion cars to a new joint venture to be formed by Johnson Controls of the US and Bertrand Faure of France, two specialist automotive seat makers. Ford will in future be supplied on a just-in-time basis from satellite plants established by the component makers. Ford's US-based Automotive Components Group is also examining the establishment of a plant in Poland or Czechoslovakia to make seat covers to supply the new joint venture. Mr Fike says Ford of Europe is now determined to 'eliminate non-essential work and reduce bureaucratic controls and layers of management'. In the engineering activities, management layers are being cut from seven to five, and in manufacturing from six to five. Yesterday's job cuts bite heavily into the salaried workforce. 'We are trying to cut duplication between national sales companies and staff activities. There will be fewer checks and balances than historically. We will run our business with fewer pieces of paper and much more with numbers.' While the latest cuts go deep Mr Fike insists that the reductions are being made 'surgically. This is not a lawnmower'. He promises that new product programmes will not be hit. 'But we must make cash to pay for future programmes, and if that means our share must drop somewhat, then it will drop.' Dollars 8bn bill, Page 25; Volkswagen and Citroen, Page 26</p>

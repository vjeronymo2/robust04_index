We understand that this is a current project for the Telecommunication Industry Association's (TIA's) TR&hyph;41 Committee, whom we anticipate will provide appropriate recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The types of plug-jack connectors to be used for ISDN services engendered comment. Ameritech says that the ANSI standard for BRA proposes an eight-position non-keyed jack in which two positions are for the tip and ring connections to the service itself, and the remaining six positions are reserved. Ameritech offers ISDN BRA via the standard RJ11C jack which provides connections for two wires, although the jack itself can accommodate up to six wires. Most ISDN compatible equipment can accommodate such a connection, so there is no need to require the eight-position jack, states Ameritech, who believes that manufacturers who ``build-to'' the eight-position interface could provide connection to the type RJ11C through a simple six-position to eight-position double-male adapter. US West recommends that the jack type SJA&hyph;11 (8-position) proposed by ECSA (the Exchange Carriers Standards Association's T1E1 Technical Subcommittee) be approved by the Commission's tariff implementation procedure. We solicit comments on these proposals for ISDN BRA and PRA interface connectors and for suitable connectors for the Public Switched Digital Services (PSDS). It would be helpful also if interested parties would, as requested in n.7 of the NPRM, offer comments on the recommendations of ECSA for network connectors for ISDN BRA and PSDS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Public Notice of Ameritech's petition produced two comments and two reply comments. Ameritech petitions for amendment of part 68 to include terminal equipment that connects to PSDS. We request comment. As the result of joint comments by Mountain States Telephone Company, Northwestern Bell Telephone Company and Pacific Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, equipment standards for a four-wire 56 Kbps service are also included for comment. It is important to recognize that all three technologies (56 and 64 Kbps time compression and four-wire 56 Kbps switched services) are call-compatible, and a performance and compatibility standard for the three has recently been published by TIA. Not discussed in the pleadings is the fact that a new technology known as ``inverse multiplexing'' or ``bandwidth on demand'' is being used which permits customers to utilize PSDS and ISDN BRA technologies to order wider bandwidths in multiples of 56 or 64 Kbps. Commenters should address whether inverse multiplexing utilizing such channels and other bandwidths require consideration under part 68. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. In outlining the intent of newly-proposed part 68, the Commission stated in its First Supplemental Notice, released April 3, 1973, 40 F.C.C.2d 315, 316 (1973) that ``[r]egistration would constitute authorization for the equipment to be directly connected to the switched telephone network. However, in appropriate cases, registration could be revoked.'' But the rules do not include part 68 equipment authorization revocation procedures which can be relied upon; therefore, we propose adoption of rules which detail the circumstances under which equipment registrations may be revoked and which define equipment revocation procedures, including automatic denial of equipment authorization of the same product for a period of six months from the date of revocation. The proposed revocation procedure tracks closely established Commission procedure for Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL) for assessment of a monetary penalty (47 CFR 1.80 and 1.89). Revocation of an equipment registration may be imposed in addition to or in lieu of an amount in forfeiture pursuant to section 1.80 of the rules. Therefore, we propose that a Notice of Intent to Revoke may be served concurrently with and as part of a NAL. In the case of joint NAL and Intent to Revoke, &sect;1.80 of the rules would govern all procedural issues. In those cases where a material dispute of fact is involved, the Commission would, if appropriate, designate the proceeding for hearing before an administrative law judge. The registration revocation procedure is expected to greatly enhance our ability to enforce part 68, as well as the Telecommunications Trade Act of 1988 which requires that all telecommunications equipment imported into the United States meet the requirements of the Commission's rules and regulations. We seek comment on these procedures which are set forth in detail in the NPRM and proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No significant impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Ex Parte Presentations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This is a nonrestricted notice and comment rulemaking proceeding.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ex Parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  presentations are permitted, except during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided they are disclosed as required by Commission rules.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia/Italy: Ciampi Rejects Bosnia </F> Serb Protest"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 12 -- Premier Carlo Azeglio  Ciampi said today he was aware of only one protest from Bosnian  Serbs over the use of the Aviano Air Base in northern Italy for  NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions near the Muslim  enclave of Gorazde and added, "but certainly it is a protest  which Italy can only reject."    Talking to representatives of the foreign press gathered in  the premier's office, Ciampi said, "Events in Bosnia in these  days can do nothing other than confirm Italy in its position  pursued up to the present, which provides for joint action to  apply maximum pressure to bring peace to Bosnia and, more in  general, to all ex-Yugoslavia."    After noting that the deployment of NATO warplanes at air  bases on Italian territory represents the nation's greater  contribution to this effort, the head of government said Italy  provided this assistance "with an awareness of the importance,  and also the risks, connected to certain positions and can only  calmly maintain this position."    Earlier today, the Italian press reported that the Bosnian  Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, had threatened to make Italy "pay  dearly for its complicity in the attack" with reference to the  second raid carried out Monday by NATO planes flying out of the  Aviano base.</p>

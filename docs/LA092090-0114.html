			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> DYAL IS HAMSTRUNG FOR FOUR WEEKS  </P> <P> The Raiders placed tight end Mike Dyal on four-week injured reserve with a  hamstring injury. Dyal was injured in Sunday's 17-13 victory over the Seahawks  in Seattle.  </P> <P> To replace Dyal, the team signed free agent tight end Andy Parker, who played  four years with the Raiders until signing with the San Diego Chargers as a Plan  B free agent in 1989.  </P> <P> So, who replaces defensive end Howie Long, out six weeks with a broken toe? No  one, really, but the Raiders are first going to give Mike Wise the chance. Mike  Charles and Bill Pickel may also play some in Long's spot.  </P> <P> Donald Evans, the Rams' first draft choice in 1987, will be starting at right  defensive end for the Pittsburgh Steelers Sunday against the Raiders at the  Coliseum. Evans was released by the Rams before the 1989 season. He was signed  by the Philadelphia Eagles and was later released, before catching on with  Pittsburgh. He has one sack this season, one more than is career total with the  Rams. CHRIS DUFRESNE  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CROW, SOCKERS AGREE ON 1-YEAR DEAL  </P> <P> Kevin Crow became the fourth member of the Sockers' 1989-90 championship team  who will return for '90-91 when he signed a one-year contract Tuesday.  </P> <P> Crow, selected the Major Soccer League's defensive player of the year an  unprecedented three times, joined Branko Segota, Victor Nogueira and Paul  Wright as players under contract for next season.  </P> <P> In signing a one-year deal for $50,000, Crow is taking a $10,000 cut in pay.  But the majority of the players in the MSL are taking pay cuts because of the  league's reduced salary cap of $630,000, which has made nearly every player a  free agent.  </P> <P> Crow is a former San Diego State star and the Sockers' all-time leader in games  played, having joined the team in 1983 as a second-round draft choice.  Remaining in San Diego, he said, was the primary reason for his re-signing.  </P> <P> "My home is San Diego. This is where my wife and I have decided we're going to  settle down, and I don't see any reason to leave," Crow said. "As long as the  Sockers are here, I'm healthy and still got the energy and desire to go out and  win, I'll be here. That's basically the reason."  </P> <P> Sockers' Coach Ron Newman was especially pleased to have Crow back because  defenders George Fernandez and Ralph Black have left in recent weeks.  </P> <P> Waad Hirmez and Brian Quinn are among other Sockers who have yet to re-sign.  Newman said Quinn is expected to return. Hirmez is unhappy with the team's  latest offer to him, $12,000 less than he made last year.  </P></p>

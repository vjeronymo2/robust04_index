			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Auditors not liable for losses BERG SONS AND CO LTD AND OTHERS v ADAMS AND OTHERS Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hobhouse: June 19 1992 AUDITORS who are at fault in failing to qualify their certification of a company's accounts for uncertainty are not liable to the company for subsequent loss if it did not rely on the accounts and was not misled by them in that the information contained in them was provided without intent to defraud by the person who was in effect sole proprietor of the company and was its directing mind and will. And certification alone gives rise to no duty of care towards a lender who may rely on the accounts, in that their statutory purpose is confined to protecting the company and informing shareholders, and does not extend to other persons. Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when dismissing claims by Berg Sons &amp; Co Ltd and Union Discount Co (London) plc against Berg's auditors, Deardon Farrow. HIS LORDSHIP said that on May 21 1985 an order was made for the winding up of Berg on the petition of Union Discount, a creditor. Berg was insolvent. It was heavily indebted to various banks and discount houses. A liquidator was appointed. In the present proceedings Berg alleged breaches of contractual and tortious duties owed to it by its auditors, as a result of which it allegedly lost some Pounds 13m. Union Discount alleged breach of a tortious duty of care by the auditors, and claimed in respect of the dishonour of four bills of exchange drawn by Berg, three of them on a company called Esal Commodities Ltd. The allegations related to an unqualified certificate signed by the auditors for Berg's accounts for year ending March 31 1982. The criticisms were that the accounts should have shown a turnover of only Pounds 2.19m not Pounds 23.69m; and secondly, that bills for Pounds 2.39m (the 'Gimco' bills) included as 'bills receivable' should have been treated as irrecoverable. The audit report, addressed to 'the members' of Berg, was signed on October 8 1982. The auditors' certificate stated: 'In our opinion the accounts give a true and fair view of the state of affairs at March 31 1982.' Berg's directing mind and will was that of a Mr Golechha who was in effect sole proprietor. His knowledge was the company's knowledge. In addressing their certificate to members, the auditors were for practical purposes addressing it to Mr Golechha alone. When the auditors received instructions to carry out the statutory audit it was reasonably foreseeable and foreseen by them that Berg would make use of the accounts in its dealings with bankers. It was not foreseen, nor was it reasonably foreseeable, that the audited accounts would be the sole information on which a bank or discount house would rely in assessing Berg's creditworthiness. Nor was it reasonably foreseeable that failure to qualify the certificate would cause loss or damage to Berg. The auditors carried out a specific investigation of the Gimco bills. With regard to recoverability they had no more than the assurance of Gimco, an Abu Dhabi entity, that the bills would be honoured 'within three to four months or earlier when able' and an unsupported statement by Mr Golechha that he believed Gimco would pay. They had effectively no verification of recoverability. The auditors should have said 'bills receivable include bills . . . payable by an overseas debtor the creditworthiness of whom it has not been possible to verify', and 'subject to satisfactory recovery of the monies, in our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view'. Had the auditors refused to sign an unqualified certificate, on the evidence the possibility was that the effect on Berg's affairs would have been insignificant. Mr Golechha's business activities depended very much on his own personality, his personal relations with the relevant bank managers, and the banks' assessment of his business standing. The accounts were not critical. They did not provide any basis for extending substantial credit to Berg. The reasons for Berg's ultimate failure was Esal's failure and Berg's unsuccessful commodity dealing in the year ending March 1984. The cause of Union Discount's failure to recover on the bills was Esal's and Berg's failure. In Caparo (1990) 2 AC 630,632 Lord Oliver said the auditor's function was to protect the company from the consequences of undetected errors or wrongdoing, and to provide shareholders with reliable intelligence as to the conduct of its affairs. The decision was that it was not part of the purpose of a statutory audit to assist even shareholders to take investment decisions in relation to the company. It followed from the decision on the restricted purpose of the statutory audit that there was also a restriction on the scope of the duty of care that arose simply from carrying it out. The duty was owed to the company itself, normally in contract. The duty, although owed to other persons falling within the scope of the statutory purpose, was in effect equivalent to the duty owed to the company itself. Union Discount did not fall within the relevant class of persons. The purpose of the statutory audit was to provide a mechanism to enable those with a proprietary interest in the company or concerned with its management or control to have access to accurate financial information about the company. Provided those persons had that information, the statutory purpose was exhausted. Berg had based its case not on lack of information on Mr Golechha's part but on the opportunity the auditor's certificate was said to have given for the company to continue to carry on business and to borrow money from third parties. Such matters did not fall within the scope of the duty of the statutory auditor. Berg sought to argue that the fact that Mr Golechha was fully informed and in no way misled by the certificate was irrelevant since he was, it said, acting contrary to Berg's interests, and his knowledge should not be attributed to the company. However one identified the company, every physical manifestation of Berg was Mr Golechha himself. Any company, if it was to allege it was fraudulently misled, must be able to point to some natural person who was misled by the fraud. That Berg could not do. It was alleged by Union Discount that a duty of care was owed to it by the auditors when they certified the audit. It said they knew it was extending credit to Berg, and it was foreseeable that it would be sent copies of the accounts and would rely on them in deciding whether to continue to extend credit. Union Discount did not prove that the purpose of the audit was other than to satisfy the statutory requirements. In Al Saudi Banque (1991) Ch 313 Mr Justice Millett held that foreseeability that a lender might rely on audited accounts was not, without more, enough to establish the duty of care. His decision was approved by the House of Lords in Caparo. Caparo showed there must be a specific relationship between the function which the defendant was requested to perform, and the transaction in relation to which the plaintiff said he had relied on proper performance. The transactions by which Union Discount alleged it suffered loss were remote from certification of the accounts. It could not establish the existence of any duty of care owed to it in relation to the audit. Berg's claim failed because the company was not misled and did not rely on the certificate, and because the facts did not raise a situation where Mr Golechha was acting in fraud of the company or its creditors. Union Discount's claim failed because it had failed to establish any duty of care. Both claims also failed for want of proof of causation. For Berg and Union Discount: Stanley Burnton QC and Thomas Ivory (Hopkins, Wood). For the auditors: Roger Toulson QC and Charles Douthwaite (Reynolds Porter Chamberlain).</p>

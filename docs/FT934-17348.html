			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Sabena adapting to deregulation Sir, Contrary to your report, 'Belgium to seek air passenger quotas' (September 27), and your leader, 'Clouds in EC open skies' (September 28), Sabena is not seeking additional cash injection, nor fresh state aid. Sabena has dramatically improved productivity in the past two years thanks to a reduction in the workforce of 25 per cent, increased efficiency and flexibility - resulting in a gain of 10 per cent in overall production - and salary reductions for staff in Belgium of up to 17 per cent. A number of other measures have also been taken, which, when fully implemented, will result in savings of more than Pounds 100m. Sabena was one of the few airlines in the world to make a profit in fiscal year 1992-93. Like any other airline, Sabena is having to adapt to deregulation of the European airline industry and the price wars resulting from over capacity. Our chairman, Mr Pierre Godfroid, has proposed to the EC's committee of 'wise men' that EC funds should be made available to the whole of the European airline industry to enable it progressively to adapt capacity to demand as it did for the European steel and textile industries two years ago. In the meantime, Sabena will continue to seek to improve its financial position by aggressive commercial policies. E de Nil, general manager for UK &amp; Ireland, Sabena, 35 Rue Cardinal Mercier, Brussels, Belgium</p>

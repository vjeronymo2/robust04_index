			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE  </P> <P> With This Rink, I Thee Wed . . .  </P> <P> As a rule, I don't do windows or weddings.  </P> <P> I've declined possible items recently on a hockey goalie marrying his beloved  on the ice at the San Diego Ice Arena, and two hiker-lawyers from San Diego  exchanging vows atop Tahquitz Rock (Elev. 1,200 feet) near Idyllwild.  </P> <P> For future reference, here is my rule: I only do 50th wedding anniversaries  when husband and wife are both on roller skates, as they were on their Wedding  Day.  </P> <P> As such, I am obligated to report that James and Aleva Gantz of San Diego will  renew their vows tonight at Skateworld in Linda Vista, surrounded by kith and  kin (including seven skating grandchildren).  </P> <P> On Sept. 2, 1940, the Gantzes were married at the Pacific skating rink  downtown, with the entire wedding party on wheels.  </P> <P> It was a natural: Aleva (Cookie) was a "floor-lady" at the Pacific rink,  picking up skaters when they fell, blowing a whistle to maintain order. Jimmy  was just out of the Navy.  </P> <P> It was a roller-skate romance. The couple had met at the Mission Beach Roller  Rink.  </P> <P> It was roller-skating's heyday. The owner of the Pacific knew a media grabber  when he saw it; he hosted the wedding, attracted 700 customers and got a splash  in the newspapers.  </P> <P> Now it's half a century later, and Cookie is 69 years old, a retired computer  operator, and still teaching kids to skate. Jimmy is 72, a retired food  salesman.  </P> <P> The evening at Skateworld will include a demonstration of skating through the  ages.  </P> <P> The couple's son Larry, 49, a communications consultant in Arizona, will serve  as emcee. He was the 1957 California yo-yo champion, and so naturally he'll do  yo-yo tricks.  </P> <P> Skates or no, 50 years of marriage is a long time. Is there a link?  </P> <P> "I got a letter from the Roller Skating Assn.," says Cookie, "saying that this  proves that whoever rolls around together, stays together, or something like  that."  </P> <P> If anybody else has a better formula for ensuring wedded bliss, I've yet to  hear it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crime Stories  </P> <P> Here, there, everywhere.  </P> <P> * San Diego's crime rate is an issue in the race for governor.  </P> <P> Dianne Feinstein is blasting Pete Wilson by saying crime increased in San Diego  by 25% during his tenure as mayor, while it decreased by 27% in San Francisco  when she was mayor.  </P> <P> Wilson retorts that San Diego had the lowest crime rate of the nation's 10  biggest cities when he left, while San Francisco was fourth on the list when  Feinstein departed.  </P> <P> There, now do you feel safer?  </P> <P> * Rep. James Traficant (D-Ohio) is seeking a congressional hearing into the  war-crimes case of Arthur Rudolph, the German scientist who worked in San Diego  after World War II.  </P> <P> Traficant's House Resolution 404 is supported by a small group of San Diegans  who believe Rudolph is innocent and should have his naturalized U.S.  citizenship restored.  </P> <P> It is opposed by the national Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith, which  believes Rudolph is guilty and had ample opportunity to state his case during a  Department of Justice probe in 1983.  </P> <P> * The San Diego city attorney is renewing his periodic warning to City Council  members not to have discussions with developers with pending projects.  </P> <P> No tete-a-tetes, no private deals.  </P> <P> * North County bumper sticker: "Save Our Most Endangered Species. The Unborn."  </P> <P> * East County bumper sticker: "Pray for Me. I Drive Highway 94."  </P> <P> * Headline in the Lakeside-based Animal Press: "Cruelty-Free Products Now in  Fashion."  </P> <P> Gee, just when I was beginning to like the off-the-rack look.  </P></p>

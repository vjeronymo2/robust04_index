			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Dealing with a Welsh Pandora's box: Roland Adburgham reports on a turbulent year for the chairman of the WDA When the National Audit Office last week praised the Welsh Development Agency's programme of land reclamation Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, the agency's chairman, was visibly relieved that at last someone had said a kind word. He ruefully noted that in the turbulent 12 months since he took over as chairman on July 1 last year the media have almost invariably described the WDA as 'much-troubled' or 'scandal-ridden'. A Cardiff-born international businessman, he was aware at the time of his appointment by the Welsh secretary that the WDA 'had a very successful reputation and was the positive envy of much of the UK, and of similar development agencies overseas'. He also knew that there had been 'an auditing problem' and that a report by the Commons public accounts committee was imminent. Mr Rowe-Beddoe did not realise that what he called 'a Pandora's box' was about to open. The MPs' report on the 1990-91 accounts said standards at the agency had been 'well below' what parliament had a right to expect. It unleashed a series of damaging stories with the agency depicted as an example of the lack of accountability of quangos. Mr Rowe-Beddoe said: 'My immediate response to the public accounts committee report was that we would accept it in its entirety.' An external inquiry was set up and its recommendations adopted. Mr Philip Head, the chief executive, resigned. The chairman said that the problems shown by the report had been cured. But it remains his task to rebuild the agency's reputation, while proving that 'we are committed to maintaining the highest probity in the management of the taxpayers' funds in this agency'. Since he arrived - taking over from Dr Gwyn Jones, who headed the agency for five years - there have been new board members and senior managers have been recruited from outside. The agency itself is in the throes of being reshaped into a slimmer structure with a smaller head office in Cardiff and more staff in the regions. About 60 of the 400 employees are being made redundant, adding to staff demoralisation. The chairman described it as a 'painful time'. Mr Rowe-Beddoe was adamant that the reorganisation was in response to a changing business environment and not the PAC report. 'My own thinking would have been crystallised without any PAC frame in which to be operating - just from the natural consequences of going out and talking to our marketplace. 'I set out last year to visit as many parts of Wales as possible and meet with the people who really represented our customer base. A popular perception was that all the agency did was to market inward investment, whereas the reality is that a substantial majority of our budget (Pounds 170m) is spent in Wales. There were such comments as all roads appeared to begin and end in Cardiff, and the further away from the centre, the longer for any decision to be taken.' What was clear, he said, was that the agency's focus needed to be sharpened towards the delivery of services. Three domestic divisions were being created in the north, south and west, with more delegated authority. The agency's effectiveness, he said, had to be measured by the creation of jobs. Of the means to achieve that, 'inward investment is clearly a vitally important aspect of continuing economic growth'. He emphasised the amount of expansion by existing inward investors, with some Japanese companies re-investing five times or more. While land reclamation and urban renewal continued to be priorities, a shift of emphasis was to provide more support for indigenous companies. 'They have felt in the past that because they weren't Japanese or American they weren't getting attention. That is being rectified. The small and medium-size enterprises are our greatest potential strength for the future,' he said. The question remains however: how long will the WDA be haunted by the past? This month Mr Barry Hartop, appointed chief executive in March, notified the public accounts committee of apparently unauthorised redundancy payments in the 1980s. Mr Rowe-Beddoe did not dispute that further matters could come to light. 'But if you think we are spending our life in a witch-hunt, forget it. That isn't what we are doing,' he said. 'What we are committed to ensure is that the housekeeping of today is beyond reproach.' Mr Rowe-Beddoe denied being dispirited by the criticism. 'A few months ago I would probably have been dispirited. I think one's skin has grown a little thicker, and I realise very clearly the accountability of being in the public sector.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is proposing to amend Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 to require broker-dealers who choose to internalize or route orders to affiliated organizations to provide information about this policy parallel to the information that Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 requires them to provide concerning the routing of orders in return for payment for order flow. As defined in proposed Rule 10b&hyph;10(e)(12), internalized/affiliate order routing practices shall mean the execution of an order by a broker-dealer as principal, or the routing of an order by the broker-dealer to an affiliated broker-dealer or exchange member. Specifically, the amendment to Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3(a)(2) would require firms to disclose their policies for determining where to route customers' orders, absent specific instructions from customers, including whether orders are executed as principal, orders are routed to an affiliated broker-dealer, or to an unaffiliated broker-dealer or market center, including a description of the extent to which orders can be executed at prices superior to the NBBO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also is proposing to extend the confirmation and account statement valuation requirements to internalized/affiliate order flow practices. The Commission requests comment on this aspect of the proposed rule and the ability of broker-dealers to estimate the value of internalized/affiliate order flow. The Commission realizes that, as in the case of non-monetary payment for order flow, precision in this area may not be possible. Therefore, the Commission seeks the views of commenters as to whether the value of internalized order flow may be reasonably approximated by reference to the monetary amount per share that a broker-dealer could have received for such order flow from a competing market center, or by other methods, such as by measuring the difference between the spread received by a broker-dealer engaging in internalized/affiliate practices and the amount that the broker-dealer could have received for the order flow from another market center. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is concerned that to the extent that the value of monetary and non-monetary payment for order flow are quantified but the value of orders subject to internalized/affiliate practices are not, broker-dealers may be encouraged to engage in the latter practices to a greater degree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission invites commenters to address whether the proposed amendment would provide customers with meaningful information and would further the goals of section 11A of the Act. To the extent that they believe payment for order flow and internalized/affiliate practices should be treated differently for regulatory purposes, commenters are requested to indicate why concerns with respect to internalization are less compelling than those frequently associated with payment for order flow practices. Similarly, the Commission recognizes that the unequal regulatory treatment of internalized order flow may result in an increase in the amount of customer orders that are executed directly by a broker-dealer or its affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Order Routing Disclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3(a)(2) would require all broker-dealers to disclose their policies for determining where to route customer orders absent specific instructions from the customer, as well as a description of the extent to which orders may receive price improvement. If adopted, this disclosure currently required under Rule 11Ac1&hyph;2 would be required for all orders, regardless of whether the broker-dealer received payment for order flow or engaged in internalized/affiliate order routing practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that the proposed disclosure of order routing practices is consistent with its goal of providing customers with information to enhance their ability to evaluate the quality of execution received, and to make informed decisions with respect to the selection of broker-dealers. Under Rule 10b&hyph;10 of the Act, the Commission currently requires broker-dealers to disclose their capacity as agent or principal with respect to customer transactions, the agency commission received in connection with a particular transaction, and the source and amount of any additional remuneration to be received in connection with a transaction, among other matters. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As a result of these disclosures, investors have a better understanding of commissions and other costs associated with the execution of a transaction. The Commission believes that proposed Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3(a)(2) will further facilitate the ability of investors to understand order routing possibilities and the decisions made by broker-dealers in this regard. The Commission believes that such information would be of significant benefit to investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

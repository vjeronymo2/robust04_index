			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND RACING AT SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> AT 9, SUPER DIAMOND MAKES ANOTHER COMEBACK  </P> <P> Besides a good nickel cigar, what this country needs is a match race between  Super Diamond and King's Swan, a pair of resilient 9-year-old geldings that  have combined to win almost $3 million while running a continent apart.  </P> <P> Since King's Swan is a New York horse and Super Diamond does all of his running  in California, it is unlikely that they will ever meet. Meantime, Santa Anita  will be the setting for Super Diamond's return to the races today, when he  makes his first start in 10 months by running in the $100,000 San Carlos  Handicap.  </P> <P> Super Diamond, who has earned $1.3 million, more than $300,000 short of King's  Swan's total, has made more comebacks than Sugar Ray Leonard.  </P> <P> He had a wrenched ankle as a 2-year-old, he underwent arthroscopic surgery for  a bone chip on the same ankle 2 years later, he tore a ligament near the knee  as a 5-year-old and now he's trying to rebound from the most serious injury of  all, torn tissue in a tendon. And while you're asking, doctor, Super Diamond  bled from the lungs during a race at Santa Anita in 1986 and has run with  Lasix, a preventive, ever since.  </P> <P> Super Diamond has been around so long that he has run against Gato Del Sol, who  won the 1982 Kentucky Derby, and also against Alysheba and Ferdinand, the  respective winners of the Derby in 1986 and 1987. Some of the horses Super  Diamond has beaten in his 9 stake wins include Skywalker, winner of the Santa  Anita Derby and the Breeders' Cup Classic, and Precisionist, the country's  champion sprinter in 1985.  </P> <P> Old horses are not rarities, but horses like Super Diamond and King's Swan, who  can still compete in major stakes competition as 9-year-olds, are virtually  unheard of. John Henry was horse of the year in 1984 as a 9-year-old; Kelso,  5-time horse of the year in the 1960s, ran once as a 9- year-old, but his best  days were past; and Forego, winner of 3 straight horse-of-the-year titles in  the 1970s, was through after his 8-year-old season.  </P> <P> In the 50 years of the San Carlos, the oldest horses to win have been  8-year-olds -- Native Diver in 1967 and Autocrat in 1949.  </P> <P> Super Diamond would not appear to have much chance today at 7 furlongs against  On the Line, who has won 3 straight since returning from a long layoff of his  own, but trainer Eddie Gregson's veteran has won from off the farm before. In  1987, after 8 months of time off had healed the ligament damage, Super Diamond  won the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar in his first start back.  </P> <P> Because of his frailties, Super Diamond has run only 34 times, compared to 87  by King's Swan, and last year was typical. Super Diamond made up 7 lengths in  the stretch, losing by a nose to Epidaurus, in the San Carlos. Then, after  winning the San Pasqual Handicap and running third to Alysheba and Ferdinand in  the Santa Anita Handicap, his season -- and his career -- appeared to be over.  </P> <P> Examinations showed that Super Diamond had suffered a slight tearing of tissue  in a tendon in his right foreleg.  </P> <P> In September, Greg Ferraro, the veterinarian, examined the leg and was  optimistic about returning Super Diamond to training.  </P> <P> "If Greg had had any reservations at all, we wouldn't have done it," Gregson  said. "I don't want this horse eventually being retired and having a big, fat  leg the rest of his life. Whether he makes it or not, though, I would have to  say that this is the horse's last go-round."  </P> <P> Because Super Diamond doesn't work in company with other horses, Gregson  doesn't know whether he's lost a step or not. The 50-year-old Gregson, who won  the Kentucky Derby with Gato Del Sol in 1982, can't remember ever training a  horse this old, even when he had cheap claimers in the Bay Area in the early  1970s.  </P> <P> "Maybe I should go to Ron McAnally for advice," Gregson said. "With John Henry,  he did the greatest training job -- under all that pressure -- that I've ever  seen with an older horse.  </P> <P> "I know that bringing a horse back from a tendon injury is tough. This isn't a  classic case of a bowed tendon, because the tendon is straight. But I've had  about 30 horses that got tendon injuries, and maybe only 3 made it back. And I  can't remember the names of 2 of those."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Eddie Gregson is running Undercut, a European horse trying dirt for the first  time, in Sunday's $200,000 San Fernando, the first major stake of the Santa  Anita season. . . . The 12-horse field of 4-year-olds for the 1 1/8-mile San  Fernando lines up this way:  </P> <P> Mi Preferido, Chris McCarron riding, 123 pounds; Dynaformer, Angel Cordero,  126; Raykou, Sandy Hawley, 114; Triteamtri, Fernando Toro, 120; Perceive  Arrogance, Jose Santos, 120; Drouilly's Boy, Frank Olivares, 114; Star  Attitude, Ray Sibille, 114; Oraibi, Laffit Pincay, 120; Undercut, Corey Black,  114; Speedratic, Gary Stevens, 120; Claim, Aaron Gryder, 117; and Blade of the  Ball, Martin Pedroza, 114.  </P> <P> Toro, who flew to Chile to be with his ailing mother, is not likely to be back  in time to ride Sunday. . . . Candi's Gold, a multiple stakes winner under  Gregson, has been retired because of a back injury and will stand at stud in  Kentucky. . . . Gregson is one of many trainers upset with the condition of  Santa Anita's turf course, which has been used for only 3 races this season.  "The other day, there were so many divots being kicked in the air that it  looked like there were a hundred gophers out there," Gregson said. "It's  dangerous." Added trainer Charlie Whittingham: "They've tried to fix it by  adding a lot of sand and they've made a mistake. Do you ever see grass growing  on a beach?" . . . Tom Robbins, Santa Anita's racing secretary, says that the  track has been the victim of cold, rainy weather. "It's not the kind of weather  that dries a grass course," Robbins said. "We've had about 6 inches of rain  since mid-December and you can see frost on the grass some mornings."  </P></p>

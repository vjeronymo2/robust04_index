SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;94&hyph;01 and SR&hyph;ICC&hyph;94&hyph;01) as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by OCC and ICC, self-regulatory organizations (``SROs''). The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changes from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule changes will eliminate the ability of a clearing member of both OCC and ICC (``joint clearing member'') that has elected to cross-net its obligations arising from foreign currency options and futures to select ICC as its designated clearing organization (``DCO'') in settling such obligations. Under the proposed rule changes, only OCC will be able to act as the DCO in settling such obligations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, OCC and ICC have included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changes and discussed any comments they received on the proposed rule changes. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC and ICC have prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Cross-Netting Under Current Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under OCC and ICC rules, a joint clearing member may elect to cross-net its OCC exercise and assignment settlement obligations in OCC-cleared foreign currency options (``OCC obligations'') with its settlement obligations in ICC-cleared foreign currency futures (``ICC obligations'') on the same foreign currency. Cross-netting occurs when OCC obligations settle on a date that also is a delivery date for ICC obligations. Because such dates coincide only one day each month, cross-netting is performed only one day each month. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, a joint clearing member that has elected to settle by cross-netting may select either OCC or ICC as its DCO and will settle its cross-netted obligations with its DCO in accordance with the rules of the DCO. (OCC and ICC have virtually identical rules regarding the settlement of foreign currency obligations.) The DCO, in turn, performs its ordinary clearance and settlement activities and acts as agent for the opposite clearing organization in settling the cross-netted obligations. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a more detailed description of cross-netting, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24781 (August 6, 1987), 53 FR 30268 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;86&hyph;14]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agreement of one clearing organization to act as agent for the other is contained in the Mutual Agency Agreement for Foreign Currency Settlement (``Mutual Agency Agreement'') between OCC and ICC. The Mutual Agency Agreement sets forth the rights and obligations of OCC and ICC in effecting cross-netted settlements and the effect of the default of a joint clearing member on such rights and obligations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The Proposed Rule Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ICC no longer desires to be a cross-netting DCO, and therefore, OCC and ICC have proposed to eliminate the ability of a joint clearing member to select ICC as a DCO. These proposed rule changes will have no effect: (1) On the basic procedures under which cross-netted obligations are settled or (2) upon any joint clearing member because no joint clearing member has ever selected ICC as its cross-netting DCO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To accomplish the proposed rule changes, OCC and ICC will amend OCC Rule 1605(c) and ICC Rule 1205(c). The two rules deal with the cross-netting of foreign currency obligations and will be modified to state that henceforth only OCC will be the DCO and effect the settlement of such obligations. OCC and ICC also will delete from OCC By-Laws Article XV, Section 1 and from ICC Rule 1202 the term and definition of ``designated clearing organization.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

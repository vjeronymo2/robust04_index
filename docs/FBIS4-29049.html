			<p>BFN     [Text] Nagoya, June 14 KYODO -- Toyota Motor Corp.  purchased 4.65 billion dollars worth of automobile parts and  materials from U.S. suppliers during fiscal 1993, up 5 percent  from the year before, company officials said Tuesday [14 June].    At an annual meeting in San Francisco of North American  parts  suppliers exporting to Japan, Toyota's Director, Noritaka  Shimizu said spending on U.S. parts has grown over four times  from 1.1 billion dollars in 1988, according to the officials.    During fiscal 1993, Toyota's U.S. branches bought 3.51  billion dollars worth of American parts, while Japan's  operations spent 1.14 billion dollars. Toyota expects purchases  for fiscal 1994 will total 5.28 billion dollars, the officials  said.    Toyota says its increase of U.S. parts suppliers from 415 in  March 1993 to 448 in March 1994 is one reason for the increase  in purchases, as well as a new factory that opened in March at  Toyota motor manufacturing, U.S.A. Inc. located in Kentucky.</p>

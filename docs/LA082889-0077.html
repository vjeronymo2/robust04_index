			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTES  </P> <P> American companies selling products in Japan and other Asian countries have  long been aware that consumers across the Pacific have different values from  people in this country. And a forthcoming book by University of Southern  California professor Jagdish Sheth and two co-authors may help to answer the  critical question of exactly how they are different.  </P> <P> The new book, called "Why We Buy What We Buy: A Model of Consumption Values,"  provides a general theory of consumer desires by slicing up the motives, or  values, behind all behavior into five categories. Functional values are  associated with quality and price of a product or service; social values relate  to the status or identity that can be gained from using a product; emotional  values are those related to the pleasure or sensations produced by a product;  epistemic values satisfy the sense of adventure and curiosity, and conditional  values are those that derive from needs created by some other value.  </P> <P> All buyers, the authors say, are motivated by some mix of these values, and  that mix remains constant for an individual consumer no matter what the product  or service. And while the value mix will vary across any population, national  and cultural differences are even more important than the individual  differences, Sheth said.  </P> <P> Japanese consumers, for example, will be more influenced by social and  functional values than by epistemic and emotional values, Sheth said. An  American cigarette vendor, for example, would therefore be wise to market a  given brand as a social symbol.  </P> <P> The next phase of Sheth's research will systematically study cross-cultural  value differences using the five categories.  </P></p>

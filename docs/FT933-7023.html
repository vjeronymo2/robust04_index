			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Bonds: JP Morgan pulls off first 15-year D-Mark offering J. P. MORGAN, the US banking group, brought off a considerable coup yesterday when it arranged the first 15-year bond offering in the D-Mark sector. So far, foreign banks have had only limited success in winning mandates in this important sector of the international bond market. For years it has been dominated by German banks, Deutsche and Dresdner in particular. Mr Maarten van Eden, head of J. P. Morgan's syndicate desk in London, said that yields on 15-year Dutch and French government bonds were used as a guide when pricing the DM1bn offering for LKB Baden Wurttemberg Finance, because a German government bond of that maturity does not exist. The yield differentials between 10-year French, German and Dutch government bonds were also taken into account. The calculations resulted in a theoretical 15-year bund yield of 6.70 per cent, in line with the yield on French government bonds and 15 basis points above the yield on Dutch government bonds. This compares with a yield of around 6.80 per cent on 15-year German domestic bonds. LKB's bonds, which carry a coupon of 6 1/2 per cent, were priced to yield 6.69 per cent, or 36 basis points above the 6 1/2 per cent bund of July 2003. When they were freed to trade, the spread narrowed slightly. 'You can argue that this is aggressive since it prices this issue where you would expect to see the bund,' Mr van Eden said. However, he felt that the pricing of the bonds was justified by strong investor demand for long-dated paper, the issuer's triple A rating and closeness to German state risk, and the fact that there were no comparable issues outstanding. Syndicate managers involved in the deal said that they expected further 15-year D-Mark offerings to emerge now that a precedent had been set. They reported good demand for such offerings from pension funds and insurance companies which have to match liabilities of a similar maturity. They said that the most obvious borrowers at this area of the yield curve were sovereigns, but that the lack of swap opportunities would limit their scope. Lehman Brothers also stole the German banks' thunder yesterday when it arranged a 10-year bond issue for LB Schleswig-Holstein. Demand was such that the issue was increased by DM50m to DM200m. The issuer has an option to change the status of the bonds from senior to subordinated debt. Lehman Brothers was also active in the Euroyen sector, leading a Y10bn three-year offering of floating rate notes for itself. The notes, which pay interest of 40 basis points above three-month Libor, attracted demand from Asia.</p>

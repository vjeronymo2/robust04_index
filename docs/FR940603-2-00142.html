			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) The preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents pertaining to hazardous materials and requirements respecting the number, content, and placement of such documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The design, manufacturing, fabrication, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a package or container which is represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in the transportation of hazardous materials. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In these areas, a non-Federal requirement that is ``not otherwise authorized by Federal law'' is preempted unless it is ``substantively the same'' as the HMTA or HMR requirement. 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). To be ``substantively the same,'' the non-Federal requirement must ``conform[] in every significant respect to the Federal requirement. Editorial and other similar de minimis changes are permitted.'' 49 CFR 107.202(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A more limited preemption test, independent of 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a), applies when the non-Federal requirement is being compared to FMCSR provisions incorporated into the HMR through 49 CFR 177.804. RSPA has declared that in enacting 49 CFR 177.804, it did not intend to change the preemptive effect of those FMCSR provisions incorporated. See IR&hyph;22, 52 FR 46574 (Dec. 8, 1987). The preemptive effect of FMCSR training requirements, 49 CFR 390.3(e)(2) and 392.1, is set forth at 49 CFR 390.9: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Except as otherwise specifically indicated, subchapter B of this chapter [49 CFR Parts 350&hyph;399] is not intended to preclude States or subdivisions thereof from establishing or enforcing State or local laws relating to safety, the compliance with which would not prevent full compliance with these regulations by the person subject thereto. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This standard essentially is the ``dual compliance'' standard. See IR&hyph;32, 55 FR 36736, 36741 (Sept. 6, 1990). Any FMSCR provision incorporated into the HMR solely through 49 CFR 177.804 therefore preempts a State or local requirement ``only if compliance with both is impossible.'' IR&hyph;32, 55 FR at 36741.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In place of the prior process for issuing advisory inconsistency rulings, the HMTA authorizes any directly affected person to apply to the Secretary of Transportation for a preemption determination with respect to a requirement of a State, political subdivision or Indian tribe. 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(c)(1). Preemption determinations under authority of the HMTA address preemption only by the HMTA, and not by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution or federal statutes other than the HMTA. Other statutes may be relevant to determining HMTA preemption, for instance in establishing whether a non-Federal requirement is ``otherwise authorized by Federal law.'' 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary of Transportation has delegated to RSPA the authority to make preemption determinations, except for those concerning highway routing, which are delegated to the Federal Highway Administration. 49 CFR 1.53(b). Under RSPA's regulations, preemption determinations are issued by RSPA's Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety. 49 CFR 107.209(a). If the HMTA preempts a requirement of a State, a political subdivision of a State or an Indian tribe, that jurisdiction may apply for a waiver of preemption under 49 CFR 107.215 through 107.227. A waiver may be granted if the Associate Administrator finds that the non-Federal requirement affords the public a level of safety equal to or greater than that afforded by the HMR, and that it does not unreasonably burden commerce. Alternatively, the jurisdiction may petition under 49 CFR 106.31 for adoption of a uniform Federal rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preemption determinations under the HMTA are consistent with the principles and policy set forth in Executive Order No. 12,612 (``Federalism''), 52 FR 41685 (Oct. 30, 1987). Section 4(a) of that Executive Order authorizes preemption of State laws only when a statute contains an express preemption provision, there is other clear evidence of Congressional intent to preempt, or the exercise of State authority directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority. The HMTA contains an express preemption provision, implemented through RSPA regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. The CWTI/NTTC Application and Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The CWTI/NTTC Application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CWTI/NTTC application asserts that the Maryland driver certification requirements duplicate and conflict with Federal standards. It observes that 49 CFR Part 383 of the FMCSR requires a driver to have a CDL with a cargo tank endorsement when operating a cargo tank, and a CDL with a hazardous materials endorsement when transporting hazardous materials. It notes that the HMR do not impose training certification requirements beyond the employer's duty, set forth at 49 CFR 172.704(d)(5), to maintain training records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

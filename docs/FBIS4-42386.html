			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [DPA embargoes this item until further notice] </F>   [Text] Rostock (DPA) -- At the beginning of the Free  Democratic Party [FDP] Federal Congress in Rostock on Friday [3  June], FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel confirmed, as expected, the  FDP's intention to continue the coalition with the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] after the  Bundestag elections on 16 October. In his opening speech  Kinkel, on behalf of the Presidium and the Federal Executive  Committee, presented a corresponding resolution to the congress  to vote on it.    The resolution says: "On the basis of its liberal program,  the FDP wants to continue the successful coalition with the  CDU/CSU in the next legislative period." Kinkel stressed that  this signal must "emanate" from the congress "to the outside."    It is considered certain that the about 660 delegates will  approve the coalition statement by a great majority.    Kinkel harshly attacked the Social Democratic Party [SPD]  and  the Greens. The SPD wants to come to power together with the  Greens. This would mean an SPD government program that is  hostile to the economy, a hindrance for economic recovery, and a  killer of performance, embellished with the demands of the  Greens, up to the dissolution of the Bundeswehr and getting out  of NATO. "I can only say: red-green -- good night, Germany."    According to Kinkel, a grand coalition would not be better,  either, but would just be a policy of following the path of  least resistance and conducted at the smallest common  denominator. Rather, it has been the coalitions with the FDP  that have brought progress in Germany, Kinkel said. A strong  FDP is the guarantee against red-green and against a grand  coalition. Even in this difficult time there is no need to hide  the successful record of the current coalition in Bonn. "We  want to continue our successful work after 16 October." There  are still important tasks to do, which can best be solved  together, Kinkel said.</p>

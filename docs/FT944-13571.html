			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Allies of Blair win jobs in reshuffle Mr Tony Blair yesterday tightened his grip on Labour's economic strategy with an extensive shake-up of the party's frontbench team. The move puts several younger allies who last week failed to be elected to the shadow cabinet in key positions. The Labour leader underlined his determination to put the main economic departments firmly in the hands of the party's modernising wing by appointing Mr Brian Wilson and Ms Hilary Armstrong to prominent posts in the trade and industry and Treasury teams respectively. Mr Wilson augmented his reputation with his skilful harrying of the government as shadow transport spokesman during the railway privatisation bill. Ms Armstrong was a loyal aide to John Smith, the former Labour leader. Mr Alistair Darling, another close ally of Mr Blair, will continue in his role as the party's City spokesman, with Mr Alun Michael continuing to support Mr Jack Straw in home affairs. This leaves Ms Dawn Primarolo as the only 'traditionalist' member of Mr Gordon Brown's shadow Treasury team. Mr Andrew Smith, another moderniser, was confirmed as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury some days ago. Mr Derek Fatchett, a leading traditionalist, was moved from trade and industry to defence. Mr Blair was expected today to signal his intention of reshaping the Labour whip's office as the principal training ground for the party's stars of the future. Mr Peter Mandelson, the party's former communications director, was among a number of members of Labour's 1992 Commons intake being tipped for a job there as part of the new strategy. There were several prominent jobs for women in the new line-up. Ms Ann Clwyd was appointed to back up Mr John Prescott, deputy leader, as well as moving to Mr Robin Cook's frontbench foreign affairs team where she joins Ms Joyce Quin. Ms Joan Ruddock will be the party's spokeswoman on environmental protection. Ms Llin Golding will speak on children and families. In employment, Mr Kevin Barron, an ex-aide to Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, will support Ms Harriet Harman along with Mr Ian McCartney, a traditionalist. Mr Kevin McNamara, previously Northern Ireland spokesman, moves to the civil service portfolio. Mr George Foulkes, who resigned as defence spokesman a year ago before he was fined for assaulting a police constable, returns as overseas development spokesman. The home affairs team is completed by Mr George Howarth, noted for his research into quangos, and Mr Kim Howells. Mr David Blunkett will be supported in education by Mr Bryan Davies and Mr Peter Kilfoyle, an unsuccessful challenger as chief whip. Mr Nick Brown joins Mrs Margaret Beckett at health.</p>

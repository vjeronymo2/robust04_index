			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Simonyan report in the "Georgia" column: "Refugees </F> Will Be Returning to Abkhazia Under UN Supervision. The Latest  Session of the Quadripartite Commission"]    [Text] The second session of the quadripartite commission  on the return of refugees and deported persons to Abkhazia was  held in the Lazurnaya hotel in Sochi for two days. The  commission includes representatives of Georgian and Abkhaz  sides, the Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Ministry, and the  Russian Federal Migration Service, as well as the office of the  UN High Commissioner for Refugees.    The commission's first working meeting, which took place on  8  and 9 April, prepared a protocol in which the sides presented  the main principles of their upcoming activities, but the  document was signed only at the second meeting. The sides  agreed that registration of refugees will be effected by the UN  High Commissioner for Refugees mission, in collaboration with  the regional authorities. It was decided to create an expert  group that will work out questionnaires. The refugees will fill  out these papers under the supervision of High Commissioner  representatives. All the data about those willing to return to  Abkhazia will be entered into the computer and stay at the  disposal and under the control of the UN mission. The protocol  stresses that all personal particulars may not be revealed.    The meeting heard a report by the UN mission on the results  of its trip to areas of western Georgia and Galskiy Rayon in  Abkhazia.    Expert groups were set up on legal matters, information  support, and planning. A draft procedure for the registration  of those who wish to return was considered.    A statement was adopted, stressing that the absence of  peacekeeping forces in the zone of conflict hinders the return  of the refugees. True, the sides' positions on this issue  differ somewhat. The Abkhaz side continues to insist that  peacekeeping forces should be introduced not on the entire  territory but only along the line of confrontation between  Georgian and Abkhaz forces, which passes along the Inguri river.  Leonid Lakerbaya, first deputy chairman of the Abkhazia Council  of Ministers, believes that only after this can the return of  the refugees begin. The head of the Abkhaz delegation confirmed  that the republic's Abkhaz population should be prepared for  this process.    The session defined the agenda for the next meeting on 11  May.</p>

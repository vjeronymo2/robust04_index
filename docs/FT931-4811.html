			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Strong bonds spur Dow to a record peak Wall Street US SHARE prices soared to record highs yesterday, helped by declining bond yields, growing confidence about the economy and fresh inflows of cash into equities, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the finish the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 64.84 at 3,469.42, easily eclipsing the previous record close of 3,442.14 set on February 5. It was the Dow's biggest one-day gain since last September. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 forged ahead 8.60 to 454.71, also an historic high, while the American SE composite gained 2.93 at 416.73. The Nasdaq composite was 5.86 stronger at 687.23, some way short of its best ever close. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 277.9m shares, while rises outpaced declines by a ratio of three-to-one. Shares opened strongly, helped by news of big gains in foreign markets. Yet it was the performance of US bonds that set equities alight. In spite of last week's strong set of jobs data, which initially looked bad for bond market sentiment, long-dated Treasury prices rose sharply early yesterday on reports that President Clinton was planning new spending cuts for his budget. The rise in prices pushed long yields down near historic lows. This cheered equity investors, because lower interest rates help spur economic growth and corporate profitability. Even when the bond price surge lost steam later, stocks climbed further as cash continued to pour into the market. With short-term interest rates and Treasury yields so low, investors see equities as offering a better possible return on their money. Among heavily traded cyclical stocks, Alcoa added Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 72, General Electric put on Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 87 1/2 , Goodyear Tire advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 74 1/4 and International Paper rose Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 66 5/8 . Compaq jumped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 48 3/8 after announcing that it was cutting prices on a range of popular products. A rare decliner was Philip Morris, down a further Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 63 1/2 in volume of more than 3.9m shares as investors continued to sell on fears that the government will impose a heavy tax on cigarettes. Charles Schwab moved forward Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 35 1/4 as investors responded to last week's news that customer business at the discount broker reached a record 40,000 trades a day in February. Some leading Nasdaq market stocks were actively sought. Apple rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 1/2 , Intel Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 119 and MCI Communications Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 1/2 . Canada THE Toronto market extended its current rally to a fifth day in heavy dealings, given fresh impetus by the buoyancy in some leading foreign stock exchanges yesterday. The TSE 300 index appreciated 26.5 to close at 3,551.0 and advancing issues outnumbered declines by 374 to 292. Volume came to 53m shares, but was well below Friday's 72.2m. Nine of the 14 sub-groups ended higher, led by mining, up 2.7 per cent. Alcan rose CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 24. The gold shares index lost 1.9 per cent as the New York bullion price eased.</p>

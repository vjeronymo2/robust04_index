			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Shares slip as Novo Nordisk disappoints Shares in Novo Nordisk slid 7 per cent yesterday after the Danish pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes group disclosed lower first-half profits and a reduced forecast for the full year. The group blamed the costs of merging two US companies and unrealised bond losses for the 7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to DKr734m (Dollars 117.76m) from DKr788m. It said falling bond prices meant it no longer expected 1994 profits to increase at a relatively faster pace than last year, when the pre-tax result climbed 11 per cent to DKr1.86bn. This year's increase will be 'slightly lower' than last year, it stated. The group's shares fell DKr49 to DKr617 in heavy turnover. Novo stressed that its underlying businesses had performed in line with expectations, with sales climbing 15 per cent to DKr6.58bn due to larger volumes, an improved product mix and currency factors. But costs rose more than sales - climbing 18 per cent to DKr6.07bn - due to efforts to build up the company's international production and sales organisation. The results were also hit by a DKr80m provision for the planned merger of two US companies in 1995 as well as a DKr75m unrealised loss on the group's bond portfolio. The US provision relates to relocation and severance costs and property write-downs. Healthcare sales climbed 15 per cent to DKr4.37bn. Diabetes sales accounted for DKr3.08bn of the total, a 9 per cent rise helped by an improved insulin product mix. Enzymes sales climbed 14 per cent to DKr1.77bn while ferrosan sales were 32 per cent higher at DKr310m. Net income fell to DKr550m from DKr595m, while earnings per share fell to DKr14.66 from DKr15.87. Second half sales are expected to be higher than in the first half.</p>

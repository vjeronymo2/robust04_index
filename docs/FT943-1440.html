			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Ukraine and IMF agree initial deal over economic reforms Ukraine reached preliminary agreement with the International Monetary Fund yesterday on a programme of radical economic reforms that may release an initial Dollars 700m (Pounds 443m) in aid next month. The deal with the IMF, the first since Ukraine declared independence just over three years ago, may be a watershed in the country's economic development. Under former president Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine became one of the most economically depressed republics of the former Soviet Union. The new president, Mr Leonid Kuchma, has promised comprehensive economic reforms, and yesterday's agreement suggests that his government is prepared to live up to his word. According to Mr Viktor Yushchenko, the reformist chairman of the Ukrainian central bank, who took part in the negotiations, Ukraine has agreed to keep its budget deficit to 10 per cent of GDP. IMF officials said the accord called for a tight fiscal policy, price liberalisation, liberalisation of Ukraine's foreign trade, rapid structural reform, such as privatisation, and the creation of a safety net to shield the poor. If the preliminary agreement is ratified next week by the board of the IMF and the Ukrainian leadership, it may pave the way for substantial western assistance. IMF officials said they could begin negotiating a standby agreement with Ukraine, which might release as much as Dollars 1.24bn, early next year. This summer the Group of Seven leading industrial nations promised Ukraine Dollars 4bn in aid if the country began serious reforms. 'This is a ground-breaking agreement,' said Mr Lawrence DeMilnar, resident representative for the IMF in Ukraine. Mr Yushchenko said: 'This is the beginning of real steps toward economic reform', adding that the president was '100 per cent' behind the IMF deal and the reform process. He also predicted that initial opponents of market reforms in Ukraine in the cabinet of ministers and the communist-dominated parliament would support the deal, which, he said, had created 'an unprecedented political consensus on the need for reforms in Ukraine'. Mr Yushchenko said that Mr Vitalii Masol, the Ukrainian prime minister, was likely to sign the agreement with the IMF. The agreement with the IMF, and the brightened prospect for reforms in Ukraine, suggest that the country's provincial and often instinctively conservative political elites have realised that without an improvement in Ukraine's collapsing economy the nation is unlikely to survive as an independent state. Professor Anders Aslund, the Swedish economist who has been advising the government, said that 'there is now the best chance yet for a commitment to reform. There is now the clear will to move forward'. He said that because of greater social stability and less crime the prospects for reform 'are in some ways better than in Russia'.

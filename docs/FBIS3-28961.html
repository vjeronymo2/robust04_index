			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic  Liberal Party (DLP) on Monday called on the government to seek  ways to possess nuclear reprocessing facilities for the peaceful  use of nuclear.    In a policy material it prepared and distributed to its  lawmakers in connection with the upcoming National Assembly  session, the DLP objected the idea of turning the South-North  denuclearization declaration into an international treaty. The  party said that if the declaration were made an international  treaty, it would restrict Korea's use of nuclear reprocessing  facilities for peaceful purposes.    "The question of nuclear reprocessing facilities should be  dealt with in linkage with the issue of denuclearizing whole  Northeast Asia," the paper said.    Since the denuclearization declaration is not an  inter-country treaty but an intra-national agreement, the paper  said, the declaration cannot be made an international treaty.    The policy paper also voiced negativism toward the possible  deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. It said there  should be an ample review of the issue at the National Assembly  before any decision is made on the deployment of Patriots.    The paper specifically noted that because of the  geographical  limitedness, there would be no sufficient time for Patriot  anti-missile missiles to detect and intercept incoming North  Korean Scud missiles. Besides, there is the suspicion that the  United States seeks to deploy the missiles in South Korea as a  prelude to the promotion of sales of their old-type Patriots to  Korea.    The paper further indicated that the ruling party is not  buying the reported offer of the Russian Government to produce  sophisticated Russian weapons in a joint Russia-South Korea  project. Such a joint scheme is prone to cause a confusion in  South Korea's weapons system and accelerate the arms race  between South and North Korea, it said.</p>

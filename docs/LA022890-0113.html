			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> STATE OF EMERGENCY EXPIRES ON SPRAYING  </P> <P> The Orange County Board of Supervisors, faced with a deadlock on a routine  proclamation, allowed the state of emergency on malathion spraying to expire  Tuesday, exposing the county to possible claims arising from the Medfly  eradication program.  </P> <P> Under county law, the supervisors are required to renew a proclamation every  two weeks to extend a state of emergency. That vote was scheduled Tuesday, but  Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez was on his way to Montevideo, Uruguay, as part of a  six-member delegation representing the United States at the inauguration of  President-elect Luis Lacalle.  </P> <P> County Counsel Adrian Kuyper said Tuesday that without the declaration, the  county would lose the immunity provided by the state of emergency. He would not  discuss specifics but added that without the immunity, all liability claims  would have to be considered.  </P> <P> Board Chairman Don R. Roth said a new proclamation declaring the Medfly  emergency will be back up for a vote on Tuesday. In the past, the proclamation  has passed on a 3-2 vote, with Roth, Vasquez and Supervisor Thomas F. Riley  voting in favor and Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and Roger R. Stanton voting  against it.  </P> <P> Since Tuesday's vote would have ended in a tie, Roth decided to delete the item  from the agenda, leaving the county without an emergency declaration for one  week. He announced the deletion at Tuesday's meeting. There was no debate.  </P> <P> County Agricultural Commissioner James D. Harnett said he asked the state to  delay its next scheduled spraying Monday night in the Brea, La Habra and  Fullerton area, but officials said the spraying schedule was too busy to change  it.  </P> <P> Spraying is also scheduled in the Garden Grove, Santa Ana, Orange, Westminster,  Stanton, Huntington Beach and Cypress areas.  </P> <P> One staff member who has studied the issue said an example of liability faced  by the county would be a helicopter crashing into a home. Although the state  has full responsibility for the spraying program, the county could be named in  a suit resulting from accidents because it lacked the absolute immunity  provided by the state of emergency.

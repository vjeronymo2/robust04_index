			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> BABY-SITTER, HUSBAND ARRESTED IN DEATH OF 2 1/2-MONTH-OLD GIRL  </P> <P> A 61-year-old Van Nuys baby-sitter and her 75-year-old husband were in jail  this morning after an infant in their care died and investigators found  possible signs of child abuse, Los Angeles police reported.  </P> <P> Theresa and Jose del Gado were arrested on suspicion of murder Wednesday night  after 2 1/2-month-old Evelyn Figueroa stopped breathing in their apartment and  was later pronounced dead at Panorama Community Hospital, said Detective Jim  Vojtecky.  </P> <P> The couple were being held without bail in the Van Nuys jail.  </P> <P> Investigators were called to the hospital at 5:30 p.m. after staff members  found bruises on the head and face of the child, Vojtecky said. Vojtecky said  the cause of the child's death is unknown and the results of an autopsy will  likely determine whether the Del Gados will be charged with murder.  </P> <P> "The injuries appear minor," the detective said. "We are talking about slight  bruising. When you are dealing with a young child, it is difficult" to  determine if bruises are fatal injuries.  </P> <P> Vojtecky said the Del Gados denied injuring the child, who was left in their  care by her mother, Susana Espina, 24.  </P></p>

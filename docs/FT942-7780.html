			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Observer: Educated guess No secret that John Patten's job at the Department for Education is one of the least secure in the cabinet. Perhaps a bit more surprising is the press of hopefuls jockeying to succeed him. In addition to the likes of Michael Portillo, Steven Dorrell and Virginia Bottomley, it emerges that social security secretary Peter Lilley, the ex-Greenwell's oil analyst, also fancies exchanging the never-ending headaches of the Child Support Agency for worries about a different facet of youngsters' development. Lilley has been surprisingly successful over the past two years, but with more cuts expected in his Pounds 80bn budget it may be time to get out while he is still ahead. A suspiciously large chunk of his recent Spectator lecture was devoted to the subject of education. However, while Lilley is regarded as one of the most intellectually able in the cabinet, the prime minister may be disinclined to make changes in an area as sensitive as social security just at the moment. And would it be a promotion for him anyway?</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Election: Extraordinary parliamentary session must be called within 30 days The Japanese constitution says that an extraordinary parliamentary session to elect Japan's next prime minister must be called within 30 days of the general election, writes Emiko Terazono. Extensive negotiations between parties to decide on details of a new coalition may take up to a month, preventing the Diet from convening before the August 16 deadline. It has usually taken more than 18 days for parties to convene the past 16 special parliamentary sessions following general elections. After the special session is convened, there is no time limit for the election of the prime minister. In 1979, the session took a record eight days to elect Mr Masayoshi Ohira because of friction within the Liberal Democratic party.</p>

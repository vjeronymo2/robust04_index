			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / World Trade News: Zimbabwe eases dividend remittance ZIMBABWE has brought in an incentive package aimed at boosting investment and exports. Yesterday Mr Bernard Chidzero, the finance minister, announced that any foreign-owned company established after May 1, 1993 will have the right of unrestricted remittance of dividends without requiring foreign currency allocations from the central bank. But these dividends will have to be purchased in the so-called export retention market, where foreign currency is available at a premium of 28 per cent above the official rate of ZDollars 6.4 to the US dollar. Foreign-owned companies, allowed to remit dividends of 25 per cent of after tax profits (for pre-1979 investors) or 50 per cent for post-1979 investors, will be allowed to increase their dividend on new investments undertaken after May 1. The aim is to encourage existing foreign investors to reinvest in the knowledge they will be able to remit 100 per cent from profits derived from new investment.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Why you must shop around - Wrong choices can be costly - Annuities There is little point investing carefully in a pension plan for 20 to 30 years if, at retirement, you fail to shop around for your annuity. The wrong choice of provider can reduce the annuity rate by up to 25 per cent, while unnecessary expense on costly features can knock up to 50 per cent off your income. An annuity is an insurance product that provides a guaranteed income for life in return for a lump sum investment. With money purchase pensions, which invest contributions to provide a fund at retirement rather than a salary-linked pension, the bulk of that fund must be used to buy what is known as a compulsory purchase annuity. Retirement annuities, personal pensions, executive plans, most company additional voluntary contribution schemes (AVCs), free-standing AVCs (FSAVCs) and contracted-out money purchase schemes (Comps) are all examples of money purchase arrangements. Given the complexity of annuities, it is essential to seek expert independent advice, preferably on a fee basis. But the important point to remember is that once you have made your choice and handed over your money, you cannot switch to a different provider - or even to a different type of annuity within the same provider's product range. In recent years, though, providers have developed the range of options. You can, for example, buy a fixed rate of annual increase (commonly, 3 or 5 per cent a year), or increases that are linked to retail price inflation. Other options ensure a return of outstanding fund to your dependants if you die within a certain period. But each bolt-on feature carries a cost in terms of reduced income. Annuity rates fluctuate in line with investment conditions. To back the guarantee associated with annuities, life offices buy medium and long dated gilts. The annuity rate you secure - that is, the amount of regular income you can purchase with your fund - will depend on prevailing gilt yields. The annuity rate also is based on a series of actuarial factors including your age, sex and health. Statistically, women tend to outlive men by between five and seven years, so the annuity rates offered to women will be lower than for men of the same age. One exception is annuities bought by a personal pension fund which has inherited liabilities from the State earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). It is possible for an individual to contract out of Serps and use the money handed over to build up a personal pension fund. This fund then has to buy an annuity which meets certain government specifications. The company providing the annuity must make similar quotations to people of the same age, regardless of sex; it also has to offer a spouse's pension and annual increases up to a maximum of 3 per cent. Step one towards choosing the right annuity is to use the open market option. This allows you to take the proceeds of your pension fund away from the plan provider and to buy your annuity elsewhere. The top names in personal pension plans often are quite different from the top names in the annuity market, so it makes sense to shop around. Annuities can be sold only by life offices. If your pension plan is provided by any other sort of financial institution - say, a unit trust group - then you have no choice but to use the open market option. This can improve the income provided by your annuity by up to 25 per cent - the typical difference between the best and worst rates on offer. But some life offices penalise policy-holders who use the option while others pay a loyalty bonus to those who stay put, which is tantamount to the same thing. Either way, the differential must be taken into consideration when weighing up the benefits of the better rates available under the option. The table shows the various annuity options and their cost in terms of diminished income. The figures, provided by Lexis Pensions Consultants, assume the buyer is a man aged 60 with a wife of 57. After taking his tax-free cash and purchasing his protected rights annuity, his fund size is Pounds 100,000. The maximum annual income he could get when we checked was Pounds 11,327; this was for a pension that did not include annual increases, a spouse's pension, or any other guarantees. If he goes for every possible option (see 'combination' in the examples following), he might consider himself to be a wise and cautious fellow - but he will also forfeit half of his income, leaving him just Pounds 5,675 a year. The options fall into seven main categories: Guaranteed annuities. These pay a lump sum or continue the regular income for the five or 10 years guaranteed even if the annuitant dies - a useful option given that one in eight people dies within the first five years of retirement. Reduction in income: 2 per cent to 6.2 per cent, depending on the period of guarantee. Increasing ('escalating') annuities. These rise each year in line with a pre-determined rate, typically 3 per cent, 5 per cent or RPI. Some degree of inflation-proofing is essential. Once inflation takes its toll, the value of the level annuity plummets. Early retirement - whether voluntary or enforced  -combined with increased longevity aggravate this problem, as can be seen in Table 2. Reduction in income: 20 per cent to 40 per cent, depending on rate of increase. Payable in advance or in arrears. This affects the timing of the first payment. You can also chose the frequency of payment: monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually. Likely reduction in income: 10.4 per cent for annual in advance. Monthly in advance would reduce the income by about 6 per cent compared with an annual income paid in arrears. Spouses' pensions. These are not normally compulsory except for annuities bought from personal pension funds which have taken over liabilities from Serps. Your requirements will depend on marital status and your spouse's own pension arrangements. Reduction in income: 11 to 14 per cent, but can be higher depending on couple's age and the level of spouse's pension. With or without proportion. When an annuitant dies shortly before a pension payment is due, the surviving spouse might already have lived for several months with no income, for some pension schemes pay as seldom as once a year. With most schemes, that is just tough. But it is possible to arrange that the scheme will pay the survivor a proportion of the next payment. So, if there were three months left to the next annual payment, the survivor would receive three-quarters of it. Reduction in income: an extra l per cent on top of the cost of the spouse's pension. Combination. Clearly, many people would like to combine several options, and here the drop in income can be substantial, particularly if you go for a high rate of annual increase and a high level of spouse's pension. Reduction in income: up to 50 per cent, depending on options selected. Investment. A handful of providers sell annuities that leave the fund invested on a with-profits or unit-linked basis. Under a with-profits annuity, shown in the chart on page VII, the annuitant secures a fairly low guaranteed income and also is awarded annual bonuses from the with-profits fund. To lift the initial income, it is possible to set an anticipated rate of bonus. Where the actual declared bonus rate is lower than anticipated, then the income will fall, and vice-versa. But these, and other complex options like phased retirement, should be considered only if you can afford to take a gamble. For others, a conventional product is best since it offers rock-solid guarantees. As well as independent pensions advisers, there are several annuity specialists. These include: The Annuity Bureau Ltd, Enterprise House, Upper Ground, London SEl 9PQ (tel: 071-620 4090); Annuity Direct, 32 Scrutton Street, London EC2A 4RQ (tel: 071-375 1175); and Lexis Pension Consultants, 8 Crosbie Square, London EC3A 6AQ (tel: 071-374 4448).

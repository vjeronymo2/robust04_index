			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Xiangwei] </F>   [Text] Hainan province, China's largest special economic  zone, yesterday unveiled plans to sell off all of its 33 wholly  and partly state-owned enterprises in an ambitious move to fuel  economic growth in the region.    The massive sale to foreign investors includes an airline,  two airports, a major power plant and a highway, according to  Sun Lijun, the provincial deputy secretary-general.    The sale would be conducted through public auction and  individual negotiation, from tomorrow until next Wednesday, in  Haikou, the capital of the province, Sun said yesterday in Hong  Kong.    Sun said a 27 per cent stake in Hainan Airline would be sold  to foreign investors. An official of the airline later  confirmed the deal.    He said the airline planned to raise U.S.$27m (about  HK$210.6m [Hong Kong dollars]) through an international  placement of 70 million B shares.    The move, analysts said, would herald the opening up of  China's domestic aviation market to foreign investors, and  foreign carriers in particular.    The news followed a weekend announcement by the Civil  Aviation Administration of China that the country would invite  foreign airlines to buy into domestic carriers this year.    Earlier, the Chinese government said two major Chinese  carriers, China Southern and China Eastern, would seek primary  listings on the New York Stock Exchange this year or next.    However, both Sun and the Hainan Airline official declined  to  say whether foreign airlines were involved in the deal.    Established in October 1989 and restructured into a  joint-stock company in September 1992, Hainan Airline has five  Boeing passenger planes flying 15 domestic routes.    Last June the airline started to trade 96 million legal  person shares on China's screen-based securities trading system  STAQ [expansion unknown].    Last year, the airline, with a staff of 450, made 67.06m  renminbi (about HK$59.55m) in profits.    The provincial government would not set limits on how much  foreign investors could buy for most of the 33 enterprises to be  sold, Sun said.    "In fact, we will encourage them to buy the whole of the  power plant and the airports we have put up," he said.    The sale of the state-owned enterprises highlights the  unconventional and controversial methods often seen in Hainan.    In the late 1980s the province caused a political storm  after  it announced that it would lease 30 square kilometres of land to  the Hong Kong-based construction company, Kumagai Gumi, to  develop a free port.    The controversy centred around the fact that the leases  resembled those which had been drawn up in the 1890s when China  was forced to cede territories to foreign colonial powers.  However, the deal was eventually approved by Beijing in 1992.    Sun said the provincial government had already drawn up a  series of provisional regulations to govern the sell-offs and it  would set up a permanent trading centre, open to Chinese and  foreigners, this Friday where enterprises could be bought or  sold.    The centre, like a stock exchange, would operate on a  membership mechanism in which enterprises that wanted to buy or  sell would have to do so through members. The centre would have  21 members, most of them securities and investment companies.    Enterprises would be able to sell both state-owned and  non-state-owned assets, provided they were properly audited.    Investors would be able to buy the management rights,  land-use rights, and intellectual property rights of the  enterprises.    Sales would be finalised through negotiations or public  auctions at the centre.    The Hainan centre will not be the first in China. Shanghai,  Sichuan and Hunan already have similar centres.    But Hainan wants to become the largest and most  sophisticated  in China.    Ren Junren, the deputy director of the Hainan Securities  Regulatory Office, said the centre would consider admitting  foreign securities companies and linking up with other centres  across the country so enterprises in other provinces could be  traded.    Of the 33 enterprises to be sold, Ren said only a few were  losing money and some companies had big potential.    In addition to the airline, the Hainan Airport Joint Stock  seemed to be a good buy, he said. The company runs two major  airports in Hainan.    The Sanya Fenghuang International Airport, with an  investment  of Renminbi [Rmb] 600m, is due to open on July 1, 1994.    The airport, close to summer resort Sanya City, is designed  to handle 1.5 million passengers a year and accommodate Boeing  747 passenger planes.    Construction of the Haikou Meilan Airport, at a cost of  Rmb3bn, is due to start later this year and open four years  later. The new airport would replace the current Haikou airport  which was converted from a military airstrip.</p>

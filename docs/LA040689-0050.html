			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A federal judge rejected a request by attorneys for Oliver L. North to show  jurors about three hours of videotaped testimony by John M. Poindexter, North's  former boss, during congressional hearings into the Iran-Contra scandal in  1987. Poindexter, a retired admiral and former White House national security  adviser, is due to be tried on criminal charges after North's own trial  concludes. He has advised North he would cite his constitutional protections  against self-incrimination if called as a witness. In his ruling, U.S. District  Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said the videotape selected by the defense "distorts  the record from the congressional proceedings." In his testimony, Poindexter  assumed responsibility for the diversion of funds to the Nicaraguan Contras and  said he never told former President Ronald Reagan about it.  </P></p>

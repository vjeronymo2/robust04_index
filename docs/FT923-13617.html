			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (13): A rare bird among businessmen - Interview, Seiji Tsutsumi 'THE common image of Japanese businessmen is that they are always doing calculations on calculators in their rooms. I'm different,' says Mr Seiji Tsutsumi. It is no idle boast. Part businessman, part artist and part intellectual, Mr Tsutsumi, who is 64, is a rare bird among Japanese businessmen. Saison Group, the conglomerate he leads, employs 145,000 people in everything from fast food and helicopters to luxury hotels. His interests include writing poetry and novels, modern art and the temples of Angkor Wat. His family history is the stuff of soap opera. Mr Tsutsumi talks about himself in a slightly detached way, as if a little unsure of the many roles he plays. He seems shy but very determined - a man driven, as he says, by a hungry spirit. This spirit was nurtured in a difficult childhood and youth. His father, Mr Yasujiro Tsutsumi was a ruthless railway baron who founded Seibu Railway, one of Japan's biggest private railway companies, as well as Seibu Department Stores and Prince Hotels, a luxury hotel chain. At the end of the Second World War, Mr Tsutsumi senior bought prime Tokyo sites from impoverished Japanese aristocrats in a series of hard-driven deals, for which he earned the nickname Pistol Tsutsumi. He went into politics and became speaker of the Diet's lower house. Mr Seiji Tsutsumi's life was blighted by the fact that he was the son not of his father's wife but of his mistress. His childhood was torn by the many conflicts generated by his father's pursuit of women. Mr Seiji Tsutsumi rebelled and, as a student, joined the Communist Party. With Japan still under US occupation and the Cold War raging, this was a risk, even for someone as privileged as Mr Tsutsumi. After graduating from Tokyo University, he decided to conform - he joined his father's business and even served for a time as his father's political secretary, making friends with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who was then a young political aide. The turmoil left deep scars on Mr Tsutsumi about which he writes in a semi-autobiographical novel, A Spring Like Any Other, recently published in English. It concerns a department store owner's attempts to reconcile himself with his life and his family, who all live in the shadow of a tyrannical father. At one point the hero says of himself: 'It seems I'm burdened with an inability to commit myself which keeps me from belonging anywhere.' When Mr Tsutsumi senior died in 1964, his legitimate son, Mr Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, inherited almost the entire business empire except for Seibu Department Stores, which then consisted mainly of one loss-making shop in Ikebukuro, in central Tokyo. 'The people at Seibu Railway thought the department store would go bankrupt. So they said: 'You take it',' says Mr Tsutsumi. To revitalise the company, Mr Tsutsumi says he had to try something different. He had earlier spent some time working for Seibu Department Stores in Los Angeles. There he saw chain stores in operation for the first time. These included JC Penney, the fast food group and consumer credit businesses. None of these then existed on any scale in Japan. When he returned to Tokyo, he realised what Seibu must do. 'I saw the future of Japan in the US,' says Mr Tsutsumi. Seibu developed into a web of interlocking companies - a department store chain, a fashion chain, supermarkets, fast food, food processing and consumer credit. Later, as Japan grew wealthier, Mr Tsutsumi invested in leisure, including the Seiyo Hotel, a luxury hotel in Tokyo, travel agencies, and a stake in Club Mediterranee, the French holiday village company. In 1988, he paid Dollars 2.15bn for Inter-Continental Hotels, the luxury chain. 'When I started, this business was one-hundredth the size of what it is today. We are the only department store company in Japan to have succeeded with diversification,' says Mr Tsutsumi with a smile. Japanese magazines often describe the rise of Mr Tsutsumi in terms of a life-long rivalry with his half-brother, Mr Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who regularly heads lists of the world's richest businessmen. Even when the group's name was changed last year from Seibu Saison to Saison Group, it was seen by some Japanese journalists as a snub to Seibu Railway. Mr Seiji Tsutsumi parries a question about family rivalry, by saying: 'We don't compete directly. Seibu Railway is completely different. My goal was not to compete with Seibu Railway but with Takashimaya and Mitsukoshi (Japan's two grandest department store companies).' Mr Tsutsumi admits that the circumstances of his inheritance fired his ambition: 'I think what made us successful was the fact that we had very few blessings at the beginning. We didn't have much bestowed on us. We had a hungry spirit.' Today, Mr Tsutsumi acknowledges that Saison Group, like other Japanese companies, suffers from an excess of that hungry spirit. He believes it is time for Japanese businessmen to replace a workaholic culture with one that would allow individuals more time for themselves. He welcomes a recent appeal made by Mr Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, the electronics group, who urged Japanese companies to stop seeking to maximise sales and profits and instead give employees more pay and more holidays. Mr Tsutsumi has tried to live up to Mr Morita's philosophy - last year he retired from some top corporate posts in order to give himself more time for writing and for politics. In practice, Mr Tsutsumi has found it hard to distance himself from Saison Group. He remains chairman of Saison Corporation, a core company. 'I have delegated day-to-day management, but still I must still do some co-ordination between companies,' says Mr Tsutsumi. Mr Tsutsumi would have more free time were it not for the problems of Inter-Continental Hotels, which Saison bought from Grand Metropolitan of the UK in 1988. The acquisition has been hit by unforeseen increases in borrowing costs and a decline in business travel caused by the Gulf war and the world economic slow down. It has made operating profits, but has fallen into the red after interest costs in each of the last three years. Saison had hoped to share the risks and costs with Scandinavian Air Systems, the European airline, which bought a 40 per cent stake in Inter-Continental. But earlier this year, SAS, squeezed by financial difficulties, pulled out and sold its shares back to Saison. Mr Tsutsumi says that other Saison companies are injecting new capital into Inter-Continental. Perhaps Y100bn (Pounds 437m) in total will be invested to reduce borrowings. The hotel building programme will be slowed down over the next two or three years. But he denies that the chain is damaging the finances of the Saison group as a whole. There are no plans to sell hotels to clear debt. 'We are long-term commercial investors not financial investors,' he says. Mr Tsutsumi finds it difficult to tear himself away from the group he has headed for more than 30 years. On the day we met, he had attended a meeting of 400 top managers of Seibu Department Stores. He said: 'Mr Mizuno (Mr Seiichi Mizuno, president of Seibu) told the managers about his plans for the new (financial) year. I heard his speech. I was just observing. Nobody knew I was there.' Nevertheless, Mr Tsutsumi strongly believes that he must force himself to stay away in order to make space for his future successors. Mr Tsutsumi wants to follow the example of Mr Soichiro Honda, the late founder of Honda Motor, the car manufacturer, who retired at the peak of his powers in the early 1970s. So Mr Tsutsumi is spending more time in politics. The appointment of his friend Mr Miyazawa as prime minister has created demands, including trying to smooth relations between the government and industry. He is a member of the board of Keidanren, the employers' federation. Semi-retirement from Saison has given Mr Tsutsumi more time to write, under his pseudonym Takashi Tsuji. He has written more than 20 novels and collections of poems and essays. A book of poems was translated into English and published two years ago under the title, A Stone Monument on a Fine Day. He argues that Japanese business culture will change to allow other people to make time for themselves. 'If Mr Morita had talked 10 years ago about cutting working hours and increasing pay nobody would have listened. Now people are talking about it.' It is hard for companies to cut hours in times of growth because they are busy; while in times of recession, companies are concerned about costs, says Mr Tsutsumi. Nevertheless, employers are beginning to act. Saison Group has this year established a new subsidiary charged with advising group companies on how to improve fringe benefits and welfare for employees. The worst difficulty is that 'there are many Japanese business people who don't know how to use their free time even if they have it', he says. Employers can introduce staff to mountain climbing and skiing and even reading but there is a limit to how much they can do before they are accused of 'trying to manage employees' free time'.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1927: Born in Tokyo 1951: Graduated from Tokyo University economics department 1954: Joined Seibu Department Stores 1961: President of Seibu Department Stores 1975: Chairman of Seibu Allstate Life Insurance 1987: President of Saison Corporation 1991: Chairman of Saison Corporation  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Other posts include board member of Keidanren, board member of the international council of The Museum of Modern Art, guest professor of Moscow University, adviser of Sotheby's Holdings and director of Club Mediterranee  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

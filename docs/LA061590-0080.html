			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> PENALTIES STUDIED FOR WASTING WATER  </P> <P> As part of an effort to identify water-saving measures, the city of Oxnard is  studying whether to make wasting water illegal and punishable by jail time and  fines.  </P> <P> In a report released this week, Public Works Director James Frandsen said the  water-wasting practices covered by the proposed law could include over-watering  lawns and hosing off driveways and sidewalks.  </P> <P> Residents and businesses also could be penalized under the proposed law for  maintaining fountains and carwashes that do not recycle water.  </P> <P> Similar laws have been passed in Ventura and Camarillo, while several other  cities in Ventura County have adopted voluntary water-conservation guidelines.  </P> <P> The proposed law would be part of a water-conservation plan that the City  Council is expected to consider in September, according to the report.  </P> <P> The city is now offering residents free water-saving kits that include two  shower flow devices and two dye tablets that detect leaks in toilet tanks.  </P> <P> Oxnard is also offering partial or full rebates to residents who exchange  older, conventional toilets for new, ultra-low-flush models.  </P> <P> Oxnard residents use an average of 160 gallons of water per person per day, one  of the lowest per-capita rates in the county, according to the report.

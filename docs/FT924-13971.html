			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Observer: Crisp Meeting his manager when going to cut a lettuce in two for a customer, a new assistant in a US store remarked: 'There's a stupid woman who wants half a lettuce . . .' Then noticing the customer had followed him, he added: 'but this nice lady would like the other half.' Impressed, the manager later offered to promote the assistant to a supervisor's post in Detroit. 'Oh no]', said the young man. 'All the women shoppers there are either prostitutes or hockey players.' 'I'll have you know my wife comes from Detroit,' the manager snapped. 'Which team did she play for?' came the reply.</p>

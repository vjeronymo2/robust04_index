			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt stays calm amid signs of recession CONFIRMATION that Germany was closer to recession did not have much impact on Frankfurt yesterday, while Paris was lifted by renewed currency and interest rate speculation, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT lost early gains as investors took the view that there was little to get excited about in yesterday's batch of corporate results. The DAX index, which had reached a high of 1,539 early on, fell to an intraday low of 1,526 before closing down 1.46 at 1,532.50. Turnover was little changed at DM4.7bn from DM4.8bn. A 1.5 per cent fall in west German GNP in the third quarter from the second quarter in line with expectations while news that the steel workers had accepted an 18-month pay package worth 3.3 per cent was taken as a sign that realism had entered wage settlements. On Tuesday insurance employees accepted a 4.2 per cent salary increase, having sought 7.5 per cent. Commerzbank provided no surprises in its 10-month figures when it reported a 13 per cent rise in group operating profit. The shares initially reacted with a DM2.20 gain to the day's high of DM247.00 but came back after the bank said that there was no room to improve last year's DM10 dividend to close unchanged at DM244.80 Elsewhere in the sector, Deutsche Bank lost DM3.50 to DM669 ahead of its results next week, while Bayerische Hypo Bank was unchanged at DM402 on a 12 per cent increase in operating profit. Henkel lost another DM18 or 3 per cent to DM551 on Wednesday's disappointing 1992 profits forecast and Volkswagen was DM1.70 weaker at DM253.30 after the company said orders for its vehicles were declining in spite of a 5.6 per cent rise in deliveries in the first 10 months. Kugelfischer, forecasting full-year losses above DM132m as against a DM81m deficit in 1991, eased DM2 to DM112. PARIS rose briefly above 1,800 on renewed speculation that Germany would lower interest rates next week and that the franc would be devalued. The CAC-40 index rose as high as 1,805.39 but later closed up 16.10 at 1,799.43 in good turnover of FFr2.7bn. Interest-rate sensitive stocks were among the gainers, as Societe Generale rose FFr13 to FFr567 and Compagnie Bancaire put on FFr6.40 to FFr361.50. Thomson-CSF shares rose FFr6.40 to FFr132.90 on a newspaper report that the company might win an order to sell fighter aircraft electronics to Abu Dhabi. Euro Disney steadied after its recent drop, closing FFr1.30 higher at FFr57.80. The drinks group Pernod Ricard bucked the trend, falling FFr5.4 to FFr371.6. MILAN ended lower on worries that a disagreement between the treasury and the industry ministry on the timetable for planned privatisations would hold up the sell-off of state companies. The Comit index fell 6.8 to 426.46 as turnover continued to decrease steadily, to an estimated L160bn from L171bn on Wednesday. Generali was in focus, as it dropped L280 to L27,740 on one or two big sell orders. However, its drop below 28,000 prompted some buying interest, dealers said. The hotel group Ciga remained weak on worries about its financial situation and the shares fell L137 or 13.2 per cent to L898. The retailer Rinascente regained some ground after its recent fall, rising L162 to L6,732. AMSTERDAM turned its attention to Daf after the truck maker announced further restructuring plans and said that it hoped to conclude talks soon with banks regarding a refinancing package. The shares were temporarily suspended at Fl 5.40 and then closed unchanged at Fl 6.20, though some analysts commented that there was really nothing new in the announcement. The CBS Tendency index was 1.2 higher at 105.6. Cyclical stocks remained in favour with investors: DSM up Fl 1.00 at Fl 81.50, Akzo rising Fl 1.50 at Fl 137.70 and KLM firming Fl 1.60 to Fl 26.60. ING, which reported a 6.6 per cent rise in nine-month net profit just after the close, was unchanged at Fl 49.60. MADRID remained buoyant as the general index closed 2.07 higher at 211.40. Repsol came off the day's high of Pta2,600, on news that a chartered Greek tanker had run aground off Spain, raising fears that the company might be liable for clean-up costs. The shares closed Pta30 higher at Pta2,575. ZURICH was encouraged by lower short-term interest rates as the SMI index gained 4.7 to 1,928.6. SMH, the watch manufacturer, saw its registered shares rise SFr65 to a year's high of SFr1,405. STOCKHOLM eased as lower domestic interest rates failed to offset gloomy predictions for the Swedish economy. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 2.6 to 882.6 in turnover of SKr700m. VIENNA fell in light volume as the ATX index closed 8.37 down at 751.54. Wienerberger, the building materials supplier, lost Sch110 to Sch2,850 with a large sell order being noted. ISTANBUL fell back as metal workers threatened to strike and investors waited for the release today of November inflation data. The 75-share index lost 21.76 to 3,921.88 in turnover of TL192.7bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 3  THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open     10.30     11.00     12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1055.60   1054.90   1053.62   1053.18 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1133.33   1133.17   1133.34   1134.46                         13.00     14.00     15.00     Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1053.78   1056.09   1056.12   1055.11 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1138.21   1139.19   1139.42   1136.09  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Dec 2     Dec 1    Nov 30    Nov 27    Nov 26 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1052.11   1056.79   1057.75   1049.92   1048.05 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1130.96   1135.62   1132.14   1122.37   1118.56  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1057.18; 200 - 1142.56 Low/day: 100 - 1053.03  200 - 1132.45  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

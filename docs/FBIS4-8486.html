			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nicolae Militaru and Petre Popa: "Hashish Ring </F> in the Iza Valley"]    [Text] In the middle of last week, antidrug brigades in  France, Belgium, and the Netherlands arrested 79 persons during  a raid carried out on the border between the three countries.  They were carrying large quantities of drugs. The nationality of  the traffickers is not known yet but it is known that some 500  vehicles and 1,500 persons were searched and 50 traffickers will  be appearing before a Rotterdam court this week.    Seemingly without any connection to the above, some 315 kg  of  hashish was found concealed in the house of 39 year-old loan  Covaci in Salistea de Sus, Maramures County, in the Iza valley.  Placed in several hundred packages wrapped in tin foil, labeled  in Italian, put in packages and then in cloth bags, it was  buried in the ground in burlap and polyethylene sacks. A large  quantity of empty burlap sacks were ready for use in packing.    In another Maramures locality, Dragomiresti, also in the Iza  valley, a machine, made in the Netherlands, for packaging drugs,  in bulk form, by vacuum method, was found under the kitchen  floor of a countrywoman, M.M. In the same hiding place, a  number of plastic and polyethylene bags were found, along with  boxes with various foreign inscriptions.    The criminal investigators discovered a whole network of  drug  traffickers. As of now, it has been established that four more  Maramures citizens -- from Salistea de Sus, Bogdan Voda, and  Baia Mare -- are involved in the operation of processing and  clandestinely transporting large quantities of hashish which  were shipped to the port of Constanta from Lebanon. After a  short stop at the Dutch packaging machine in Dragomiresti, the  drugs were sent to the Netherlands. They crossed the border in  trucks, nestled among crates of apples and bottles of wine. It  is believed that about 5,000 kg of hashish was delivered to the  Netherlands alone, in three trailer trucks.    The activity of breaking up the ring of traffickers  continues, with the arrest of some of the persons implicated.    In the meantime, we have learned that 18.5 kg of heroin was  discovered at the Giurgiu customs inspection point on 25 March.  It was hidden in the doors and on the floor of a "Scania"  38-HT-657 truck belonging to the Tekin Uluslarasi company from  Turkey, which was transporting packages of cot ton thread. The  driver, 31 year-old Yesil Erdojan, and his assistant said that  they were delivering the "goods" to a citizen in Innsbruck,  Austria. Both are being interrogated by the police and the  procurator.</p>

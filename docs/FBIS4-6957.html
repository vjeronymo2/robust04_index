			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata, who is certain to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, indicated Friday [22 April] a prime minister should  not serve concurrently as foreign minister.    Hata, 58, told a press conference the posts of prime  minister  and foreign minister should be held by different individuals to  meet the demands of Japan's growing international role.    He pointed out that a great number of leaders from abroad  now  visit Japan and that the foreign minister should be able to  travel overseas whenever necessary.    Hata said times have changed since the 1940s, when Prime  Minister Shigeru Yoshida also served as foreign minister.    Heads of coalition parties will endorse Hata, who is also  deputy prime minister and head of Shinseito, as a candidate for  prime minister Friday afternoon following a deal struck early  Friday by coalition representatives on a draft policy platform  for a new cabinet.    Hata is certain to be elected prime minister in a Diet  election expected Monday to select a successor to Hosokawa, who  announced his resignation April 8.</p>

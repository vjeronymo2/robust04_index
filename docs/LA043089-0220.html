			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRUG-BUST PROCEEDS  </P> <P> Jeffrey Perlman's article (April 22) "Costly Preparations -- Drug Money to Pave  Way for President" indicates that Sheriff Brad Gates will spend in excess of  $100,000 for a photo opportunity that could have been scheduled in many other  Orange County locations instead of in a remote country area requiring extensive  and expensive preparation for probably less than 10% of this cost.  </P> <P> We are so underfunded in our efforts to reduce drug use that such a waste of  money is unconscionable. And the Republicans call the Democrats spendthrifts!  </P> <P> We all welcome our President to Orange County, but this scenario makes no sense  at all.  </P> <P> HENRY KLIPSTEIN  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

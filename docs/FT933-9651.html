			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Scargill takes aim at area's Pounds 5.8m A PLAN by Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, to take over the Pounds 5.8m assets of the union's Yorkshire area to ease the NUM's financial crisis has come under sharp attack from a leading Yorkshire official. Mr John Walsh, the area's agent and assistant general secretary, warns in an internal document that the scheme threatens to plunge the Yorkshire area, which is the union's largest and richest, into deficit and compel large increases in members' contributions. He has been forbidden by other Yorkshire officials to circulate his document. Mr Scargill wants to centralise the NUM by taking over control of the union's areas, which have considerable financial and administrative autonomy. Other NUM areas are also resisting his centralising moves. Yorkshire - like other NUM areas - is registered as a separate body with its own accounts and assets, reflecting the NUM's federal character. Mr Scargill was president of the Yorkshire area before he was elected to the national presidency 12 years ago. Yet the Yorkshire area council agreed last month to proceed with a transfer of engagements in a move to integrate the area fully into the national union. But such a step could be made legally only with members' approval in a ballot. This is expected to take place before the end of the year. Mr Scargill's plan is to create a new trust fund that would administer Yorkshire's total spending. A sharp decline in membership - down from 245,000 in 1982 to about 30,000 today - and the cost of the 1984-85 strike has put considerable strain on NUM finances. Last year the union had a small surplus of Pounds 31,686 according to figures just submitted to the Certification Office by Mr Scargill, but suffered a Pounds 69,772 negative cashflow on its operating expenses. Just 32,947 members contributed Pounds 1.4m to the union fund's nationally last year, while investment income totalled Pounds 233,615. But headquarters' administrative costs alone accounted for Pounds 1.3m of the union's total expenditure of Pounds 1.7m. Priority for the proposed trust's funds would first be to honour existing legal obligations and to pay benefits. But the other main uses of the fund would be to cover national office expenses, additional salary costs and any redundancy or severance money for full-time officers at national as well as area level. Mr Walsh estimates the fund's total income could amount to between Pounds 640,000 and Pounds 870,000 a year. He says the plan would mean raising subscriptions and cutting benefits for Yorkshire members. Mr Scargill has denied Mr Walsh's calculations.</p>

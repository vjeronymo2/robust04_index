			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / DoE expects increase in quarrying A 66 PER CENT increase in the amount of sand, gravel and limestone extracted from quarries in Britain over the next 20 years is forecast in a report to be published by the Department of the Environment this week. The DoE report envisages that demand for aggregates will rise from less than 300m tonnes a year to an estimated 500m tonnes by 2011. By 2005 it would rise to 400m tonnes, a 33 per cent increase. The forecast has led to a clash with conservationists who protest that such a scale of mineral extraction for aggregates - which are used in the construction industry - will lead to destruction of the countryside, planning blight and an extra burden on roads. Mr Ben Plowden, a minerals campaigner for the Council for the Protection of Rural England, said: 'It means that more aggregates will be extracted over the next 20 years than from the beginning of this century until now.' Mr John Adams, reader in geography at London University, who has drawn up a report for the CPRE, estimates that it will be equivalent to the removal of an area the size of the Isle of Wight 11 metres deep. The DoE forecast is based on an assessment that in the medium and longer term the building and construction industries will show a much stronger recovery than they did after the decline in the housing market in 1973-74. The forecast, which is published every few years, will be the basis for plans drawn up by county councils, which will then have to allow for that scale of mineral extraction.</p>

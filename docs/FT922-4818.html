			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Liffe's new era of management The board of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) yesterday voted in Nicholas Durlacher as the new chairman, succeeding David Burton. He has been deputy chairman for the past four years and stood unopposed at the board meeting, as was expected. Durlacher is unlikely to push for any major change of course at Liffe, which merged with the London Traded Options Market earlier this year. However, the troubled merger, and last year's move to new premises at Cannon Bridge in London does signal a new era for the management of the exchange. Liffe is still searching for a replacement for Michael Jenkins, chief executive of the exchange, who is stepping down in the autumn. Jenkins is to be the new chairman of the London Futures and Options Exchange (FOX). Durlacher yesterday vowed to 'fulfil the potential' of the equity product range, revive the ailing Ecu bond future and develop new products, including possibly an insurance contract. The appointment of a new deputy chairman will be the subject of next month's Liffe board meeting. One possibility is to nominate two deputy chairmen, hence dividing up responsibilities for the equity and interest rate side. Such a move might help placate former members of the London Traded Options Market, who had pushed for, and been denied, a managing director to take specific charge of equity options following the merger. With the chairmanship of Liffe taking at least two days a week, Durlacher intends to continue as chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Futures but to relinquish more of the day-to-day running of the firm to Graham Newell, who took up the position of chief executive last October.</p>

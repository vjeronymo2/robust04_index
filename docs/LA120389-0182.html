			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A BIG PLUS FOR SOCIETY  </P> <P> Last year, more than 500 students at Westminster High School left school,  ending their formal educations before they graduated. That earned the school  the dubious honor of having one of the highest dropout rates in the area. It is  virtually impossible to calculate the cost to the community and the school  caused by the loss of these students.  </P> <P> Other educators who are more resigned to such shocking statistics might have  thrown up their hands. But newly appointed Westminster High Principal Bonnie  Maspero asked the Huntington Beach Union High School District board for  assistance, and this year won $50,000 for a pilot program aimed at helping at  least some of these students graduate. She also embarked on a project to clean  up the campus and make it a more cheerful place.  </P> <P> Called PLUS -- Positive Learning Units for Students -- the program identified  50 freshmen, mostly minorities, who were "at risk" of dropping out of school  based on their eighth-grade attendance records, grades and other factors.  Students involved in PLUS get special counseling and are in slightly smaller  classes. Perhaps most important, parents are required to help their children  with homework one hour a night, four nights a week, as well as attend at least  three conferences with teachers during the school year.  </P> <P> Westminster is hoping to keep at least 25 of these potential dropouts in school  until graduation. That may seem like a tall order but it's modest if one thinks  of the sad consequences of sending young people out into the world without even  the basic skills to earn a living. If the program works, it might serve as a  model for other schools faced with similar disheartening dropout problems. And  that would be a definite PLUS.  </P></p>

The officials said the left-hand tyre of the president's  plane exploded on landing, but the plane was able to come to a  controlled stop on the tarmac after arriving midmorning.    Milosevic is here to take part in Yugoslav peace talks  between the three warring Bosnian sides, to be hosted by  mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.    Milosevic's arrival for the talks was delayed as a result of  the talks.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Banco Bilbao ahead of forecasts Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the big Spanish bank at the centre of the rescue of the rival Banesto group, yesterday reported a 2.3 per cent rise in net profits for 1993 to Pta71bn (Dollars 504m). During the previous 12 months profits fell nearly 20 per cent, leading the company to claim yesterday it had consolidated a healthy core banking business. The results were ahead of forecasts. These had suggested the group would return flat profits because lower domestic interest rates last year were expected to penalise BBV, which has a short-term concentration in its loan portfolio and a position as a net lender on the interbank market. Reduced BBV equity in companies that consolidate with the banking group contributed to holding down the net income figure and disguised a 14.9 per cent rise in operating profit to Pta155bn. The bank's capital base topped Pta730bn at the end of 1993 to give it a BIS capital ratio above 12 per cent and its total assets increased by 15.4 per cent to Pta11,600bn, making it the largest financial institution in Spain. BBV has lent scores of senior and middle-ranking executives to Banesto to salvage the troubled bank following the intervention of the authorities three weeks ago.</p>

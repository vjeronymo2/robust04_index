			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Amstrad As they might say at Tottenham, the boy's done good. Having sold a 7.5 per cent stake in Amstrad for 79p per share - putting roughly one-third of the Pounds 34m proceeds into gaining control of the North London football club - Mr Alan Sugar announced yesterday that he may be ready to bid 30p per share for the outstanding 65 per cent of the personal computer company which he does not already own. Taking Amstrad private - and completely away from the public gaze - may be a good idea at this particularly awkward stage in the group's chequered history. Ordinary shareholders, though, are entitled to feel deeply frustrated. If latest estimates that the balance sheet contains 19p of net cash per share are correct, Mr Sugar is picking up Amstrad's existing products, its distribution network and any ideas in the pipeline for just 11p. There is obviously no prospect of a counter bidder. It goes to show that it is not only continental minorities that get stuffed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Azerbaijani Army formations have been sustaining  enormous losses in their incessant attacks on Karabakh defensive  positions for the past three weeks.    The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Press Service  reported that heavy fighting continued on the north and  northeast fronts on the evening of 3 January. After losing one  tank, one infantry fighting vehicle, and 90 soldiers and  officers, the enemy retreated to its initial positions. Five  fighters were killed and 13 wounded on the Karabakh side. The  fighting has continued in these sectors since this morning.    The same source says Azerbaijani soldiers frequently  surrender. Four gave themselves up on 3 January alone and 14  have surrendered over the past three weeks. They confessed to  being forced to fight fearing execution by the so-called  deterrent detachments, which stay behind the Army formations.  According to the prisoners, the deterrent detachments are  basically formed of Afghan mojahedin because the Azerbaijanis  themselves refuse to fire on their own soldiers.    Friends, for many days now we have been unable--through no  fault of our own--to report on the situation in the border  regions of the Republic. Telephone links have been disrupted  preventing us from receiving reports from the Defense Ministry's  press service.</p>

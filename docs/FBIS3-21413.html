			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The AL-SHALL weekly economic report said that Kuwait  is currently debating the future of oil as the country's main  source of income and that the Ministry of Petroleum and the  Kuwaiti Petroleum Organization are involved in the debate that  focuses on three issues--the status of oil reservoirs, foreign  participation in the production of oil, and prices.    The text of the report follows:    There is currently no substantiated data on the condition of  major oil reservoirs, such as al-Burqan, which is of primary  importance. Studies are still in their preparatory stages. The  al-Burqan study may be completed before August 1994. Preliminary  studies of the reservoirs and Kuwait Oil Company estimates of  other reservoirs indicate that they suffered no major damage and  that the production losses they sustained from burning were  limited to three-times the regular production. Other minor  losses may have occurred in addition to capital equipment damage  as a result of sabotaging the fields and other support  facilities for transportation, gathering, warehousing, and  exporting--all of which, in the final analysis, represent the  cost of opportunities foregone in the utilization of oil money.  A Ministry of Petroleum response to a weekly magazine certainly  agrees with the above summary, even though it lacked in detail,  perhaps for political considerations.    There does not seem to be total rejection in Kuwait for the  premise of foreign participation, which is the second point of  concern. The Ministry of Petroleum's response seems to indicate  that the premise has been accepted on a technical level and may  have been the subject of precursory discussion by the Supreme  Petroleum Council. The debate revolves around three caveats as  we previously mentioned:    1.The role of people of influence in pushing through  agreements that may not serve our national interests; either by  endorsing incompetent foreign companies or by pursuing  inequitable agreements. The media of information has a  constructive role [to play] by alerting the legislative and  executive branches in order to limit the incidence of  aberrations that [tend to] proliferate in closed societies.    2. The potential for foreign government and private pressure  utilizing the carrot-and-stick approach as a result of the  invasion aftermath [as published]. This may be handled by  raising the awareness of public opinion as well as the  decision-making authorities.    3. The potential of failure in putting the country's  internal  affairs in order, especially where the public treasury is  concerned. This is a pressing matter that calls for urgent and  unpopular measures if we are to maintain a reasonable  negotiating position. It seems that the Ministry of Petroleum  leans so far towards foreign participation in all other oil  activities such as petrochemicals, refining, and transportation,  as well as in virgin territories or politically sensitive areas  of production. But the Ministry of Petroleum's intentions remain  just that; since the matter must go through normal channels to  such decision-making authorities as the government, the National  Assembly, and the Supreme Petroleum Council.    The center of controversy is the current and future  consequences of lower prices as we previously discussed. The  Ministry of Finance reported on this issue to the Council of  Ministers and recommended freezing certain expenditures such as  those for defense, reducing withdrawals from financial reserves  by 20 percent, and reducing public expenditures by the same  ratio. But short- and long-term implications exist and may be  summarized as the potential for widening the cumulative fiscal  deficit in the face of a large increase in the flow to the labor  market. Moreover, because of the need for considerable capital  to develop the reservoirs in order to boost productive capacity,  we will be in a poor negotiating position unless we contain the  deficit shortly.    The Ministry of Finance submitted to the Council of  Ministers  a report primarily based on an earlier World Bank report on  privatization, one of whose objectives was to ameliorate the  imbalances in the components of the Kuwaiti GDP, estimated at  6.3 billion dinars [KD] in 1992.    The oil sector and the government services sector account  for  76 percent of GDP, leaving 24 percent to others. But this is  imprecise because of the strong and direct links they may have  with others. The report deals, in its basic thrust, with the  attempt to face the potential for a widening public treasury  deficit, with over-employment where the surplus ranges between  20 and 40 percent, and with cost differentials. Once again, the  Ministry of Finance is to be given credit for getting that  report finished, for commenting on it, and for adopting its  general principles and presenting them to the Council of  Ministers, much as it did with its earlier report on the deficit.    The report identifies some 74 projects as candidates for  privatization within five years. Of those projects, 62 are  companies owned in full or in part by the General Investments  Authority. Half of the [remaining] 12 projects are in the oil,  electricity, and telecommunications sectors, or are part of the  General Ports Authority.    The World Bank estimates government ownership in all those  projects, with the exception of the oil sector, at about KD3.6  billion ($12 billion), of which the electricity sector alone  accounts for some KD2.2 billion and all other [sectors] account  for KD1.2 billion.    The report goes into some detail about the candidates for  privatization. It mentions, for instance, that of 62 companies  owned by the General Investments Authority, some 23 may be  privatized directly, six must be liquidated, and 23 need some  detailed study.    Differences do exist on whether the telecommunications  sector  should be fully or partially privatized, but they do not seem to  be insurmountable, and we believe that the [outcome] will be  dictated by such variables as demand, capital, and the  stipulations for privatization.    The report recommended that the electricity sector, because  of its structural defects and low prices, be overhauled before  it is privatized. We believe that there are social and political  justifications that mandate its gradual transformation, and we  concur with the recommendation to divide it up.    The World Bank recommends establishing an alternative system  for health insurance, leasing the facilities of the Ports  Authority, and selling 75 percent of all transportation  companies, including Kuwaiti Airlines.</p>

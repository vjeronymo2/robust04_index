			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met here this afternoon with  Jean Matteoli, chairman of the Economic and Social Council of  France.    They expressed hopes that bilateral relations will  experience  better development.    Matteoli and his party arrived here on April 26 on a  goodwill  visit to China at the invitation of the National Committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).    At the meeting, Matteoli said that he is deeply moved by the  warm reception by the Chinese side after he arrived here, which  has proved that bilateral relations are on a positive  development track after the China visit by the French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur.    He said that French personages from political and economic  circles spoke highly of the reception of Balladur by China and  they also hope to further bilateral relations.    Matteoli said that his talks with Chinese leaders during the  past days show that conditions are ready for the harmonious  development of bilateral relations in the fields of politics,  economy, culture, science and technology.    Qian expressed his appreciation for the active evaluation of  Sino-French relations, saying that this year is very important  for their development.    He recalled that he was warmly received when he visited  France in January this year, adding that not long ago,  Balladur's visit to China was successful.    He announced that Gerard Longuet, French minister of  industry, posts, telecommunications and foreign trade will soon  visit China, claiming that Sino-French economic and trade  relations have a new prospect.    He pointed out that "we are very pleased to see that the  development of Sino-French relations has returned to the time  when the two countries established diplomatic relations."    He noted that the tasks facing the leaders of the two  countries are to carry forward the Sino-French friendly  relations of cooperation initiated by General Charles de Gaulle,  former Chairman Mao Zedong and former Premier Zhou Enlai.</p>

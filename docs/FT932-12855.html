			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Hyperinflation threatens eastern European reform CENTRAL Europe and the former Soviet Union will need continued financial and technical help from the industrialised nations, if they are to stay on the path of economic reform, the IMF warns. Most countries of central and eastern Europe have already adopted radical changes in economic policy, but the course of reform faces considerable strains from large government budget deficits and from the threat of hyperinflation. 'The risk of hyperinflation is now the major threat to continued reform in the former Soviet Union. High and accelerating inflation has already caused massive capital flight and, if unchecked, will eventually destroy the price system and make further economic reform virtually impossible,' the report warns. The IMF's economists have revised their growth forecasts for both central Europe and the former Soviet Union sharply downwards since their last projections six months ago. Even so, they see the severe economic contraction experienced in central Europe in 1991 and 1992 slowing down this year, with growth resuming in 1994. Output is still expected to contract by 11.8 per cent in the former Soviet Union this year, and by 3.5 per cent in 1994. 'But, if macroeconomic stability can be achieved and if the economic reform programmes are followed through, most of the countries in the former Soviet Union could experience sharply falling inflation during 1993 and economic turnaround as early as the middle of the decade,' the report says. The IMF warns that government budgets are still showing considerable strains in central Europe because of the dramatic decline in tax revenues. Albania, Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia all showed budget deficits in excess of 10 per cent of gross domestic product last year. In the former Soviet Union, the republics of Armenia, Georgia and Ukraine all ran government deficits in excess of 30 per cent of GDP. Monetisation of these deficits, with excessive credit expansion by the central banks and the explosive growth of inter-enterprise arrears, are the main factors behind inflation, the report warns.</p>

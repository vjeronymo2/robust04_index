			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Markets: At a Glance - Smaller companies rally continues It was another good week for small company shares, which seem to be enjoying their long-awaited revival. But as Hoare Govett points out, the sector enjoyed a 'false dawn' in 1991. The Hoare Govett index (capital gains version) rose 2.2 per cent to 1304.77 in the week to May 14, while the County index rose 2.6 per cent to 1032.19 over the same period.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOUQUET FOR LONGTIME POLICE CHIEF, LEAVING MONTEREY PARK  </P> <P> Capt. Joseph Santoro, (who was named Monrovia police chief, Times, Oct. 7), you  may not have been the political choice, but you certainly were the people's  choice.  </P> <P> That's evident by your dedication and over 1,000 signatures presented to the  City Council (they represent the people, so they claim).  </P> <P> Unfortunately you can't take that to the bank.  </P> <P> But, Capt. Santoro, you can walk proud knowing the people of Monterey Park  respect, trust and love you.  </P> <P> Monterey Park's loss is Monrovia's win.  </P> <P> On behalf of the residents whom you have served so well for 22 years we thank  you. Good luck, Chief.  </P> <P> MARIE T. PURVIS  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

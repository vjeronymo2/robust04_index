			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 30 (CTK) -- Criticism of the Slovak  Government by Miklos Duray, one of the Hungarian minority  leaders, was today rejected by chairman of the Democratic Left  Party (SDL) Deputies' Club, Milan Ftacnik.    "(Ex-Premier Vladimir) Meciar and Duray need each other,"  Ftacnik said, commenting on the Egyutteles chairman's accusation  this weekend that Jozef Moravcik's government was not fulfilling  its promises towards the Hungarian parties. The SDL is part of  the coalition government.    Ftacnik denied the "endless speculations about the existence  of secret agreements" with Hungarian parties which the present  cabinet had allegedly concluded in return for a promise of  support from these parties.    The undertakings which the Moravcik government made when it  arose were part of its manifesto, and were being fulfilled,  Ftacnik said. Proof of this was the passing of the law on  personal names last week by the Slovak Parliament (which allows  Hungarians to register their names in the Hungarian form and not  to use the ending -ova for womens' surnames) and the fact that  on Wednesday [1 June] the "signpost law" on the bilingual names  of towns and villages is to be passed. Other issues which the  coalition government had promised to solve by the end of its  temporary term were being worked on, Ftacnik said.    However, at the weekend Duray had accused the government of  hesitation over the promised approval of the European charter of  local autonomies and minority languages.    Ftacnik countered today that the government had only  undertaken to create conditions for the future implementation of  these norms. "The agreement did not read 'approve' but 'create  conditions for'. It is unreasonable to tie a future government  to models with which it would not necessarily agree," he said.    On another demand of the Hungarian minority leaders, that a  law be passed on the transfer of property with no known  restituent into the ownership of the community, Ftacnik  commented that it was "at first sight sympathetic and  democratic," but that there could be no debate on it without the  consequences of such a law first being analysed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo May 11 TASS -- This year's first group of  Japanese has left for the South Kurils in accordance with the  programme of the visa-free exchanges between these Russian  islands and Japan, which began two years ago.    The ship, which sailed today from the port of Nemuro, north  Hokkaido, to the Kunashir island, is bringing in 48 people,  including 24 former Japanese inhabitants of the Kuril Islands,  nine representatives of the national movement for the return of  the "northern territories", and 15 journalists.    During their stay on the Kunashir island, the Japanese  guests  will meet local inhabitants, will visit a secondary school and  several enterprises. Like the previous groups of Japanese  guests, they will live in the homes of local citizens. The  delegation will return home on May 13. This year's second group  of Japanese visitors will come to the Kunashir island on the  next day after its arrival in Japan.    The third season of visa-free exchanges began for the  citizens of the Kuril Islands this April, when Hokkaido was  visited by this year's first group of Russians. The same number  of people is expected to take part in visa-free exchanges  between the two countries this year as in 1993, that is 400  people from each side. A distinctive feature of the 1994 season  is that this year's delegations will include more specialists,  able to use their trips to the neighbouring country to exchange  professional experience.</p>

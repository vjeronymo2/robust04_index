			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to PLO </F> Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, place not given, by Sa'id Mu'addi on 24  May; from the "With the Midday Events" feature -- live or  recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Ahmad, good afternoon.    [Al-Tibi] Good afternoon to you.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Ahmad, yesterday you sounded optimistic about  a date for convening the Palestine National Council [PNC].  Perhaps there are some difficulties in getting all the PNC  members together soon in the Gaza Strip.    [Al-Tibi] Did you say optimistic? I did not hear your  question.    [Mu'addi] Yes.    [Al-Tibi] Did you see my television interview yesterday? I  was very clear. It was in Hebrew. I said that the PNC will  convene in Gaza in the future. However, I said there were some  logistical, administrative, and technical problems in getting  all the PNC members together from all over the world. I said if  these logistical problems were solved in the future after the  arrival of the Palestinian uuthority and the establishment of  security, then Yasir 'Arafat would demonstrate commitment to the  agreement he signed that the clauses that relate to the State of  Israel and contravene the Oslo agreement would be amended.  Therefore, I reiterate what my brother Dr. Nabil Sha'th has  just said about the PNC convening in Gaza in the future. Some  people quoted me as saying the PNC would convene a session  shortly. I said in the future, and there is a difference  between the two. Things should be clear.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Ahmad, do you expect Yasir 'Arafat to adopt  another step to remove this crisis of confidence that erupted  between the two sides in light of the recent statements?    [Al-Tibi] Yasir 'Arafat is not the one who created this new  crisis of confidence. It is is true that there is a growing  crisis of confidence. The crisis has escalated over the past  two days after the Israeli accusation that 'Arafat plans to  violate the agreement. Some Israeli orientalists claimed that  'Arafat intends to violate the agreement just like Prophet  Muhammad violated the agreement [with the Jews]. Any primary  school student knows that Quraysh was the tribe that violated  the agreement and that Prophet Muhammad adhered strictly to the  al-Hudaybiyah Agreement, despite the difficult conditions set  for the Muslims then. Therefore, there is no need for President  'Arafat to provide another written agreement to the head of the  government, Yitzhaq Rabin, or to the Israeli Government. The  only commitment that Yasir 'Arafat signed and adheres to so far  is the Declaration of Principles signed between 'Arafat and  Rabin. Therefore, asking 'Arafat to sign another letter is  unnecessary and will not be done.    [Mu'addi] One last question. Even Environment Minister Yosi  Sarid, deemed by the opposition to represent the left side of  the political map in Israel, has criticized Yasir 'Arafat in  light of these statements.    [Al-Tibi] What is new about that? This is not the first  time that Yosi Sarid criticizes Yasir 'Arafat. He is always the  first to do so. There is a choir that always criticizes Yasir  'Arafat. This is not new. I respect some of Yosi Sarid's  attitudes regarding human rights and the need to talk to the  PLO. However, I strongly object to his style in criticizing  Yasir 'Arafat. Yasir 'Arafat will not be a mayor of the town of  Jericho because he is a leader of the Palestinian people. And  his leadership of the Palestinian people is not confined and is  not linked to statements of this sort, which are harmful and do  not help promote confidence-building.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, Yasir 'Arafat's special  adviser, thank you.    [Al-Tibi] You are welcome.</p>

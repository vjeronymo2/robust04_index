			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brothers: As we continue to forge the epic, create  the miracle, escalate our great struggle, and wage fierce  confrontations and [word indistinct] the homeland from the north  to the south, and from the sea to the river with the efforts of  our brave hands, our heroic masses, our blessed intifadah  actions, and the strength of our powerful march toward decisive  and certain victory, with Almighty God's help, and as we move  from one stage to another, advance from one achievement to  another, and from one creativity to another more brilliant  creativity--while we are doing this and more--we should beware  of the occupying enemy and be always and daily on maximum alert  for its black plots and criminal fingers that are trying to  encroach on our past and present.    Not only is this arrogant enemy fighting us with ordinary,  plastic, and rubber bullets. Not only is it fighting us with  gas, poisonous, and nerve gas bombs. Not only is it using the  ugliest and dirtiest crimes in the history of mankind. This  enemy is also fighting us with intrigues -- malicious intrigues  which try to undermine our self-confidence. You, kinsfolk and  beloved brothers, know the occupying enemy's method of cheap and  black intrigues. The occupying enemy is behind all the forged  and distorted statements. It is behind most tribal differences.  The enemy is behind most fabricated, false stories, and rumors  against any of our brothers or group.    Therefore, let us beware of the enemy, because this enemy,  which fires treacherous bullets at the chests of our children,  women, magnificent young men and girls is the same party that  directs intrigues to our spirits and morale in a bid to deal a  strong blow to us.    Let us beware of this criminal enemy, let us make the  enemy's  arrows and hateful and black schemes backfire. Let us be  patient, let us resist and arm ourselves with awareness, and  hoist the banners of national confidence. Let us bring double  retaliation and answer [words indistinct].    The intifadah is continuing, its voice is louder, its flag  is  higher, and its march is the strongest. Hail to you the sons of  our great people. Hail to you and to your comprehensive  awareness, and deep vision of things, the courage of your [word  indistinct] , the strength of your hands, and the greatness of  your sacrifices. Gods' victory is close.</p>

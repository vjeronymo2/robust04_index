			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] As with everything that breaks with tradition,  self-employment has sparked controversy in Cuban society. And  the spectrum of opinions covers everything from advocating a  complete deregulation of this activity, eliminating all controls  and restraints, to a fear of any flexibility, and a rejection of  even the most modest variants of self-employment.    The wisest course of action is to look at the phenomenon in  balanced terms. At a time of serious economic contraction, it is  a palliative for employment difficulties; it can assure the  population of goods and services and resolve myriad daily  problems by using everyone's initiative. Furthermore, it  represents an opportunity to relieve the state of some burdens.  But we must not limit its raison d'etre to temporary problems  alone. This type of employment is a new element that is being  incorporated into the Cuban labor system, a feasible alternative  that is part of the qualitative changes taking place in our  economy.    It is natural that Decree-Law 141, promulgated by the  Council  of State just five months ago to authorize self-employment, has  raised many questions, and that its implementation has been a  matter of trial and error, with many ups and downs. It is the  course of events that dictates what procedures are to be  followed and what changes need to be made. Because a decree, in  and of itself, cannot account for reality.    More than 137,000 Cubans are already working for themselves  in more than 100 occupations, ranging from plasterer to musical  instrument tuner, from palm tree trimmer to potter. It is an  inescapable reality that brings new questions: How can this  movement, which is elbowing its way into the Cuban economy, be  guided correctly? How far will it go? What are its vulnerable  sides? How does it fit into the collectivist, socializing  approach that has predominated in our society?    The first thing we must do is convince ourselves that,  economically, politically, and socially speaking, this labor  variant is by no means alien to our socialist formula, and can  in fact enrich it with a breath of fresh air that will not  represent a course change. There is no reason to fear  self-employment, and there is every reason to accept its  advantages and challenges. Otherwise, we would have to give up  and turn our backs on it, because it is easier to say no to  something we are unable to accept.    The question is how to accept it. The spirit of Decree-Law  141 comes through loud and clear when it describes the active  role the territorial governments and the neighborhood structures  known as popular councils are to play in the control and  monitoring of this activity to make sure it does not go bad or  become corrupt. Moral rectitude and social discipline should be  premises of this decentralizing phenomenon.    But we cannot remain focused on the mere purpose of the law.  The initial experiences have shown us that it is in the places  where this task has been undertaken with enthusiasm and  conviction that the fewest distortions and abuses have occurred,  and that the decree has been implemented with the fewest  problems.    It is essential that we distinguish the true self-employed  worker, that man who, through his individual effort and  striving, aspires to earn more than the average income, provided  that he earns it by honest effort and clean business practices.    He has nothing to do with the man who has stolen state  property and, through tricks and dodges, thumbs his nose at the  people's needs and shortages and displays his flashy greed,  sometimes even refusing to accept the institutionalization of  his status. This type of person generally does not register his  business. We must vindicate the many honorable self-employed  workers who are lumped together with unscrupulous speculators  and wheeler-dealers.    There is no denying that some self-employed workers have  also  gotten involved in shady deals. It is undeniable that at a time  of severe shortages, when it is impossible for the state to  guarantee the availability of raw materials and supplies, not  everyone can resist the temptation to get hold of materials  through dubious channels; but that is no excuse for people to  blame the respectable occupation of self-employment. Throwing  out the baby with the bath water is never a good idea.    A decree is being considered that would levy fines for  irregularities in the implementation of Decree-Law 141. A  rigorous inspection system would be set up. The popular council  is supposed to establish a monitoring system to accomplish this  task, and to exert control over this activity. And naturally, we  must put this phenomenon in perspective. Neither self-employment  nor any of the other measures that are being taken are mere  band-aids; and to the extent that our economy shows signs of  recovery and production picks up, the state can gradually assume  its role as balancer or supplier.    Another regulating mechanism would be taxation and the  control of self-employed workers' income. The tax that has been  levied on their income is minuscule, but it is subject to  increases as their income grows, just as it is everywhere else  in the world. Income tax returns are one way of discovering  malfeasance.    But to be fair, it is not healthy to blame self-employment  for the diversion of resources, although it can occur there,  just as well as in any other segment of society. Theft must be  neutralized at the time and place where it occurs; every problem  must be solved wherever it arises.    The self-employed should be subject to the same scrutiny as  state workers, officials, or peasants. The only way this type of  employment will smoothly fit into our economic environment is if  it is born healthy, under the watchful eye of popular control  and the discipline that the state must enforce. In this way  alone will we be able to guarantee the right of honest people to  make their living through self-employment.</p>

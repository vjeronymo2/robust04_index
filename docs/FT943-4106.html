			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rise in continental car production lifts Laird Laird Group, the automotive components and building products manufacturer, saw underlying pre-tax profits improve by 17 per cent to Pounds 23.9m in the first half helped by a recovery in continental car production in May and June. If last year's Pounds 3.1m exceptional credit is included, profits rose by just Pounds 300,000. Mr John Gardiner, chairman, said that all three of the group's divisions reported higher profits, excluding exceptional items. 'For the future the full benefits of the major investments in Draftex in Spain and the Czech Republic for the automotive industry have yet to be realised and the new plant in the US for Fullarton to supply the personal computer industry is just starting.' Underlying profits from automotive sealing systems rose 14 per cent to Pounds 10.9m on sales of Pounds 114.6m (Pounds 118.3m) despite margin pressure in Germany. Mr Ian Arnott, managing director, said he did not expect to see a rapid recovery in Germany due to the car manufacturers' efforts to reduce their costs and the transfer of assembly to lower cost countries. However, Laird saw good growth in France helped by the success of Renault's and Peugeot's small models. Profits also rose sharply in Spain where the investment in new capacity began to pay off. The full benefit from Volkswagen's new Polo, which was launched on the continent last month, will be felt next year. Underlying operating profits from the industrial products division rose 17 per cent to Pounds 11.5m on sales of Pounds 115.4m (Pounds 105.3m), largely thanks to the non-sealing systems automotive components business in France. The UK and US building products companies also turned in better figures. Helped by a lower tax charge, earnings per share rose 7 per cent to 13.2p, an increase of 23 per cent excluding exceptional items. The interim dividend is up from 4.2p to 4.4p. Although Laird does not recover all its ACT, it has so far decided against paying foreign income dividends. COMMENT Given its heavy dependence on the French and German car markets, Laird has performed extremely well over the last couple of years. Its Spanish investment has come good even though the new Polo, which was the main reason it put up the plant in 1989, is only now rolling off the production line. The non-automotive businesses are also building nicely and the French market is now recovering well. But life remains very tough. It is having to absorb some raw materials price increases in the face of fierce competition and pressure on costs from the car manufacturers, particularly in Germany. Profits could reach Pounds 44m this year which puts the shares at 406p on a multiple of nearly 17. With a yield of only 3.4 per cent the shares may struggle to make more headway.</p>

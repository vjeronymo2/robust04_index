			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson advances Recommendations from two brokers helped international conglomerate Hanson round off an active week in the London market. The shares put on 3 1/4 to 234p, with volume this time reaching 16m, after James Capel recommended the stock. Hoare Govett which issued a 46- page revue of the group's US construction interests urged investors to buy the stock suggesting it was 'undervalued'. Its current year profits forecast of Pounds 1,093m remains unchanged. Hanson has been in demand since its announcement at the end of last month that it is to acquire Quantum Chemical of the US. Container rental group Tiphook asked the stock exchange to investigate dealings in its stock after the shares dived in the first half of the session. What initially appeared to be a bear raid sent the shares crashing 45 to 283p, at the day's worst. The slide prompted the company, which reports results next Wednesday, to say the figures would include a number of accounting changes, 'to bring the company's reporting more in line with US accounting principles.' Around 45 per cent of the stock is held by US investors. However, analysts were unsure how to read the statement or how it would alter the headline profit figure reported next week. Many remain nervous after the company surprised the market with a profits warning last April. The shares rallied to close a net 40 down at 288p, on volume of 1.8m. Speculation that Thorn EMI was close to sealing a deal on the disposal of its electronics division to GEC was heightened by confirmation of negotiations from the two companies. Thorn shares gained 3 to 909p. GEC lost 3 to 316p. Ladbroke climbed 3 to 188p with SG Warburg said to be positive. Thursday's profits warning from Euro Disney again hounded the theme park operator. The shares reached a new low of 638p, a fall of 37 on the day. Vague takeover talk was heard around Joseph Holt and the stock added 63 to 3138p. BT retreated 8 1/2 to 416p as it announced that the bookbuilding that started on Thursday had already attracted sufficient bids to cover the International Offer. Wellcome was the biggest casualty in the FTSE-100 as investors fretted over reports of alternative Aids drugs. The shares fell 12 to 657p. Royal Insurance moved 4 ahead to 319p, following a recommendation from NatWest Securities. The broker said: 'Royals is the composite with most to gain from the upturn in insurance rates even after its rights issue.' Stake-building speculation returned to Sun Alliance sending volume rising to 2.7m, its highest daily total since mid-June when Transatlantic revealed a strategic 3 per cent stake, as the shares advanced 12 to 373p. Helical Bar's move to raise Pounds 20m in a preferential rights issue and an upbeat message from the chairman pleased the market and the share price moved ahead 10 to 236p. Asda Properties benefited from a BZW buy note and added 3 to 88p. In banking stocks, Barclays Bank eased 11 to 480p on a combination of profit-taking and cautious comments from US investment bank Goldman Sachs. Market newcomer Field Group continued its honeymoon with investors, adding 4 to 284p. Smith New Court moved to back the packaging company with a buy note and confidence that Field will keep its market leader position.</p>

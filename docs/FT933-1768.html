			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Starmin shareholders back Abdullah reappointment SHAREHOLDERS of Starmin, the loss-making quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former Conservative cabinet minister, yesterday backed the reappointment of a director who is considering taking legal action against the company. Mr Raschid Abdullah, who speaks for about 30 per cent of the shares, retained a non-executive seat on the board after his position came up for confirmation at the meeting, it being his turn to retire by rotation. Mr Abdullah, and his brother Osman, resigned as executive directors in July, a month before the company rescinded its dividend and announced 1992 pre-tax losses had been understated by Pounds 3.8m, deepening them to Pounds 11.9m. The adjustment followed a review of accounting policies that focused on profits booked on asset swaps. Lord Parkinson, whose job attracts an annual salary of Pounds 25,000, confirmed the possibility of legal action against the company by either or both of the brothers, who had run Starmin since 1989. During yesterday's meeting, which lasted just 18 minutes, Lord Parkinson said, in response to shareholders' queries, that Mr Raschid Abdullah, his family and allied interests 'do speak for nearly 30 per cent of shareholders and they feel that it is right that that 30 per cent should be represented on the board'. He said the board, which abstained in the vote, believed it would not be in the interests of the company or shareholders for him to comment further because of the possibility of legal action. Mr Raschid Abdullah refused to comment and is understood to have reached no firm decision on legal action.</p>

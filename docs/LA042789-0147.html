			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: NORWALK;  </P> <P> NEW CITY ATTORNEY NAMED AT LOWER RATE  </P> <P> The Norwalk City Council has appointed as its new city attorney Steven L.  Dorsey, of the law firm of Richards, Watson &amp; Gershon. Dorsey replaces  former City Atty. J. Kenneth Brown, who held the post for more than 19 years.  </P> <P> The City Council decided to rebid the city attorney's contract last November  after City Manager Richard R. Powers said that Norwalk's legal fees appeared to  be excessive when compared with several area cities with similar legal demands.  </P> <P> The city manager, however, had no specific examples of overcharging or bills  for unnecessary legal services on the part of Brown's firm. And Powers said  city employees may have contributed to high legal bills by unnecessarily  seeking legal advice. Brown said his firm provided the city with proper legal  services at a reasonable rate.  </P> <P> Dorsey's firm, which will charge the city a $5,000 monthly retainer and $135 an  hour for additional legal services, initially underbid Brown's firm of Brown,  Winfield &amp; Canzoneri, Powers said. Brown's firm was willing to renegotiate  its bid, but Powers said the council "simply wanted a change" when it appointed  Dorsey last week.  </P></p>

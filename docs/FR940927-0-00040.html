this disk as a high utilization disk and inspect in accordance with paragraph (c) of this AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For each HPC stage 7 through 12 disk with an initial utilization rate less than 1,300 hours per year or less than 900 cycles per year, designate this disk as a low utilization disk and inspect in accordance with paragraph (d) of this AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) For each HPC stage 7 through 12 disk with an unknown initial utilization rate, designate this disk as a low utilization disk and inspect in accordance with paragraph (d) of this AD. <!-- PJG

paragraph 2.D.(1)(b) and Chart A of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Recalculate the fleet or sub-fleet average utilization rate at 12 month intervals after the previous date of utilization determination in accordance with paragraph 2.B of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For fleet or sub-fleet average utilization rates that are equal to or greater than 1,300 hours per year, and equal to or greater than 900 cycles per year, continue to designate all stage 7 through 12 HPC disks as

per year or less than 900 cycles per year, within four months of compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this AD, determine the utilization rate for each stage 7 through 12 HPC disk in accordance with paragraph 2.B.(1) of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994, as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) For each HPC stage 7 through 12 disk with a utilization rate equal to or greater than 1,300 hours per year, and equal to or greater than 900 cycles per year, designate this disk as a high utilization disk and inspect in accordance with paragraph (c) of this AD. <!-- PJG 0012

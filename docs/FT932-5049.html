			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Fashion: Goodbye Wall Street, hello West Coast cool - The British male professional is turning increasingly to Hollywood for a role model JUST A FEW years ago, the sartorial and professional role model for young British professionals was Bud Fox, the aspiring arbitrageur in the film Wall Street. Now, he has been replaced by another big-screen business figure: Griffin Mill, studio executive in The Player. Things have changed: the American look and lifestyle to which British men aspire is no longer Brooks Brothers, East Coast traditional - but West Coast contemporary. As the dress code of the 1990s has become more relaxed, West Coast has replaced East Coast as the sartorial role model. For casual clothes, British men are looking to the West Coast workwear, typified by The Gap chain of fashion stores. And for business, the designer look of Hollywood executives is replacing the formality of East Coast bankers. Each world has its codes. There is a particular movie business style - a cashmere/silk blend suit with pleated trousers, saved from dark-suit conformity by a subtle stripe of, say, lilac, rust or peacock blue in the fabric; a light, designer shirt; a Giorgio Armani tie (wider in cut and lighter in fabric than East Coast power ties); and spectacular socks. Magically transported to the other coast, to the corner of Wall Street and Broadway, the Brooks Brothers-clad businessmen would stop and stare - but in Hollywood, that is just the Uniform. Even the lace-up black shoes. the classic half brogued New &amp; Lingwoods worn by Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy in The Bonfire of the Vanities, are replaced, by tasselled loafers - and in suede, too. When Sig Rogich, an advertising and PR man from Las Vegas, was brought to Washington to polish President Bush's image, his brown suede, Cole-Haan loafers immediately attracted attention. 'I'm fighting for freedom around the world,' said Secretary of State James Baker with mock scorn. 'So you can wear shoes like that?' Designer menswear took off quickly on the West Coast. It was new, and it was expensive - two endearing characteristics in LA. Italian designers use lighter fabrics, better suited to the Californian climate than the heavier weight of East Coast tailoring. Indeed, tailoring itself is seen as Old World, and Los Angeles is the place furthest from being Old World. And as with movies themselves, the entertainment industry believes in paying for big names and trusting them to get it right. So buying top-to-toe Giorgio Armani is the executive dress equivalent of investing in Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnie or Armani - it is still a low-risk investment in a high-concept name. The look spreads beyond the movie industry itself, even to sports personalities such as Pat Riley, coach of the LA Lakers basketball team, who now lectures American executives on motivation. He wears sharp, continental suits with his slicked-back hair: he is stylish enough to have featured on the cover of US GQ and attended Giorgio Armani's country house parties. And when the Lakers won their second consecutive championship, the talk was not of their achievement, but of why the coach wore a purple shirt in the victory parade. It was the UK screening of the hit television series LA Law which allowed British executives to see just how sharp West Coast dressing could be. And the BBC series Naked Hollywood, coupled with the movie The Player, have provided an equivalent view of the professionals in the movie industry. The result has been to legitimise West Coast style for British business. The West Coast look shuns the traditional trappings of preppy businessmen: no cufflinks or braces, no heavy silk power ties, no striped shirts, brogues or three-piece suits. Instead, think in terms of lighter weight, foulard ties with Art Deco-inspired patterns; plain designer shirts with unstiffened collars; loafers; and lightweight suits, dark but with an intriguing stripe, cut more loosely than traditional tailoring. The look is like the West Coast mood - lighter, and more relaxed. In LA, work is done at odd times and odd places: Sunday brunches, beach parties, around the pool. No wonder the dress codes of business and pleasure have become so intermingled. And while the lawyers and agents have relaxed the traditional business dress code, their style is still formal when compared with many West Coast men. The relaxed style of Californian dressing is something of a cliche. It is still said in New York that the edict 'formal dress' on a West Coast invitation means that you are expected to wear socks. Informality has reached such extremes in California that the Triad Artists agency recently felt obliged to stem the tide and issue a dress code, banning jeans and T-shirts during business hours. The most informal professionals in Western business are probably those in the California computer companies. The average age of employees at many Silicon Valley companies is between 25 and 33. And aside from giants such as IBM and Digital, most high-tech firms are simply too young to be shackled by orthodoxies from the past. Polo shirts, jeans and loafers are standard working attire. At Apple computers. staff favour T-shirts, shorts and Birkenstock boots. 'People put in a lot of hours around here,' says an Apple spokeswoman. 'You have to accommodate them. We have to warn executives if outside people are coming around.' And at Sun Microsystems, which employs nearly 7000 producing workstations, Scott McNeally, the chief executive, says: 'We don't have a dress code. The only rule on dress is that you must.' It is this shifting attitude to dress which has spawned The Gap, the San Francisco-based clothing chain which is now the second-biggest clothing label in the US, behind that other West Coast clothing phenomenon, Levi Strauss. What The Gap sells is dubbed 'workwear' because its style comes from blue-collar professions such as truck driving and engineering; yet it is now workwear for white collar work, such as film production, media and computing in both the US and Britain. When their stylish, black-and-white ad campaign appeared on London buses, you could see a traditionalist like shoe designer Manolo Blahnik wearing a Gap turtleneck under an Anderson &amp; Sheppard Savile Row suit. In a British menswear market looking for a way forward from traditional tailoring it was clear that this West Coast combination of the classic with the comfortable was going to succeed. It was timeless - the value we had been taught to look for in quality menswear - but also relaxed, that key word both of the 1990s and of Californian culture. The Gap now provides British professionals with the casual basics - chambray shirts, chino trousers and polo shirts - which are becoming increasingly acceptable in creative work as well as at weekends. Of course, on the West Coast those two may be indistinguishable: but that may also, eventually, be true of the wardrobes, too. As the LA look makes business dress more relaxed, and casual wear more acceptable for work, there may come a point when the two meet in the middle. Or is that just California dreaming?</p>

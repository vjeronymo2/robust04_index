			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRM FINED FOR 10 VIOLATIONS;  </P> <P> OSHA CITES EGG CITY FOR SAFETY HAZARD LINKED TO MAN'S DEATH  </P> <P> The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited a Ventura  County egg producer for a safety violation that inspectors said contributed to  the March 23 death of a worker.  </P> <P> The citation, made public Monday, also alleges that Julius Goldman's Egg City  violated nine other federal safety laws during a seven-day period in March when  the agency inspected the 300-acre facility near Moorpark. OSHA fined the  company $14,410 for all 10 violations, which range from poor housekeeping  procedures to failure to secure a protective metal plate over a machine  involved in the worker's death and failure to monitor oxygen and combustible  gas levels in grain bins.  </P> <P> Egg City officials did not respond to repeated phone calls from The Times on  Monday.  </P> <P> The inspection was prompted by a fatal accident involving Rodolfo Gomez, 31, of  Fillmore, who bled to death shortly after his right leg was severed near the  waist by a machine called an auger, which mixes chicken feed. Gomez was walking  on a runway above the augur when he slipped and displaced a metal plate  covering the device, according to a Ventura County sheriff's report on the  incident.  </P> <P> The OSHA citation alleges that the metal plate was not securely fastened when  Gomez slipped -- a condition that the company could have discovered through  diligent inspection of its equipment, said Frank Gravitt, director of the  agency's north Los Angeles area district.  </P> <P> But Gravitt said there is no evidence that the company knew about the condition  and ignored it. Therefore, the violation is classified as serious instead of  willful and carries a maximum fine of $1,000. OSHA fined Egg City $900 in the  violation, Gravitt said.  </P> <P> OSHA's findings confirm a March 23 sheriff's report on the accident. The report  said clamps used to hold the protective plate over the auger appeared to have  been removed "quite awhile ago," judging from the amount of dirt lodged in the  holes where the clamps would have been.  </P> <P> Gomez's common-law wife and two children have filed a death claim with the  state Workers Compensation Appeals Board for $97,000, the maximum they can  collect under state law, said their attorney, Victor B. Moheno. A civil lawsuit  will not be filed against Egg City because state law prohibits dependents of an  employee killed on the job from suing the employer except in rare instances, he  said.  </P> <P> But Moheno said that if an investigation he is conducting finds the company  knowingly permitted a hazardous condition to exist, he will also file a  "serious and willful misconduct" petition for $46,000 with the workers  compensation board.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grain Storage  </P> <P> Egg City was also cited for willfully violating a federal statute requiring  companies that store grain to monitor oxygen and combustible gas levels in  their silos to prevent explosions and death by suffocation. The violation was  classified as willful because interviews with workers and inspection of company  records showed that workers had complained about 10 years ago of respiratory  problems resulting from lack of oxygen in the grain bins, Gravitt said. OSHA  fined the company $10,000 for the problem, the maximum allowable for a willful  violation, he said.  </P> <P> Egg City was also cited for not having guardrails around walkways atop its  30-foot-high grain silos. Other violations include failure to install adequate  protective guards on a machine used to grind metal and sharpen tools, and  failure to build elevated stairways over machinery. Gravitt said workers in  some areas of the plant were forced to clamber over potentially dangerous  equipment because of the lack of stairways.  </P> <P> Egg City has until May 26 to contest the citations and request a hearing before  the federal Occupational and Safety and Health Review Commission in Sacramento,  Gravitt said. The company was also given various deadlines by which to correct  the violations, however, most have already been remedied, he said. The agency  will conduct a surprise inspection this summer, Gravitt said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Union Representation  </P> <P> Egg City's 250 workers were represented by the United Farm Workers until 1986  when they walked off the job in a dispute over wages and were replaced. The  strike occurred after the ranch, citing severe financial problems, filed for  protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and cut  wages by as much as 30%.  </P> <P> The company, listed as the world's largest chicken ranch in the 1986 Guinness  Book of World Records, has since been reorganized and has paid its debts, said  Arnold L. Kupetz, an attorney for Egg City during bankruptcy proceedings. A  Japanese trading firm, Okura Inc., which purchases frozen egg yolks for  mayonnaise and egg noodle products from Egg City, loaned the company about $14  million in exchange for acquiring a 40% interest, Kupetz said.  </P> <P> Diana Lyons, an attorney for the UFW, said the union has long feared that there  would be safety problems at the ranch, which produces about 2.2 million eggs  daily. She said the company intended to "save every penny regardless of worker  safety" and would not let the union inspect the facility, despite repeated  requests. The union has asked the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board for  the right to represent the workers.  </P></p>

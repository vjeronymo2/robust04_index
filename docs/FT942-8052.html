			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Brown makes appeal to tradition: Leadership contest Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday made a strong appeal to Labour's socialist past as a guide to the party's future, in a speech carefully pitched at the traditional Labour mainstream. Combined with repeated attacks on privatisation, the City and means-testing for welfare, the speech was clearly aimed at the prejudices of the constituency and union rank-and-file at Labour's annual Welsh conference. In his keynote speech to the 500 delegates meeting at Swansea for the one-day conference - truncated in the wake of John Smith's death - Mr Brown called for party unity and made no mention of the coming leadership contest. He also committed Labour to a University for Industry, partnership between the public and private sectors and a readiness to grasp the opportunities of the dawning new information age and the permanent industrial revolution now in train. But the tone of Mr Brown's speech was firmly traditionalist, laced with appeals to socialist values 'that do not change. Let us have confidence that our values are the values of the people of this country,' he told the delegates, in what some saw as a clear effort to distance himself from Labour's more radical modernisers. Privatisation and the City were the targets of sustained invective. Mr Brown contrasted 'neglected public services' with 'international companies using and abusing Britain as a tax haven, directors of the privatised industries overpaying themselves so grossly . . . (and) the waste, short-terminism and costly failure of self-regulation in the City of London'. In place of 'dividends-hungry' financial institutions, Mr Brown called for 'long-term investment agreements between UK companies and banks and pension-funds investors'. He said that an investments revolution lay at the core of Labour's industrial policy. He also recommitted Labour to a national minimum wage and a windfall tax on the profits of privatised utilities. The tax would be used to help fund radical measures to expand the capacity of the economy, including an emergency employment programme and active regional and industrial policies. Mr Brown had little to say about Europe except to condemn Conservative divisions on the issue and to repeat Labour's support for a European recovery fund and the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. The speech was well received by delegates, who had earlier debated employment and the welfare state, including a motion calling for full employment to be a key objective of a future Labour government. Outside the conference hall the mood of delegates appeared to be in favour of a contested leadership election. One said there was strong resentment in south Wales constituency parties at the 'media bandwagon' for Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary. Several delegates volunteered support for Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, because of his emphasis on full employment and his rapport with Labour's grassroots. A constituency official from Newport summed up the mood of one group in the bar: 'Blair may be the man to win the election - but at least he should be forced to debate the issues with John Prescott.' Mr Brown's appeal to Labour's roots in Welsh trade unionism - 'from its small beginnings in valleys and pit villages' in the late 19th century - could be seen as the start of a campaign to cultivate union support. Trade unionists make up one-third of Labour's leadership electoral college. Mr Brown spoke to the hearts and concerns of Welsh union officials in his audience with his commitments on employment, means-testing for benefits and a 'strategy for coal' to revive the Welsh valleys, the cradle and bastion of the 20th-century Labour party. 'We are sustained by our enduring values, handed down from one generation to another, values that do not change,' Mr Brown said.</p>

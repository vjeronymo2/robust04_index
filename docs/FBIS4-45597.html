			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by O. Gridasova: "The Poison Needle and Children: </F> Petersburg Is One of the Leaders in Number of Juvenile Addicts"]    [Text] On 14 April our newspaper published the  letter "A Poison Needle," written by a mother whose son had died  of drugs. This tragic story confirmed yet again that drug mania  is firmly taking hold in our homes. St. Petersburg has probably  the greatest number of identified juvenile drug addicts in  Russia. And the average age of this juvenile drug addition in  our seaport city keeps declining; the percentage of children  hooked on the opium group of drugs is growing at an incredible  rate: Last year 89 percent of all juvenile drug addicts used  opiates. Over the first quarter of this year this figure had  already risen to 93 percent! Are we prepared for this disaster?  Judging by the fact that the city has just one juvenile  department for... 15(!) beds operating as part of the city drug  treatment clinic, our preparedness is below average, to put it  mildly. But even this one department is being rent by problems.  Juvenile department chief Tatyana Slavina and psychologist Olga  Koltsova describe them.    "Our department was set up in March 1991 and originally was  intended to accommodate 25 beds for patients between 15 and 18  years of age. Of course, these age boundaries were frequently  violated in accepting patients, but within reasonable bounds.  The problem was different--the real number of juveniles  undergoing treatment at any given time. Fifteen was a sort of  critical level, after which the department began to literally  "split at the seams," which made it very difficult for medical  personnel to keep a handle on the process and the children under  control.    "Treating drug addicts is not an easy job. People suffering  from drug addiction are very aggressive: Their will is destroyed  but at the same time they are very inventive and are capable of  conceiving many sophisticated methods of deceiving a doctor or a  nurse in order to get hold of the drug they crave.    "To these traits that are common for all drug addicts, the  juvenile environment adds its own age-related peculiarities.    "First, a juvenile is mostly peer-oriented in his behavior,  and if the sociopsychological microclimate in the department is  conducive to giving up drugs, the chances for success in  treating the children increase dramatically. And vice versa, if  the work with the collective is not successful, treating each  individual juvenile becomes nearly meaningless.    "Second, a specialist working with children knows that  multiple-substance addiction is most common among them: These  kids are going through a stage of so-called drug  experimenting--they are looking for a drug that "suits" them  most, or use whatever they can get their hands on. Therefore, it  is very difficult for the medics to find an appropriate form of  treatment in these conditions.    "Next, unlike adult drug addicts, who are capable of  understanding the need (perhaps a last-chance one) for  treatment, children completely lack the sense of danger inherent  in drug use. The motivation to undergo treatment as a rule does  not stem from this factor: A juvenile is brought in either by  the militia or parents, but he will never come on his own. Which  means he may run away at the slightest real opportunity.    "Finally, strange as it may sound, adults are more careful  and neat: A veteran drug addict will rarely use a dirty syringe  or an unpurified opiate (or other drug) solution. A juvenile may  mix into the opium solution an inexpensive medicine--he usually  has a money problem; a `dirty' drug costs less but will deliver  the same kind of `high' as the pure one.    "So this work is not easy, and the department has gone  through difficult experiences: We tried different methodologies  for treating children--from complete freedom and democracy in  relations with juveniles to strict compulsory measures. We read  books and magazines, attended seminars held by foreign  psychologists, until we understood that a child suffering from  drug addiction needs first of all medical help (any  psychotherapy is secondary) provided in a well designed  environment. And the important part in this is the small number  of children undergoing treatment in the department and the  cyclical nature of accepting new patients, when a group is  accepted at the same time and remains together until they are  discharged four weeks later.    "A new patient coming into the treatment program has a  ruinous effect on the others, and all our efforts, all the  agreements we enter into with the juveniles when they are  accepted, go down the drain. It is not the children's fault,  since drug intoxication is a `psychological infection' of sorts  and can be easily `transmitted' from a new patient to those who  have just shaken off the burden of drug addiction.    "And we have already mentioned a strictly limited number of  patients.    "Without adhering to these conditions, our work essentially  turns into Sisyphean toil: The doctors want to help the  children, but the existing overcrowding does not allow them to  do what is best for successful treatment. The result is failure;  the staff disappointed and dissatisfied with their work. So if  the city truly wants to help juvenile addicts, they have to give  us real help."    The opinion of professionals: St. Petersburg should  have not one department for juvenile drug addicts but several  clinics, where different methods of treatment will be offered.    Let us note that so far this is not universally accepted.  Moreover, sometimes there is talk about closing the only  "unprofitable" clinic. It is ineffective, they say. But what is  meant by effectiveness in this case is the number of patients  "treated" per certain number of beds, while the quality of  treatment apparently does not bother anyone.    Meanwhile juvenile drug addiction in St. Petersburg is  growing. Over the past three years it has doubled. And this is  if we are to believe official statistics.</p>

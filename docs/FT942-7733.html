			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Growth report gives Celsis shares a fillip Celsis, the biotechnology company which was valued at Pounds 60m when it came to the stock market in July 1993, saw a sharp rise in costs and sales in the year to March 31. Spending on research and development rose from Pounds 156,000 to Pounds 984,000 while a rise in the number of employees from 15 to 48 and the associated costs of growth, took overheads from Pounds 349,000 to Pounds 1.3m. The flotation proceeds lifted net current assets - an important figure for a low-sales, high investment biotechnology company - to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 770,000). A pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.58m compared with a deficit of Pounds 460,000 for the six months to end-March 1993. The shares rose 4p to 91p compared with the flotation price of 100p that gave a market capitalisation of Pounds 54.6m. Mr John Precious, chairman, said the new financial year had started well. New products were well on track. For 1993-94, sales of the company's one product, a contamination detection kit, increased by 46 per cent to Pounds 172,000. Fee income brought total turnover to Pounds 274,000. The contamination kit is used by Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company and the Thames Water and Severn Trent water companies. Each kit costs about Pounds 500 and is good for 500 tests, said Mr Chris Evans, the company's founder and 26 per cent stakeholder. What the company regards as potentially its biggest seller, the Digital kit for detecting and quantifying low levels of contamination, is scheduled for launch in the last quarter of 1994. The company said that it had signed a collaborative deal with Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company, to determine the feasibility of using Celsis technology in hygiene monitoring. It also launched a new product yesterday, the Colony Counter, which automates part of the laboratory testing for microbes.</p>

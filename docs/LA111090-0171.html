			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANA MAKER OF CIRCUIT BOARDS FILES BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> Facing a cash crunch and unable to raise new funds, Metropolitan Circuits of  California on Friday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in federal  court here.  </P> <P> The company, a manufacturer of printed circuit boards and a subsidiary of  Metropolitan Circuits Inc., had assets of about $6 million and debts of $10  million, said spokeswoman Cecilia Wilkinson.  </P> <P> "The company's financial condition made it impossible to get the financing  necessary to meet the company's cash needs," said Richard Sandberg, chief  executive officer of the parent company. "Hopefully, the company will now be  able to restructure its indebtedness and obtain the necessary financing."  </P> <P> Under Chapter 11, a company is allowed to continue operations while developing  a plan to reorganize and pay off its debts.  </P> <P> The subsidiary's two major secured creditors are General Electric Co. and  Advanced Dielectric, Wilkinson said. It also has 165 unsecured creditors.  </P> <P> The parent company last reported financial results a year ago. For the nine  months ended Nov. 25, 1989, the company reported a loss of $830,000 on sales of  $5.1 million, compared to a loss of $1.1 million on sales of $5.6 million a  year earlier.  </P> <P> Wilkinson said the subsidiary hired turnaround specialist Kenneth C. Cleveland  in October to assist in its restructuring. In addition, Paul G. McNamara,  former president of Anaheim-based Aeroscientific, was named president of  Metropolitan Circuits Inc.  </P> <P> The subsidiary, Metropolitan Circuits Inc.'s only operating unit, laid off  about 50 employees in recent months, leaving the company with 257 employees.  </P> <P> The American Stock Exchange has halted trading of the parent company's shares.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Amin] </F>   [Excerpt] The Central Bank of Jordan [CBJ] has decided to  give initial licenses to certain banks to reopen their branches  in the towns of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, which have been  closed since 1967. The move follows the Cabinet's approval of  the move and the signing of the Jordanian-Palestinian economic  accord, which regulates the financial and economic ties between  the two parties.    CBJ Governor Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-Nabulsi yesterday told  AL-DUSTUR that the CBJ has given initial licenses to five  Jordanian banks to reopen branches in the occupied Palestinian  towns as follows:  The Arab Bank: Two branches, one in Nabulus, one in Gaza.    The Jordan Bank: One branch in Janin.    Jordan and Gulf Bank: One branch in Nabulus.    Jordan National Bank: One branch in Nabulus.    Arab Land Bank: Two branches, one in Bethlehem, one in  Gaza.    Dr. al-Nabulsi noted that these licenses are initial, and  the  banks that are allowed to open branches must complete all  measures and file all the necessary documents.    AL-DUSTUR learned that these branches will start their work  after gaining the approval of the Israeli monetary authorities  in accordance with the agreement reached through the  Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli economic committee meetings in  Washington.

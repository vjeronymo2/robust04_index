			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhou Maosheng (0719 5399 3932): "Carefully Guard </F> Against `White IOU Slips' From Foreign Investors"]    [Text] In recent years, China has opened its doors wider to  the outside world, vigorously developed its export-oriented  economy and actively attracted foreign investments. This has  brought about rapid development of the Sino-foreign joint  ventures and cooperative and wholly foreign-funded enterprises,  and instilled vitality into its economy. However, a considerably  amount of funds from foreign investors have not arrived on time.  Some foreign businessmen have not contributed all their  investments and repeatedly delayed their payments, while others  have refused to pay. This has left some of the joint ventures  with signboards of joint ventures only.    In late 1992, a department concerned in a certain city  conducted a survey on how much foreign investors were paying  toward their share of their registered capital. Among the 52  enterprises surveyed, their foreign investors owed a total of  US$9.2 million, accounting for 70.9 percent of the total  investment. Five of the wholly foreign-funded enterprises owed  as much as 83.9 percent of their registered capital. One  enterprise with foreign investment has gone into operation for  more than two years, but the foreign investor has not paid  anything yet. Right now, only 14 of the 52 enterprises have  subscribed their capital, accounting for 26.9 percent of the  total number of enterprises surveyed. In addition, there are a  dozen or more enterprises with foreign investors with problems.  Some of them have already stopped production (closed) and made  preparations to nullify their registration, while others have  ceased to exist except in name.    There are many reasons for the issuance of "white IOU slips"  from foreign investors. In order to fulfill the targets in the  development of Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative and  wholly foreign-funded enterprises and score "political  achievements" in attracting foreign investments, some districts,  departments and enterprises have vied with one another in making  joint investments with foreign investors. They are eager to  attract foreign funds. They are so hungry that they are not  choosy about their food. They blindly start operation without  carefully checking the credentials of their foreign partners. At  times, the Chinese side of some joint ventures only outwardly  signed the agreement of joint operation with foreign businessmen  in order to put on the joint venture "red cap" and enjoy the  preferential treatment given by the state policy to any  enterprise with foreign investment, while some foreign  businessmen are making use of the eagerness of the Chinese side  to develop joint ventures and availing themselves the loopholes  in the management to run "fake joint ventures." As a result,  this has made the Chinese side of the joint venture suffer and  lose money.    In order to put an end or reduce the number of "white IOU  slips" from foreign businessmen, it is necessary to further  improve the investment climate. In addition, I believe that the  following measures should be adopted:    1. In screening and approving any application from any  enterprise with foreign investment, the department concerned  must strictly check and verify the reputation of the foreign  businessman.    2. In the course of forming the joint venture, the Chinese  side should, first of all, ascertain the foreign investor's  ability in fulfilling the contract and his reputation in doing  business first; and stipulate clearly in the contract the time  limit for him to subscribe the capital and his responsibility  for delaying payments or breaching the contract.    3. In dealing with those enterprises which have not been  paying for their investment contributions on time, it is  necessary to send a "notice of overdue payment for registered  capital" to foreign investors via mail, FAX or telephone to urge  them to make payments before the deadline.    4. It is necessary to strictly implement the "Regulations on  Capital Subscription for Sino-Foreign Joint Ventures,"  strengthen check-ups on how foreign investors are making  financial contributions to their joint ventures, and place them  under strict control. It is essential to nullify, according to  law, the registration of those enterprises with foreign  investments which have not subscribed their capital for a long  time, although they have been repeatedly reminded of their  overdue payments.    The establishment of the Sino-foreign joint ventures and  cooperative and wholly foreign-funded enterprises is something  inevitable in history. We should strive to become more matured  and smarter in the course of dealing with foreign businessmen,  and help enterprises with foreign investments further develop  themselves in a healthy way.</p>

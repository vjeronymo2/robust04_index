			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Mayhew apologises for remark on grenade blast: Comment on explosion was 'expression of relief' SIR Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, last night apologised for an apparent gaffe which had threatened fresh embarrassment for prime minister John Major's increasingly accident-prone administration. In a letter to Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick said he 'much regretted' any distress caused by his remark about a grenade explosion in Belfast on Saturday that injured nearly 30 people. This had been made as 'an expression of relief' that no one had been killed in the incident, the Northern Ireland secretary said, adding: 'I saw at once that it could have caused offence.' Sir Patrick had angered Mr McNamara and Ulster Unionist MPs after joking that 'nobody was dead' after the explosion during a loyalist parade in the Shankill area of Belfast. Mr McNamara later condemned Sir Patrick for making 'flippant and unfeeling' remarks and wrote demanding an apology. The row followed the decision by the BBC in Ulster to broadcast a recording of remarks by Sir Patrick made when visiting the opera in Castleward, county Down, with the prime minister on Saturday night. The scene had been planned as a delicate public relations exercise, designed to demonstrate that there was more to Belfast than bombs or dole queues. Mr John Major's party had swooped in army helicopters into the elegant grounds of Castleward to see Donizetti's Lucia Di Lammermoor. Faced with a barrage of press questions on recent explosions, Mr Major insisted as he strode across the grass: 'We have only come for the opera. I have no comment to make.' Sir Patrick, however, after saying he would not comment until briefed, said: 'Well, nobody is dead yet. At the end of this opera, everybody is dead.' As the faces of his hovering press officers froze, Sir Patrick quickly added that it was no joking matter. He went on to express his outrage to the waiting cameras. Sir Patrick's aside was seen as insensitive by local politicians - and highlighted the precarious task faced by Northern Ireland secretaries, who rarely win a loyal following among the province's politicians. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said Sir Patrick's remarks had been 'absolutely disgraceful.' Mr McNamara last night accepted Sir Patrick's expressions of regret, saying: 'He dropped a clanger. He has apologised which is more than most members of this government do when clangers are dropped. There the matter rests.'</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Gatt warns Canada on growing US ties GROWING concentration of Canada's trade with the US reveals the risks as well as advantages for Canada of the free trade pact between the two countries, a Gatt report warns. The report on Canadian trade policies, discussed by Gatt's governing council yesterday, says the US/Canada free trade agreement (FTA) has boosted intra-industry trade, promoted investment, encouraged new employment and abolished many protective rules. But it has shown weaknesses in Canadian industry, a large chunk made up of small and inefficient companies. In the past two years, the US recession has hit Canada's manufacturing strongholds, including the car industry, and contributed to bilateral trade frictions, the report notes. In 1990, 72 per cent of Canada's trade was with the US. The need to avoid over-reliance on US trade had underpinned Canada's involvement in Gatt and the Uruguay Round. Canada sought a strengthened Gatt framework to provide 'an external anchor' for regional integration, and to ensure balance between participants. Canada's recession had been aggravated by developments on world markets for its traditional exports, including grains, timber and minerals. Canada's grain farmers had been devastated by the US-EC subsidies war. Canadian producers had been hit by the entry into world markets of metals exports from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and world over-capacity in forestry industries. Gatt members yesterday welcomed Canadian moves to more trade liberalisation, but criticised aspects of policy. They stressed the need for the FTA and the future North American Free Trade Agreement to be trade-creating and consistent with Gatt principles, noting that, in contrast to its push for a more open trade regime for grains, Canada was trying to keep import curbs for less competitive farm sectors.</p>

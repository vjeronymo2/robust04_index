			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Wilson arm helps Amer return to the black AMER GROUP, the Finnish consumer goods group which includes Wilson Sporting Goods in the US, bounced back into the black last year. It reported a profit, after financing costs, of FM93m (Dollars 17.2m) for the year to the end of February, compared with a loss of FM35m in the previous year. Net group sales of FM7bn were up only a fraction from FM6.96m, but increased sales and profitability overseas, particularly in the sporting goods division, helped strengthen the group result in spite continued recession in the home market. Sporting goods sales rose 18 per cent to FM2.9bn. The vast majority of this  -FM2.7bn - was accounted for by Wilson, which saw sales growth of 4 per cent in dollar terms and 18 per cent in markka terms, as demand grew for its racquets, golf equipment and team sports goods. By contrast, Korpivaara Companies, Amer's vehicle importing division in Finland, saw sales fall by 10 per cent to FM1.67bn as new car sales in Finland declined for the third year in succession. There was an 11 per cent fall in sales at the paper division, to FM1.43bn, and a 4 per cent fall in the tobacco arm to FM569m. Publishing and printing rose 18 per cent to FM463m. Amer predicted net sales for the 1993-94 full year of FM7.5bn, with overseas sales accounting for 70 per cent of the total, compared with 62 per cent last year. It said profits would improve. Earnings per share were FM2.80 in the year to the end of February, compared with a loss of FM1.80 in 1991-92. The dividend was unchanged at FM2 per share. Amer, traded on the London Stock Exchange since January following changes in Finnish law to allow foreign ownership of Finnish shares, said 25 per cent of the group's outstanding shares were now owned by foreigners.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Brittan outlines bank charge plan: EC cross-border transfers EC CONSUMERS could save more than Ecu1bn (Pounds 710m) annually in bank charges, if banks and building societies follow European Commission guidelines aimed at making it easier and cheaper to transfer cash across borders. Sir Leon Brittan, the financial services and competition commissioner, yesterday unveiled the Commission's programme for improving cross-border payment systems in time for the launch of the single European market in 1993. 'It's a cumulative approach, not a big bang approach,' he explained, urging banks, users and public authorities to work towards a cheap, quick and reliable system. An independent study will be commissioned at the end of this year to assess progress. If it is still dissatisfied, the Commission may then press for formal legislation to improve the system. The paper includes a five-point users' charter calling for banks to provide clear and consistent information to the customer on transfer methods and costs. According to the Commission, private and commercial users should be able to complain to national ombudsmen if they experience problems. At the moment there are some 200m cross-border retail payments annually, costing on average about 20 times more than the same domestic transfer. Brussels aims to encourage electronic links between national clearing houses  -which handle domestic money transfers. David Barchard adds: APACS, the UK organisation which handles payments and clearing, yesterday welcomed the proposals. UK banks are relieved that Sir Leon and the Commission have not tried to impose a framework on the market at this stage. Groupement des Cartes Bancaires, which represents French banks belonging to the Eurocheque system, said it would appeal to the EC's lower court against a Ecu5m (Pounds 3.57m) fine imposed by the European Commission, writes Andrew Hill. Brussels has accused the banks of striking an anti-competitive deal with Eurocheque, the cheque guarantee organisation, to charge French retailers every time they accepted a Eurocheque. Eurocheque was fined Ecu1m.</p>

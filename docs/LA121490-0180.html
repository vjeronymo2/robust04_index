			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: SINATRA BIRTHDAY PARTY -- ALL THE GUESTS WERE IMPRESSED  </P> <P> "DARLING, ALL these years you've given the world beautiful, wonderful music,  but you have given me the world. . . . One more thought, the fourth time around  is really lovely!" said Barbara to Frank Sinatra at the private party after his  Meadowlands concert in New Jersey on Wednesday on the occasion of his 75th  birthday.  </P> <P> Barbara Sinatra was a dedicated and ravishing hostess at the Waldorf in New  York when about 200 of the creme de la creme of the Sinatra world gathered to  exude the milk of human kindness together -- because I don't believe there was  a soul there who wasn't just a little bit "impressed" to have been invited.  </P> <P> I know I was. My fellow scribes Maxine Mesinger and Shirley Eder were also  there, and Sinatra didn't get mad at any of us -- a night to remember.  </P> <P> First, we had drinks in the Empire Room, where videos of the famous, each  wishing Sinatra well, were playing. Frank said, "I can look at those later" as  he worked the room, looking very trim and slim and wearing a red birthday tie.  </P> <P> Then the tributes. Tina Sinatra, weeping: "You are an American treasure. I am  so grateful that you're 75 and I expect so much more from you because without  you, I'm nothing."  </P> <P> Frank Jr. attributed his father's long life to his eating properly and never  letting smoke or alcohol touch his tongue.  </P> <P> Sinatra responded: "These few days have been sensational for me. It was 6,000  to one that I'd get to be 50 years old; but 75? I love it. I've had some fun in  the past weeks and a few tears."  </P></p>

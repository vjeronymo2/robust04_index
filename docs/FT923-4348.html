			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Interest rate rise pushes lira higher THE Italian lira recovered slightly yesterday in response to the raising of the discount rate by 1.75 points to 15 per cent by the Bank of Italy on Friday. But the price of this defensive measure, raising the discount rate to its highest since 1985, was a sharp fall on the Milan bourse. Share prices retreated an average 3.02 per cent as analysts worried about the impact of higher interest rates on a wide swathe of quoted companies. Since the beginning of the year, but especially in the past two months, share prices have fallen 30 per cent on the Milan bourse. Yesterday, the commercial banks emphasised the high cost of credit by following the discount rate rise. Most commercial banks raised their prime rates in line by 1.75 points and the upper limit of rates now charged to customers moved as high as 23 per cent. The lira was fixed yesterday at 763.40 against the D-Mark, compared with Friday's 765.40, the floor level permitted within the European Monetary System. The lira has been under particular pressure during the past 10 days since the first polls in France showed a majority would vote against the Maastricht treaty in the referendum on September 20. A no result would profoundly affect Italy which has a huge public sector deficit, high indebtedness, above average inflation and a weak currency. Foreign currency dealers said the lira remained vulnerable even though the authorities have made clear their determination to defend the existing parity and the Bank of Italy can call on unlimited credit from its stronger EC partners.</p>

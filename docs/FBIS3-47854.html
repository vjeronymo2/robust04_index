			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu by KBS </F> commentator Yi Chong-su and CHOSON ILBO editorial writer Kim  Hyong-kon from the program "KBS Diagnosis of Policies"--live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Kim Hyong-kon] The greatest  pending issue in our diplomacy last year was the North Korean  nuclear issue. However, with the beginning of the new year, a  sign for the solution of the problem has appeared. North Korea  reportedly said that it will accept inspection of seven  facilities and the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks is  expected to take place soon. However, the issue of special  inspection has not been raised. How do you assess the present  status of the North Korean nuclear issue?    [Han Sung-chu] Ten months have passed since North Korea  declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  [NPT] on 12 March last year. But the nuclear issue has not been  resolved up to now. I feel regret and sadness over this.  However, this does not mean that we wasted this ten months. We  can prevent this problem from going to an extreme situation.  Moreover, there was no sign that North Korea manufactured  nuclear materials during this period, or used this period for  developing and manufacturing nuclear weapons. As you pointed  out, although we cannot fully assure this, a sign for the  solution has also appeared.    The agreement and comprehension between the United States  and  North Korea and discussion on ordinary and ad hoc [imsi]  inspections between the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] and North Korea are not the negotiation or agreement for  the final solution of the North Korean nuclear issue. They are  of significance in further seeking an essential solution through  insurance of continuity of nuclear safeguards by IAEA and  through the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks. Therefore,  the special inspection, which you mentioned earlier; insurance  of nuclear safeguards; North Korea's complete nuclear  transparency pertaining to the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula; comprehensive checking of North Korea's nuclear  development; and the like, can be regarded as preparatory  measures for the next stage, rather than as present-day problems.    [Yi Chong-su] What were presented as preconditions for the  third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks was insurance  of North Korean nuclear transparency and another was tangible  progress in North-South dialogue. We understood that only after  this, the third round of talks can be held and the issue of  improvement in relations and cooperation can be discussed.  However, recently, the issue on tangible progress in North-South  dialogue has not been briskly mentioned even though considerable  progress appeared in North Korea's nuclear inspection issue.  Will you tell us about what degree of progress in North-South  dialogue will enable the United States and North Korea to  discuss the third round of high-level talks and the issue of  normalizing relations?    [Han] We may say that there is progress in ensuring  continuity of IAEA's nuclear safeguards measure. There is no  change in the policy to regard such progress as an indispensable  step for future dialogue.    Likewise, there is no change in the policy of calling for  tangible progress in North-South dialogue. Therefore, although  this issue has not been emphasized openly and discussed loudly,  the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks will not be held  without tangible progress in North-South dialogue.    [Kim] With a sign for the solution of the North Korean  nuclear issue, do you think that tangible progress in  North-South relations can be expected in the new year?    Some people view that North Korea would reluctantly come to  dialogue with the ROK merely for the sake of negotiations with  the United States. What do you, the minister, think of this?    [Yi] In the event that the North Korean nuclear issue is  resolved to a certain degree and progress is seen in North-South  dialogue, do you think there is a possibility of North-South  summit talks?    [Han] It is too early for us to say that a summit is  possible or impossible at the moment. However, there is no need  to exclude the possibility of a summit after the stumbling  block, also known as the nuclear issue, is removed. [passage  omitted]    [Yi] I would like to ask a question about how the ROK should  maintain relations with the four neighboring big countries of  the Korean peninsula. At the end of the Cold War era, can  ROK-U.S. relations be a little distant or should they become  even closer?    To what degree should relations with Japan be close? Is it  alright even if relations with Russia are somewhat distant, and  how close a relationship should we maintain with China?    [Han] In maintaining relations with the four big countries  surrounding the Korean peninsula including the United States, it  is not desirable to consciously designate precedence and order  of the countries to keep close or distant relations.    However, relations with the United States still remain most  important in terms of security, economy, and diplomacy.  ROK-Japan relations are also very good at present in various  aspects. In fact, the relations are better than ever before.  Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa visited the ROK last November  and held a summit with the ROK. The two sides agreed to develop  relations in a forward-looking manner by overcoming the past to  the greatest possible extent. I think this is possible.    As for relations with China, since relations were normalized  in August 1992, remarkable progress was effected in the trade  field, and cooperation in other fields has also been  satisfactory. In particular, China cooperated with the  international community for the solution of the nuclear issue  and made a great contribution to solving this problem through  dialogue. I believe that China will also contribute to this in  the future, as well.    As for relations with Russia, since diplomatic relations  were  established, good relations have been maintained. Although the  issue of payment in economic cooperation still remain as a  pending issue, ROK-Russia relations have not been affected  seriously by this. We hope to maintain good relations with  Russia. We also hope that Russia will satisfactorily achieve  political and economic stability at home. Thus, we will maintain  good relations with the four countries, and amid balanced  cooperation among these big countries, we will secure our own  position.    [Yi] Will you explain how you are going to implement the  policy for reunification?    [Han] The policy for reunification is closely related to  pursuing our 5-point basic goals. We may divide it into three  stages. One is how peacefully and productively we should manage  the present status of division. For example, the solution of the  nuclear issue stresses the necessity of diplomacy to manage the  division.    Next, the diplomacy for achieving national reunification and  for winning the support for this is necessary. In other words,  we should carry out diplomacy to convince the neighboring  countries that our reunification is not contradictory but  corresponds to their interests and to ask for their cooperation.  This is applicable not only to the aforementioned four countries  but also to many other countries. We should also seek  cooperation from international organizations, including the  United Nations.    Last, we should prepare ourselves for the postreunification  era. We should review how to maintain relations with world  nations and international organizations after the reunification.  This is the issue related not only to the Foreign Ministry but  also to the National Unification Board, other government  offices, and the people.    [Yi] Thank you, Minister Han, for being with us today.</p>

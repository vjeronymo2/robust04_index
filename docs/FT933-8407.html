			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Arts: Tales of two cities - Architecture When the summer feels more like the autumn, which it does in England this August, there are only two things to do. One is to escape to the sun, the other is to curl up with a good book. I suppose you could combine the two activities, but I have never found it easy to read on a beach or to do anything very much at all in the hot sun. Two good new books this summer may give readers the opportunity to mug up a bit on some appropriate regional architectural history before they travel or even to get on with some continuing education of a fairly serious kind. As far as I know, there is not yet a bluffers' guide to Tuscan towns or a simple introduction to the Baroque of the Balearics. But there are other ways of immersing the mind in architecture and often the less obvious books are the best. Visitors to the Edinburgh festival can this year enjoy the architecture of the city with a new edition of Charles McKean's guide book. Edinburgh: An Illustrated Architectural Guide (published by the Royal Incorporation of Architects of Scotland, Pounds 9.95, 236 pages). This new edition of the guide was sponsored by The City of Edinburgh District Council and Edinburgh Enterprise Limited for the European Summit last December, but it is a timeless guide that should be in the hands of every visitor to the Edinburgh festival. It is an advantage to have a pocket-size guidebook, but I wish for more from Mr McKean particularly because his picture research is so good. The are wonderful visions that were never built, like Robert Adam's 1791 proposal for a new bridge to link Calton Hill to Prince's Street, and J. Dick Peddie's view of a completed Parthenon high above the city. The author is also good at making the visitor look about him and think of the future of the city as well as what is before him. As McKean says, Edinburgh is about to have a new Opera House, a conference centre, a new headquarters for Scottish administration and the sizeable Maybury business park. Does the city have a policy for the residential rejuvenation of the Old Town or for phoenix-like transformations to follow on that of Leith? What about the future of the Trinity area, which McKean memorably describes as a home for the 'unbuttoned mercantile princes of Leith and artists, maiden ladies and mistresses?' Edinburgh is much enlivened by this book, with its clear explanations of the differences between the old and the new towns of Edinburgh and its simple exposure of the incredible architectural wealth of a city that still keeps many of its glories, both classical and gothic well hidden from its native residents as well as festival guests. Mr McKean opens Edinburgh's architectural doors. ***** From the Athens of the North to Rome. I was fascinated by a book about that intriguing Roman building the Villa Madama which, although unfinished, remains a key point of reference in Italian Renaissance architecture. Villa Madama: a memoir relating to Raphael's project by Guy Dewez (Lund Humphries Pounds 35, 184 pages) is an unusual kind of architectural history. The author uncovers the plans and proposals of Raphael for his patron, Cardinal Giulio de Medici, who was the first cousin of and Secretary of State to Pope Leo X. Construction began on the villa in 1518, but Raphael died in 1520 and, although work continued under the direction of Giulio Romano, it was never completed. It was a project of great importance in the early Cinquecento, ranking with the Michaelangelo commissions in Florence and marking the importance of the Medici presence at the gates of papal states. Today the villa is hard to see, as it is in the custody of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It lies to the north-east of Rome, high on its hillside among woods and gardens. It is used in much the same way as the Medici planned - a place for high-level foreign ministry meetings and state receptions. Guy Dewez has clearly been obsessed, in the best sense, by this incomplete masterpiece and his researches are accessibly published here in a way that convincingly shows how the villa would have looked if it had been finished by Raphael. It was a perfect example of the Renaissance wish to idealise the antique Roman villa - a place where the pleasures of civilisation could be enjoyed and demonstrated in a rural setting. The discovery and publication in this book of a letter from Raphael to his patron provides us with a first hand account of the artist's intentions. Raphael writes of the siting of the villa to 'face the most salutary winds'. Part of the villa is to be a circular structure, 'lit through a ring of glass windows, each of which is successively visited by the sun from the time it rises to the time it sets - a delightful place in which to hold polite conversation.' Bathing was clearly an important part of villa life and Raphael thought it important to be able to bathe in the sunlight: 'in front of the window a place where one may lie in the water and be washed by one's servant without coming under his shade . . .' This delightful letter is supported in the book by many romantic 19th century photographs that show the incomplete villa in an agreeable state of arcadian decay. The author's own immaculate measured drawings provide a lucid vision of how the villa might have looked if completed. This kind of informed speculation about such an important place makes for the best kind of architectural history because it stimulates the historical imagination.</p>

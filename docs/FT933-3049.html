			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Georgian president returns A CONFIDENT Eduard Shevardnadze reclaimed his job as Georgian president and threatened a new crackdown on rebel fighters yesterday after forcing parliament to grant him emergency powers, AP reports from Tbilisi. Mr Shevardnadze had submitted his resignation in a manoeuvre to force parliament to approve a state of emergency, then suspend its session. Capitalising on the disarray, rebels associated with former President Zviad Gamsakhurdia captured a strategic rail and road junction in the west, using armoured personnel carriers and grenade launchers. Parliament first balked at the emergency law, but capitulated after more than 10,000 protesters massed outside.</p>

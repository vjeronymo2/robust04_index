He graduated from the Economics Faculty at M.V.  Lomonosov Moscow State University and completed his postgraduate  studies at Tbilisi State University. He defended his  candidate's dissertation in 1980 and his doctoral thesis in  1990. He has been a professor at Tbilisi State University since  1991. Between 1988 and 1993, he was head of department at the  Georgian Academy of Sciences Institute of Economics. He began  his political career in March 1992 when he became government  adviser on economic questions. In October of that year he was  elected to Parliament. In November, he was appointed Republic  of Georgia minister of the economy.    He is married and has two daughters.    On 10 December 1993, Mikhail Dzhibuti resigned.    [Adamashvili] The plaque outside the office of the minister  of the economy still bears your name. Has your resignation been  accepted and how has the government responded to it?    [Dzhibuti] As it was solely my decision to quit my functions  as minister, it can only be a question at this stage of when a  successor will be appointed.    My decision was taken not for the usual reasons of family  circumstances or health; I resigned in order to draw the  public's attention to the chaos that exists in the management of  the economy.    The reaction to my resignation was the same as that when  dead  people are being discussed, that is to say when nothing is said.  The entire reaction came down to the level of human feelings  being hurt: Why didn't Dzhibuti warn us? Surely, our relations  didn't merit this? And so forth. For me personally, this is  more insulting than anything. After all, I am on friendly terms  with many people in the Cabinet of Ministers and I have not  rejected these relations. I do not agree with the activities  that the current Cabinet of Ministers is implementing in the  economic sphere. Of course, it is possible to name those  principally involved but, nonetheless, it is a question of  collective responsibility. Each member of the Cabinet of  Ministers is responsible for the policy conducted by the  government. I dissociate myself from the Cabinet of Ministers  as a whole and from its individual members precisely as far as  this responsibility is concerned.    [Adamashvili] What caused you to resign? By what thoughts  were you guided in taking this step?    [Dzhibuti] A connection exists between a system and  subsystems. A system is made up of subsystems. However, the  characteristics of a system are something more than the simple  total of subsystems. The characteristics of a system do not  repeat the characteristics of any one of the subsystems of which  it is made up, whereas any subsystem in a system bears the  characteristics of the system. This can be applied to the  Cabinet of Ministers where any minister is like a subsystem.  When the Cabinet of Ministers acquired the antireformist  characteristics of a system and the sphere of activities of this  system -- parliament and the head of state -- did not repulse  this immediately, this situation became unbearable for me with  my outlook and capabilities.    I thought that my resignation would serve as an SOS and that  economic policy would become a subject of serious discussion.  Unfortunately, this has not happened. Neither in the government  nor in parliament nor in economic institutions and faculties....  All this confirms the state of dreadful torpor not only of  those managing the economy but also of general economic thinking  and emphasizes the casual approach to the economy in all  segments of society and among all politicians.    [Adamashvili] You have said that the reason for your  resignation was your disagreement with the forceful methods used  to manage the economy. How did pressure from the government on  your branch specifically manifest itself?    [Dzhibuti] In Georgia, the Soviet style of managing the  economy has not changed. There has been no reform of  macroeconomic, branch, regional, and microeconomic management.  Socialist enterprises prevail in industry and collective farms  in agriculture and supply depots and auctions in the sphere of  trade. Almost half of agriculture is subordinate to the  Ministry of Defense. That is to say, everything that existed  under the Soviet system has not been touched, including the  administrative style of management. True, this management is  not having as great an effect as it used to since the communist  binding mechanism does not exist. However, the directorate is  not in a hurry to implement reforms. It likes being the boss  even among ruins. This also does not run counter to the  interests of the ministries in charge. State ownership was as  big a fiction as public ownership under the Soviet system. In  actual fact, all property was in the hands of the nomenklatura  and this is how it has remained to this day. Only a reform of  the system can create state ownership before which both  directors and ministers will appear not as lords but as  employees. Political pressure on the economy is also being  determined by the fact that the destruction of the district  soviets has proved meaningless while managers are, in the main,  "Soviet."    [Adamashvili] What have you personally done in order to  break through the situation that has taken shape? In what  instances were you hindered and prevented from acting in what  you considered to be the right direction?    [Dzhibuti] I have done everything in order to expound an  economic strategy and tactics in the form of a document. Such a  document should have become a guide to action for all branches  of management. By following it, it would have been possible to  have overcome the obstacles of mentality and ignorance. At the  same time, it would have been possible to have judged the  activities of certain managers and levels of management. A  program aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability and  implementing system changes was contained in this document. A  draft indicative plan for 1993-95 was drawn up....    I think one cannot pick out individual cases when I was  hindered. The obstacle was a permanent one as, for example, of  the two draft government decrees, one either contradicted an  earlier decree adopted by the government or was aimed at  restoring administrative management and individual power.    [Adamashvili] How do you view the situation that has taken  shape in the republic's economy today? What timely measures  should have been taken to prevent the crisis and the plunging of  the coupon? What else can still be done in order to save  Georgia's economy? In what direction should we work?    [Dzhibuti] One can characterize the situation as follows:  the chaos of disorder. The crisis and the coupon are  incommensurable quantities. Let's begin with the crisis.    There are several qualitatively different reasons for the  economic crisis in Georgia as well as for that in all  postcommunist states. The first set of reasons have nothing to  do with internal republican factors: These are the collapse of  the Soviet Union and Russia's obvious or not so obvious attitude  to events in Georgia. The second set of reasons are of a  republican nature: The conflicts in the Tskhinvali zone and  Abkhazia, the civil war, internal political disorder, and so  forth.    In general, it was impossible to prevent the crisis.  However, it would have been possible to have reduced it by  removing the internal republican reasons.    As for the coupon, it is connected with the state of the  economy and the monetary and credit policy. Depending on what  this policy is, the devaluation of the coupon can be halted  within a very short period of time. Everything here depends on  who is managing the economy and how. The general strengthening  of the currency depends on the restoration of the strength of  the republic's economy. The coupon itself, that is to say the  national currency, is not the reason for the crisis. On the  contrary, we have survived almost a year with just the coupon.  Since November 1992, Georgia has received no kind of assistance  to strengthen its currency system. In addition, a national  currency represents the foundation of an autonomous economic  system without which political independence does not exist.    In order to save Georgia's economy, we have to refrain from  social experiments and implement the declared policy of economic  reform and not put spokes in the form of legal nihilism in the  wheel of natural economic development due to ignorance,  dilettantism, and personal profit. We have to work toward  improving people's lives and in so doing, we must follow the  path of civilization and not unexplored tracks in our history.    [Adamashvili] In the event that your resignation is not  accepted, will you agree to continue in your former position and  under what conditions?    [Dzhibuti] At the given stage, unless circumstances change,  my decision remains final. However, if a reformist-minded  Cabinet of Ministers is formed and guarantees are given that the  system transformations contained in those programs and the  indicative plan in which I participated will be implemented and  the opportunity presents itself, I will work with pleasure and  with no less responsibility on implementing the transformations.    There has probably not been a minister anywhere in the world  who, having resigned, has not thought about becoming minister  again!</p>

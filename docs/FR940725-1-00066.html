			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed new &sect;23.1583(c)(6) would establish the zero wing fuel weight of &sect;23.343 as a limitation. This would provide the pilot with information necessary to prevent exceeding airplane structural limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1583(d) has editorial changes only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1583(e)(1) and (2) would delete references to ``characteristically incapable of spinning.'' As discussed under &sect;23.221, requirements for ``characteristically incapable of spinning'' would be deleted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1583(e)(3) and (4) would replace present paragraph (e)(3). Proposed &sect;23.1583(e)(4) would add the requirement for specifying limitations associated with spirals, six turn spins, or more than six turn spins. The requirement for a placard has been deleted since the requirement would be covered in &sect;23.1567. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1583(e)(5) would be based on current paragraph (e)(4) for commuter category airplanes. It would be revised to define the maneuvers as those proposed for commuter category airplanes in &sect;23.3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1583(f) would revise the heading of the paragraph and add the limit negative load factor for acrobatic category airplanes. The limit negative load factor is essential for safe operational use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1583(g) would make editorial changes with no change in requirements. The paragraph would reference the requirements of flight crews in &sect;23.1523. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1583 (i), (j) and (k) are the current &sect;23.1583(k), (l) and (m), as redesignated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1583(l) would require furnishing baggage and cargo loading limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1583(m) would require furnishing any special limitations on systems and equipment. This would provide the pilot with information necessary for safe operation of the airplane systems and equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1583(n) would require a statement on ambient temperature limitations. Maximum cooling temperature limits have been required for turbine powered airplanes by &sect;23.1521(e); however, the requirement for the limitation has never been specified in &sect;23.1583. Proposed &sect;23.1583(n) would require furnishing both maximum and minimum temperature limits if appropriate. A minimum temperature limit would provide the pilot with information necessary to avoid airplane damage during low temperature operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1583(o) would require furnishing any occupant smoking limitations on the airplane. This would enhance safe operation of the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1583(p) would require the applicant to state what runway surfaces have been approved. This provides the pilot with a positive indication of which runway types may be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1585&blank;Operating Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would rearrange the current material in &sect;23.1585 and add additional requirements as discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1585(a) would contain the requirements applicable to all airplanes. The requirements would be arranged in a different order from the current requirements in paragraph (a). The requirements for information that must be included cover_unusual flight or ground handling characteristics; maximum demonstrated values of crosswinds; recommended speed for flight in rough air; restarting an engine in flight; and making a normal approach and landing in accordance with &sect;23.73 and &sect;23.75. All of these requirements are in current &sect;23.1585(a) except for restarting a turbine engine in flight, which is in current paragraph (c)(5) pertaining only to multiengine airplanes. The FAA decided that a restart capability is not required for single reciprocating engine airplanes for the reasons given in the preamble discussion of proposal 3 in Amendment No. 23&hyph;43 (58 FR 18958, April 9, 1993). The requirement for providing restart information should apply to single turbine engines, since turbine engine designs incorporate a restart capability and inadvertent shutdowns may occur. Normal approach and landing information in accordance with the landing requirement in proposed &sect;23.73 and &sect;23.75 is new. This is necessary to enable pilots to achieve the published landing distances and, if necessary, to safely transition to a balked landing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1585(b) would be a revision of &sect;23.1585(b) on gliding after an engine failure for single-engine airplanes. The proposed version would reference requirements in proposed &sect;23.71. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

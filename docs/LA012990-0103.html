			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'ASPECTS' HEADS FOR BROADWAY  </P> <P> The four London stars of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical "Aspects of Love" will  bring the show to Broadway, publicists for the show announced.  </P> <P> Ann Crumb, Michael Ball, Kevin Colson and Kathleen Rowe McAllen have signed to  reprise their London roles when the hit show opens April 8 at the Broadhurst  Theater.  </P> <P> Ball, who is British, and Colson, who is Australian, are being allowed to work  on Broadway under an exchange agreement with the actors' union, Actors Equity.  Crumb and McAllen are American.  </P> <P> The situation is in marked contrast to the 1988 Broadway debut of Lloyd  Webber's "Phantom of the Opera," which was preceded by months of acrimonious  negotiation between the composer and the New York branch of Actors Equity over  the employment on Broadway of Lloyd Webber's wife, Sarah Brightman.  </P> <P> Lloyd Webber eventually won, and Brightman opened the show in New York  alongside the two other original London stars of "Phantom," Michael Crawford  and Steve Barton.  </P></p>

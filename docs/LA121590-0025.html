			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> THE STRUGGLE AND TRIUMPH OF 'A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST' ON CHANNEL 28  </P> <P> PBS' "Wonderworks Family Movie" scores high marks for "A Girl of the  Limberlost," airing Sunday at 5 p.m. on KCET Channel 28.  </P> <P> Based on part of Gene Stratton Porter's novel, set in 1908 rural Indiana, it's  the story of a gifted 15-year-old who struggles against poverty, the scorn of  her peers and her widowed mother's bitterness, to find her own future.  </P> <P> As Elnora Comstock, Heather Fairfield is a believable mixture of vulnerability  and unquenchable stubbornness, with a memorable smile in her moments of  triumph.  </P> <P> Joanna Cassidy ("Who Framed Roger Rabbit," "Under Fire"), as the soignee  naturalist who inspires Elnora, doesn't have much to do except provide a  sympathetic presence. But Annette O'Toole is a surprise as mother Kate. Most  recently seen in the Stephen King TV thriller "It," O'Toole eschews all glamour  here. Her Kate is stocky, hard-faced and weathered, sullen over the fate that  left her to a life of endless toil.  </P> <P> Under the resentment is pain and love, and O'Toole shows it through the  gruffness, but not too often, and not too soon.  </P> <P> Pamela Douglas' screenplay is predictable, filled with a climactic storm, a  ruined crop, an adorable orphan, a villainous tax collector and helpful  mentors. But the heroine's consuming quest for knowledge is a refreshing theme,  and Burt Brinckerhoff's thoughtful direction and solid principal cast make  enjoyable watching. LYNNE HEFFLEY  </P></p>

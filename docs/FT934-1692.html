			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / More like a prime minister Heaven alone knows what the Downing Street declaration will do for Ireland, north and south. Will it bring peace? A lasting settlement? We have to wait for prolonged silence, or a bomb blast, to give us the beginnings of an answer. Yesterday's statement by the president of Sinn Fein, Mr Gerry Adams, was redolent of peaceful promise, but takes us no further. Meanwhile it is open season for wishful thinkers. Optimists can let their fancy flow free, down to the speeches by the British and Irish prime ministers when, following Mandela/de Klerk, they collect their Nobels. Sceptics, or those who harbour pet Ulster theories, can predict doom and disaster. Armchair strategists can set up their imaginary battlefields and pit 'loyalist' terrorists against their IRA opponents. Patience, patience. There is no telling what will happen, and therefore no way of estimating the eventual effect on the standing, before their present electorates and in the eye of history, of Mr Albert Reynolds and Mr John Major. All that can be said today is that the taoiseach and the prime minister have shown courage and imagination. Against the odds, they have co-authored a document that allows for a united Ireland while obliging those who seek one to persuade a majority of the people of Ulster to vote for it. This was accomplished by rewriting, in the language of the nationalists, Britain's long-standing promise that it will protect the unionists. Both leaders have done well. This should be acknowledged without quibble or qualification. Mr Major in particular sounded more like a prime minister when he spoke in the Commons on Wednesday than he has since Britain was ejected from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 and he lost his authority. This time he had the best house since the Gulf war, with members listening intently to his every word, breaking concentration only to approve. His manner had become less hesitant, his voice less uncertain. This was, for once, a politician at ease with himself. Take, as a single example, his response to Rev Ian Paisley, who had spoken of people being 'slaughtered, butchered and murdered' by the IRA. His constituents, said Mr Paisley, looked on the Downing Street declaration as a 'sell-out act of treachery'. With rare passion, Mr Major turned on the Democratic Unionist and replied that he wished to make sure that there was no more bloodshed. Politicians had to have the courage to address the problem. 'I am prepared to do that. If the honourable gentleman believes that I should not, he does not understand the responsibilities of the prime minister of the United Kingdom.' We have, in short, seen the prime minister rise to an important occasion. In handling Northern Ireland his most effective qualities have come to the fore. Major the negotiator, he of Maastricht, saw to the detailed haggling. Major the whip, he who has survived in spite of a dwindling parliamentary majority, has ensured that most susceptibilities were catered for in the drafting. Major the chancer, he of the hard Ecu and the safe havens, proved willing to throw the dice in Ireland. Let us set aside cynicism, and grant that these characteristics have been enhanced on this occasion by a proper sense of the responsibilities of his office. The prime minister will be strengthened if a wearily cynical electorate is equally charitable. His weakness arises from the disrespect in which he is held by natural Conservative voters. On Wednesday morning, before the declaration on Ulster was published, Mr Major was the least popular prime minister since polling began. Rebuilding a reputation in such circumstances takes time. It cannot be achieved by a single outstanding performance on a powerful Wed-nesday afternoon. More is required. Events in general have to be in his favour. The prime minister may be given his due on Ulster, while yet suffering the fate of his predecessor. To take a more exalted example, remember what happened to Winston Churchill after he led Britain to victory in the second world war. That said, the favourable news is beginning to pile up. The Uruguay Round of the Gatt negotiations has been completed, setting the markets further towards the stratosphere. The prime minister intimated yesterday that Europe in general and Britain in particular would gain more from trade liberalisation than most of the other participants. Downing Street's role in helping the process forward was subtly suggested. Mr Major knows that the performance of the economy is paramount. On Wednesday the latest monthly indicator showed the annual rate of inflation still at 1.4 per cent. Yesterday we saw a further fall in unemployment. The Conservatives in Parliament have continued to hold steady on other matters, as they have done since the prime minister concluded his devil's pact with the right at the party conference in October. A carefully crafted Queen's speech, avoiding difficult legislation, and a strategy of limiting the length of time Parliament sits, have helped reduce the number of 'Tories split' headlines. These developments could have been designed to create a feeling that perhaps the government is not doing so badly after all. Mr Major's job was in some immediate danger during the summer. That crisis has passed. The sense that nobody is in charge of the administration has to some extent been countered by the wizardry of Mr Kenneth Clarke. The chancellor's recent Budget may have added to the March Budget's imposition of the greatest tax increase anybody could remember, but it demonstrated control, 'grip', command. Mr Clarke's opinion after Budget day was that its positive political effect would not be reflected in public sentiment for a year or so. That may still be true. We have now had three years of Mr Major as prime minister. He has been flat on his face much of the time, but he did win in April 1992, against many predictions. The next opportunities to vote will come at local council elections in May and elections to the European parliament in June. The conventional wisdom in October was that he had about a year in which to restore his and his party's popularity, or face a challenge to his leadership. He has made a good start to that year of trial. A triumph in Ireland would, if it came, take his rehabilitation further.</p>

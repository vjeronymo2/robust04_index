			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UN to dig up mass graves in Croatia A TEAM of United Nations pathologists today will oversee the excavation of mass graves in eastern Croatia in the former Yugoslavia, amid calls from the international community for the creation of a war crimes tribunal. A team of pathologists and archaeologists is due to visit Ovcara, a village near Vukovar in eastern Croatia devastated last year by the Yugoslav army. They will dig up a grave where some 300 civilians and Croat soldiers are feared to be buried in cornfields after being taken from Vukovar hospital and executed by Serb forces when they seized the town in November last year. It was uncertain whether local Serb authorities in the UN zone would try to obstruct the investigation which could incriminate high-ranking Yugoslav army officers. The UN team is headed by Mr Clyde Snow, an American pathologist who has conducted similar investigations in Central America. The excavation could produce evidence for a war crimes tribunal to try those responsible for atrocities in Croatia and Bosnia. The US and France are discussing creating a permanent international war crimes court whose first task would be to try war criminals in former Yugoslavia, the French foreign ministry said yesterday. Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen yesterday made a surprise foray into Serbian domestic politics with an appeal to voters to choose peace in this weekend's presidential elections, Reuter adds from Geneva. The co-chairmen of the Geneva conference seemed to urge support for moderate candidate Mr Milan Panic when they said that 'this election will choose the course of peace and not the policies of war'. Mr Panic, who returned from California to become prime minister of the rump Yugoslavia in July, is competing for the Serbian presidency against Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the hardline nationalist incumbent</p>

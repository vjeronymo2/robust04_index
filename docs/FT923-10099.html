			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / University research cost plea UNIVERSITIES MUST charge companies, government departments and charities the full costs of the research they sponsor, the government's Advisory Council on Science and Technology said in a report yesterday. Acost also called on the government to increase funding for academic science at more than the rate of inflation, but said universities should be more selective in the range of research they carry out. Sir Robin Nicholson, Acost chairman, said: 'The failure of universities to identify and recover the full costs of research sponsored by external agencies has added to the financial pressures.' Acost recommends the government not only to increase the research councils' budget but also to give universities additional funds to underpin the infrastructure for research. Institutions 'should ensure that the additional funds are used to improve the support given to existing staff and facilities, rather than to employ more researchers, and are allocated on the basis of the quality of the research undertaken'. The research pressure group Save British Science welcomed the Acost recommendations for full cost recovery and more government funding. It rejected the call for greater selectivity, which it called 'a recipe for withdrawal from more areas of science, which risks slowing rather than simulating contacts with industry'. The Office of Science and Technology said it would reply to the Acost report in due course. 'Meanwhile the government recognises the importance of full cost recovery.'

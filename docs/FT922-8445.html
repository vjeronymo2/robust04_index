			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (3): The difference between economic reform and revolution - Optimistically, the government hopes to achieve large-scale privatisation by the end of 1993 or rather counter-revolutionary - policy of the Russian government. For mass privatisation is the difference between economic reform and revolution. Price liberalisation and macroeconomic stabilisation could, in theory have been attempted by reform communists. But successful privatisation would spell finis to Bolshevism. Its aim is not just to create a new, more competitive economy. It is to create new classes, new attitudes and new relations between government and the governed. Counter-revolutions are prima facie no easier to make than revolutions, especially when, as was true of Lenin's proletariat in 1917, the class that will be the obvious beneficiary - the bourgeoisie, both big and small - now hardly exists. The government does not even possess secure control over the levers of national power. Its sole advantage is, in the words of Anatoly Chubais, minister for privatisation (or, more precisely, 'chairman of the committee for the management of state property of the Russian Federation'), that the planned privatisation involves a move 'from an absolutely artificial to a normal economic system'. Privatisation means the assignment of existing socialised property to private owners. But, more fundamentally, it demands effective establishment and protection of private property in its three main aspects - the right to use property, the right to enjoy the income and the right to dispose of it. The government hopes - over-optimistically, beyond a doubt - to achieve much of the transformation by the end of 1993. For 1992, Mr Chubais has set himself three main tasks: To make irreversible the privatisation of small enterprises, by auction or tender. To turn large enterprises into joint stock companies, followed by at least partial privatisation of most of them in the course of 1993. And to solve the problems involved in distributing privatisation vouchers to the population. Experience in both Poland and Czechoslovakia suggest that rapid privatisation of small enterprise is both feasible and effective. Partly influenced by these successful examples, the decree of the president of the Russian Federation on privatisation, promulgated on 29 December 1991 (decree number 341) puts most small enterprises into the category of 'obligatory privatisation'. However important it may be, even small privatisation has gone slowly so far. But a start has been made with a programme that the government hopes will prove a replicable model for the whole of Russia: that for mass small-scale privatisation in Nizhny Novgorod (previously Gorky), Russia's third largest city and traditionally its main trading centre. This city was chosen by the government and the International Finance Corporation (an affiliate of the World Bank), because of the enthusiasm of the governor and mayor and because of the relatively low level of corruption in that city. The intention in Nizhny Novgorod has been to sell off some 2,000 small businesses over the six months following the start of the programme in March. Privatisation is by auction, either of long-term leases or of outright ownership in the case of stand-alone premises. But some product lines, notably bread, will have to be kept by auctioned shops for a year. In addition, existing employees enjoy discounts in the auction. The auction in Nizhny Novgorod has started successfully, argues the minister, if in a small way, with just 21 shops sold at the first auction on 4 April. But a precedent has now been established, one that the rest of Russia will be required to follow. To that end, the government will use what Mr Chubais calls 'traditional instruments, acceptable to the normal Russian mentality. We have mandatory tasks for each region, which show the proportion of enterprises that must be privatised by the end of this year.' As is shown in the chart, the December decree lays down such quotas in fine detail, to be acted upon by regional governors appointed by the president. What will be the fate of recalcitrant governors? They will be dismissed, says Mr Chubais. But he is hopeful that this will be unnecessary, since 'normal bureaucrats don't want to be the first, but also don't want to be the last. Each must now choose his own strategy, because the way is now clear. They know that if they are the last in the queue, there is a danger that they will be dismissed. 'This is not just a governmental position, but the position of President Yeltsin. We have enough instruments to force local authorities to do the job,' he says - though, Mr Chubais admits, this may well not apply to the autonomous republics. Resistance of local authorities is only a part of the problem. That of managers and workers is at least equally significant. The need to carry out privatisation speedily is why Larissa Piyasheva, adviser on privatisation to Gavriil Popov, the radical mayor of Moscow, recommends selling property at low prices to workers' collectives. Strong objection to Ms Piyasheva's views comes from Yelena Kotova, until recently General Director of the Moscow State Property Office. For her, as for Mr Chubais, auctions of property are essential. Such ideological conflicts, along with the fierce political struggle between the mayor and the Moscow City Soviet (council), have led to a stalemate on privatisation in Moscow. Mr Chubais, for his part, reluctantly accepts Moscow's autonomy as, in his words, 'another republic.' But for Russia as a whole, he far prefers auctions: because merely granting enterprises to workers at a negligible price does not change their behaviour; because the revenue generated by privatisation - Rbs2bn in the first quarter of 1992, up from Rbs200m in the whole of last year - is itself valuable; because benefits from transfer of state property into private hands should be shared by the population as a whole, not just by workers; because experience in Nizhny Novgorod demonstrates that the objections of workers' collectives can be overcome, especially if many win in the open auctions, as they have in about a third of the cases; and because auctioning need be no slower than giving enterprises away. The government believes that it is its duty to 'find a balance between the interests of those inside and those outside the enterprises.' It intends, therefore, that in the privatisation of both small and large enterprises 'there will be privileges for different social groups; it is very important that people do not feel this exercise is for the benefit of the old nomenclatura and the mafia.' Workers, for example, will receive 25 per cent of the equity in larger enterprises, and managers 5 per cent, but both in the form of non-voting shares free of charge. Workers will also have the opportunity to purchase an additional 10 per cent of shares in their enterprise at a discount of 30 per cent. For similar political reasons, privatisation vouchers will be distributed, not later than autumn this year, says the minister, with the precise details of the scheme to be decided by mid-May. Meanwhile, for Russians who can afford to pay - of whom a part will, indeed, be drawn from those who had been high up in the previous power structure, or who had acquired their money illegally - there will be an open auction of shares, without any privileges. All this assumes that the government can halt, or at least contain the pace of 'spontaneous privatisation', whereby managers of enterprises and local bosses are diverting the assets of state enterprises into their own hands. Mr Chubais is optimistic - 'we have had no legal basis for privatisation until now: all privatisation has been semi-legal. The only way to curb spontaneous privatisation is to introduce a normal legal structure,' he says. Now that the west has made a commitment to provide Dollars 24bn to Russia, Mr Chubais also expects that there will be a substantial capital inflow into the country. Foreigners will, therefore, be allowed to play a part in privatisation. But the minister says that there should be no special exchange rate for the rouble, to be used when buying shares, as was formerly mooted. Instead, Mr Chubais says that the Government intends to 'multiply the book value of the property (when sold to foreigners) by some co-efficient. There could be special auctions only for foreigners - but this is still to be decided.' A special privatisation programme is also being prepared in the energy sector. Most state enterprises are to be involved in privatisation by the end of 1993, though the plans for next year are far from firm - 'there will be resistance and so we must be quite flexible,' says Mr Chubais. Flexibility will certainly be needed. An immediate problem is the financial straits to which attempted stabilisation has already reduced many of these enterprises, a problem the minister regards as 'serious, but temporary.' Where enterprises are bankrupt for technical or structural reasons, privatisation will be combined with attempts to make enterprises healthier, says Mr Chubais, perhaps through use of foreign credits. Nobody can have any doubt about the scale of the obstacles - social, political and economic - to the property transformation that the government is intending. The question of privatisation of land, for example, is still highly sensitive, as was shown in the debates in the Congress of People's Deputies. Privatisation of large enterprises raises still more difficult questions. Will the government be able to bring these enterprises under effective state ownership once more, this being a necessary condition for their privatisation? Can it implement the kind of voucher system that has so far defeated the Poles? Will owners and managers be found who are capable of steering the giant enterprises of the former Soviet economy within a competitive market economy? Can the government make bankruptcy a credible sanction against their failure? Last, but far from least, can the government avoid the need for comprehensive prior restructuring of unviable enterprises and, if not, does it have the resources, both human and financial, to bring such restructuring about? Privatisation is, it is now clear, no magic wand. The Polish precedent shows that Russia will be struggling with the industrial legacy of the Soviet state for years, if not decades. Nevertheless, if the government were to achieve even a small part of what it now intends, its counter-revolution should prove irreversible.</p>

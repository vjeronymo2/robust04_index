			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses focus on special situations in mixed trade INDIVIDUAL stocks featured in mixed trading yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was dominated by special situations. The CAC-40 index fell 15.41 to 1,928.18 in turnover of FFr2.5bn. Pechiney International jumped FFr7.60 or 4 per cent to FFr198.60 in heavy volume of 765,600 shares after getting the green light to sell its aluminium activities to its parent, leaving it with the more profitable packaging side. Dealers were surprised that the shares reacted to strongly, since the restructuring had been widely expected. Investment certificates in the parent fell FFr6 to FFr327 with 65,250 units traded. CMB, another packaging group, fell 90 centimes to FFr198.90 with 125,000 shares traded. Some analysts expect investors to switch out of CMB into Pechiney International. Perrier fell FFr63 or 3.9 per cent to FFr1,545 with 64,650 shares traded. There were rumours that the Agnelli group and Nestle had done a deal to resolve the struggle for the mineral water company, whereby Nestle would pay FFr1,575 per share to the Agnelli group, giving it a capital gain, and in return, Nestle's bid would be unopposed. Euro Disney is due to replace Perrier in the CAC-40 index by today. FRANKFURT gave up some of its early gains to close with the DAX index 2.11 higher at 1,732.18, after an intraday high of 1737.77 and a 2.18 gain to 704.45 for the FAZ at midsession. Turnover eased from DM4.4bn to DM4.3bn. Company news moved shares both ways. BMW rose DM4.50 to DM553.50 on expectations of a 10 per cent rise in net profit when it reports today. Schering dropped DM7.90 to DM849.10 on fears that Japan might shelve plans to legalise the pill. Schering ran sixth in the active stocks list in turnover of DM205m. Asko came 10th as it rose DM25 to DM770 on Tuesday's story that profits could treble between 1990 and 1995. AMSTERDAM again focused on Heineken as it reached another record high, closing up Fl 4.80 or 2.6 per cent at Fl 186.00. The CBS Tendency Index rose just 0.2 to 125.8. Since reporting better-than-expected 1991 results nearly two weeks ago, Heineken has gained over 11 per cent. Investors have taken confidence from the results and signs that the company's performance in 1992 will be even better. Grolsch was pulled along by Heineken to close up Fl 1.00 at Fl 207.00. Elsevier also recorded a new high, gaining 20 cents to Fl 117.70 ahead of tomorrow's 1991 results. VMF Stork slipped back 80 cents to Fl 44.40 after reporting a modest rise in 1991 net profit. MILAN closed higher but dealers wondered if the bourse could hold on to its new-found strength. The Comit index rose 6.81 or 1.4 per cent to 510.09 in turnover estimated at L95bn after L80bn. Cir, the holding company of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, rose L58 or 3.5 per cent to L1,713 following news earlier this week that the group had raised L120bn by selling a stake in a German automotive parts company. Italcable rose L200 to L5,500 after reporting 1991 results in line with expectations. Italgas recovered from a drop earlier in the week on disappointing 1991 figures, closing up L90 to L3,418. Some analysts said they were downgrading their 1992 forecasts, citing margin pressure and increased debt levels. ZURICH saw slightly higher profits and a rise in dividend, but no stock split at Brown Boveri, whose bearers rose SFr70 to SFr3,640 and gave the market a firm tone as the all-share SPI index closed 3.2 higher at 1,133.7. STOCKHOLM majored on Tuesday's Wall Street gains and steady profits from Asea, co-owner with Brown Boveri of the international operating company, ABB. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 13.8 to 1,002.5 as Asea B climbed SKr14 to SKr338. The forestry index closed 3.9 per cent higher, with Stora B up SKr14 to SKr289, on US recovery hopes. MADRID weakened ahead of today's holiday. The general index closed down 0.67 at 258.55 in turnover of some Pta12bn against Pta10.8bn. OSLO rallied with the all-share index closing up 8.07 or 1.9 per cent to 432.45 in turnover of NKr438.62m. Norsk Hydro put on NKr4.5 to NKr149.5 while Saga Petroleum free shares closed NKr3 higher at Nkr89.00. ISTANBUL was boosted by a cash inflow from bond maturity repayments and the 75-share index closed up 128.05 or 3.4 per cent at 3,899.15 in turnover of TL235.8bn. VIENNA's ATX index rose 11.72 to 1,052.35 after a 1.5 per cent gain on Tuesday with Maculan, the construction, real estate and building materials group, up another Sch40 to Sch1,275.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open    10 am   11 am   12 pm   1 pm    2 pm    3 pm     close 1155.26 1156.19 1155.98 1156.01 1155.36 1153.54 1153.72  1153.82  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1156.43    Day's Low  1152.40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 17    Mar 16   Mar 13   Mar 12   Mar 11 1151.88   1145.61  1154.40  1149.99  1161.88  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

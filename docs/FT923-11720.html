			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Australian wool auctions are resumed next week. The market during the recess has been nominally static, but with dollar currencies weakening for most of the month, price ideas in most major consuming countries have eased. The Australian view is not by any means bearish, however, and some European traders consider that prices could possibly rise to begin with. Calculations further ahead are influenced by the four million bale stockpile, which has to be disposed of at some stage, by recession and by the inability of the old Soviet countries to buy.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Bill on access to records fails A FURTHER attempt to prevent the government cloaking its activities in unnecessary secrecy failed in the Commons yesterday. The Freedom of Information Bill, sponsored by Mr Archie Kirkwood, Liberal Democrat MP for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, was denied a second reading after being strongly criticised by Mr Tim Renton, minister responsible for the Civil Service. The Bill sought to establish a broad right of access to official records for the public.</p>

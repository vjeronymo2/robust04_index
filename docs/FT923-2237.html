			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (1): Charm and a challenge - As Whitehall encourages local leadership in its approach to inner city regeneration, council leaders have come to realise the need to work with the grain of government policy if they are to do the best for their areas THE LAST two years have seen a remarkable evolution in UK urban policy, with a new partnership emerging between the government and inner-city councils. After a decade of antagonism between central and local government, ministers with responsibility for local government have launched a charm offensive to build new relationships. Previously, local government was seen as an impediment to restoring inner-city areas - even, through its attitudes, as a factor in urban decay. Now the emphasis in Whitehall is on fostering local leadership as part of the solution. Rather than holding control over spending at the centre, an increasing proportion of government funds is being dispensed to local authorities to spend as they see fit to implement agreed strategies. Council leaders, for their part, recognise that, with the re-election of a fourth-term Conservative government, they must work with the grain of government policy, if they are to do the best for their areas. The key change in creating this new partnership in urban regeneration was the return of Michael Heseltine to the Cabinet at the end of 1990, for a second term at the department of the environment. Mr Heseltine had spent time on the back benches, drawing lessons from his first term at the department and looking at overseas experience, particularly in North America. During his first term, he had invented the urban development corporations (UDCs), to demonstrate a new approach to inner-city regeneration. Government funds were used to reclaim derelict land and provide infrastructure, in order to tempt the private sector back into urban areas. Scarce public resources would be used to lever in much larger amounts of private investment, encouraging partnerships between the sectors rather than leaving everything to the public sector. The UDCs have had mixed success: some were much more successful than others in attracting private investment; and the collapse of the commercial property market has stalled some of the more ambitious plans, especially in London Docklands. But none has failed to make an impact on its area - and there have been spectacular successes as the table of comparative data on page 2 of this survey shows. Since the UDCs are necessarily limited in scope to relatively small areas, Mr Heseltine sought a way of persuading urban local authorities to take the leadership role in similar strategies. The solution was City Challenge: offering significant sums of money for inner-city projects to councils which could demonstrate the active participation of the private sector. The money was to be allocated by competitive bidding, putting the onus on local authorities to make the case - a challenge which most have taken up with enthusiasm. Mr Victor Hausner, whose London-based consultancy advises the environment department on the programme, emphasises the importance of the new role given to local government. 'City Challenge is probably the most significant nod to local authorities in the last decade,' he says. A key element of the City Challenge approach was its 'one-stop' nature: rather than deal with several departments to win funding under different heads, councils could bid for a single sum to be spent in a number of ways. The size of the purse was also important: instead of spreading the jam too thinly across many areas, the idea was to make a significant impact on a relatively small area. Equally significant was the five-year perspective: successful regeneration requires the sort of long-term planning which the uncertainties of annual funding make difficult. The downside of the competitive bidding for funds is that, inevitably, there must be losers as well as winners. It is this element which has led critics to describe City Challenge as a gameshow - though this has not usually stopped the critics from bidding, often successfully, for funds. But the need for there to be losers, pour encourager les autres, raises the question of what happens to areas which repeatedly fail to produce convincing bids. So far, some 30 of the 57 urban priority areas have been successful: but three - Bristol, Salford and Sheffield - have failed in both rounds. As the case study of Bristol, on page 4, shows, such a failure can be particularly disheartening for the voluntary bodies which form part of the team in putting together a bid. If losing knocks the stuffing out of those in the front line, the effect of entering City Challenge could actually be to damage an area's prospects. Already there is evidence that ad hoc solutions have to be found when City Challenge bids fail. When Birmingham failed to win funds for its Heartlands regeneration project in the first pacemaker round, a UDC was unexpectedly conjured up. The project was an ambitious partnership between private and public sector of exactly the type the government was keen to foster. Yet it looked likely to collapse without the funds sought under City Challenge for land reclamation and infrastructure. Creating a UDC allowed the government to bridge the gap with a similar level of funding, to the surprise of many who had thought that the development corporations were soon to be wound up. Large urban areas cannot be allowed to fail, especially when they are politically marginal. Those local authorities which have so far failed in City Challenge will, no doubt, look forward to a third round next year. However, the decision has yet to be made on whether there will be another round. The large amounts of money committed to inner-city regeneration are an attractive target for the Treasury in a tough public expenditure round. Even if there is a further round, the list of urban priority areas eligible to bid will be reviewed. The 57 were selected on the basis of the 1981 census, and many of the areas included have changed considerably since then. It will have surprised many, for example, that the prosperous south-west London borough of Wandsworth was in on the bidding, along with very deprived councils, such as North Tyneside and London's Tower Hamlets. With new data coming through from the 1991 census in November, it would not be surprising if the list were to be amended, and even shortened, before a further round of City Challenge. Finally, there will be new opportunities for inner-city development once the new Urban Regeneration Agency is launched later next year under the chairmanship of Lord Walker. Mr John Redwood, the inner cities minister, describes the URA as a 'roving UDC' in his interview, on page 2. It will be able to clear land and - if necessary - sweep away red tape, with a healthy budget to encourage private sector investment. The agency will not supplant the existing UDCs, which will continue to receive separate funding until they are wound up (probably by the middle of the decade). However, it will work closely with them, with a committee of UDC chairmen meeting regularly with Lord Walker to discuss common problems. Lord Walker has extensive experience of urban regeneration from his periods as environment secretary and as Welsh secretary. In the latter position, he worked closely with local authorities, using government resources skilfully to promote regeneration in Wales. He will be equally keen to promote good relationships with local authorities, adding further to the constructive bipartisan approach which is now developing.</p>

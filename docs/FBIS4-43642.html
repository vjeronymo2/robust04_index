			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GF/PVDD: "Van Miert Supports Dehaene for EC </F> Presidency -- And Demands Ministerial Position for  Dutch-speaking Socialist Party"]    [Excerpts] European Competition Commissioner Karel Van  Miert believes that "Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene is one of  the few people who can deal with the complex position of  European Commission (EC) president." In an interview with DE  STANDAARD, Van Miert said: "I will be pleased when he gets it."  He also thinks that if Dehaene does become EC president, the  Christian People's Party should relinquish a ministerial  position in the federal government to the Dutch-speaking  Socialist Party. In the meantime Dehaene seems to be gaining  ever more support abroad. [passage omitted]    Prime Minister Dehaene's cabinet confirmed that the premier  had talks with his Italian colleague Silvio Berlusconi in Rome  on Friday evening [17 June], after talks with the German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud  Lubbers. Berlusconi will receive British candidate Sir Leon  Brittan in the near future.    From a German source, it was reported that Italy preferred  Dehaene to his Netherlands counterpart Lubbers. German  Chancellor Kohl is reported to have informed Dehaene of this  preference. On the basis of this information, the Belgian prime  minister is said to have publicly announced his candidacy to  succeed Jacques Delors and visit his Italian colleague.    Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez let it be known via  his foreign minister that he would not veto Dehaene's  appointment.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: US railway group in Dollars 3.4bn bid for rival Union Pacific, the biggest US railway operator west of the Mississippi, last night signalled the start of a takeover battle by launching a Dollars 3.4bn hostile bid for Santa Fe Pacific, one of its biggest rivals. The surprise bid comes four months after Santa Fe had agreed to a Dollars 2.8bn friendly takeover by Burlington Northern Railroad, which would have created the biggest railway company in the US. Union Pacific said its bid was subject to the termination of Santa Fe's merger agreement with Burlington and the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the federal authority that regulates railroads. In 1987, the commission refused to permit a merger between Santa Fe and Southern Pacific. Union Pacific said that under the proposal, Santa Fe Pacific stockholders would receive 0.344 shares of Union Pacific stock for each Santa Fe share. The offer is valued at Dollars 18 a share, based on the closing price of Union Pacific stock yesterday.</p>

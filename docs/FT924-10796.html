			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Bank of East Asia raises HKDollars 1.9bn BANK of East Asia, Hong Kong's fourth-largest banking group, has raised HKDollars 1.9bn (Dollars 245m) from a placement of new shares. The placement was made on Tuesday night, following the Hong Kong stock market's 155-point rebound. The issue had been expected for some time, despite a company statement last Friday claiming Bank of East Asia had 'no immediate plans to arrange any placement'. SBCI Finance Asia and Peregrine Capital underwrote the issue of 52.6m shares at HKDollars 37.50, a 4 per cent discount to Tuesday's closing price.</p>

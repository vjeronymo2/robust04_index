"The talks will aim at a thorough and broad resolution of  the  nuclear and other issues that separate the DPRK from the U.S.  And the rest of international community," State Department  spokesman Michael McCurry said in a statement.    Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci will head the  U.S. delegation to the third round negotiation.    The announcement came after a team of inspectors from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) began their work at  the DPRK's nuclear sites and representatives of the Republic of  Korea (ROK) and the DPRK resumed discussion at Panmunjom earlier  today.    The department spokesman also announced that the United  States agreed to suspend the combined military exercise, Team  Spirit in 1994, with the ROK.    However, McCurry said that "the long-standing security  relationship between the ROK and the U.S. remains strong, and  the suspension of Team Spirit '94 will not weaken our joint  defensive capabilities."    McCurry stressed, "the undertakings of the U.S. regarding  Team Spirit '94 and a third round of U.S.-DPRK talks are based  on the premise that the IAEA inspections will be fully  implemented and the South-North nuclear dialogue will continue  through the exchange of special envoys."</p>

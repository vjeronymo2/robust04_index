			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 928.52 of the order authorizes the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container regulations for fresh shipments of papayas. Section 928.53 allows for the modification, suspension or termination of such regulations when warranted. Section 928.55 provides that whenever papayas are regulated pursuant to &sect;928.52 or &sect;928.53, such papayas must be inspected by the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service and certified as meeting the applicable requirements of such regulation. The cost of inspection and certification is borne by handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 928.313 of the rules and regulations currently in effect under the order establishes minimum grade requirements for fresh shipments of Hawaiian papayas. This rule suspends &sect;928.313, which requires that such papayas grade at least Hawaii No. 1, except that not more than 5 percent of the fruit may be immature, and that the weight requirements specified in the Hawaiian grade standards do not apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current minimum grade requirement has been in effect since 1984. The objective of this requirement was to provide that only acceptable quality fruit enter fresh market channels, thereby ensuring consumer satisfaction, increasing sales, and improving returns to papaya producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the industry continues to believe that quality is an important factor in maintaining sales, the committee recommended this suspension because it believes the cost of inspection and certification (mandated when the grade regulations are in effect) exceeds the benefits derived. The cost of papaya inspections on a per pound basis averages about $.006, which is nearly as much as the assessment rate established under the order to cover the order's administrative and promotion costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee members supporting the suspension stated that such action would be in the best interests of producers, because eliminating the cost of inspection will increase producer returns. Those members contend that the marketplace will dictate fruit quality, and competition among shippers will ensure shipments of good quality fruit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the industry is pursuing alternative means of improving and ensuring quality, such as providing financial incentives to producers to deliver good quality fruit to handlers. Current industry practice is for producers to deliver their fruit to handlers for grading, packing and marketing. Producers are paid by handlers based, in part, on the quality of fruit they deliver. Producer prices are reduced to reflect the amount of fruit that is discarded during handling because it is of unacceptable quality. All producers delivering fruit to a particular handler are typically paid the same amount for their fruit, based on the average quality delivered by all producers. This practice causes producers delivering high quality fruit to be penalized by producers delivering poorer quality fruit. A newly formed producers' bargaining cooperative is attempting to change this practice by having low quality fruit attributed to individual producers. That is, an individual producer would be paid based upon the quality of fruit that individual delivered to the handler. Thus, producers would have a financial incentive to harvest and deliver high quality product. This should help improve and maintain the quality of papayas entering the fresh market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee members opposed to the suspension stated that it would allow poor quality fruit on the market and have a negative impact on the market. Additionally, those members believe that such a suspension will be perceived negatively by the State of Hawaii Department of Agriculture. They are also concerned about the length of time necessary to reinstate the grade requirements, if it is determined that such action is needed in the future to ensure that only fruit of acceptable quality is shipped to fresh markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of committee members acknowledge the possibility that fruit quality could decline as a result of this action, but do not believe that this is likely. They believe that the reduction in handling costs due to elimination of mandatory inspection will outweigh any declines in returns attributable to reduced quality. Further, the committee will monitor the impact this action has on the market, and will recommend reinstatement of quality standards if warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

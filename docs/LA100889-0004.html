			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> It took me the entire length of the opening credits for the CBS series, "The  People Next Door," to realize that this is garbage destined for the sitcom  trash can. A half-hour later I was convinced, thanks to the idiotic concept,  the pathetic script and the infuriating canned laughter at every ridiculous  line and facial expression. My disbelief at how this rubbish gets on the air is  only surpassed by my amazement that actual salaries are distributed to the  so-called writers. Naturally I won't be giving this one a second chance and to  prevent future abominations, I suggest we all do the same. Until we do, the  only people laughing will continue to be the writers trotting off to cash their  checks at the bank.  </P> <P> Francis Albert, Long Beach  </P></p>

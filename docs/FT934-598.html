			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / GE-led bid wins battle for Nuovo Pignone The Italian government is selling a controlling stake in Nuovo Pignone, the gas turbines and compressors group, to a consortium led by General Electric and including two other US companies, Dresser Industries and Ingersoll-Rand. The sale represents a significant political move by the Italian government, which has favoured a US partner over European candidates in its first big industrial privatisation. Both GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, and ABB-Atlas Copco also bid for Nuovo Pignone. The deal values the 69.3 per cent of Nuovo Pignone being sold by the Eni state holding company at about L1,100bn (Dollars 660m). The figure represents about L700bn for the equity and about L400bn in debt transfers. Nuovo Pignone, which specialises in low-powered turbines and compressors for the energy and chemicals industries, made net profits of L36.7bn on sales of L1,977bn last year. The L7,000 a share bid is a significant premium for Nuovo Pignone's minority shareholders compared with Tuesday's pre-suspension closing price in Milan of L6,269. Announcement of the deal, which had been under negotiation for more than a year, was greeted by demonstrations by employees, who took to the streets of Florence in protest. The company's works council said the sale to GE represented 'the worst solution', while Mr Giorgio Morales, the city's mayor, expressed concern about the inclusion of one of Nuovo Pignone's biggest rivals in the consortium. Union leaders fear the sale could result in Nuovo Pignone losing its independence and suffering redundancies among its 2,600 strong workforce. Some politicians have also expressed concern about Italian state companies falling prey to cash-rich foreign predators under the privatisation programme. Political concern to limit such fears and possible union opposition explains the deal's complex structure. GE, always the most likely to win, will take only 25 per cent of Nuovo Pignone. A further 20 per cent will be held by six Italian banks. Some observers believe the banks will eventually sell their stakes, of 2 per cent to 4 per cent each, to GE once the political heat over the deal dies down. The surprise, however, was that Dresser Industries and Ingersoll-Rand, two other US turbine or oil industry specialists, are taking 12 per cent each. The two companies bid in tandem for Nuovo Pignone and may have decided to join forces with GE when it became clear their offer would prove unsuccessful. A GE victory had seemed virtually certain from September 1992, when Rome first announced plans to sell Nuovo Pignone. The company has co-operated with GE for more than three decades, and the two have numerous cross-licensing deals. Nuovo Pignone has used GE technology in its larger turbines, and the US group has taken up ideas from the Italian producer for lower-powered units. As expected, Eni will retain a significant stake of 20.25 per cent, reflecting the continuing interlocking interests between the two. Much of Nuovo Pignone's business has come from Eni contracts. The current order book partly reflects a massive deal, worth about Dollars 1.6bn, to upgrade the trans-Siberian gas pipeline negotiated by Eni with the Russian government last year and for which Italian export credit insurance cover has recently been approved.

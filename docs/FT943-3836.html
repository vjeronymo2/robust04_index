			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Outlook less certain after inflation scare - New York After being caught off guard by Friday's inflation scare, investors may have to rethink their strategies this morning in anticipation of tomorrow's reading on consumer prices. A fairly steady outlook for equities became less certain as last week drew to close. Although most analysts had expected an upturn in the August producer price index, Wall Street was approaching the announcement with what proved to be a false sense of confidence. Stocks were expected to weather any bad news with minimal damage. In the event, share prices tumbled on news of a 0.6 per cent jump in the PPI, a figure which far exceeded forecasts of an 0.4 per cent increase. While Friday's 33 point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average hardly qualifies as a disaster, it was enough to give pause to those who had been expecting the market to enjoy a robust autumn. If this week brings evidence that inflation has been spilling over into the consumer sector, the sell-off in stocks may accelerate, but if tomorrow's figure comes in at about 0.4 per cent, as analysts had predicted before Friday's PPI reading, then there is a good chance that share prices will stabilise. Economists were busy this weekend reconsidering their earlier estimates. Mr Sung Sohn, chief economist at Norwest in Minneapolis, still believes the CPI is likely to show a more modest increase than the PPI. The former, he points out, is more sensitive to wage pressures, which have remained quite modest. By contrast, the cost of raw materials, which heavily influence producer prices, has risen sharply in recent months. 'It is still quite possible for stocks to do well if inflation is contained at the producer level,' says Mr Thomas McManus, stock strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York, in spite of the likelihood that the slide in bonds will drag on for some time. Mr McManus's view is based on increasing signs that the stock market has entered a phase in which earnings, not interest rates, exert the strongest influence on investor sentiment. Indeed, Friday's decline by stocks was moderate when compared with the big losses suffered by the Treasury market. 'Companies are really starting to show investors that they have capitalised on a weak dollar and all the restructuring that has been done over the past couple of years,' he says. That may prove to be a mixed blessing. Some observers believe Wall Street has again grown complacent in the expectation of robust corporate profits in the second half of the year. 'The market could well be building itself up for a big disappointment,' says Mr McManus, who advises caution. His recommendation is to concentrate on stocks which are directly benefiting from rising industrial prices, such as chemicals, papers and metals.</p>

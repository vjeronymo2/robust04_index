			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (2): Urgent surgery needed - Anne Counsell examines the economy of the poorest country in the EC THERE has been a grudging acceptance by the financial community that the Greek economy was in need of serious remedial attention. The realisation that periodic cash injections from the EC could not sustain indefinite life in a chronically sick economy has also slowly begun to penetrate the political ranks. Political expediency in an election year dictates that the prescribed surgery of public spending cuts and structural reforms should be administered painlessly. But many in government are reluctant to be left holding the scalpel. The Greek home remedy of spending its way out of tight corners is, not surprisingly, the preferred course of treatment for many politicians. Against this backdrop, Mr Stefanos Manos, the minister of national economy and finance, has been dogged in his approach to economic and fiscal reform. He has been instrumental in pushing through much needed but nonetheless unpopular measures such as lifting price controls, public sector wage freezes and privatisation programmes. There have been howls of protest, not only from the public but also from within parliament, resulting in a see-sawing passage towards reform. Part of the problem is that external pressures have forced changes at a faster rate than Greece's deeply entrenched political traditions. Greece, which is the largest net recipient of EC funds, has committed itself to the Maastricht treaty and an economic convergence programme. Both demand a fiscal discipline which, until quite recently, was markedly absent from Greek economic policy. When Greece joined the EC in 1981, it was the second poorest country. It is now the poorest, having been overtaken by Portugal in 1991, and has the lowest productivity in the community, the highest inflation and the biggest external debt. In 1990, the New Democracy government took over an economy with a public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of 18.5 per cent of GDP, a current account deficit of 5.5 per cent of GDP and an inflation rate of more than 20 per cent. Three years into its economic programme, the government can point to significant progress - the PSBR and the current account deficit have shrunk by 50 per cent or more to 10.5 per cent and 2 per cent of GDP respectively, inflation is down to an average 15.5 per cent for early 1993 and a host of measures have been taken to liberalise capital movements, implement privatisation and to curb spending. Recent reports by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), acknowledged the improvement in economic indicators and praised the momentum towards structural adjustment, urging the government to press ahead with its reforms. However, both the annual reports tempered their praise with concern, primarily over the persistently high rate of inflation and the government's ability to raise revenues. The most significant brake on the economy is inflation. The consumer price index, which ended the year at 14.4 per cent, has risen to more than 16 per cent during March, April and May, largely because of steep rises in telephone, transport and water tariffs as well as some basic foodstuffs. A package of indirect taxes introduced last August has also added about 3 per cent to the annual rate of inflation. But even when stripped out of the index this August, the resulting fall will still be below target. The goal of single digit inflation by the end of 1993, as outlined in Greece's convergence programme, cannot be met and 12 per cent is now seen as a more realistic figure. Another obdurate problem is the large public deficit, which in turn has contributed to the inflation difficulties. Although there have been significant reductions in the PSBR over the past three years, the rate has fallen short of targets. In 1991, the PSBR was 14.1 per cent of GDP, 3.7 percentage points higher than the objective, in 1992 it was 10.5 per cent of GDP and 1.4 percentage points adrift, while for the first half of this year it is estimated to be 12 per cent of GDP, against a convergence programme target of 8.6. This is not for a lack of budgetary consolidation efforts. Public sector wages and pensions have been cut in real terms, keeping the wage bill within limits and contributing to a primary surplus in 1992 - the public sector financial position before debt costs. The government has attempted to rein in its consumption by reducing gross overstaffing in a public sector packed with political appointees. A recent study revealed that Greece has a ratio of one civil servant per 17 members of the population, compared to one per 100 in the United Kingdom. A policy of replacing one out of every two retiring civil servants is not being widely implemented because of the perceived political cost. On the revenue side, the government introduced a new tax law last May to deal with the pastime of tax evasion, a contributory factor to the high budget deficit and shortfall in revenues. However, the Greeks have had more practice at evading tax than the government has had collecting it. Lower tax rates did not bring more people into the net, neither did an amnesty on previous tax years. A projected 30 per cent increase in tax returns materialised as a rise of only 13 per cent for the first five months. The policy is to intensify the collection of taxes already assessed by offering bonuses to the tax offices and by cross-checking. IBM is installing hardware in 120 tax offices which account for 80 per cent of the tax system. The government has ruled out tax increases before the election, and is focusing on spending cuts involving a reduction in public investment and a cut in public sector subsidies. The government has also targeted two new sources of revenue. Road taxes collected through the banking system are projected to raise up to Dr1.5bn a day and the sale of casino licences is estimated to bring in Dr22bn. In addition, receipts from privatisations should arrive in a flurry towards the end of the year. Further falls in inflation and the PSBR are pivotal to reducing the wide interest rate differential with the EC. Real interest rates, now at around 14 per cent, have discouraged investment and strangled business activity. There is little prospect for reduced rates as high real interest rates are required to cushion the drachma against international exchange rate uncertainty and to finance the PSBR. Given the slippage in a number of crucial targets, the drachma will not join the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) this year. There has been some success in stabilising the devaluation of the drachma against the Ecu to between 4 and 5 per cent over the first five months of this year compared to a rate of 9.9 per cent in 1992. On the external front, progress has also followed a zigzagging path. The 1992 current account deficit climbed to Dollars 2.03bn, partially reversing a 60 per cent fall in 1991 to Dollars 1.46bn. Much of the deficit can be attributed to payment lags and a surge in imports during the autumn currency crisis in the EMS when there were expectations of a drachma devaluation. A large net inflow of invisible earnings, including from the EC, continued to hold up the balance of payments performance. Although many expectations have not been realised, the failings are not acute when over-ambitious targets, the war in Yugoslavia and the negative impact of a slowdown in Europe are factored into the government's record. Mr Manos and his experienced team, do not see Greece bumping along at the bottom of the European Community in the longer term. The difficulty is the short term. The patchy but generally better prospects for the Greek economy are not the most appealing message to voters, especially since most will not have reaped any direct benefits from the overdue, but necessary, reforms.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Juan Manuel Venegas] </F>   [Text] The Agrarian Reform Secretariat [SRA] and the  Chiapas State government have agreed that as long as the legal  situation remains unsettled, peasant organizations in that  entity will retain the lands they recovered in the past three  months that, according to peasant leaders, represent  approximately 100,000 hectares.    Meanwhile, the State Council of the Indian and Peasant  Organizations (CEOIC) has promised to refrain from promoting  further occupation of land and, as established in the document,  "to abide by the law should an occupation occur on or after 15  April 1994."    This agreement will be valid for two months. During that  time, an executive commission will be formed. The commission  will be comprised of representatives of the agrarian reform,  agriculture, social development, government secretariats; the  Chiapas State government; the CEOIC; small landowners; and  interested peasant groups. Together, the representatives will  study the situation of each of the properties occupied by CEOIC  groups.    After the study has been completed, the commission will  establish the legal status of the lands and decide on its  ownership in a manner "that will be fair and satisfactory for  all parties involved."    In addition, the Agrarian Plural Commission [Comision Plural  Agraria] will handle "all pending matters regarding the rural  backwardness of each of the CEOIC organizations. A strict  schedule will be set and respected by all parties involved, and  the mechanisms for human, technical, and social requirements  that will speed up the solution will be established."    Likewise, Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno said that his  office will advise the district attorney's office to "suspend  all arrest warrants against those involved in the agrarian  struggles." Lopez Moreno said that they will "examine" the  current situation of human rights activist Enrique Perez Lopez  who was arrested on Sunday.    The agreement was signed last night by SAR Secretary Victor  Cervera Pacheco, Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno,  Government Deputy Secretary Jose Narro Robles, and  representatives of 22 CEOIC organizations following an over  six-hour meeting -- from 1700 until after 2300 -- at the SAR  offices.    In conclusion, it was established that to avoid further  occupations of land and to attend to new requests for land, the  governor, a CEOIC representative, and a small landowners  representative will meet in Tuxtla Gutierrez soon to "examine  the agrarian situation and jointly suggest new alternatives for  the solution of the problems." A bank official, as well as  federal and state officials involved in agrarian matters, will  also be invited to the meeting.    Meanwhile, it was learned that CEOIC and the Zapata Lives  National Liberation Coordinating Board will march from the  Zocalo to the Chamber of Deputies headquarters to demand changes  to Article 27 of the Constitution.</p>

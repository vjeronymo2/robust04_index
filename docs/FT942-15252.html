			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Spain to float part of Endesa holding Grupo Teneo, the Spanish state holding group, is to place up to 10 per cent of its equity in the profitable Endesa electrical utility on the market next month, in an international public offering expected to raise Pta180bn (Dollars 1.3bn). The offering, which will reduce Teneo's shareholding in Endesa to around 65 per cent, will be weighted towards Spanish institutions and especially towards retail investors. It will, however, include tranches for the US, Europe and the rest of the world. The four-week registration period for potential domestic retail buyers of Endesa shares opened yesterday. Teneo said the international tranches would be reduced if there was a strong enough demand among small Spanish investors. At present, US institutions hold nearly half of the 25 per cent of Endesa equity that is traded. Teneo said one of the objects of the offering was to increase the number of Spanish shareholders in the utility. Mr Javier Salas, Teneo's chairman, said the income from the share disposal would be directed towards consolidating the public holding. The income is particularly needed by Iberia, the national airline, whose losses last year were chiefly responsible for a sharp fall, to Pta3bn from Pta21bn, in Teneo's net earnings. Endesa, which raised its net profit last year by 9.9 per cent to Pta116.8bn, is the dominant player in the highly-regulated domestic electricity market. Together with its affiliated companies, it produces more than half of Spain's electric power and distributes around 40 per cent.</p>

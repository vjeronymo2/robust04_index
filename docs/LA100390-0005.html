			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG RATE HIKE FOR ASSIGNED-RISK CAR INSURANCE  </P> <P> Henderson's column is an outstanding example of illogical reasoning, flawed  comparisons and distortions.  </P> <P> Consider just one: "While the state requires everyone to carry insurance  (liability only), it has to make sure everyone can afford coverage." Why?  Driving a vehicle is a privilege, not a constitutional right.  </P> <P> If one elects to steer a 3,000-pound vehicle, a lethal weapon, that person has  the moral as well as legal obligation to monetarily care for victims of a  driver's error. And the government should not subsidize such insurance or allow  driving without coverage.  </P> <P> WALLACE HUNT  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

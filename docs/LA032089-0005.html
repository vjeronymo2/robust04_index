			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Soviet General Staff had warned the Kremlin against large-scale  intervention in Afghanistan in December, 1979, arguing in vain for a more  limited operation, a top Soviet soldier said. Gen. Valentin I. Varennikov, who  headed the Soviet Defense Ministry's operational group in Afghanistan for four  years, also criticized as a "demagogue" Babrak Karmal, who became Afghan  president after the Soviet troops moved in. Varennikov, now deputy defense  minister and commander of Soviet land forces, told the weekly Ogonyok: "It is a  fact that the General Staff was against the idea of sending the troops to  Afghanistan up until the time when it was decided."  </P></p>

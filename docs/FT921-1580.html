			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Mrs Clinton stands with her man: The Democratic front-runner's wife is something of a joint candidate THE 'HILLARY factor' and the role of Mrs Hillary Clinton, the wife of Arkansas governor Bill Clinton, is emerging as a strong force in the Democratic presidential primary campaign and a possible Clinton presidency. As a full partner in her husband's campaign and a prominent lawyer in her own right, Mrs Clinton, at 44, is as much a symbol of generational change in national US politics as her husband. At first viewed as the 45-year-old governor's secret weapon, she played a leading role in the nuts and bolts of what has been a well-organised campaign. However, her response last week to a spate of negative news stories about connections between the state government and contracts granted to her law firm has lifted her political profile. It may also have been something of a lesson in why most candidates' wives confine their activities to sitting on platforms and gazing adoringly at their husbands. Speaking to journalists about how she might have to re-evaluate how she conducts her career, Mrs Clinton blurted out: 'I suppose I could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas,' she said. The remark was immediately seized on as a disparagement of women who forgo careers to be housewives and mothers. Governor Clinton was forced to defend it on television on Sunday. Insisting that Mrs Clinton 'believes that rearing children is the most important work in our society', he said she had been speaking of what could have been a 'largely ceremonial role' as Arkansas state's First Lady. Until then, Mrs Clinton was considered such a plus in the campaign that both she and her husband like to say they are a 'two-for-the-price-of-one' election bargain. She was certainly invaluable in parrying the womanising charges which hovered over her husband until they came out in to open in the Gennifer Flowers Affair. When Ms Flowers, a part-time nightclub singer, told a supermarket tabloid that she had had a 12-year affair with the governor, Mrs Clinton was at her husband's side, urging voters in the New Hampshire primary to 'take the election back from the sleazy tabloids'. Most Americans got their first glimpse of Mrs Clinton's forceful personality when the governor and his wife appeared on '60 Minutes', the top-rated US television current affairs programme, to acknowledge implicitly that he had strayed during his marriage. However, said Mrs Clinton, 'I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette (a country music singer). I'm sitting here because I love him and I honour what he's been through and what we've been through together. And if that's not enough for people, then heck, don't vote for him.' This kind of frankness can be alluring to many 'baby boomers' who admire her independent mind and the equality of roles the couple seems to have achieved. Mrs Clinton's early press notices suggested she is tough where her husband is more pliable. She could be, friends suggest, another Eleanor Roosevelt, who was also considered more liberal than her husband. While she has been named by the National Law Journal as one of 'the 100 Most Influential Lawyers in America', her views are also under attack. In scholarly articles and speeches, she has urged 'family policies' and 'children's rights', anathema to conservatives who fear the encroachment of government into private lives (except on the abortion issue). 'Children should have a right to be permitted to decide their own future if they are competent,' she has written. Also, she has argued, the US must develop a comprehensive system of childcare, adapting to the reality that most women now must work. (The Clintons have a 12-year-old daughter, Chelsea.) 'If we compare our parenting policies in the workplace with those available in our industrialised competitors around the globe, we seem to put less actual value on the act of parenting than any other - despite our rhetoric, despite the political talk about who can be more pro-family than the next politician.' Her views are, said The National Review, the conservative journal, 'chillingly . . . Swedish.' No one knows how the 'Hillary factor' will play in the general election. In Washington, observers wait for 'another high heel to drop' but she may have already neutralised the issue. Older voters may see her as a 'pushy' feminist. Certainly there could be little more contrast with the maternal Mrs Barbara Bush or Mrs Marilyn Quayle, wife of the vice-president, who earned a law degree but never practised law.</p>

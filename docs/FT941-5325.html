			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Seasonal window dressing of accounts ahead of the March book closing, where investors prop up their earnings figures with profits from their gains from bonds, will continue to weigh on the Japanese government bond market. However, most traders believe that the sell-off in the JGB market peaked last week, when the yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark rose nearly 40 basis points on the week to 3.99 per cent. Factors responsible for the plunge included surprisingly strong economic figures, further weakness on the international bond market, and worries about over-supply. Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo believes that investors will regain confidence as the underlying weakness of the economy continues and money market operations by the Bank of Japan reveal that it would not tolerate a further rise in interest rates. The central bank has allowed overnight call rates to ease to 2.125 per cent from 2.25 per cent, and the yield spread between the call rate and the official discount rate, currently at 1.75 per cent, is at a historical low. A rise in long-term interest rates could hurt the economy, which remains vulnerable to the strengthening of the yen and political turmoil and the bank could ease short-term money market rates lower this week, to prevent a further fall in bond prices.</p>

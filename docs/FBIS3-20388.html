We welcome the U.S. efforts to find a solution or a way out of  the deadlock. Our talks could be described as positive. This is  our first meeting and I am sure there will be more. Nimetz will  continue his talks with the prime minister.    I believe this is what I could tell you now as the initial  result of a first meeting that is over traditional frameworks  and frameworks of simple meetings. Thank you.    [Nimetz] I am greatly honored that President Clinton has  asked me to take on this significant mission. This dispute  threatens the security and stability in a region that is very  important to the United States. We had discussions this morning  in Skopje and we had discussions here. And we will continue the  discussions.    Our goal is to assist in achieving a solution under the  auspices of UN mediator Cyrus Vance. I do not think I will say  anything more. We will persevere in this effort and I hope the  outcome will be positive.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUTLER HELPS SOLVE UCI'S PROBLEMS IN VICTORY OVER AZTECS  </P> <P> UC Irvine's basketball team, trying to solve the mystery of its worst start in  school history, found part of the answer Saturday night.  </P> <P> And it was the Butler who did it.  </P> <P> Ricky Butler scored 18 of his career-high 28 points in the first half and  Justin Anderson added 15 of his 17 in the second half as the Anteaters beat San  Diego State, 75-62, before a crowd of 2,130 at the Bren Center.  </P> <P> The Anteaters (2-5) broke a three-game losing streak and ended a five-game  winning string by the Aztecs (5-3).  </P> <P> The victory was a relief for the Anteaters, who have struggled without their  top two point guards, Ben Rishwain and Rod Palmer. Rishwain is out with a  broken finger and Palmer has an injured right knee.  </P> <P> So it was Butler, a 6-7 junior, who was the center of attention Saturday night.  Butler, averaging 13.5 points a game, scored eight points in the final 6:26 as  the Anteaters led by as many as 13 points.  </P> <P> "I was really disappointed because I hadn't played well in the last two games  (against Cal and Colorado)," Butler said. "I thought it was the worst I had  played."  </P> <P> Butler, who also had a game-high 12 rebounds, said it was a lack of  conditioning that hurt him in the games. He said he grew tired and faded in the  late stages of the losses.  </P> <P> "I was losing (power) in my legs," he said. "I started riding a stationary bike  again this week and I got some of it back."  </P> <P> Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg said Butler had the Aztecs chasing him the entire  game.  </P> <P> "Butler played really well," Brandenburg said. "We had no answer for him."  </P> <P> Butler scored 18 points, including 12 on layups and short jump shots, to keep  the Anteaters close in a first half in which the lead changed hands 15 times.  </P> <P> A free throw by freshman Craig Marshall gave the Anteaters their last lead of  the half, 29-28, with 2:22 left.  </P> <P> Then San Diego State's Michael Best made two three-pointers, sparking a 9-4 run  that gave the Aztecs a 37-33 halftime advantage.  </P> <P> It was Anderson who got hot from the outside in the second half. He made three  three-pointers and a layup to help the Anteaters pull to a 48-48 tie with 12:05  left.  </P> <P> Then the Anteaters' Don May, a sophomore reserve, took over. He had a  three-point play and layup and Craig Marshall added two free throws as the  Anteaters went on a 7-0 run.  </P> <P> "We had a few rules tonight," said UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan. "Only a  couple of guys (Anderson and Jeff Herdman) could shoot the jumper."  </P> <P> But Butler's play inside was the difference down the stretch. He blocked a  jumper by Best with 3:09 left and the Anteaters were clinging to a 66-59 lead.  Best had hit two three-pointers in the previous two minutes to cut the Aztecs'  deficit from 13 to seven.  </P> <P> "Coach had been telling us that (Best) was their best outside shooter so we  started jumping out at him," Butler said. "I just jumped out and got a piece of  the ball."  </P> <P> Best and Shawn Jamison scored 14 points each for San Diego State, which  committed 19 turnovers and was outrebounded 42-31. The Aztecs made only 11 of  20 free throws while UC Irvine made 28 of 36.  </P> <P> "We lost our poise a couple of times," Brandenburg said. "We didn't do much in  the second half."  </P> <P> Nor did Herdman, UC Irvine's leading scorer (16.5 points). He had 10 points  before fouling out with 5:13 left.  </P> <P> "We did a good job," Mulligan said. "Herdman didn't have a good night and we  still won. We came out and played hard in the second half."  </P> <P> Mulligan said the victory might turn the Anteaters' fortunes around.  </P> <P> "If we would have lost I would have made them watch tapes of the game from  10:30 (p.m.) until 2 (a.m.)," Mulligan said. "I reminded them of that at  halftime."  </P> <P> Butler got the message and Mulligan and the Anteaters slept well Saturday  night.  </P> <P> Anteater Notes  </P> <P> Ben Rishwain, a freshman point guard who has been sidelined since Dec. 2 with a  broken finger, is expected to be out until January. . . . The Anteaters are 2-3  at home. . . . The Anteaters play at Pepperdine Tuesday night at 7:30.  </P></p>

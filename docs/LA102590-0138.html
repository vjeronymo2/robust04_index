			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLUM'S MONEY RESCUED S&amp;L, RECORDS SHOW  </P> <P> No business deal has drawn more fire during the gubernatorial campaign than  Richard C. Blum's stake in a financially troubled savings and loan in Oregon.  </P> <P> A TV ad for Sen. Pete Wilson alleged that Blum and his wife, Dianne Feinstein,  "own" the thrift and profited from a "sweetheart" government bailout in 1988.  </P> <P> But according to documents and sources familiar with the matter, Blum money  helped rescue the thrift.  </P> <P> First, records show the investment is held by Blum's firm, not by him and his  wife. Second, outside accountants who recently evaluated the deal for  regulators offered no criticism of its terms. In addition, the amount of  government aid was decided months before Blum became involved.  </P> <P> Most of the 1988 thrift bailouts were negotiated between government regulators  and private investors. Critics have argued that the government was outsmarted,  resulting in deals that were too generous with taxpayer money.  </P> <P> But with Jackson County Savings &amp; Loan in Medford, the rescue's terms were  set in advance, before a purchaser was on the scene. The regulators determined  that the government would provide $63 million in assistance and require $14  million in cash from investors. The new money was to be raised by selling stock  in the thrift to the public.  </P> <P> A Columbus, Ohio, investment bank was hired by the regulators to sell the stock  in October, 1988. Charles R. Webb, one of the Columbus bankers, said less than  half of the stock was sold during the next two months and the deal was in  danger of failing.  </P> <P> Webb said he then contacted Carl D. Gustavson, a San Francisco bank executive  and a Feinstein appointee to the city Redevelopment Commission, and Gustavson  agreed to try to raise the remaining cash.  </P> <P> Two San Francisco investment bankers said they turned down Gustavson's  solicitation, but Blum eventually agreed to provide some of the needed cash.  His investment firm wound up acquiring a 24.9% interest in Jackson County  Savings and a seat on its board.  </P> <P> If Blum had not stepped in, it would have cost the government an estimated  $87.6 million to close the institution and pay off depositors, according to  Webb and a regulatory executive familiar with the transaction.  </P> <P> In 1989, the savings and loan reported a profit of $1.3 million, a figure that  reflected $4.9 million in government assistance.  </P> <P> The Wilson campaign has refused to back down from the ad's assertions. "Blum  has a controlling stock interest and we're just saying that he was a  beneficiary of the government's generosity," said Bill Livingstone, Wilson's  campaign spokesman.  </P></p>

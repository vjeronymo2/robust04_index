			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (7): Track record raises doubts - John Mason examines the effectiveness of the Serious Fraud Office The future of the Serious Fraud Office, set up in 1988 to spearhead the fight against financial crime in the UK, is highly uncertain. Question marks over its track record recently prompted a government review which recommended a merger between the SFO and the lower profile fraud investigation group (Fig) of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). If the review's conclusions are adopted, the SFO would be subsumed into the CPS. To some observers this would appear an admission that the original conception of an elite department to combat the most complex cases of financial fraud has failed. The attorney-general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, is now considering the merger proposal. At the same time, he will decide on parallel proposals for both the SFO and CPS to be turned into executive agencies outside the civil service as part of the government's plans to streamline Whitehall. Sir Nicholas is expected to announce his conclusions on the proposed merger by the end of the year. So what has gone wrong? The SFO was set up with unique powers and structure to bring an increased effectiveness to the investigation and prosecution of complex financial crime. Its brief is to tackle those cases which involve considerable sums of money (more than Pounds 5m) and are of a particularly complex nature. Unlike the CPS, it handles both the investigation and prosecution stages - although detection remains the responsibility of the police and City regulatory bodies. Its multidisciplinary structure, in which lawyers, accountants and police are supposed to pool their skills, is intended to increase the effectiveness of its investigations. Finally, it was given unique powers in Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to remove the right to silence and compel witnesses to give evidence. With these powers and structure, the SFO was supposed to be able to tackle complex fraud cases that had proved virtually impossible for police fraud squads working on their own to handle. However, as has been documented exhaustively in the press, the SFO's track record since its inception has been mixed. Its initial success in the Guinness trial, when four prominent City figures were convicted over the 1986 takeover of Distillers, proved the high point. Since then, headlines have been restricted to reporting failures such the Blue Arrow trial, after which the SFO was criticised by the Court of Appeal for the size and unmanageability of of the prosecution, and the fiasco over Mr Roger Levitt, the financial services salesman who served 180 hours' community service after agreeing to a widely criticised plea-bargaining with the prosecution. Lawyers involved in defence and prosecution work agree that not all the responsibility for such failures should be laid at the door of the SFO. The legal system that the SFO has to operate within still has crucial failings in its ability to present fraud cases that are tried by a jury. For example, there is common agreement that within the judiciary there are all too few judges with the necessary experience of both commercial and criminal cases to handle such difficult cases. Equally, George Staple, the SFO director, insists that efforts have been made to learn from previous mistakes, notably on bringing to court cases that are too large and unwieldy. However, its past failings and the consequent bad publicity has proved highly damaging for the SFO. It has had its success stories - such as the four successful prosecutions which followed the large-scale investigation into the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International - but these are less well reported. The result has been that the SFO has found itself in a similar position to that of the beleaguered Child Support Agency - forced on to the defensive by a poor public image it is finding difficult to reverse. The question of public perception - rightly or wrongly acquired - is one that the attorney-general will have to consider. For the SFO to be effective, it is widely agreed, it has to be widely seen to be a credible organisation. Perception aside, the initial review of the workings of the SFO and Fig concluded there are sound reasons for a merger of the two bodies. It found that there is considerable overlap in the work they carry out and that it is anomalous to apply different methods to what amount to very similar cases. This problem has been enhanced over the past year because the number and size of cases referred to the SFO has dropped significantly, leaving it to pick up smaller cases that would previously have been dealt with by Fig. The review also found room for improvement in the management of both bodies. The SFO, it reported, was not fully exploiting its current systems and lacked formal management overview of important decisions. It did, however, conclude that the 'Section 2' powers removing the right to silence had proved an effective weapon.</p>

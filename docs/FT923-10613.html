			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: More bids likely for New York Daily News NEW bidders are likely to emerge in coming weeks in the battle for the New York Daily News, according to a key lieutenant of Daily Telegraph proprietor Mr Conrad Black, who has made an offer for the ailing paper once owned by Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr David Radler, who heads Mr Black's North American operations, said he does not expect the ownership of the Daily News to be resolved before September. Mr Radler said that, in his opinion, another 'crisis' would be needed before the paper's 12 trade unions were willing to throw their support behind one of the bids. The Daily News has operated under bankruptcy court protection since December. The court recently extended until the end of this month the deadline for the paper to file a reorganisation plan under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. Only Mr Black and Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, publisher of US News &amp; World Report, have so far emerged as serious contenders for the Daily News. Mr Radler declined to be drawn on which other parties may join the bidding. Mr Radler, president of Hollinger, the Daily Telegraph's parent, predicted his group has a 'slightly better than 50-50' chance of winning. He claimed 'we're the only ones who can demonstrate that we have the equity' for what is expected to be a USDollars 300m deal. Hollinger has no short-term debt at present and Mr Radler is confident it can raise as much as CDollars 500m (USDollars 416.6m) from its banks. Should Hollinger take control of the Daily News, Mr Radler said the paper's publisher Mr James Willse would stay on, but that he and Mr Black were likely to oversee the operation. Mr Radler said Hollinger had drawn on the Daily Telegraph's resources in its bid for the Daily News.</p>

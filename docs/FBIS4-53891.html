			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA May 21 -- Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has  signed a decision permitting the establishment of the Vietnam  Bankers Association (VBA).    VBA will be an NGO [Nongovernmental Organization] grouping  on  a voluntary basis all Vietnamese banking institutions,  state-owned commercial banks, joint-stock banks and financial  companies.    Apart from the state commercial banks, some 40 joint-stock  banks and two financial companies are now operating in the  country.    The new association will protect their rights within the  legal framework.    It should also function to promote their modernisation and  mediate any disputes between member banks.</p>

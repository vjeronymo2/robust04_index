Report to Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> EPA has completed its study of CKD waste and prepared the Report to Congress on Cement Kiln Dust. In keeping with the statutory requirements, the report addresses the following factors (hereafter ``study factors'') required under section 8002(o) of RCRA:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The source and volumes of such materials generated per year;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Present disposal practices;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Potential danger, if any, to human health and the environment from the disposal of such materials;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Documented cases in which danger to human health or the environment has been proved;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Alternatives to current disposal methods;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The costs of such alternatives;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) The impact of those alternatives on the use of natural resources; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) The current and potential utilization of such materials. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> In addition, section 8002(o) directs the Agency review other Federal and state studies and actions (e.g., regulations) to avoid duplication of effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Agency's approach in preparing the Report to Congress was to combine certain study factors for purposes of analysis and to evaluate these study factors in a step-wise fashion. This evaluation process, hereafter referred to as EPA's decision rationale, is a three-step methodology that was used in making the regulatory determinations for Mineral Processing Special Wastes (56 FR 27305, June 13, 1991) and the four large-volume Wastes from the Combustion of Coal by Electric Utilities (58 FR 42466, August 9, 1993). The decision rationale contributed to the development of the proposed options for managing CKD waste. EPA is soliciting comment on how the decision rationale can be used in the Agency's decision-making process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The resulting review and discussion of EPA's analysis is organized into ten chapters in Volume II of the Report to Congress: Methods and Findings. (Volume I is an Executive Summary.) The first chapter of Volume II briefly summarizes the purpose and scope of the report, general methods and information sources used, and EPA's decision making methodology. The second chapter provides a brief overview of the cement industry, including a description of CKD waste, the industry structure and characteristics, the cement manufacturing process, the types of production processes used, and significant process inputs (RCRA Study Factor 1). The third chapter discusses the generation and chemical and physical characteristics of CKD (Study Factors 1 and 3). The fourth chapter outlines the range of CKD management methods employed at domestic cement plants (Study Factor 2). The fifth chapter identifies and summarizes cases of potential and documented damages to human health and the environment (Study Factor 4). The sixth chapter includes a discussion of EPA's risk assessment in which the Agency examined inherent hazards posed by CKD, evaluated site-specific risk factors, and performed quantitative transport, fate and exposure modeling (Study Factor 3). The seventh chapter summarizes applicable federal and state regulatory controls. The eighth chapter investigates alternative waste management practices and potential utilization of the wastes (Study Factors 5, 6, and 7). The ninth chapter discusses costs and impacts under each of several regulatory and operational scenarios (Study Factor 8). The tenth and final chapter of Volume II of the Report to Congress summarizes and analyzes the findings of EPA's evaluation of the above study factors and presents a series of options the Agency is considering, based on these findings, concerning the management of cement kiln dust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> C. Decision Rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> After studying cement kiln dust, the Agency used the decision rationale to evaluate the findings of the study factors, and to formulate a series of options being considered regarding the level of control needed for CKD. In Step 1 of the decision rationale, the Agency first determined whether the management of CKD poses human health/environmental problems and the potential for current practices to cause problems in the future. In Step 2, the Agency looked at waste management practices and existing regulations to examine the potential for releases and exposure under current practices. In Step 3, the Agency evaluated the costs and impacts associated with regulating this waste under Subtitle C and, possibly, other regulatory scenarios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

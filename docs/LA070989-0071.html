			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALMS SPRINGS ETERNAL  </P> <P> First, I must tell you how entertaining and informative your Travel Section has  proved to be. When I get the Sunday Times I save your section until last  because it's my dessert.  </P> <P> Second, my main reason for writing is in regard to the Palm Springs article,  "Palm Springs Trying for a Comeback," June 25. After reading about all the  planned resorts with waterfalls, lakes, shorelines and aquatic activities, I am  most curious about one point. Where on earth -- or maybe under earth -- is all  that water to come from? At the rate of development you wrote about, I wonder  if it will be a real desert someday?  </P> <P> ROSEMARY MARPLE  </P> <P> Bellflower  </P></p>

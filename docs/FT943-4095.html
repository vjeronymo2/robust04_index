			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Premier Consolidated hit by oil price fall Premier Consolidated Oilfields, the independent oil company, raised its production by 26 per cent in the first half of 1994. But a parallel fall in the oil price, of 26 per cent, left operating profits down slightly over the period. The company earned Pounds 8.5m to June 30, compared with Pounds 8.7m, while at the pre-tax level profits were down at Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 6.2m). After-tax profits at Pounds 3.4m were down by Pounds 1.2m due to adverse currency movements and slightly higher tax. No dividend is being proposed, but Mr Charles Jamieson, the chief executive, said that Premier 'is working towards it.' Capital expenditure over the period was Pounds 17m, and gearing remained around 50 per cent, with net borrowings of Pounds 64m. Premier recently became the first foreign oil company to sign an oil production agreement in post-communist Albania. The deal, with Albpetrol, the state oil company, provides for enhancement of the Patos Marinze fields in the south of the country, and a development well at Dumre. The company has also had exploration successes in Tunisia and Pakistan, and a testing programme is in progress offshore Cambodia. Premier's current production is over 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, and this is expected to rise to 20,000 barrels by the end of next year as developments at Wytch Farm, Fife and Qadirpur come on stream. Mr Jamieson said: 'We are exposing our shareholders to considerable upside through low cost offshore developments.'</p>

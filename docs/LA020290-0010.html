			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF BLOCK SHOWS A WISE HEAD  </P> <P> Sheriff Sherman Block has issued some sound and sensitive guidelines for his  deputies in the aftermath of a fatal confrontation with black members of the  Nation of Islam that began with a minor traffic stop.  </P> <P> Block has advised against taking "enforcement actions in minor incidents" in  black neighborhoods because of the "heightened tensions" that have resulted  from the incident in which a deputy shot and killed a Muslim on Jan. 23. If  taken to heart by his street cops, the sheriff's advice can defuse escalating  tensions, and maybe save lives.  </P> <P> The shooting followed a non-fatal confrontation between Los Angeles police and  Muslims last month. Both incidents prompted a series of unprecedented meetings  between high-level law- enforcement officials and black leaders representing  the Muslims, other religious groups, civil rights organizations and community  groups. The meetings, organized largely by Danny Bakewell of the Brotherhood  Crusade and Councilman Nate Holden, have started a beneficial dialogue.  </P> <P> As a result of the sessions, the Sheriff's Department produced a training video  for all deputies that outlines the Nation of Islam's history and its small  presence in Los Angeles. The presentation also acknowledges that Muslims and  law enforcement share some worthwhile goals, specifically, "to get young black  men and women out of gangs and to keep them off of drugs." The message -- and  effort to reach an understanding -- are commendable.  </P> <P> Minister Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam,  should respond in kind when he visits Los Angeles this weekend. Farrakhan can  be offensive and incendiary -- his virulent anti-Semitic speeches are well  known -- but he can also be eloquent. He should tone down his hate-mongering  and advocate a continuing dialogue to ease tensions between local police and  Los Angeles' black community.  </P> <P> Sheriff Block has made it clear his department is not at war with Muslims.  Farrakhan must send out a similarly sensitive message. No one wants more  bloodshed.  </P></p>

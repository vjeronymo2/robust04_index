			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Foster's Brewery wins control of Cascade FOSTER'S Brewing, the Australian beer group, yesterday announced a deal with Wilson Neill of New Zealand which will give it control of Tasmania's Cascade brewery. Foster's said Carlton and United Breweries (CUB), its wholly-owned subsidiary, would establish a 50-50 partnership with Cascade Group, wholly-owned by Wilson Neill, to acquire the Cascade name and a brewery in Hobart. The joint venture company will be controlled and operated by CUB. Foster's said Wilson Neill would receive ADollars 27m (USDollars 18.6m) for the Cascade name and the brewery, but would retain the Cascade group's other assets, which include fruit juice manufacturing, a second brewery in Launceston, and a chain of public houses. The deal ends nearly a year of speculation about the future of Cascade, which is one of Australia's most popular boutique beers. However, the agreement is subject to the approval of the Trade Practices Commission, which last year blocked a proposed outright sale of Cascade to CUB for ADollars 100m.</p>

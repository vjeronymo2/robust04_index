			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Brittan's EC rival threatens to quit MR Hans van den Broek, the European Community's external political affairs commissioner, has threatened to resign if he fails to secure concessions in a long-running power struggle with Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator. Sir Leon and Mr van den Broek are at loggerheads over who has management responsibility for the EC's overseas delegations. Mr Van den Broek, a former Dutch foreign minister, claims he was promised exclusive management rights over the delegations as part of a delicate power-sharing agreement brokered by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, last December. A senior aide to Mr van den Broek said last night this agreement risked being reneged on. The aide said Mr van den Broek considered the matter a point of principle. Some officials have suggested that Mr van den Broek has sought wider management responsibilities in a bid to expand his bureaucratic empire. 'He's looking for soldiers,' an official said. The matter is set to come to a head today at a full meeting of the Commission in Brussels. Sir Leon and Mr van den Broek have been battling over division of responsibilities since they took up their posts 10 months ago. Part of the problem lies in the decision to split the external affairs portfolio previously held by Mr Frans Andriessen, the long-serving senior Dutch commissioner who left Brussels last December. But Commission officials said Mr van den Broek had become progressively disenchanted with his present position which includes the ill-defined responsibility for political relations and the lead role in the enlargement talks with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway, which have applied to join the European Union by January 1 1995. By contrast, Sir Leon has revelled in his high-profile position as chief negotiator responsible for negotiating in the Gatt world trade talks because he enjoys statutory legal powers under the Treaty of Rome, an EC official said. The ratification of the Maastricht treaty - which includes provisions for a common European foreign and security policy - appears to have tipped Mr van den Broek's hand toward demanding more powers, specifically co-responsibility for appointing Brussels civil servants in any of the 110 offices overseas. At present, Sir Leon shares the power of patronage with Mr Manuel Marin, the Spanish commissioner for development aid. However, Sir Leon enjoys the lead management role since the vast majority of the EC's offices engage in trade-related work.</p>

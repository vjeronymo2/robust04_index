			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Auto union goes for Ford first THE United Auto Workers' union yesterday set in motion a tussle over the pay and conditions of half a million US car industry workers when it named Ford Motor as the company with which it intends to negotiate a new contract first. Under traditional 'pattern bargaining', the UAW tries every third year to reach a new contract with a target company and then to impose similar conditions on the other two big Detroit vehicle-makers. The UAW's current contracts with the big three are to end in mid-September. Ford wanted to be the target company and presented an outline package to the UAW last week. It is financially more robust than rivals General Motors and Chrysler. The union, concerned about GM's competitiveness, may well be more flexible than usual. Industry analysts, who do not expect a strike against any of the car companies this autumn, point out that union leaders have struck a conciliatory tone towards the big three recently. Richard Waters reports: Workers at Bethlehem Steel, the second biggest US steel producer, have approved a six-year labour accord which will allow a representative of the United Steelworkers of America union on to the board.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Coffee prices shrug off pact blues COFFEE TRADERS were not unduly dismayed this week as the International Coffee Organisation's two-week negotiating session made negligible progress towards a new price-supporting international agreement - they had expected nothing better. About all producer and consumer negotiators at the ICO could claim to have achieved as the meeting drew to a close yesterday was the identification and clarification of their differences. While they have agreed to meet again at the the end of March, they will have an uphill task to meet the March 31 deadline for renewing the agreement. Brazil, the biggest producer, yesterday accused some important consumer countries of lacking the political will to reach an understanding. Its delegation issued a statement stressing its 'disappointment and frustration at the lack of progress in what was to be the decisive phase in the negotiation of a new international coffee agreement'. No attempt has been made so far to tackle crucial points such as how to determine the size of export quotas or the price range to be defended; and significant divisions remain on 'selectivity' between different coffee types within the quota system and 'automaticity', the rolling forward of quotas from the end of one coffee year to the beginning of the next. If the market was disturbed at the negotiators' performance it did not show it. The May robustas price at the London Futures and Options Exchange closed yesterday at Dollars 922 a tonne, up Dollars 27 on the week and Dollars 18 higher than the level ruling before the ICO talks began. Initial disappointment as early hopes for the negotiations evaporated had sent the price down to Dollars 801 a tonne at one stage last week, but that fall was quickly recovered. Since then the market, while keeping a jaundiced eye on the ICO session, has been more interested in the tightening fundamental supply/demand situation and the activities of the powerful New York investment funds. Mass movements of investment fund money have been largely responsible for the wide fluctuations in coffee prices in recent months and expectations of lower production in Brazil have recently been inclining the fund managers to the side of the bulls. The cocoa market has no such fundamental factors to prop it up. With oversupply continuing and talk circulating that recent arrivals from the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, have been higher than was expected the market came under further pressure this week. The May futures position in London closed yesterday at Pounds 708 a tonne, down an apparently modest Pounds 8 on the week; but the fall would have been more than Pounds 20 a tonne had it not been for the decline in sterling against the dollar. On the New York market May cocoa futures, which ended last week at Dollars 941 a tonne, were quoted at Dollars 906 a tonne in late trading yesterday. World sugar prices continued the recent slide, the May futures price in New York reaching 8.46 cents a lb in late trading yesterday, down 11 cents on the week. The bearish mood of the market did not appear to be materially affected by news yesterday that ED F. Man, the London trade house, had cut its estimate of the 1992-93 world supply surplus from 3.44m tonnes to 1.47m tonnes. At the London Metal Exchange most attention was directed at the zinc market, which had moved up sharply late last week on news of a production cut at Pasminco of Australia and this week was presented with further output reduction announcements by Cominco of Canada and Metallgesellschaft's Ruhr-Zinc of Germany. Any hopes that a law of accumulating returns might apply as the output cuts mounted were quickly dashed. The Pasminco cut (25,000 tonnes this year) helped the LME's zinc price up to Dollars 1,137 a tonne initially; Cominco's (50,000 tonnes) did only marginally better than that at Dollars 1,140 a tonne; and the peak inspired yesterday by Ruhr-Zinc's (30,000 tonnes) was a decidedly disappointing Dollars 1,135. At the close three months zinc was quoted at Dollars 1,128 a tonne, up Dollars 10 on the week. While the latest round of cuts has more than tripled this year's expected zinc deficit dealers point out that they still look pretty modest in comparison with the 1m tonnes in western world stocks. Copper prices were firm, ending about Dollars 9 a tonne higher on the week. But once again the pound's weakness made the sterling-denominated market look stronger than it was, with three months metal showing a Pounds 40 gain to Pounds 1,555.75 a tonne. The underlying steadiness was a reflection of concern over strike worries in Mexico and Chile, dealers said. Platinum group metals finished the week with their tails up as the outlook seemed to improve for world industry in general and motor manufacturers in particular. Platinum, the biggest outlet for which is the automotive catalyst market, rallied by Dollars 2.25 yesterday to Dollars 360.75 a troy ounce, down Dollars 3.75 on the week, as buyers were encouraged by German and Japanese interest rate cuts and improving US economic indicators. But it was outrun by its sister metal palladium, another catalyst metal, which was fixed in London at a 30-month high of Dollars 114.90 an ounce, up Dollars 2.55 on the week. Palladium's extra strength was prompted by concern over supplies from the former Soviet Union, dealers said. The London gold price, having been under pressure throughout the week, ended yesterday at the bottom of the range, pressing against support at Dollars 328 an ounce.  --------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------------- Aluminium    +175   to   1,628,375 Copper     +1,975   to     315,475 Lead         -700   to     233,750 Nickel       +126   to      79,338 Zinc       +7,400   to     532,775 Tin           +60   to      17,005  ---------------------------------------------</p>

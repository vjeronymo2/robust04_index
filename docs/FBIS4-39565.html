			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking at a news conference in Moscow today,  leader of the communists in the Russian State Duma Gennadiy  Zyuganov did not rule out the possibility that in  September-October 1994 the authorities will launch what he  called another blitzkrieg: presidential elections.    Speaking of his recent tour of the Volga region and Russia's  far north he said he had seen a sharp economic decline and a  sharp rise in crime. He said that if this trend continues, the  introduction of extraordinary measures by any government is  inevitable within the next few months.    Zyuganov also spoke of what he called favorable symptoms:  All the regions he visited have swung to the political left and  the position of the Communist Party has strengthened greatly.  He said that what is called the democratic government has no  prestige in these regions.    He said that the best next move before the introduction of a  state of emergency would be that suggested by the Accord for  Russia movement: To work out a common opposition program,  propose a team capable of carrying it out, unite political  efforts and win over industrial circles and trade unions.</p>

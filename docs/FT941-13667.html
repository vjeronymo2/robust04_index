			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Aspin's deputy named as defence secretary President Bill Clinton yesterday named Mr William Perry, deputy US defence secretary, to move up into the top Pentagon post in place of Mr Les Aspin, taking on a position that Mr Clinton has found difficulty filling to his satisfaction. He said Mr Perry was 'a real pro' who had 'the right vision for the job'. After asking Mr Aspin to resign, Mr Clinton had named retired Admiral Bobby Ray Inman as his successor, but Adm Inman last week withdrew his name, complaining of a conspiracy of newspaper columnists against him. Although Mr Clinton said yesterday that the job was 'absolutely, categorically not offered to anyone else', efforts were made to interest Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, or former Senator Warren Rudman, a respected Republican expert on defence and budgetary issues. Mr Perry, a 66-year-old mathematician whose role as number two at the Pentagon has centred on management and acquisition issues, told the White House on Saturday that if pressed for an immediate decision, he would have to say no, for family reasons. By Sunday afternoon, however, he had agreed to take the job. In President Jimmy Carter's administration, Mr Perry headed the Pentagon's research operations and was an early champion of stealth technology. Before returning to Washington last year he was managing director of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco investment banking firm, and headed a Silicon Valley consultancy. He said yesterday that implementing the force structure proposed by Mr Aspin's 'Bottom Up Review' within Mr Clinton's proposed defence budget would be difficult but achieveable. 'In order to carry out the Bottom Up Review with the funds proposed for it we will have to manage the Pentagon very well,' he said. Although he is expected to be more organised than the intellectually fertile but sometimes unfocused Mr Aspin, Mr Perry's limited political or foreign policy experience means he is unlikely to be the answer Mr Clinton has been looking for to the shortcomings in his national security decision-making structures. Mr Aspin will stay at the Pentagon until Mr Perry has been through confirmation by the Senate.</p>

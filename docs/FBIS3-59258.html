			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shen Zhiyu (3088 1807 3342): "Noted Economist </F> Comments on Price Trends, Price Reform"]    [Text] Since the beginning of this year, inflation has been  picking up momentum in a broad area. The central government took  macroeconomic control and regulatory measures but instead of  being reined in, the overall social retail price index actually  continues to climb. How should we interpret this situation and  what actions should we take as a response? Recently we  interviewed Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan [1728 0587 0337], an expert  on prices, and asked him to comment on price trends and the next  stage of price reform in China.    Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan is currently director and a  researcher with the Finance, Trade, and Economics Institute of  the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He is also a professor  and supervisor of doctoral studies at the graduate school of the  academy, and vice president of the China Prices Society. He has  been studying the issue of prices for years and has written  several books, including Socialist Price Theory and Price  Reform and Selected Works of Zhang Zhuoyuan, and  hundreds of scholarly articles. He is well known in academic  circles at home and abroad.  <H3>  Is It Normal for Prices To Rise Just as Macroeconomic  Regulation and Control Gets Under Way? </H3>   Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan began by briefly describing the  current situation on the price front. Before June this year when  the central government took macroeconomic regulatory and control  measures, fixed assets investment continued to expand with no  letup. Coming on top of the raid expansion in 1992, this  resulted in an overheated economy, releasing the inflationary  pressures that had been building up for the past several years.  The overall social retail price index climbed every month, up  10.2 percent between January and June alone. Prices of capital  goods also soared, up 21.7 percent by May from the beginning of  the year. The price of steel used in construction at one point  hit 4,300 yuan per ton, significantly higher than the price on  the international market. Meanwhile, the exchange rate of the  renminbi on the foreign exchange regulatory market plummeted. On  1 June the government decontrolled prices on the foreign  exchange regulatory market. By late June the exchange rate had  dropped to $1:11 yuan. The plunge would have continued had not  the government intervened in time. Interest rates on the market  and the black market surged, with the annual interest rate  reaching 20 percent or so in most cases, vastly higher than  those charged by banks. The explosion of real estate prices was  stunning; the prices of undeveloped land rose in an endless  spiral, doubling and redoubling again and again.    Faced with this grim economic situation and galloping  inflation, the Chinese Government tightened its macroeconomic  regulatory and control measures beginning in June to cool the  economy, check inflation, and prevent prices from rising too  rapidly. Among other things, it clamped a tight lid on the scale  of credit and the money supply, strictly limiting the amount of  currency issued in 1993 to within 150 billion yuan. It cracked  down on illegal capital-raising; demanded that banks collect the  funds they had lent in violation of the law within a specified  period; raised the interest rates charged by banks; and revived  value-guaranteed savings. It demanded that the Bank of China  become a true central bank and get out of business dealings in  the future. It raised the interest rates on treasury bonds this  year and speeded up their sales. It tightened its management of  the real estate market, imposed controls on foreign exchange and  reformed the foreign exchange retention and utilization system,  selling foreign exchange on the foreign exchange regulatory  control to hold down exchange rates. Party and government organs  at all levels were prohibited from going into business with no  exception in a draconian step to stop state organs and their  affiliates from collecting all sorts of fees arbitrarily under  all sorts of pretexts by using their office, etc. In the  professor's opinion, it is essential that the government took  these measures. Had the government not acted, the development of  the entire economy would have ben affected, as would reform.    More than two months later, the above-mentioned measures  have  begun to pay off, as demonstrated mainly by the following: The  upsurge in industrial expansion, hitherto excessive, has  retreated. In July the output value of industrial enterprises  at the township level and above nationwide rose 25.1 percent  compared to the same period last year, but was 5.1 percentage  points down from the preceding month. The average daily output  value was off 15.4 percent from the level a year ago. For the  entire January-July period, the gross value of industrial output  was still 25.1 percent higher than the corresponding period last  year. In fixed assets investment, fewer new projects were  launched. In July, the number of capital construction projects  and modernization and transformation projects was off by 6,372  compared to the previous month. The boom in real estate and  development zones has begun to cool off. The consumer goods  market continued to stabilize and flourish. The trading of  capital goods began to slacken, with the volume of transactions  heading downward. The supply-demand gap for major materials has  narrowed. Prices fell and inventories continued to rise. The  regulatory exchange rate of renminbi rose, stabilizing at about  $1:8.8 yuan currently, which represents a 20 percent  appreciation for the Chinese currency since it hit a record low  in late June. Exports rebounded. According to customs  statistics, there was a 6.5 percent gain in exports in July  compared to the same period last year, while a drop of 9.1  percent was recorded for the preceding month. Household savings  surged. In July new urban and rural household savings deposits  amounted to 40.5 billion yuan, 26.9 billion yuan more than the  same month a year ago, reversing a downward trend.    At the same time, however, prices continued to climb because  of the delayed effects of inflation. Retail prices jumped 13.9  percent in July, pushing the retail price index up 10.8 percent  for the January-July period. Workers' cost of living index rose  12.8 percent in just the January-June period, and 14 percent  from January through July. In the 35 large- and medium-sized  cities, the workers' cost of living was a high 23.3 percent by  July; for the entire January through July period, it was 18.2  percent. Can the central government's macroeconomic regulatory  and control measures check inflation effectively? Just how long  would prices keep on going up? Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan has  offered an analysis of price movements for the remaining few  months of 1993 and 1994.  <H5>  What Is the Optimal Meeting Point? </H5>   As Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan sees it, the introduction of  intensified macroeconomic regulatory and control measures would  not tame inflation any time soon. The reason is that it usually  takes six months or so for macroeconomic changes to be reflected  in prices. In the first few months, therefore, prices may  continue to go up. He expects inflation to ease notably only  after October. When the central government acted to toughen  macroeconomic regulation and control, its goal was to cool the  economy gradually after a period of adjustment, restore balance  to the overall volume of the macroeconomy, and then bring  inflation under control effectively after a time lag, slowing  the rate of price increases. Specifically, if we manage to keep  fixed assets investment, new bank lending, and the increase in  the money supply below 1,000 billion yuan, 400 billion yuan, and  150 billion yuan, respectively, this year, and if we can hold  the rate of increase of the gross value of industrial output at  20 percent or below and the annual growth rate of gross output  value at 10 percent or so, then the nation's overall retail  price index for 1993 may stay below 12 percent. In other words,  we can hold the nation's overall retail price index for the  second half of 1993 below 14 percent. At the same time, the  exchange rate of the renminbi will hold steady at $1:9 yuan or  so. That way a little more fine-tuning is all we need to do in  1994 to further stabilize the economy and hold the rate of price  increases to within two digits.    One other scenario is conceivable, however. If the  government's macroeconomic regulatory and control measures are  resisted by local governments and some enterprises and therefore  are not really carried through or if these units go along with  them half-heartedly at the beginning only to relapse into their  old ways later by going around the red light, thus preventing  the economy from staging a soft-landing and reigniting the  investment explosion, then the government's original economic  adjustment objectives will not be met. In that case, we will  have difficulty controlling inflation and prices will continue  to rise. Specifically, suppose total investment exceeds 1,000  billion yuan by a wide margin; new bank loans surpass 400  billion yuan, perhaps even reaching 500 billion yuan; the amount  of currency issued goes beyond 150 billion yuan; the gross value  of industrial output remains at a high level, hitting 25 percent  or even higher, and the gross value of output expands 13  percent, 14 percent this year. Suppose too that retail prices  surge 20 percent nationwide in the second half of 1993 and the  exchange rate falls back to $1:10 yuan. If all that comes to  pass, the government would have no choice but to adjust the  national economy more radically in 1994 so as to re-stabilize  it. And that will come with a steeper price. Professor Zhang  Zhuoyuan pointed out that the first scenario is a more likely  outcome. The war on corruption being waged nationwide in  particular will help us reach the various targets as required in  the first scenario.    Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan noted that since there is a  relationship of mutual substitution between inflation and  economic growth, which means that when the economy expands too  rapidly, it will inevitably trigger off notable inflation, we  must find the best meeting point between a high rate of economic  growth a sustainable rate of price increases as a major point of  reference for the central government as it regulates and  controls the macroeconomy. Bearing in mind the conditions in  China, he suggested the following meeting point for the nation  as a whole in the next one to two decades: average annual  economic growth rate around 9 percent and prices increasing 6  percent on the average annually, not more than 10 percent at  most. Assuming that he has located the best meeting point and  that the Chinese economy more or less behaves as it should,  China would still lead Asia and the world in economic growth  rate, ensuring the achievement of the strategic objectives it  has set for itself by the end of the century, thereby realizing  a fairly comfortable standard of living. What is more, China  will match the economic development level of moderately  developed nations by the second or third decade of the next  century. It seems that this is a promising path that would lead  to accelerated economic growth amid stability.  <H5>  What Next Step Should We Take in Price Reform? </H5>   When you discuss the current price movements, you naturally  have to talk about price reform. After 14 years of price reform,  Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan said, China has taken big strides in  the transition toward a market price system and made substantive  progress. The market mechanism has begun to play a leading role  in the formation of commodity prices. A distorted price  structure has improved significantly. Measured against the  requirements of developing a socialist market economy, however,  price reform has not been completed. Under the central  government's plan to tighten macroeconomic control and  regulation, price reform is scheduled to slow down for a certain  period of time. In the long haul, however, price reform must be  pursued with vigor as well as a steady hand. How then are we to  further price reform in the future? Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan put  forward the following four proposals.    First, decontrol the prices of those products ready to enter  the competitive market. As of now there are still prices which  should be deregulated but have not, including the prices of a  number of leading commodities such as energy products, including  centrally allocated coal and finished oil; raw materials such as  steel and non-ferrous metallic products; chemical industrial  products such as basic chemical industrial products, chemical  industrial raw materials, chemical fertilizers, chemical fibers,  and plastics; construction materials such as cement; heavy-duty  mechanical products; light and textile industrial products, and  a handful of agricultural products under contract procurement.  The reasons are extremely complex. For starters, there is the  fear that once these prices are decontrolled, the overall price  level would shoot up so much so that it would be burdensome for  enterprises and households alike. Secondly, the market is still  immature. Industry-based monopolies and regional separatism have  impeded the formation of a unified market and hence more  standardized market-regulated prices. Thirdly, to protect their  own vested interests, some departments have balked at delegating  power, so on and so forth. It seems that even with a more  enthusiastic attitude, it will take us two to three years to  gradually decontrol those prices which should be deregulated but  have not so far.    Second, we must further rationalize prices under government  control. A number of key commodities are still underpriced, so  the task of price adjustment remains an arduous one. For  instance, the government should set the prices of crude oil and  natural gas in a centralized manner. Moreover, it should raise  their planned prices substantially, from the present 200 yuan or  so per ton to more than 700 yuan to bring them in line with  international market prices. Rail freight charges should be more  or less doubled, which would increase the freight per  ton/kilometer from 3.85 fen to about 6 fen. The prices of  government-procured grains and those sold to consumers also must  be raised. Public housing rents are clearly on the low side at  present; they too must go up. Price adjustments will involve  huge sums of money. The adjustment of the prices of crude oil  and natural gas and rail freights alone, for instance, would  mean an additional 50 billion yuan changing hands. This cannot  be accomplished overnight. If we try to do it in one fell swoop,  the overall price level would jump a dozen percentage points,  which would be socially unacceptable. Therefore we must phase  them in step by step, doing everything we could to straighten  out the prices mentioned above within five years or so without,  however, touching off a round of double-digit inflation.    Furthermore, we must gradually let the market regulate the  prices of capital goods. Among such prices, the most important  are interest, the price of funds, otherwise known as capital,  labor wages, land prices and rents, and exchange rates between  the renminbi and foreign currencies. In accordance with the  requirements of developing a socialist market economy, they all  should be formed and regulated by the market so that the most  essential market signals would not be distorted and the  improvement of the efficiency of resource allocation would not  be hindered.    Zhang Zhuoyuan singled out interest rates, the prices of  funds, the foremost capital goods, for special discussion.  Calling funds the scarcest economic resource in every market  economy, he pointed out that having the market determine  interest rates is the first step in having the market determine  the prices of capital goods. In a socialist market economy,  interest rates are the most essential lever available to the  government for regulating the macroeconomy. To ensure able,  coordinated, and effective economic growth, the government must  regulate interest rates. In an overheated economy, for example,  the rediscount rate and re-lending rate charged by the central  bank must be raised to drive up interest rates on the market and  hold down inflation. When the economy is too sluggish, on the  contrary, the rediscount rate and re-lending interest rate  charged by the central bank should be cut to push down interest  rates on the market, spur investment and consumption, and bring  about economic recovery and growth. Be that as it may, interest  rates regulation by the government or the central bank  essentially consists of regulating the base interest rates as a  way of influencing market interest rates, not directly fixing or  altering market interest rates. As for interest rates charged by  commercial banks and other financial institutions on loans or  paid by financial institutions on deposits, the government  should not intervene but instead give the market a free hand in  regulating them. Regarding interest rates payable by enterprise  and companies as they seek to raise funds directly, the  government too should take a hands-off policy and let the  bonds-issuing bodies determine the interest rates to be carried  by the bonds. Accordingly a distinction must be made between  commercial banking and policy-oriented banking, between  commercial banks and policy-oriented banks. When a loan must be  made to a key infrastructural project or a project in a leading  industry on preferential terms, the treasury may pay interest in  the form of a deduction and take other steps to differentiate  such a loan from ordinary commercial banking.    Finally, we must create an effective price regulatory and  control system. Both during the creation of such a system and  after, we must keep the overall price level relatively stable  and basically stable to ensure the stable and normal functioning  of the economy. To stabilize the price level, the key is the  implementation of a stable macroeconomic policy by the  government. The central bank must keep a tight leash on the  amount of money it puts into circulation, limiting not only the  cash issued (M0), but also the supply of currency defined  broadly to include cash and deposits (M1 and M2). By and large  the money supply must not expand faster than the GNP. Nor should  the growth rate of the money supply be excessively higher than  what the monetarization of the economy requires, preferably  around 5 percent.    He went on to say that to ensure the stable development of  the socialist market economy, we need do more than regulate  interest rates, wages, and exchange rates. We must also prevent  wild swings in the prices of major commodities. Toward that end,  we must set up the necessary grain, energy, and raw materials  reserves and establish price regulating funds, including  separate regulating funds for grain and agricultural byproducts.  Concomitantly, producers, traders, and consumers must be  provided with signals -- market and prices -- as a guide to  prevent the supply and demand as well as prices of key  commodities from moving too sharply upward or down, which would  hurt the sustained and coordinated development of the national  economy. Furthermore, we must perfect prices-related law-making,  enforce the law strictly, and establish a variety of supervisory  bodies and methods. All of that is indispensable.</p>

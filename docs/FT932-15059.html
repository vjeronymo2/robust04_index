			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Thos Cook ends up with 21% of Owners - Tender offer ties up loose ends in Pounds 285m travel industry bid battle THOMAS COOK, the travel agency and financial services company, has ended up with a 21 per cent stake in Owners Abroad, the holiday group it helped defend against a hostile bid from rival Airtours. Owners' shareholders rushed to offer stock to satisfy the 150p a share tender offer made by Thomas Cook at a crucial stage in the Pounds 285m Airtours' bid. When the offer closed on Tuesday, Thomas Cook had received tenders from shareholders representing 76 per cent of Owners' shares. In line with the terms, which limited Thomas Cook's offer to 12.5 per cent of the equity, Owners shareholders have been scaled down to about 16 per cent of what they tendered. Thomas Cook and its sister company, LTU, the German tour company, will now forge closer ties with Owners Abroad and will be anxious to see the savings its new partner promised during the bid. Owners Abroad's share price closed 4p lower yesterday at 110p, down 37p from its highest level during the bid. Owners Abroad's current share price would tend to underline the wisdom of Airtours' decision to sell in the market the 7 per cent stake it acquired during the bid. Airtours is understood to have received about 118p a share, when Owners' share price was 123p, generating at least 10p a share above the average price it might have received had it tendered to Thomas Cook and then sold the balance in the market. Airtours' share price has also fallen sharply since its 339p high during the bid. Yesterday it closed up 10 1/2 p at 289 1/2 p. Only part of this fall reflects the Pounds 9.5m cost of the bid, including the loss on sale of its stake in Owners. Thomas Cook's tender ties up the loose ends of the bid which gripped the travel industry for the first quarter of the year. Investors and competitors will now be watching with interest to see what Owners can do with its independence and what Airtours does now that it has failed to leap into a position to challenge Thomson, the market leader. The company has already indicated it will spend some of its Pounds 180m war chest - part of which was raised during the bid through an issue of convertible preference shares - to increase the size of its retail chain. Its purchase last October of Pickfords was its first step in this vertical integration. While Airtours believes it can continue to grow organically, it also accepts it cannot continue to grow at the breakneck speed of recent years and is considering the acquisition of brands.

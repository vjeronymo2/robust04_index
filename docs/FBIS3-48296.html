Backed by an ample amount  of funds, it has exercised uncanny influence not only in the  political, bureaucratic, and financial worlds, but also in the  underworld, and moreover, we have been in the dark about the  real situation. However, an internal family feud commenced the  same time as the Liberal Democratic Party split, and the taboo  has begun to crumble.    It goes without saying that the Japan Shipbuilding Industry  Foundation was built up in one generation by Ryoichi Sasagawa.  He is the final survivor of the A-class war criminals. Ryoichi  Sasagawa is the man who has reigned as "Japan's don," wielding  great authority in the political world, right wing, and gangster  world after the war.    It has been the post of chairman of the Japan Shipbuilding  Industry Foundation, the acme of the motorboat racing world,  which the don has continued to protect. The Motorboat Racing  Law was enacted by Diet legislation in 1951 when Japan was  heavily colored by the war defeat. The current Japan  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation was established in 1959.    It is the achievement of Ryoichi Sasagawa, who is well  versed with inside and outside of society, commanded this  industry that initially was said to be "a place of employment  for members of ex-special attack unit, Special Service Agency,  and military police members" and was said to "have tattooed  gangsters among its racers," modernized it, created a  nationwide organization, and nurtured the Shipbuilding Industry  Foundation which was its core until it became called "the  world's foremost financial group now surpassing Rockefeller."    It was also called the Sasagawa empire, and it has become an  abode of demons not easily penetrated by the outside in which  his family of "three illegitimate children" and "common-law wife  who is called the Mrs." are cleverly linked to the vested  interests of the motorboat racing world backed by his influence.    The don will be 94 this year and his former figure of vigor  has come to an end.    "He has stopped jogging, which he had done every day for  some  time, and I recently happened to see him after a long while,  wondering how he was doing. The chairman was standing in a daze  in front of the house, looking up at the sky. Since it was very  different from his previous figure, I was shocked" (neighbor of  Ryoichi Sasagawa).    "He repeats the same thing over and over as if he were a  broken record.... There are times when he feels good and times  when he feels bad. He no longer carries out a hard schedule like  before. When he goes to a party, he has private secretaries  with him and if they notice anything "strange" about him, they  immediately take the chairman outside" (motorboat racing source).    It seems that he is no longer able to hide the  characteristic symptoms of being old.  <H5>  Amount Allocated Is 140 Billion Yen </H5>   When the strength of the don weakened, it was inevitable  that  the empire would begin to collapse concerning his successor.    Currently, the don's third son Yohei (53) is in the post of  chief managing director, which ranks next to the post of  chairman. Criticism about Yohei began spreading at the  beginning of this year.    Then, there has been opposition between Yohei, who has been  steadily making preparations to inherit, and Shuhei Omori  (president of Rengo Kaihatsu), and Shigetoshi Kano, chief of  the Public Relations Office (former private secretary to the  chairman) who were formerly said to be Sasagawa's closest  associates. It is reported that an internal feud is occurring,  and that Shizue Sasagawa (69), his "common-law wife," has begun  to wield power in place of the weakened chairman. Moreover, a  scandal has begun to be revealed that Yohei is involved in big  projects, which he commenced as a symbol of "the start of my  own second era of founding businesses."    Before daybreak on 18 June, a pistol suddenly was fired into  Yohei's home in Setagaya, Tokyo. Moreover, the pistol thought  to be used by the culprit and 15 live bullets were placed before  the entrance as if to attract attention.    What in the world is happening in the Japan Shipbuilding  Industry Foundation?    I began to investigate the Japan Shipbuilding Industry  Foundation at the end of March 1993. Now, dozens of pages of  inside information lie near at hand. Searching through them, one  will inevitably notice a surprisingly tricky and complicated  flow of money that is behind the accounting of the Japan  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, which has been called clean.    Below, I would like to close in on the dark side of the  Sasagawa empire that has not yet been told, based on that inside  information and interviews with several inside sources.    First, I will touch lightly on the motorboat racing world.  The scale of vested interests held by the Japan Shipbuilding  Industry Foundation there exceeds by far our imagination.    In the house cut system, the amount the motorboat racing  associations in various regions earn is about 2 trillion yen  annually with 24 boat raceways nationwide. Seventy-five percent  of that is returned to fans and the remaining 25 percent is  allocated to expenses for holding them or the local autonomous  bodies that sponsor them and the motorboat racing associations  in the various regions.    The take of the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation is 3.3  percent of sales. In other words, it has become a system where a  house cut of about 66 billion yen annually rolls in by doing  nothing. This is allocated as subsidies related to merchant  shipping and ship construction (Title I grants) and culture and  welfare groups (Title II grants). However, the actual amount of  the allocation balloons to about 140 billion yen if the interest  portion is included. This house cut system takes on a "public"  nature and should be called tax money that formerly was  collected by the Treasury, and administration in full view of  the public is stringently sought.    It is Ryoichi Sasagawa who sits in the post of chairman that  runs the show in subsidy allocation. Moreover, he has a hand in  the budget as chairman of the National Motorboat Racing  Association Federation [Zenmoren] that is the agent for the  racers.    According to a racing association source, that system  "collects the dirty house cut with the right hand and  distributes it as honest money with the left hand. Moreover, the  more it distributes, the more gigantic it becomes and stories  roll in of vested interests from around the world with  connections to Ryoichi Sasagawa who has an ample network of  people in it. For example, if a single company is designated for  a project, a commission is accepted."    It is an "ingenious system, completely untainted," so to  speak.    Moreover, the greatest feature of the Japan Shipbuilding  Industry Foundation is that it is a juridical foundation as  opposed to other forms of gambling, such as cycle racing and  horse racing in which, being special corporations, personnel  authority for officers is held by a supervising government  agency. In other words, personnel changes are completely at the  will of Sasagawa and it is "the only publicly operated gambling  organization" that gets by just with the approval of the  Ministry of Transport.  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     Under the law, approval of the Ministry of Transport must be  obtained for the allocation of those subsidies, but the  relationship between the chairman and the Ministry of Transport  is such that "when the chairman goes to give New Year's  greetings, all the employees stand erect and greet him, and even  the bureau directors come to the entrance and stand up straight"  (Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation source). He even has  the Ministry of Transport under his thumb.    Sasagawa designates his own related groups, which are just  like the tentacles of an octopus, as the recipients to whom the  subsidies flow. He has cleverly managed to control the matter  within ahe family by appointing his third son Yohei to  important positions such as chief managing director of the Japan  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation and concurrently chairman of  the Tokyo Prefecture Motorboat Racing Association, and placing  at end points of the industry "Taiyo Printing" (managed by his  eldest son Masatada), which prints boat tickets, etc.; "Yamato  Motor," which has a monopoly on racing boat engines; and "Nihon  Tota," which supplies boat ticket issuing machines (management  participation in these two companies by second son Takashi,  currently member of House of Representatives). In the past,  criticism has been raised many times about this organization  that "it is improper to have the same family involved in the  income and outgo of money," and "it should be a special  corporation like cycle racing and horse racing." However, no  impropriety has been discovered at all, and consequently,  Sasagawa control has not been shaken. Everything has been  accomplished because of the very fact that it is Ryoichi  Sasagawa.  <H5>  A Dismissal Incident </H5>   A rent in that empire began to be seen about one year ago.  It  was because a rumor started that "the chairman was senile."    It is said that immediately "there was a telephone call"  from  Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who spearheads the Seibu group, "wanting to  meet with Chief Managing Director Yohei" (Japan Shipbuilding  Industry Foundation source).    A rumor spread that Tsutsumi was involving the Ministry of  Transport and aiming for the position of chairman. A shock was  generated internally.    On 26 May 1993, an internal feud in the Japan Shipbuilding  Industry Foundation surfaced all at once.    On this day, Kano, the head of the Public Relations Office,  who reportedly opposed Yohei, suddenly was fired.    It was disciplinary dismissal action. The reasons were  recorded thus on a standard sheet of paper transmitting the  official announcement.    "1. Spoke exceeding job authority, intimidated and committed  intimidating acts, and carried out coercive actions against  superiors.    "2. In addition, took similar actions against fellow workers  and committed impardonable acts in an organization."    "The above-stated points 1 and 2 pertain to No. 2 and No. 5  of Article 49 of the Work Regulations."    Intimidated superiors and fellow workers -- is not a gentle  reason. However, in essence, it seems the gist is that "he went  against Yohei who is the chief managing director." "He made use  of the media and leaked the inside situation to the outside."    Kano met Ryoichi Sasagawa when he was 27, became entranced  by  the Sasagawa idea, and "hired himself as private secretary."  Until a certain time, he was the fellow usually at the side of  the chairman and thereafter came to work for the Japan  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation for a period of 20 years.  Something extraordinary must have happened for a man like Kono  to be punished unilaterally and in a form equivalent to "a  death sentence" for a white-collar worker.    The Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation began to shake  inside with the disciplinary dismissal of Kano. Chief Managing  Director Yohei's side began a purge of the Kano group.    Section chiefs who were believed to be friendly with Kano  were called one by one and given a hearing on the circumstances.    Furthermore, agents who were acquainted with Kano from the  standpoint of chief of the Public Relations Office were  pressured.    Clearly, something unusual was happening in the Japan  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation.    What was the real reason that he was fired? I met Kano.  Along  with claiming that the punishment was improper, he informed me  about the real state of affairs and that a reign of terror by  Chief Managing Director Yohei had begun inside the Japan  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation.    Below, I will pursue the background for this sudden  punishment based on testimony from Kano and some 10 odd inside  sources whom I met.  <H5>  A Single Word From the "Mrs." </H5>   The strategic preparation for the recent disciplinary  dismissal actually goes back to a year ago.    Last year, a similar incident occurred inside the Japan  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation concerning a personnel change  of the chairman's private secretary.    In March, Chief Managing Director Yohei broached the subject  with M, who had been the chief of the chairman's Private  Secretary Section, that he wanted "to replace him soon." The  various department heads acknowledged that and left it up to the  chairman. However, when Managing Director Yohei and Masahiko  Yoshimatsu, director of the Secretariat, sounded him out, the  chairman indicated that M would stay in his post and,  ultimately, it was left at that.    However, it was 31 March, the day before delivery of the  appointments.    When M, chief of the Private Secretary Section took the  chairman to his home in Sengoku, Tokyo, his wife, Shizue  Sasagawa, came out and said, "You won't need to come starting  tomorrow." The chairman was silent and said nothing.    With these words, the personnel change was made. The  personnel change was settled overnight in a form that accepted  the will of the wife, not a discussion of the chief of the  Secretariat and others with the various department chiefs. The  next day, M, chief of the Private Secretary Section, was  transferred to be chief of the Loan Section.    His wife Shizue is the person mentioned before who is called  "Mrs." in the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation.    She is said to be "the woman closest" to the chairman and is  the only person who can influence the mind of the weakened  chairman. Perhaps for that reason, Chief Managing Director  Yohei, who "had been on bad terms with her for a long time"  (according to a source), quickly got close to the wife,  beginning about one year ago.    However, although she lives in Sengoku and carries the last  name of Sasagawa, she is not actually the legal wife of the  chairman. Ryoichi Sasagawa's legal wife is Kazue (73), who is  called "the Osaka Mrs." by those inside. Shizue took the last  name of Sasagawa by becoming the adopted daughter of the  chairman's younger sister. Of course, she is neither the real  mother nor the foster mother of Chief Managing Director Yohei.    However, she is said to be "the woman that the chairman has  loved the most since the war," and she was the woman who made  visits almost daily to meet Ryoichi Sasagawa when he was  incarcerated in Sugamo Prison as a class-A war criminal and was  awaiting a death sentence (later released). Sasagawa later told  those close to him that Kazue became extremely angry at him when  he told her that he was `thinking of putting Shizue on the  family register.'"    She is talented on the chikuzen biwa (style of lute playing)  and it was Shizue's biwa at the end of the NHK program that  ended with "Goodbye, everyone in Japan" on the day of the Iwo  Jima defeat. She is also a scholar in Chinese poetry recitation  and currently is vice chairman of the Japan Recitation, Sword,  Poetry, and Dance Promotion Society [Ginkenshimai], one of the  related groups of Ryoichi Sasagawa. A person close to the  Sasagawa family says, "She is a charming person and still like a  schoolgirl."    However, there is another face to her. That is the face of  "empress of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation." This  spectacle is often witnessed by the staff in the Japan  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation building:    A person connected with the Japan Shipbuilding Industry  Foundation waits holding a hot towel in front of the women's  restroom. When wife Shizue comes out, he says, "Here you are,  Mrs." and holds it out to her respectfully.    Moreover, the Benz in which she rides, including the driver,  comes from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. The  gorgeous recording room across from the elevator hall on the  10th floor of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation  building was made for her, and it is said that "special  consideration is made" to her group for subsidies that are  granted by the foundation every year. It is a privilege given to  "the woman that Sasagawa loves most."    Her words that "you won't have to come here starting  tomorrow" truly rival the words of the chairman. [passage  omitted]  <H5>  Secret Agreement on Coup d'Etat? </H5>   On 26 May, the fateful day for Kano came.    It was the disciplinary dismissal action. Kano has filed a  personal integrity suit with that as a complaint.    It could be that Chief Managing Director Yohei punished  Kano, who previously had been close like a brother, as a warning  for "a fellow who knows too much about me" because he coveted  the post of chairman.    It seems that the results were immediate. A person connected  with the foundation whom I contacted designated a hotel room as  the place for collecting the information and was worried about  being noticed and being followed.    "Indeed, such punishment was unusual. However, he had been  making very threatening moves for the past year. It was  punishment for that series of moves."    Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu explains thus. And after  acknowledging an apology in front of the department and section  chiefs on 5 April, he flatly says, "There is no internal feud  as has been reported. It (the foundation) is extremely calm." On  the other hand, he said there is an anti-Yohei group inside  that sympathizes with Kano.    Unmistakably, a serious disturbance is occurring in the  Sasagawa empire that had boasted of being a monolith.    Such information has leaked from in and around the  foundation  as if it aimed at the cracks. "Actually an emergency motion was  scheduled to be introduced at the board of directors meeting to  approve the settlement of accounts on 27 May. It was to move  Chairman Sasagawa to honorary chairman and install Chief  Managing Director Yohei in the post of chairman. Then the  director of the Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau at the  Ministry of Transport would receive a post-retirement  appointment [amakudari] to the empty post of chief managing  director. There had been a meeting for that purpose between  Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu and Director of the Maritime  Technology and Safety Bureau Toda and it seems that Director  Toda had said, `If the post of chief managing director is  returned to us, Yohei will be appointed chairman somehow or  other. The Ministry of Transport will take the responsibility  and make the rounds of Nagata-cho (the politicians).'    "However, Takashi, who heard this, said that `It would be a  serious matter to do such a thing when trouble has been  reported,' and called it off. Ultimately, the secret agreement  on the coup d'etat plan could not be materialized."    Managing Director Yohei, Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu,  and Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau Director Toda deny the  secret agreement, but several persons on the inside say there is  no mistake.    Nevertheless, what are the serious allegations that have  come  out from time to time? The big project allegations that Kano  told to Chief Managing Director Yohei at the Hotel Okura and  were later reported by some of the media are the allegations  concerning the "Hotel Kaiyo," the super high-rise hotel that is  said to have had total construction costs of about 25 billion  yen, and "Boatopia Himeji," an off-track boat ticket sales  office that the motorboat racing world launched to compete with  horse racing. Perhaps Kano might have been fired because he  touched upon that "alleged secret agreement."    Tracing the flow of money, I came up against some rather  interesting facts. One purpose of this report is to shed light  on the actual situation of that accounting.    Before that, however, I would like to review the details  concerning the appointment of Yohei to the position of chief  managing director, which is virtually the No. 1 post. It is  because he was appointed to this post that the propriety of  heredity, which should not exist at all in a foundation that is  a nonprofit corporation, is being questioned.    Ironically, it was Kano and Omori who made Yohei the chief  managing director. At one time they worked together in the  foundation as a "reform group" which involved Yohei.    In May 1989 Yohei was appointed chief managing director of  the foundation.    The post of foundation chief managing director originally  had  been a seat designated as an amakudari post for successive  directors of the Ship Bureau (later, the director of the  Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau) in the Ministry of  Transport.    It is said that when Ministry of Transport bureaucrats were  appointed to that seat "the foundation had been virtually taken  over." The Ministry of Transport had the authority to  distribute amakudari to important places. "They would wait  patiently. That was the feeling in the Ministry of Transport,  and when the chairman died, they would take control at once and  make it a special corporation like the Japan Keirin Association  and JRA [Japan Racing Association]." When they tried to hold  department or section chief conferences, they were rejected  with the words, " Go talk to the Ministry of Transport and  discuss that with them," or "There is no need for you to think  about that," and they could not even hold conferences.    "They wanted to grasp the post of managing director and make  the foundation a private enterprise. They wanted to create a  free, open-minded work place."    That was the reform. Kano and Omori were at the center of  the  group promoting it.    The two schemed to recapture the chief managing director  post, which is basically the top post after chairman, from the  Ministry of Transport, place a private citizen in it, and make  the foundation a private enterprise.  <H5>  "There Is No One Left But Me" </H5>   The chance came suddenly.    In 1983, Chief Managing Director Eiichi Tasaka, a Ministry  of  Transport veteran who was widely known as an able man, suddenly  died. It was just about that time that Yohei had joined the  foundation as a director. Until then, Yohei had been at "Nihon  Tota," which was connected with Takashi Sasagawa, but "He was  young, smart, and articulate. This person might some day...."    Thinking thus, Kano and Omori brought him along.    They probably could sweep out the Ministry of Transport  completely by this.    Quickly, Kano and others persuaded the chairman. Everyone  was  fervent. Yohei also was in the middle of it. The one planned for  the post was Yujiro Shinoda, professor at the Social Economics  Research Center at Sophia University. He also was a director of  the foundation and was not totally unrelated.    "We will have Shinoda take over the post."    The Ministry of Transport was silent in the face of a mere  word from the chairman. It happened in 1984. At the time, this  personnel change received much attention by the media, evoking  talk about "the appointment of a literary scholar to what had  been an amakudari post for successive directors of the Ship  Bureau of the Ministry of Transport."    However, Shinoda changed the moment he sat in the chair of  chief managing director.    It was a position where the budget of 100 billion yen could  be moved anywhere by his signature alone. That was magic power.  The power little by little ate away at Shinoda who had been a  scholar. The crowd hoping for subsidies set him on a pedestal  and he became alienated from the staff.    Shinoda fell ill.    That was the time. Yohei, who had been reticent up until  then, said to Kano and the others, "I will be it. There is no  one left but me." So, Yohei was appointed the post of chief  managing director in 1989."    However, the reaction of the Sasagawa family was strange.  The chairman extremely disliked Yohei's appointment to the  position of chief managing director. It was Omori and Kano who  persuaded him. Ryoichi's three children, including Yohei, are  illegitimate, and Ryoichi Sasagawa did not hesitate to say to  people around him that "he is no child of mine." When his  associates said that his face resembled him, Sasagawa would make  a serious face and say, "No, I went to the hospital and fully  checked this out (pretending to squeeze his crotch). I have no  offspring."    At times he has shouted at Yohei, "Give back your name (of  Sasagawa)!" On those occasions, Yohei has turned pale. It can be  said that Sasagawa is more severe than necessary with Yohei.    When Yohei volunteered that he wanted to be chief managing  director, the Sasagawa family was rigidly opposed. At the time,  the wife Shizue, with whom he was on bad terms, said with rage,  "If you do that, the Sasagawa family will be destroyed. It will  fall to pieces!" Takashi, who already had turned to the  political world, was furious with anger. "What are you doing!"  he stormed in with rage, and it is said that a terrible quarrel  between brothers took place. It was a fight to be heir to the  don.    It will be mentioned in more detail later, but the Sasagawa  family had to have "a flesh and blood fight" concerning the heir  to the don.    It is said that Yohei begged, "Father, why don't you approve  me? Let me do it," while crying in front of Ryoichi in Sengoku.  It was Chief Managing Director Yohei that was born as a result.  It was a difficult delivery, but the birth of the young chief  managing director seems to have held the hopes of the reform  faction staff that "it will change the image of the foundation  at once by this." [passage omitted]    Yohei was born the child of Kiyoko Ogawa (deceased), a  hostess at Tokyo Kaikan, a high-class cabaret in Ginza, Tokyo,  in 1939. According to a person close to the Sasagawa family,  "she was the most beautiful of all the women with whom the  gallant chairman had relations." However, Ryoichi visited the  home of Kiyoko in Asakusa, Tokyo, only several times a year. It  is mentioned in The Unprecedented Man Ryoichi  Sasagawa (by Sohachi Yamaoka), which is said to be written  based on dictation from Sasagawa, that Yohei remembered Ryoichi  coming to the house in Asakusa only three or four times when he  was about five. [passage omitted]    It is reasonable that Yohei grew up as a child without  knowing the face of his father at all.    After Ryoichi left Sugamo Prison, he lived with Shizue. When  Yohei turned 18, he was placed in the charge of Ryoichi at  Sengoku, but it was in 1970 when he became 31 that he formally  took the last name of Sasagawa. Although Ryoichi was his own  father, he was not a father to him. Such probably was the  existence for him. Yohei was daunted in front of Ryoichi.    On the other hand, Kano and Omori were the closest  associates of Ryoichi and those outside say, "The two seem to be  just like children of the chairman." [passage omitted]    There is a crowd that is on more intimate terms and closer  just like sons to Ryoichi Sasagawa than him [Yohei]. It is not  strange that the buds of love and hatred toward them already had  been cultivated there. When Yohei grasped authority -- the post  of chief managing director -- he changed completely and probably  could not avoid looking at them with a harsh eye. The reason for  Yohei's later favorite phrase, "I will act differently from the  chairman," probably lies in his early days.  <H5>  Chairman Collapses at Party </H5>   On the chairman's state of health, Secretariat Director  Yoshimatsu says, "He is in good health. He comes every morning  and decisions are made every day. He has no illness peculiar to  the old as written in the media. Being old, however, he  sometimes repeats the same story from beginning to end. Other  than that, he has somewhat lost his ability to remember. His  only chronic disease is hemorrhoids and he was hospitalized only  for two days for surgery on an ulcer on his shoulder," but....    Ryoichi Sasagawa's health condition has been concealed until  now by a very few close associates. Only a very few know  about it even within the foundation. It is because the Ministry  of Transport, who had the position of chief managing director  stolen away since Eiichi Tasaka, has been on the alert, looking  for a chance to recover it. They must not give them an excuse.    According to those around him, Sasagawa, when he was  healthy,  "would not use the elevator in buildings of some 10 stories, but  would walk down the emergency stairs. When asked why, the  chairman would say, `I am chairman of the World Federation of  Firefighters. I can certify safety; besides, it is good for the  body.' The people with him got tired. It was hard when they  reached the bottom of the emergency stairs and found the door  locked and they all had to go back up the stairs with the  chairman. They got really tired."    "In any event, he is healthy. Even though he is over 70  years  old, he shows people that he is healthy by doing push-ups. Even  if you say `please don't,' he continues, saying `No.' You'll  be amazed."    "At any rate, he has good intuition. He goes through the  thick documents at tremendous speed, stamping his seal of  approval, bam, bam, bam, bam. Yet sometimes he comes to a  sudden stop; he knows when there is something wrong. It's like  he smells it. It's magic. You'll be amazed."    Sasagawa has a tremendous tenacity for life. To prevent  senility, he runs high voltage electricity through his body to  make the blood circulation good for peripheral nerves. Moreover,  he does all sorts of things, such as taking the fresh air and  taking tonics.    This healthy Sasagawa suddenly collapsed around 1981 or 1982  in Hakone.    "He was attending a party and when everyone made a toast,  the  chairman collapsed with a thud, still holding his glass. What? I  thought, but the chairman collapsed so that the contents of the  glass did not spill. `Chairman, you must not joke,' Eeveryone  was saying. Then he began snoring and everyone was alarmed and  confused."    A doctor was called immediately. It was a light cerebral  hemorrhage. Sasagawa was in a state as though he was dead for  about two months and could not move. When he gradually became  better, "he pulled out his own hair and saying, `It must not be  good to have so much hair,' `How could I allow myself to succumb  to a trifling thing like this hair!' he glared at the hair that  he clutched. Then when he had a little command of his body, he  crawled restlessly around the room."    Those concerned concealed it with a trip abroad.    The second time he collapsed was in 1983 when Sasagawa was  84  years old. The site was the Keio Plaza Hotel. He was returning  from a lecture. In the lecture that day, Sasagawa had talked to  the audience with exceptional strength.    "Just as he got into the car, he tottered. When I looked, he  was asleep, snoring. He was immediately hospitalized at St. Luke  Hospital. It took one week for him to recover."    That too was completely concealed.    After that, Sasagawa was fatigued and collapsed many times.    Even though he was urged to rest, he carried out a hard  schedule, saying, "Even if I hide in a vault and have 100  doctors manage my health, when it is time to die, I will die."    The restoration of Sasagawa's health began when he was 88  and  started jogging, but his body gradually has weakened like a  fire going out.    It seems that his close associates, who watched him  deteriorating, began to think that they would like to make it so  that they could speak of him with a nicer title, not the title  of "left wing, A-class war criminal" when he died. The strategy  to capture the Nobel Peace Prize was born there.    One thing is noticed in viewing the profile of Ryoichi  Sasagawa.    The image of "respect motivated by fear" which he has had  before and after the war has changed dramatically in two  aspects. One is the conversion from a symbol of anti-Communism,  and the other is the start of aggressive activities abroad.  <H5>  Ulcer Was the Occasion for Weakening </H5>   When the controversial Unification Church established its  first base in Japan in 1963, it was Ryoichi Sasagawa who became  its consultant. In the late 1960's, Sasagawa was appointed  chairman of the International Victory Over Communism Federation,  but at the time, several staff members of the Shipbuilding  Industry Foundation and his related groups, by order of  Sasagawa, "took lectures to become leaders of the Unification  Church at the training center for motorboat racers at Lake  Motosu" (inside source).    Also it is said that he gave ministers of the Unification  Church part-time work and supported them by giving them a salary  for about a year.    The sudden conversion from such "anti-Communism" was in  1972.  Actually, this was due to advice from his close associates. Then  in the late 1970's, Sasagawa became aggressively involved in  activities abroad with their advice. The object there was  acquiring the Nobel Peace Prize.    The beginning of a chance seemed to be when the grandson of  Nobel came to Japan. It is noted during the various talks there  that he was convinced that "The Nobel Prize is not given, it is  acquired. There are people in the world who nominate for the  Nobel Peace Prize. I must make inroads with them."    However, their names are concealed. He obtained the  information little by little. Then his private secretaries found  their way to the nominators.    For example, there is Linus Pauling. He was a person who  took  two, the Nobel Peace Prize and the Nobel Chemistry Prize. He was  a researcher on vitamin C and he also was one of the nominators.  So, the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation began subsidies to the  Linus Pauling Research Institute.... He just privately diverted  foundation money to satisfy his own desire for fame.    This was a secret that Ryoichi Sasagawa was being promoted  as  a candidate of the Nobel Peace Prize. [passage omitted]    The occasion when Sasagawa gradually began to wane was the  surgery for the ulcer that Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu  previously mentioned one year ago. However, an informed source  says that it was not an ulcer, but a burn scar. He explains,  "When he was in Sugamo Prison, U.S. officers mistakenly  suspected that the moxa cautery administered by the B- and  C-class war criminals to people in China was `torture' and they  were about to inflict severe punishment. When the chairman heard  this, he said, `That is medical treatment. It is done this way,'  and he burned some moxa at the nape of his neck to show them and  dispelled the misunderstanding. It was the burn that came from  that time."    It is said that when that scar was neglected, it became  cancerous and was removed by surgery, but the total anesthesia  of his body was the clincher and Ryoichi weakened all of a  sudden. [passage omitted]    This weakening made Yohei uneasy.    Preparing for the worst, he had to begin creating a hasty  system.  <H5>  "Favors Sold to Politicians" </H5>   As previously mentioned, the motorboat racing world is a  world that could be created because of the very fact of Ryoichi  Sasagawa.    When Yoshio Kodama, who was called the leader of the right  wing, controlled the seven chivalrous groups of Kanto and  created the "Kanto Association," visited Sasagawa, he would  take a rigid, upright position before the room and enter,  saying, "Kodama is coming in, sir." He never sat on a chair  until Sasagawa urged him. Moreover, if a fellow came in hopes of  money, Sasagawa chased him away with a roar, saying "you have to  kill me to get it!"    Yohei does not have that power. He has only the influence of  his father.    So what was he thinking? It was an alliance with the  political world and the Ministry of Transport to replace that.  That is what Ryoichi most hated and especially alliance with the  Ministry of Transport was close to "shaking hands with the  devil" for a group who was defending to the death the position  of chief managing director and wanted to promote privatization.  In the case of Chief Managing Director Yohei, however, it  probably was absolutely necessary to achieve inheritance of the  chairman post which he eyed relentlessly.    Thus, it was a natural course of events for the hearts of  close associates who had come to serve Ryoichi and Yohei to be  alienated from Yohei.    It is said that Tsuneo Watanabe, president of YOMIURI  SHIMBUN, has become the "political world instructor" for Yohei.  It is said that Yohei quickly became close to both former prime  ministers Yasuhiro Nakasone and Noboru Takeshita through him.    For example, on 5 May 1990, he played golf with both former  prime ministers Nakasone and Takeshita and Tsuneo Watanabe at  the Fuji Sakura Country Club in Yamanashi Prefecture. On 14  June, he played golf with Takeshita, Kiichi Miyazawa, and Tsuneo  Watanabe at the Three Hundred Club in Shizuoka Prefecture.  Moreover, on 31 July, he golfed with both former prime ministers  Nakasone and Takeshita and the deceased Shintaro Abe, and they  chatted for two hours the night before at Yohei's villa on Lake  Kawaguchi.    The staff says about such things, "When we meet with  officials, we are instructed to report casually that Yohei met  with Takeshita yesterday..."    Moreover, in September 1990, when he returned to Japan after  a meeting with former Soviet President Gorbachev, Yohei spread  the rumor among the staff that "I was carrying secret documents  for Takeshita." Moreover, now that Takeshita has lost his  standing, he has begun to say inside, "Takeshita is no good. Now  it is Mitsuzuka."    The problem, however, is not the indiscreet talk or golf.  The problem is the reason why he is contacting the political  world. He is using subsidies from the Japan Shipbuilding  Industry Foundation, which is inherently public money, to try to  buy favors from politicians.    The subsidies allocated by the Japan Shipbuilding Foundation  are under the rigorous supervision of the Ministry of Transport,  and such a thing should not be permitted. However, "There are  many recommendations from Diet members in the Foundation subsidy  applications, but when Chairman Sasagawa was healthy, he highly  detested such strings attached. Therefore, a sense of fair play  was required. Chief Managing Director Yohei, however, is  different. He gives preferential treatment to them and when the  subsidy grants are informally decided, he orders staff to  `quickly contact the politician and sell a favor'" (informed  internal source).    Moreover, each time, he has the staff confirm whether thanks  have come from the interceding Diet member and if not, he has  them phone for a reminder.    This is just like using the subsidies allocated by the  foundation as a tool for Yohei's political schemes    Actually, I have two pages of inside information at hand.  One  is a letter in memo style. The other is a list entitled "Project  Applications for Fiscal 1988." In other words, it is information  related to the spoils from Yohei's "selling favors" to  politicians.    Written in the letter is thus, "Yoshimatsu, There was a  telephone call of thanks from the distinguished gentleman  previously mentioned. After referencing your list of names,  please let me know the names of those who have not contacted us.  Sasagawa."    Sasagawa, of course, is Yohei.    Written on the left under "Foundation welfare appreciation  TEL" is a list of the names of 23 House of Representatives  members, including Koichi Kato, and three House of Councilors  members.    There is another list. On it are the names and telephone  numbers of 42 Diet members, including Yasuhiro Nakasone, Ryutaro  Hashimoto, and Yoshiro Mori, and then the name of the group and  scheduled amount for the grant.    Like this, for example:    Name of Diet member or other introducer: Shoichi Nakagawa  (Hokkaido 5)    Name of group: Yubetsu Welfare Association    Name of project: construction of special home for care of  senior citizens    Ranking: (blank)    Amount of subsidy/assistance request: 194,300    Amount scheduled: 194,300    The unit is 1,000 yen. Then there is a mark believed to be a  check ahead of the name. Perhaps being no contact of thanks yet,  "later" is written next to Noboru Takeshita. There is also his  older brother's name, Diet member Takashi.    When I tried to confirm it with Diet member Nakagawa, he  said, "The item of your inquiry was recommended by my office.  When building a special home for the care of senior citizens, at  the request of the Hokkaido Development Agency, we asked the  Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation and others for a  construction fund grant for the portion not covered by the  Ministry of Health and Welfare budget. Since this is a open  matter, I do not thing that there is any special problem"  (Private Secretary Saito, Nakagawa's office).    Regardless of the fact that the source of the funds is the  house cut on gambling, the subsidies allocated by the Japan  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation are treated as public money and  acts that can be misunderstood are strictly forbidden. In  addition, this is supposedly supervised rigorously by the  Ministry of Transport.    Why has the Ministry of Transport ignored this situation?  Actually, it is a circumstance where it can only be believed  that the Ministry of Transport also adheres.  <H5>  Golf With 11 From Transport Ministry Vice Minister on Down </H5>   An informed source of the Foundation says, "Our jurisdiction  is the Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau of the Ministry of  Transport, but that is a technical officer position. Chief  Managing Director Yohei says, `It is the administrative officer,  not the technical officer, who has power. In the future, we must  get close to the Transport Policy Bureau or future candidates  for administrative vice minister.'"    For that reason, on 9 August 1992, Yohei invited Ministry of  Transport bureaucrats to golf at the Fuji Sakura Country Club.  There were a total of 11 people participating:    Administrative Vice Minister Toru Nakamura    Transport Councilor Kiyoshi Terashima    Secretary General Minoru Toyoda    Senior Councilor Hideaki Mukaiyama    Director, Transport Policy Bureau, Hideo Otsuka    Director, Road Transport Bureau, Yasutoshi Tsuchisaka    Director, Maritime Transport Bureau, Yoshitoshi Asami    Director, Ports and Harbors Bureau, Masaaki Uemura    Director, Civil Aviation Bureau, Michihiko Matsuo    Director, Documents Section, Shogo Arai    Director, Seafarers Department, Masakazu Nagao    It is a prominent line-up. All of them should be called the  central officers of the Transport Ministry.    Looking at the list which forms "the car preparation report"  for the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation from the Ministry  of Transport and the "8 August (Saturday) Car Dispatch  Allocation Preparation List" that the foundation prepared upon  its receipt, which I have obtained, it is learned that they went  the day before to Yohei's villa in Yamanashi Prefecture, riding  separately in four foundation cars and two hired cars  chartered by the foundation, spent one night there, and then met  for golf. Naturally, they had a reception at the villa and the  return home probably was similar. Isn't this unprecedented  "entertainment"?    How does the Ministry of Transport respond? It was Maritime  Technology and Safety Bureau Director Toda who replied.    " I have been told that they all went. I also received an  invitation, but didn't go because of business. Such golf parties  are not routine, but it seems like there have been several so  far. They probably went because it would be rude to refuse. I  believe that it is within the scope of etiquette."    Furthermore, in regards to matching the schedule of 11  officers, "It probably was planned a long time ago. Oh yes, it  was golf at the beginning of August, wasn't it?. Everyone clears  their schedule before the Bon festival."    The common sense of the Ministry of Transport must be  doubted. I asked a bureau director-level bureaucrat about "the  scope of etiquette." He was speechless.    "Entertainment of so many people normally is impossible. It  is not common sense. It will end up becoming a big problem," he  said.    Can they really say that they are supervising the Japan  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation in this manner?    He had hold of politicians and the Ministry of Transport.  Did  he think that now there was nothing to fear? Yohei rushed  full speed into the big projects of "Hotel Kaiyo" and "Boatopia  Himeji" which were to be the symbol of the start of the "second  Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation era" which was his own  aim, and these were much bigger projects than the scale of  previous projects.    "Hotel Kaiyo" opened in October 1992.    Total construction cost was about 25 billion yen. It is a  building with 23 floors above ground and four below ground. It  has a rather splendid appearance and soars up unexpectedly in  the shopping district of Shin Okubo. A panoramic view of the  neighboring Kanto prefectures is possible from the bar lounge on  the 22d floor. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Once Permission Is Given, It Is Unrestricted </H5>   The issues are the following two points.    According to an inside source, "One point is that a request  for a subsidy was made to the Japan Shipbuilding Industry  Foundation from the Marine Foundation with the objective of  repairing the Ship Science Museum, and the funds that were  granted were transferred into the "Hotel Kaiyo" building fund,  which is a special account. Moreover, it was not just for a  single fiscal year. Looking at the statement, that transfer of  money was continued for four consecutive years with 2.63 billion  yen in fiscal 1990, 2 billion yen in fiscal 1991, 2 billion yen  in fiscal 1992, and 1,395 million yen in fiscal 1993.    "Furthermore, the second point is that 3 billion yen  borrowed  from the general account is different in pretext from the time  of application. It was a project, including provision of the  infrastructure, for the permanent anchorage and display of the  "Yotei Maru," an Aomori-Hakodate ferry boat that already had  been purchased, in the waters in front of the Ship Science  Museum."    In other words, it was this.    A subsidy that was received under the pretext of a public  works project was applied to the construction expenses for the  "Hotel Kaiyo" every year.    Moreover, the foundations involved with this hotel are all  controlled by the Sasagawa family. I would like you to look at  the following:    Marine Foundation chairman, Ryoichi Sasagawa; chief managing  director, Eichi Kamiyama; director, Yohei Sasagawa.    SO Foundation chairman, Ryoichi Sasagawa; director, Yohei  Sasagawa (former chief managing director).    Upon further investigation, we find that these foundations  were all established with subsidies from the Japan Shipbuilding  Industry Foundation. It goes without saying that Yohei, the  chief managing director, is the one who holds real power in the  Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation.    This means that Sasagawa-affiliated foundations poured money  from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, from right to  left, like a tunnel company, to raise construction funds for the  "Hotel Kaiyo." It is no different from a money-laundering scheme  by the Sasagawa family. It can be said that the "Hotel Kaiyo"  was created with grant money from the Japan Shipbuilding  Industry Foundation, which supposedly require strict  examination.. I reiterate, Yohei controls the strategic  positions in that flow.    Moreover, the amount of the subsidy granted to foundations  by  the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation normally is said to  be 1 billion and some yen in both the welfare sector and  special cases. The amount for the Marine Foundation alone is  very large.    How was such a thing done? Subsidies from the Japan  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation need the permission of the  Ministry of Transport at the time of application. What about the  check system of the Ministry of Transport? A very interesting  fact came out upon investigation.    "When you want to transfer a subsidy once it has been  granted, you don't use it and leave it in a pool and you can  make a project change at the end of the fiscal year. This change  can be made just by a settlement inside the Japan Shipbuilding  Industry Foundation."    In other words, regardless of the pretext, once permission  is  given and the subsidy comes out, they change the object of fund  use. It becomes what is called ex post facto approval by the  Ministry of Transport.    The Marine Foundation "was inspected by the Ministry of  Transport twice regarding construction objective, purport of  construction, fund procurement, contracts, and payment. Since it  passed everything in February and March this year and received a  license, I believe that there won't be any problem. The reason  for two inspections was that, being cautious, the Ministry of  Transport wanted to inspect with another set of personnel. The  General Affairs Section of the Maritime Technology and Safety  Bureau was in charge" ( Yasuki Tobita, acting general manager,  Marine Foundation "Hotel Kaiyo").    The Ministry of Transport responds thus, "We were shown in  advance the details of the fund allowance. We do not think that  there is a problem. As for the transfer from the general  account, it was just a transfer to the "Hotel Kaiyo" in the form  of a temporary loan of the subsidy obtained from the Japan  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation with the objective of improving  the environment of the Ship Science Museum. That is because it  was involved with the Marine Subcenter of Tokyo Plan, the  construction was delayed from the outset and ended up not being  used for that reason. We approved it in advance and do not  believe that there is any problem. Since it is effective use of  funds within the same foundation, the method of use is not  strange, but it probably will be a problem if they do not return  it" (Director Toda, Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau).    However, I wonder what the Ministry of Transport thinks of  using a subsidy under a certain pretext and transferring it  elsewhere and continuing to do that for over four years.    It could be understood if some subsidies were transferred to  another project just for a year. However, how can you explain a  subsidy that is given under the same pretext every year and  changed to the same project every year? The misunderstanding  cannot be avoided that the large, excessive flow of money to the  "Hotel Kaiyo" is a juggling of the books. Why wasn't the  transfer of that portion to another public works project  considered?    It is not a matter that it should be returned as the  Ministry  of Transport says. The moral responsibility for a method of  granting subsidies that can be misunderstood must be brought to  question. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Bride Also Was Introduced </H5>   [Kaga] Please explain the reason for the disciplinary  dismissal of Kano on 26 May.    [Sasagawa] You can't do a disciplinary dismissal half-way.  It  is now pending in court. Since it is an issue of a person's  honor, we cannot say anything.    [Kaga] But, a disciplinary dismissal is like a sentence of  death for a white collar worker.    [Sasagawa] No, since he is a man of considerable wealth, I  don't think that he will have trouble eating.    [Kaga] Some see the recent strife as an internal feud of the  Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation.    [Sasagawa] I don't know why you would say a feud. The  organization is not split into two. If you look at events, there  is only the matter of one capable staff member having a  disciplinary dismissal. If you call it a feud when one person  does bad things, then that probably is the word, but I don't  believe so.    [Kaga] Was there a secret agreement with the Ministry of  Transport on creating a "coup d'etat" on 27 May?    [Sasagawa] I know that such a thing was floating around as a  rumor and it became an interesting and amusing story, but it  probably doesn't merit comment.    (At this point, there was still time to get responses and I  directed the questions to the two allegations.)    [Kaga] Why did you build such a lavish "Hotel Kaiyo"?    [Sasagawa] Actually, there have been few facilities recently  for students making a school excursion to Tokyo to stay, and  since it would not be good in terms of education to complete a  school excursion without seeing Tokyo, I wanted to build such a  thing. Since regional hotels and facilities recently have  improved, we decided to rebuild. Whether it is lavish or not is  a subjective issue. There is a total of 12,200 tsubo and the  total construction cost was 25 billion. Since the tsubo unit  price construction cost was 1.6 million, we do not believe that  is so lavish.    [Kaga] However, is it permissible to transfer a special  account to the general account?    [Sasagawa] Since it is efficient use of funds within the  foundation, there isn't any problem, is there? Since  construction was delayed on the Tokyo Subcenter, we just  borrowed it to use because a money surplus was created for a  year or a year and a half.    [Kaga] What process is undergone for the procedure of  transferring money?    [Sasagawa] The process is that first, a Marine Science  Promotion Foundation board of directors meeting is held,  approved items are brought to the Japan Shipbuilding Industry  Foundation, and there are discussions with the person in charge  of title one grant money at the Shipbuilding Industry  Foundation. Then if approval is made, it is brought to the one  in charge at the Ministry of Transport to get their  understanding.    [Kaga] Allegations have been whispered about "Boatopia  Himeji" also...    [Sasagawa] We wanted a low-interest loan to do work on  expanding the off-site boat ticket sales offices, and the first  was "Boatopia Himeji." Fuji Rex is a company where I was an  administrator a long time ago. We decided that we should have  them do it and created it by persuading a great opposition  movement. Now it is much appreciated by the shopping district,  we are increasing the days that it is open and it seems that it  is changing to cooperate for the benefit of the shopping  district.    [Kaga] It is said that there is a deep connection between  you  and Fuji Rex. Should it be called your company?    [Sasagawa] It is a company where I worked for a portion of  my  youth since I served as administrator at the age of 32. I have  had a very friendly acquaintance with Fujita and also was made  an officer of Nihon Hikosen. Moreover, it is a fact that when I  heard that the performance of the company had not been that good  and they needed funds, I wanted to help. He also introduced me  to my bride. However, he now is retiring.    [Kaga] It seems that Fuji Rex is thinking about opening a  chain of off-site boat ticket sales office with Store No. 2 and  Store No. 3, but why is it centered on Fuji Rex?    [Sasagawa] There is a head office promoting Boatopia  nationwide and there are about 70 or 80 companies that want to  build them now. Among them, the only ones that by chance are  bearing fruit at the present point in time are the three  locations of Himeji, Kure, and Akita. Major firms also have said  that they want to participate in the future. It does not means  that other businesses cannot participate because Fuji Rex is  doing it.    [Kaga] There are a lot of Fuji Rex staff members at the  Marine Foundation.    [Sasagawa] They are people who have been employed because  they said they wanted to be devoted to hotel management over 20  years ago when I joined Fuji Travel as an administrator.    [Kaga] Was financing initially a part of the modernized  center concept?    [Sasagawa] It was from the start.    [Kaga] Last year, weren't the regulations revised to make  financing possible for the first time?    [Sasagawa] No, since government offices proceed with work in  order, it only was approved in order.    [Kaga] At the Fuji Sakura Country Club on 9 August last  year,  you played golf with 11 prominent members of the Ministry of  Transport bureaucracy. Moreover, hired cars were sent to get  them from the Foundation and they all stayed at your villa.    [Sasagawa] Wasn't it seven or eight? It is a fact that we  played golf. It is also a fact that we used foundation cars.  However, our chairman is very strict, and the entertainment  expenses for the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation are 16 million  in all. Therefore, it is a fact that I personally invited them  at my own expense, but it is only once a year.    [Kaga] Is it an annual custom?    [Sasagawa] No, it's not. It was a one-time courtesy thing  last year and the year before last. I suppose you might have a  good image when you hear a villa, but I and my wife laid out  the bedding and they all slept together in a group....    [Kaga] You said it was personal, but drivers were hired.    [Sasagawa] They were borrowed (from the foundation).    [Kaga] Did you use your pocket money for their wages too?    [Sasagawa] Since they are drivers that belong to the staff  of  the foundation, I do not pay.  <H5>  "This Is Awful Information" </H5>   (He seemed to assume a threatening attitude and asked what  was wrong with have a reception for government officials. What  about another alliance, his connections with the political  world?)    [Kaga] Are there requests from politicians for approval of  subsidies?    [Sasagawa] Ryoichi Sasagawa has a better reputation to  respond specifically to such a thing. It is a famous story, but  long ago he asked, "Have any requests come from kith or kin?"  When I said, "This and this have come," he said to remove those  unconditionally. That is the way we have come to do business.    In the words of Ryoichi Sasagawa, "Our work is a job that  makes 10 people happy and 90 people enemies. We are thanked by  the people who receive, but the many people who are left off say  that Ryoichi Sasagawa is disgraceful." It is only the  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation that so long as the case is  good, it is the same whether or not it is particularly  introduced by someone, and that is not involved with Diet  members.    [Kaga] You said that it would be rejected just by seeing the  name of kith or kin, but among the grant projects in fiscal 1988  is a welfare facility mediated by Takashi Sasagawa. In the case  of the chairman, is it just when seeing the name of Takashi that  he does not say, "No good."?    [Sasagawa] Naturally, he says it.    [Kaga] I have heard that when you became chief managing  director, political schemes were necessary and your have  permitted applications with ties to politicians or ordered  mediating politicians to express thanks.    [Sasagawa] There is no reason for that.    [Kaga] Don't you do confirmation work as to whether or not  thanks have come by phone?    [Sasagawa] That is not so.    [Kaga] Would you take a look at this (look at "thanks list"  in this article)? I believe that this is a request to get proper  thanks.    [Sasagawa] That is not so.    [Kaga] But this has been checked as to whether someone  mediated and whether there were proper thanks regarding projects  with strings attached. In other words, isn't it the exact  opposite of what you said now?    [Sasagawa] It is a fact that there have been telephone calls  (from politicians). They ask to be informed if anything  happens...    [Kaga] Looking at the items on this list, there is, for  example, the item of ranking. There are no numbers, but viewed  generally, this is something which you cannot help saying has  strings attached.    [Sasagawa] That is a matter of if it were to come, it would  be nice that it came. I don't think that it is necessary to make  a list of whether or not telephone calls of thanks came from  Diet members. This is just a matter of my secretary writing down  the telephone calls received.    (To the chief of the No. 2 Operations Department) We are now  talking about the philosophy of the chairman. In the  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, the chairman determines  whether a case is good or bad, no matter who requests it. When I  explain that it is not that it was done or not done because it  was requested by a Diet member, he says aren't we dealing with  so many cases that involve politicians. I have not seen this  information.    Chief of No. 2 Operations Department: We in the No. 2  Operations Department undertake consultation on applications.  Naturally, we consult with local autonomous bodies, and  distinguished members of the Diet and the local community. Since  there are cases where the private secretary seems to be in  charge together with us, there are cases where we make up a list  of them. An examination cannot be made by the administration if  the details are not definite. The reason is that we have to  create rigid criteria.    [Sasagawa] I am just bragging. Compared to others, the  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation has extremely little  involvement with politicians.    Chief of No. 2 Operations Department: Your use of such  expressions such as involvement is causing problem, chief  managing director. That is because when asked by people who do  not understand this system, they take it to mean that it is  controlled by them.    [Kaga] No one is saying that this information is a forgery.  We have confirmed that there were thanks from Diet members.  Actually, it would not be necessary to create information that  includes the names of Diet members if had no effect.    [Sasagawa] We don't need this. I am amazed. This is awful  information.    Chief of No. 2 Operations Department: As a supervisor, I  believe that it is a little different from whether this or that  information created by the person in charge is not needed. I  will not stop information for attempts to do highly motivated  work.  <H5>  Contradiction in Yohei Sasagawa's Ambitions </H5>   (He appeared considerably flustered. Inherently, the  occurrence of this internal feud was due to the weakening of his  father Ryoichi.)    [Kaga] What about the health of the chairman?    [Sasagawa] He laughed when I mentioned it (rumors of serious  illness) to him. He still walks on his own feet. He doesn't need  a hearing aid or eyeglasses for the old. We recently had a  birthday party at the "Hotel Kaiyo" just for the family, but I  led in the toasting and when I said, "They always say that the  chairman will live until he is 200 years old, so please excuse  us ordinary people if we precede you," he shouted loudly, "What  foolish talk. You will live to be 200 years old too." In view of  his age, I think that he is exceedingly healthy.    [Kaga] I heard that there was opposition within the family  when you were appointed chief managing director.    [Sasagawa] That is not true. In fact, my older brother is  taking the path of the politician.    [Kaga] What do you think about the inheritance system?    [Sasagawa] Honestly speaking, I think that it is the issue  of  a successor, but the successor is decided by the board of  directors. Since there are people who have insight on the board  of directors, I cannot be one just because I want to be it. I  am putting all my effort into seriously doing the job that I now  have been given. My interest is filial piety and I have been  working by considering what would be best for Ryoichi Sasagawa.    [Kaga] Yohei responded to the interview in the office of the  managing director at the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation for  about two hours.    He is a man small in stature who resembles Ryoichi Sasagawa.  He had a constant smile on his face. . His voice was sonorous  and seemingly eloquent.    His expression changed when I showed him the aforementioned  "list of thanks." His expression up to that point vanished and  he bent his head and was silent for a while.    The two projects that are proceeding through the good  offices  of Yohei are his strategic preparation for inheritance.  Moreover, the fact that Yohei has gotten close to politicians  and the Ministry of Transport is to cover the influence that is  far inferior to his father and to have those inside the  Shipbuilding Industry Foundation as well as the Sasagawa family  approve his "inheritance." However, there is a big  contradiction. The closer he gets to the Ministry of Transport,  the stronger will be the voice of the Ministry of Transport, and  the farther will be the path toward control by the Sasagawa  family, or in other words, to his "inheritance" and it might  inevitably be linked to a special corporation like horse racing  or cycle racing.    Solidifying his position in the Sasagawa family and placing  the Sasagawa empire under his control truly are nothing but a  contradiction. Does Yohei really realize that contradiction?    The motorboat racing world is an empire that has been  maintained because of the very fact that it was Ryoichi  Sasagawa. When the problem of Sasagawa's health was born, the  collapse of the empire was inevitable.</p>

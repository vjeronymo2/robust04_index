			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Arts: Pal Joey - Bristol Old Vic Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey (1940) was thought obscene when it transferred to London from New York in 1954. It was doctored for the English censor, and then further diluted into the anodyne film version: Columbia excised the social and sexual comment by turning it into the story of a heel (Sinatra) and two women (Hayworth and Novack). The original is a dark tale of exploitation and ideals, and it has been delivered accurately and energetically in a fine production at the Old Vic. The English have never evolved an equivalent of the American musical. The genre combines felt realities with hoped-for dreams, staples from Showboat to West Side Story. But this strain in American music has been developed away from the stage by Paul Simon ('American Tune') and Randy Newman ('Land of Dreams'). The English revival of a Rodgers-Hart musical now tells us about our own times. This production of Pal Joey puts Joey the young opportunist, Vera the sexually assertive older woman and Linda the idealistic girl, in the original Chicago dive. Joey is the quintessential toy-boy and wide-boy who thinks with his loins andcalls lust ambition. But the 'dames' are always in control. Here, the key to the evening is not the overworked but enduring 'Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered', but 'Take Him . . . he's free' sung by the two women in Joey's life as they decide who will claim ownership. The sexual energies are kept hidden, but emerge in the intimate ballads, 'What is a Man?' ('is he an ornament, useless by day, handy by night?') and 'Den of Iniquity', a fouled version of the ideal love-nest. The show is sharply and wittily choreographed, with fine dancing throughout, particularly from Sara Weymouth (Gladys) and the night-club troupe. Jill Gascoine (Vera) acts the rich vamp superbly; at fiftysomething bored enough to make revisiting teenage lust a delight, and attractive enough to make it look possible. Carol Starks' Linda is her innocent counterpart who learns fast. Cissy Collins' journalist sings 'Zip' with panache: Hart's lyric brilliantly gathers Dali, Lippmann, Saroyan and Toscanini into one song. And if Anthony Bowles' musical arrangement sometimes sounds thin, the show is driven on by Ben Ormerod's substantial lighting changes which keep the action moving. Financial difficulties have put The Old Vic under sentence of closure. If it continues to deliver high quality productions like Pal Joey, it deserves to remain open.</p>

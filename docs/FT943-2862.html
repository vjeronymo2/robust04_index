			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Strong first half for Indosuez Banque Indosuez, the French investment bank and subsidiary of the Suez holding company, yesterday announced net profits of FFr412m (Dollars 76.86m) for the first six months of this year, a 24 per cent increase over half of its total net profits for last year, when interim results were not announced. Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Indosuez and Suez, described the interim results as good given that Indosuez, like other French banks, had 'not had an easy year in the markets, particularly in the bond markets'. Indosuez had net banking income of FFr6.42bn in the first six months of 1994 against FFr6.59bn, which represents half its 1993 net banking income. Gross operating profits were FFr1.89bn in the interim period, compared with FFr2.19bn for half of 1993. The bank had a tough time in 1993 when it was forced to make heavy provisions on its exposure to the weak French property market and on corporate loans, following a steep increase in business failures. These problems have eased and the level of provisions is expected to fall this year. It was set at FFr632m for the first half, against FFr1.31bn for half of 1993. However, Indosuez - which, like many French banks, benefited from windfall trading profits during last year's European currency crises - did not fare so well in its market trading activities during the first half. Income from trading in equity, interest rate and currency markets was down in the interim period. Conversely, the bank fared well in its US capital market activities and in Asian investment banking. Indosuez yesterday said it planned to extend its presence in China after receiving permission to open a branch in Guangzhou. It has a branch in Shanghai and offices in Beijing and Shenzhen. The Guangzhou opening forms part of the general expansion of the Suez group's Asian interests following the recent sale of a large part of Victoire, the French insurance company, to Commercial Union of the UK.</p>

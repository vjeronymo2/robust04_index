			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OVERTIME IS LAKER LOSING TIME;  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL: THEY BLOW A SIX-POINT LEAD IN EXTRA PERIOD TO FALL TO TRAIL  BLAZERS, 125-123.  </P> <P> If you want to know what the Lakers have left, it was enough to grab a  six-point lead in overtime over the Western Conference champion Portland Trail  Blazers.  </P> <P> But if you want to know what the Blazers have left, it was enough to score  eight points in the last 1:39 of the extra period to rally for a 125-123  victory over the Lakers, ruining their home opener Tuesday night before a  non-sellout 16,361 in the Forum.  </P> <P> Magic Johnson had 22 assists and Vlade Divac had 21 points and 13 rebounds, but  those are just statistics now. The Lakers are 0-2, their first such start since  the 1984-85 season.  </P> <P> For Divac, it represented by far his finest recent performance. Divac received  his all-rookie award before the game, and after the preseason he has had, he  may be eligible for comeback player of the year, too.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Johnson said he still has some things to work on.  </P> <P> "We just blew the game ourselves," Johnson said. "We beat ourselves. Even in  regulation, we had control but we were fouling (Portland shot 19 free throws in  the fourth quarter, making 15) or doing something we shouldn't.  </P> <P> "He (Divac) did a good job offensively. Now we have to get him to where he  doesn't reach and foul. If we can keep him from fouling out, we're going to be  a good team."  </P> <P> Trail Blazer guard Terry Porter scored his team's last six points, including  the game-winning field goal with 11 seconds remaining. He went right-to-left  across the floor with A.C. Green pursuing him. Inside the top of the circle,  Porter pulled up, took the ball between his legs and made an 18-foot jumper.  </P> <P> The Lakers set up for a last shot. Terry Teagle wound up taking it from  three-point range at the buzzer but hit the side of the rim.  </P> <P> Thus was extinguished a night-long Laker rally of their own. They trailed by  eight points late in the second period but fought back through the second half,  finally tying it with 6.8 seconds left when Johnson found Divac under the hoop  for a layup.  </P> <P> Divac then appeared to take over the overtime, scoring the Lakers' first four  points on a pair of 20-footers and getting their first four rebounds. A moment  later, James Worthy laid in a pretty Johnson lob and the Lakers led, 123-117.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the Lakers, they didn't score again.  </P> <P> With 2:08 left, Divac committed his sixth foul and departed.  </P> <P> And before you knew it, here came the Blazers. Clyde Drexler, who took -- and  made -- back-to-back three-pointers in the first half when he had just missed  five of his first six shots, rained in another three-pointer. Suddenly it  wasn't a matter of whether the Trail Blazers would get blanked in the overtime,  but a game again, with the Lakers up, 123-120.  </P> <P> At the Laker end, Johnson was called for charging.  </P> <P> At the Blazer end, Porter scored on a layup.  </P> <P> At the Laker end, Mychal Thompson was called for moving on a screen.  </P> <P> At the Blazer end, Porter was fouled on a drive and made his first free throw,  tying it 123-123. He missed the second but Thompson couldn't control the  rebound, which went out of bounds.  </P> <P> The Blazers then ran a play in which Porter came off a screen and hit the  game-winner.  </P> <P> When the Lakers ran their last play, it was a two-man game, Johnson coming off  a center's pick, but with the No. 1 center on the bench, watching.  </P> <P> "We have some plays like that, but they're geared to him (Divac)," Johnson  said. "If they double on me, he had that shot."  </P> <P> This time the Blazers doubled, the Lakers swung the ball outside and Teagle  fired to beat the block. Some seasons, it starts out that way.  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Play of the night: Clyde Drexler's amazing reverse layup on which he went under  and far past the board and tomahawked the ball backward. It even compares to  Julius Erving's oft-replayed reverse layup against the Lakers in the '80  finals. . . . Mike Dunleavy, on the loss: "As much as you want it to happen  right away, sometimes it just takes some time."  </P> <P> Two Blazer forwards were forced out of the game. Jerome Kersey cartwheeled  through the air, fell on his nect and left the game in the first period. He has  a cervical sprain and will be re-examined in Portland. Later, Cliff Robinson  sprained an ankle. . . . The Blazers had a terrific night shooting  three-pointers, making nine of 15. Danny Ainge was four for five and Drexler  three for four. . . . Next: Lakers host Sacramento Friday night.  </P></p>

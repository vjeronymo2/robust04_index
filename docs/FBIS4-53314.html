			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- A Japanese Government panel  on Tuesday [17 May] proposed a set of rules for invoking a  discriminatory curb on textile imports under the Multifiber  Agreement (MFA).    It is "desirable" to take necessary measures to remove the  negative effects of rapid textile imports on Japan's textile  industry under the internationally accepted accord, said the  Textile Industry Council, an advisory body to the trade minister.    The move would give the struggling textile industry time to  structurally regroup in an effort to realize profits, the  council said.    But possible negative effects from the step, including  inconvenience to Japanese textile consumers and slack innovative  efforts in the industry, should also be considered, it said.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will work  out a guideline for invoking the MFA measure by fall, based on  the council's recommendation, a ministry official said.    The recommendation does not mean Japan will begin stepping  up  safeguard measures on textile imports, in a departure from a  restraint policy on the issue, the official said.    The guideline is designed to enhance "the transparency" of  the MFA procedure, which has been "very ambiguous," the official  said.    The MFA, which was introduced in 1974 and has been  repeatedly  extended, is intended to protect Japan and Western industrial  countries, major textile importers, from possible damage to  their domestic textile industries due to massive textile exports  by China and other developing countries.    The safeguard rule proposed by the MITI council calls for  Japan to activate the step after "technically" evaluating the  seriousness of the impact of foreign products on the domestic  industry.    Specifically, the council recommended using the ratio of  import penetration, or imports divided by an aggregate of  production and net imports, as well as import growth.    As a way to gauge the severity of damage, it proposed  comprehensive assessment of such domestic factors collected in  the past three years, as employment, output drop, wage levels,  product prices, sales, investment, inventory levels and  profitability.    A cause and effect relation should be also proved between  import growth and actual damage or the risk of damage, the  council said.    The council cited prevention of a sudden increase in  unemployment as a positive effect of the textile safeguard, as  well as supporting the domestic industry's restructuring efforts.    As minus effects, the council pointed out slow correction of  a textiles price gap between the domestic market and abroad.    With invocation of protectionist measures like the MFA,  Japan  may draw global criticism at a time when the step is doomed to  be phased out under the recently concluded Uruguay round of  multilateral trade accords, the council said.    The Uruguay Round trade framework calls for total abolition  of the textile safeguard in 2005.    The council said the safeguard, when invoked, should include  a measure to ensure a certain level of imports -- no smaller  than imports in the previous year during the first year of the  safeguard's application and with a minimum 6 percent growth in  the second year and after.    The import floor is designed to minimize negative effects on  Japanese textile consumers, the council said.    Invocation of the textile safeguard should not last longer  than three years, it said.    Moreover, it should be phased out by 2005 under the Uruguay  Round accord, the council said.    The MITI official said the ministry will select textile  items  subject to the safeguard measure in the blueprint, noting that a  blanket application is not desirable.    Both the United States and Europe have resorted to the MFA  scheme frequently over the past 20 years as an effective way of  protecting their domestic industries.    About 80 percent of textile imports in the U.S. are covered  by the mfa and about 50 percent in the European union.    China has been the largest textle exporter to Japan, with  Japan's purchases from that country accounting for nearly 50  percent of the total imports.    The MITI official said the ministry will send a ranking  official to China later this month to explain the recommended  rules for invoking the MFA.    The Chinese Government is moving to introduce a voluntary  curb on textile exports to Japan in order to prevent Tokyo from  invoking the MFA.    The MITI source said last week Beijing recently sent MITI a  letter stating it will adopt the voluntary cap.</p>

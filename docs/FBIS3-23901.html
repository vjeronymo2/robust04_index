			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Statsenko: "Did Counterintelligence Save </F> Sobchak?"]    [Text] At yesterday's briefing by the St. Petersburg  Administration of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS],  which covered the results of last year's operations by the  special service, journalists learned new details about the  recent arrest of five terrorists near Our Lady of Kazan  Cathedral (see NEVSKOYE VREMYA 3 February).    According to Aleksandr Kuznetsov, head of the FCS  administration's antiterrorist unit, the arrested persons, some  of whom had participated in the defense of the White House in  Moscow in October 1993, were making preparations for an armed  attack on one of the Petersburg militia precincts to seize  armaments. Afterwards, they intended to assassinate Mayor  Anatoliy Sobchak, and to organize a raid on the House of  Government in Moscow. Among those detained is Aleksandr Bogdanov  of Petersburg rallies fame. The investigation continues.    There are more than 30 organized criminal groups currently  operating in the city on the Neva River who use the entire  spectrum of intimidation methods: blackmail, threats, violence.  The city is being divided into spheres of influence; there have  been recorded attempts on the part of the criminal capital to  acquire blocks of stock of a number of commercial banks and  objects undergoing privatization. Administration personnel have  identified and foiled activities of five criminal groups  attempting to steal about 4 billion rubles [R] from city banks  using forged documents.    They also foiled the illegal sale of almost 5,000 units of  firearms, and derailed the sale to a commercial structure of  5,000 smooth-bore rifles and 200 handguns. As was noted at the  briefing, more than 1.5 million units of unregistered rifled  firearms are currently in the hands of the Russian population.  Also, while in the past such firearms had been mostly home-made,  now the situation has changed--they are mainly factory-made  arms, Western-made as a rule. The "leader" is the TT handgun  made in China.    Eighty-five bombs went off in the city in 1993, killing  eight  persons and injuring 29.    "I will not be surprised if, having finished dividing  property between criminal groups, the same groups start dividing  political power," Aleksandr Kuznetsov said at the briefing.    Another problem for law enforcement organs is smuggling.  Last  year as a result of Operation Trawl, the guardians of security  returned to the state more than 2,500 tonnes of nonferrous  metals, 6,000 tonnes of petroleum products, about 22,000 cubic  meters of timber, and other goods worth a total of R5 billion.  Unfortunately, this work is not effective enough because of the  poor material and technical support of customs and border  services on the border with Estonia. There is a widespread  practice of bribing customs officials. Criminals use all sorts  of transportation, including military transport aircraft.  Contraband cargo is escorted by armed guards, who frequently  consist of military servicemen and militia personnel, who more  than once resisted representatives of authority and law  enforcement organs.    In conclusion the head of the FCS administration, Viktor  Cherkesov, reported that recertification of personnel is  expected to be completed before the end of March. Because the  investigative department in the service has been abolished, the  administration is switching to a new staff structure, while  criminal cases currently under investigation have been  transferred to the Procuracy.    "There is no question that after the Ministry of Security  was  abolished, the ranks of the Petersburg administration got  thinner. But our agency is not going to turn into a relic--we  will continue working," said Viktor Cherkesov.</p>

This information was released by KDS Chairman Ivan  Pilip and LSNS Chairman Pavel Hirs after their meeting.    According to Pilip, their talks focussed on the issue of the  territorial-administrative arrangement, restitution, the  approach to returning emigres' property, the election laws, and  educational and housing matters. He said that the two parties'  opinions on the issues discussed are very close in the basic  principles. The only exception is the parties' differing views  on the elections to the Senate. The KDS prefers 27 electoral  districts, while the LSNS prefers 81, added Pilip. According to  the LSNS chairman, yesterday's meeting, the first to be held at  the party-leadership level, took place out of a mutual need to  get together. "No one initiated it," said LSNS Chairman Pavel  Hirs. He added that some things have to be coordinated in  parliament, while others have to be clarified and "discussed in  advance" in cooperation with experts. "We want to set an example  to the other parties and show them that it is possible to  cooperate and reach a sensible agreement on apparently  conflicting issues on which opinions differ and that this can be  done without having to shift from one's own position," said LSNS  Chairman Pavel Hirs in conclusion.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Observer: Post haste The disappointed folks who failed to get their expected invitations to the Clinton-Gore Inauguration last January may still strike lucky, albeit a year late. For They may be among the unfortunates whose mail has turned up in a warehouse in Blytheville, Arkansas. A container holding 40,000 pieces of mail and Christmas 1992 gifts has just been unearthed at the back of the warehouse. Many of the invitations were to be sent to addresses in Arkansas and Tennessee, the home states of President Clinton and Vice-president Gore. The mail will now be delivered 'as soon as possible'; with luck in time to stop them voting Republican next time round.</p>

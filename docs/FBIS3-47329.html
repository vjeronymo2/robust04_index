			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, cabinet  members, and other high-ranking U.S. Government officials have  recently spoken out against depreciating the yen and  appreciating the dollar. Commenting on their remarks at a news  conference on 10 January, Gaishi Hiraiwa, president of Keidanren  [Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan], said: "While a  strong yen will delay Japan's economic recovery, a weak yen will  end the current asset deflation and strong yen-caused deflation.  I believe the weak yen is in the interests of the United  States." In this way, he implicitly attacked the U.S.  Government. Asserting: "It is undesirable that exchange rates  fluctuate because of the remarks of specific individuals,"  President Hiraiwa said definitely: "Given the U.S. economic  recovery, the yen can be depreciated a little more."    Touching on stimulus measures at the news conference,  Hiraiwa  stressed: "It is necessary to cut more than 5 trillion yen in  income taxes prior to raising the consumption tax and to issue  national bonds to make up for the fiscal shortfall resulting  from the income tax reduction." As for handling the consumption  tax, he said: "The idea is surfacing that if the income tax and  consumption tax are cut and raised simultaneously, it will serve  to stimulate the economy by increasing demand; this idea is  reasonable." Thus, Hiraiwa expressed his understanding of the  tax cut and tax increase package the Finance Ministry has  broached. As for the lead time of the income tax reduction  prior to the consumption tax hike, President Hiraiwa said: "I  cannot say lightly whether 15 months (under study by the  government) is desirable or not."    Referring to the argument for lowering the official discount  rate, President Hiraiwa indicated his opposition to lowering the  rate, saying: "Many people are pointing increasingly to its  adverse impact on the economy."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 29, 1994 EPA proposed two drinking water regulations: the Disinfectant/Disinfection Byproducts (D/DBP) and Enhanced Surface Water Treatment (ESWTR) rules. These proposals were the product of a negotiated rulemaking. The negotiators included State and local health and regulatory agency staff and elected officials, consumer groups, environmental groups, and representatives of public water systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The group agreed to propose a disinfectant/disinfection byproduct rule to extend coverage to all community and non transient, non-community water systems that use disinfectants, reduce the current total trihalomethane (TTHM) maximum contaminant level (MCL), regulate additional disinfection byproducts, set limits for the use of disinfectants, and reduce the level of compounds that may react with disinfectants to form byproducts. The group further agreed that revisions to the current Surface Water Treatment Rule might be required at the same time to ensure that microbial risk is not increased as byproduct rules go into effect, and to provide explicit control of Cryptosporidium. As a result, the Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule was proposed with a number of options for microbial control, including the option to simply retain the requirements of the current Surface Water Treatment Rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the hearings is to provide the public an opportunity to hear a description of the regulations and to obtain comment from the public on the rules. This notice corrects the hearing dates which were listed in the July 29, 1994 proposals. The comment period for submission of formal written comments in response to the D/DBPR rule closes December 29, 1994. The comment period for formal written comments in response to the ESWTR rule closes May 30, 1996 to allow time for the public to consider data being collected prior to that date. The Agency may hold additional hearings on the ESWTR to consider those additional data.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 3, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert Perciasepe,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25218 Filed 10&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

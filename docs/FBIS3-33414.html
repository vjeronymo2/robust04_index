According to the poll, which was prepared by  the Mexican consulting firm Moti, four basic questions were  posed to people throughout the Mexican Republic. The poll was  conducted in the Federal District, Monterrey, Guadalajara,  Tijuana, and Merida    The questions included:    1. Who do you prefer most, Manuel Camacho Solis or Luis  Donaldo Colosio?    2. What is your opinion with respect to Zapatist National  Liberation Army leader Subcommander Marcos?    3. Which of the presidential candidates do you expect to  vote  for on 21 August 1994?    4. Do you believe the people's vote will be respected in the  upcoming elections?    This random-sample poll was conducted on 11 February, and,  according to the fax sent by Federico Reyes Heroles, the  interviews were conducted in person and publicly. The poll was  sponsored by the monthly magazine ESTE PAIS, and it included  interviews with 320 people. The margin of error is  approximately 6 percent with a 90 percent statistical  reliability.    Let us take a look at what the public had to say with  respect  to the four questions I already mentioned.    First, who do you like the most, Camacho or Colosio? In  addition to this question, the respondents were also asked to  which political party they belonged or sympathized most. Nearly  43 percent of those who selected Luis Donaldo Colosio replied  that they were members or supporters of the Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI], while 23 percent indicated that they  liked Camacho as well as Colosio. In addition, 18 percent  pointed out that they preferred Manuel Camacho Solis,  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. Meanwhile,  11 percent of those who said they were PRI members or supported  the party stated they did not like either man.    Of the 320 people polled, there were also those who said  they  were either supporters or members of the National Action Party  [PAN]. Here, we begin to observe drastic changes in preferences  toward Camacho and Colosio. Of the PAN members interviewed, 18  percent expressed more inclination toward Manuel Camacho Solis,  while 16 percent stated their preference for Luis Donaldo  Colosio. At the same time, 34 percent of the PAN members  interviewed expressed equal support for both men, while 32  percent said they did not support either.    Finally, 17 percent of the PRI members and supporters polled  said they preferred Camacho, 11 percent said they preferred  Colosio, 23 percent said they liked both men equally, and 43  percent indicated they did not like either.    The poll also included some citizens who did not identify  themselves with any political party. Of this group, 16 percent  said they preferred Luis Donaldo Colosio, 12 percent selected  Manuel Camacho Solis, 34 percent said they liked both men  equally, and 30 percent said the did not approve of either.    While it is quite interesting to note how the Mexican people  feel with respect to Manuel Camacho Solis and Luis Donaldo  Colosio, according to this poll released by ESTE PAIS magazine,  there are still three more questions to consider.    The people polled were also asked their opinion of  Subcommander Marcos. Overall, 30 percent of those interviewed  said they held a poor opinion of Subcommander Marcos, 27 percent  said they did not have a good or bad opinion, 24 percent said  they had a favorable opinion, and 19 percent said they did not  know.    With respect to the third question of how each person polled  would vote on 21 August, 35 percent said they did not yet know  or did not want to say, 33 percent said they planned to vote for  Luis Donaldo Colosio, 17 percent said they planned to vote for  PAN Candidate Diego Fernandez de Zevallos, and 14 percent said  they intended to vote for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate for the  Party of the Democratic Revolution.    What is really interesting in all of this is that, if we  compare this poll with earlier polls, we observe several things:  First, Luis Donaldo Colosio's popularity has increased from 28  percent to 33 percent. Second, PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de  Zevallo's popularity has increased dramatically from 11 percent  to 17 percent. Meanwhile, Cuauthemoc Cardenas' popularity has  fallen noticeably from 11 percent to 14 percent. I repeat, all  of this is in relation to an earlier poll conducted on 11  February.    In conclusion, let us examine the results of the final  question as to whether or not the election results will be  respected. What do you think the people answered? Of those  polled, 43 percent indicated that they did not believe the  election results would be respected, 34 percent said they  believed the results would indeed be respected, 17 percent did  not answer, and 8 percent said they did not know. Interesting,  huh?</p>

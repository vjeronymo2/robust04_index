			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / UK government should resume Britain's membership of Unesco Sir, Why is the UK not a member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco)? Having withdrawn from the agency in 1985, citing concern about management and aspects of programme activity, the UK government can no longer justify Britain's continued absence. Unesco has greatly reformed in the last seven years and progress has been made on every point of dissatisfaction put forward at the time of withdrawal. The Foreign Office has repeatedly stated its commitment to the ideals and principles embodied in Unesco's constitution and in a recent adjournment debate, foreign office minister Douglas Hogg acknowledged the reforms, declaring that the government now has 'a genuinely open mind' on the issue. Yet still there is no move to return. Such recalcitrance may be due to the expected Pounds 7m cost of resumed membership. However, in 1984, UK-related receipts from lucrative contracts and consultancies from Unesco exceeded the UK's direct budgetary contribution. Future membership costs would certainly be offset by indirect income. The UK was a founder member of Unesco; the first director-general, Sir Julian Huxley, was British and the constitution is lodged at the British Foreign Office. Our continued absence from the international exchange fostered by Unesco restricts and isolates the UK and does incalculable damage to our reputation abroad. Foreign Office observers will attend the current session of the executive board - Unesco's ruling body - which ends on October 31. We urge the government to resume membership after this.

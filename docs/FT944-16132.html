			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Goodyear sees earnings up in third term Goodyear, the US tyre maker, said it would report third-quarter earnings of between 97 cents and Dollars 1 a share, a range which puts it in line with most market forecasts. Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, gave the projection in a speech to a meeting of securities analysts. Sales to the end of September were more than 6 per cent up on the Dollars 2.9bn of the 1993 period, he said. The improvement in earnings per share, from 92 cents a year earlier, comes against the background of rising rubber prices which had threatened to put pressure on margins. Separately, Goodyear said it would acquire a 60 per cent interest in a manufacturing joint venture with Qingdao Gold Lion Hose, the largest producer of automotive hose in China. The total investment for the joint venture is valued at Dollars 20m, of which 60 per cent will come from Goodyear.</p>

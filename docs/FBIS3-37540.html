Not a single of the four agreements  under discussion has been signed at the Latvian-Russian talks  which ended in Jurmala today. The next round of talks is  scheduled for February 28.    Commenting on the results of the talks, Martins Virsis, head  of the Latvian delegation, said that the two sides did not agree  in views on three issues: The size of rent for the radio  location station in Skrunda, the number of its personnel and the  status of military pensioners.    Head of the Russian delegation Sergey Zotov noted that he  was  satisfied with the assurances given by Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs today that Latvia does not intend to restrict rights of  military pensioners.    According to Russian Ambassador to Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh  "the difficulties which arose at the talks, account for the  complex internal political situation in Latvia. Failure to sign  the treaty is disadvantageous for both sides, but much more for  Latvia as it would be better if the radar worked within the  framework of an agreement but not without it".</p>

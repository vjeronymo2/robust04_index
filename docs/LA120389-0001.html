			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOPING WITH YOUR WHOLE BODY;  </P> <P> HEAD FIRST: THE BIOLOGY OF HOPE BY NORMAN COUSINS (E. P. DUTTON: $18.95; 304  PP.; 0-525-24805-6)  </P> <P> About 10 years ago, after a distinguished career as a magazine editor and  leader of liberal causes, Norman Cousins began a new career -- also, I think,  distinguished and courageous to boot -- as a medical kibitzer. Unlike some  critics of medicine, he has immersed himself in it, and in illness -- dues  rarely paid by such pundits. He has been teaching and seeing patients at the  UCLA Medical Center as well as lecturing and consulting on medical topics  throughout the world. It seems to me that he is practicing medicine without a  license, but that is not necessarily bad, since he more or less knows his  limitations, and dispenses advice under the supervision of real doctors.  </P> <P> This is his third book about illness and medicine, and it continues his  eloquent plea for two needed emphases: more humane doctor-patient relations,  and greater patient involvement in the struggle with disease. Unfortunately, it  also repeats his exaggerated faith in the power of hope to overcome illness.  Because so many of us profoundly need to believe in it, this weakest aspect of  his work receives the lion's share of attention. A current ad for the book,  under the heading "Inspirational Reading," offers "Proof That Hope Can Make You  Healthy." The book itself ends: "Belief becomes biology. The head comes first."  </P> <P> These words have two meanings. One, indisputable and accepted by all doctors,  is that to survive illness you must decide to live. You must eat and drink --  often in a particular way -- avoid certain substances, dress your wounds, take  your pills and other treatments, even, sometimes, go to the doctor. People die  from lack of hope every day -- through failure to take these pragmatic  expedients.  </P> <P> The other meaning -- that hope exerts a direct influence on the body's chemical  milieu and thus has a privileged power to stave off illness -- is hotly  disputed. That is not because it is guaranteed to be wrong, but because there  is not yet enough evidence -- actually, not nearly enough -- to constrain us to  believe in it. And in medicine, we tend not to believe things for which the  evidence is insufficient, especially when they are notions that sorely tempt  our belief. If this approach seems to you cranky and obstinate, try thinking of  it as the main reason why you feel more confident than your  great-great-grandmother did of the doctor's ability to improve your chances.  </P> <P> Cousins' first book, "Anatomy of an Illness," recounted the touchstone  experience for his contribution to medicine. As he told it, he was suffering  from a particularly rare collagen disease that was worsening relentlessly and  threatening his life. With his doctor's reluctant collusion, he discharged  himself from the hospital and, at a nearby hotel, treated himself with funny  movies, vitamin C and large doses of hope. He also stopped taking his medicine.  Full recovery ensued, and he went on to tell his story to the medical community  and the world. Both were responsive, and he entered a long-term relationship  with one of our great medical centers, a position from which he influences a  great many doctors, medical students, and patients.  </P> <P> Now, as Cousins must know, the illness he was supposed to have was and is very  difficult to diagnose definitively. It is easily confused, by the best doctors,  with other less degenerative conditions, and indeed some specialists would rule  out this particular diagnosis just because he recovered. A cynic would say that  Cousins merely proved the old medical adage that most patients have ailments  that the doctor never identifies and that are resolved with or without  treatment. He also knows that if the average patient with a really serious  illness were to check out of the hospital, stop taking prescribed medicine and  follow a regimen of vitamins and Marx Brothers, the overall result would be a  marked increase in pain and death.  </P> <P> Despite his own experience, in this book he explicitly rejects the substitution  of hope, humor, defiance and other emotions for medical and surgical  treatments, and he states: "Yes, I know that my optimism can be carried too  far. . . ." I hope that these warnings are heard loudly and clearly. Everyone  in medicine has seen some patients jeopardize their lives by substituting  unorthodox treatments for proven ones. Cousins doesn't dwell on their stories,  but they are at least as numerous and tragic as those of the mainstream medical  blunders he presents in abundance.  </P> <P> In a more subtle vein, the complex and varied suffering of people with serious  illnesses is not always and everywhere mitigated by emphasizing the possible  role of mental states in illness. I once wrote an article in a national  publication warning against the overemphasis of such factors, and many of the  letters I got were from patients or family members who had been made to feel  that they mentally caused or failed to resist their own or their loved ones'  illnesses. Reading my article helped relieve them of a burden of guilt.  </P> <P> The evidence, in fact, is complex and puzzling. One of the most solid sections  of the book is Cousins' report to the dean of the medical school summarizing  his 10 years of experience there. Another is a joint statement signed by him  and a physician-scientist who had criticized him. In these places, Cousins is  more circumspect than in the rest of his text, noting that the evidence, in  both human and animal studies, remains suggestive, and is often inconsistent,  contradictory and bewildering.  </P> <P> Some studies show that stress, for example, enhances the body's immune  defenses, others that it depresses them. Several studies suggest that what  might be considered a bad mental state -- intense and angry struggle --  improves survival in breast cancer, which seems quite different from Cousins'  emphasis on hope and laughter.  </P> <P> A new and very good study, published after Cousins' book had gone to press, has  shown a positive effect of psychotherapy on survival in advanced breast cancer  -- fascinating but paradoxical, given the previous results. The frontier of  knowledge is moving, but it is not clear where, and there is no specific  recommendation to be drawn from the evidence presently available.  </P> <P> Cousins is aware of these inconsistencies, but he allows his main line of  argument to gloss over them. In this, he succumbs to a temptation that  physicians often are faced with: to avoid at all cost taking away the patient's  hope. Yet, increasingly -- partly because of the good offices of the legal, not  the medical, profession -- we believe in truth-telling. Physicians in Japan  still lie to patients about cancer, but we consider that unscionable in most  circumstances. Yet we try to avoid clobbering patients with depressing  information that may not help them. Even as I write, I worry that I may be  spreading despondency in the service of scientific precision. This is not a new  conflict, nor is it one that physicians should be asked to resolve by  themselves.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Cousins' other message -- that poor doctor-patient communication and  insensitivity to the psychosocial dimensions of illness have become endemic in  modern medicine -- is very apt. Even if there is not a shred of truth (an  unlikely conclusion anyway) in the notion that mind directly affects immune  function, there is no doubt that lives are lost and suffering increased through  this little-studied category of medical error. Inhumane treatment can be  useless, or even worse than no treatment at all. When doctors get sick these  days, they frequently come to the same conclusion that other patients come to:  Modern physicians need to become much better at the human dimensions of care.  </P> <P> The title -- "Head First" -- is therefore a half-truth; a better one might have  been "Head Too." Cousins has learned much from his decade of medical immersion.  He influences many people, so I hope that he will become ever more careful in  generalizing, and more appropriately patient as we await new research findings.  </P> <P> He has a lot to contribute, but there is nothing like clinical experience to  make you realize how complex and difficult the battle against illness is -- and  how capriciously it defies our pieties, including these new ones about hope.  </P></p>

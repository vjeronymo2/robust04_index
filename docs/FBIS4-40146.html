			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Baltic Council of Ministers which was set up  today should provide a firm basis for Baltic cooperation. Anne  Osvet reports.    [Osvet] During the Baltic prime ministers' meeting in  Tallinn  today the foundations were laid, among other things, for yet  another cooperation body. I asked for more clarification from  Alar Olljum, deputy chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Ministry.    [Begin Olljum recording] As of today, the Baltic Council of  Ministers has been set up. [passage omitted] The agreement  which was signed today by the prime ministers of the Baltic  states is to regulate cooperation between the newly formed  Baltic Council of Ministers and the Baltic Assembly. This has  been a firm desire, with Baltic parliamentary deputies, who were  (?promoting) it already last fall when a scheduled Baltic  Assembly meeting took place here in Tallinn. It was again  repeated in Jurmala in Latvia [words indistinct]. The prime  ministers are to decide the directions for the actual  cooperation but I think that (?it will be what was discussed  before), with economic cooperation and cooperation on security  matters forming the most important (?spheres). Added to this  will be energy problems, border issues [words indistinct]; we  will, for example, begin talks with Latvia on the sea border.  [end recording]</p>

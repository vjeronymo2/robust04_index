			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of interview with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf </F> Denktas by unidentified correspondents in Nicosia on 2  June--recorded]    [Correspondent] Mr. President, can you comment on the  Turkish Cypriot side's position?    [Denktas] We are prepared to continue the talks if the 21  March document is changed in accordance with the points we  agreed upon in Vienna. We have already mentioned that and we  reiterate our position. In fact, that was Ambassador Richard  Boucher's question today. We gave him a positive reply.    [Correspondent] Has he asked whether our position is still  valid? Why has he asked that question? Will there be a new  development? Do the U.S. officials plan to make a new  initiative?    [Denktas] He wished to be informed on our position. I do not  know why. Nor do I know whether or not he plans to undertake an  initiative.    [Correspondent] Has the UN secretary general's report not  killed your proposal on the talks?    [Denktas] That is what we have said. However, they have  interpreted the report in a different way. They have said that  one of the alternatives calls for the maintenance of the talks.  They have also asked whether we agree. Well, that is why we  have conveyed a written message to Mr. Gustave Feissel, the UN  secretary general's deputy special envoy. However, it has been  ignored. Furthermore, we have been threatened with sanctions.  All that has killed our document. However, the U.S. officials  are convinced that the door is open and they have asked whether  we still agree to hold that door open.    [Correspondent] Is the United States expected to undertake a  new initiative?    [Denktas] I do not know.    [Correspondent] Can you comment on the framework of your  contacts with Turkey?    [Denktas] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and the other  Turkish  leaders have supported us. They have issued statements on the  unacceptable report. We welcome that state of affairs.  Nevertheless, Turkey probably does not want us to close the  door. We are prepared to maintain the talks if the 21 March  document is changed in accordance with our request.    [Correspondent] Does a difference of opinion exist between  the UN secretary general and the United States on that matter?    [Denktas] It is because of the difference of approach  between  Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on  the Cyprus issue, and Gustave Feissel that talks were held in  Vienna. We removed that difference on at least two and a half of  the five disputed points [sentence as heard]. We asked that the  two and a half points be included in the 21 March document. We  stressed that we shall agree to the views on the map [on  Varosha] and the access road, views which we rejected until that  time, if the two and a half points are included in that  document. The difference of opinion is between Robert Lamb, who  represents the United States and tries to help us, and Gustave  Feissel, not between the United States and the UN Secretariat.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, can you comment on what will  happen at the present time? A state of uncertainty exists.    [Denktas] Do not worry. Continue your daily lives as you  have in the past. We exist as the Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus. We shall continue to stand on our feet and defend our  rights. We are ready to comply if they wish to hold talks with  us under equal conditions.</p>

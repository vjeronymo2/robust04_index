			<p>BFN     [Text] The Serbs launched attacks last night and this  morning from small arms and mortars on eastern defense lines of  the free Orasje zone [northern Serb corridor]. [Unidentified  correspondent] We have found out from the Orasje operational  zone command there were no casualties in this attack, but  considerable material damage was caused.    General Milivoj Petkovic, the Bosnian Croat Army commander,  is currently visiting the units on Orasje-Samac front.    [Begin Petkovic recording] Judging by what we have seen so  far the people have realized how serious the situation is, and  both the Army and the people are behaving accordingly. The  general opinion is that there is no danger to this area, judging  by what we have seen so far. [end recording]    [Correspondent] The most frequently used word in all reports  from Bosnian Posavina is the corridor. There is no need to  explain what it means to the Serbs. But another question arises  here.    [Begin Petkovic recording] What are we waiting for? This is  the question we are asked everywhere we go. The Army cannot  raise itself above politics. The Army has to follow political  decisions and it will behave accordingly. All units here, both  the Croatian Defense Council's and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's  2nd Corps--the Tuzla Corps--are in a state of full combat  readiness. I do not think the Serbs have any chance of widening  the corridor here. Whether we will try to cut it--you will be  told when the time comes. [end recording]</p>

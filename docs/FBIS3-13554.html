The Israeli military siege is being tightened on all  Arab citizens and is preventing the provision of food, medicine,  and basic needs for children and sick people. The Israeli Army  continues its acts of repression, torture, and indiscriminate  shooting. The injured people number in the scores everyday.  The images of the horrifying massacre in the holy al-Ibrahimi  Mosque, where worshipers were killed by Zionist settlers while  performing their prayers, are still fresh in the minds of the  sons of the occupied homeland and remind everyone that there can  be no security and comfort until the removal of the Israeli  nightmare of occupation. The peace aspired to by the hearts and  the souls is very farfetched because Israel, very simply, does  not want peace and its objective is to expand and build  settlements.    This is in terms of the occupied territories. As for  southern Lebanon, the barbaric Israeli bombardment has become a  daily practice. This practice intensified in recent days to  include as many villages and towns as possible and to cause as  much human and material losses as possible.    This is the Israel which falsely claims peace and works  against it. This is the Israel which those in the Western world  want to raise the banner of peace while they are tempting it  with billions of dollars, economic aid, and sophisticated  weapons of destruction, are racing to strike military deals with  it, and are providing it with nuclear technology. The results  are totally the opposite. Israel's arrogance and rejection of  peace is building up and its greed for expansion and settlement  building is increasing. Israel is using weapons the West is  placing in its hands to perpetrate massacres and crimes and to  foil the hopes for peace.    While the Security Council is supposed to rise up to its  international responsibilities and take the initiative to  protect the Palestinian and Lebanese people from Israel's daily  crimes, this highest international authority is drowning in the  labyrinths of endless deliberations. It is seeking a resolution  that satisfies Israel and does not hurt the feelings of its  rulers. As for the rulers of Israel, they continue to make  misleading statements. They claim peace and concern about the  Palestinians while it is known that one of their senior military  commanders revealed that the Israeli Army has strict orders not  to stand in the way of settlers even if they were shooting at  defenseless Arab citizens.    The Washington talks have entered their third year. Not a  single Israeli negotiator uttered the word "withdrawal." The  Arabs and Syria talked about a full, real, just, and  comprehensive peace. No one heard Israel say the word "full  withdrawal." Indeed, the Israelis' main concern in Washington  was to drown the talks in the labyrinth of their security  demands and turn the peace process into mere security  arrangements that would guarantee for Israel, in the name of  security, the continuation of its occupation, the continuation  of acts of repression and terrorism, keeping the settlements  and settlers, and the freedom of stockpiling all kinds of  weapons. This is at a time when Israeli shells are continuously  bombarding southern Lebanon, when Palestinians are being killed  while performing their prayers to God, and when any Syrian  citizen in the occupied Golan, who affirms his affiliation to  Syria and Arabism, is being repressed.    The peace process in Middle East so far has been receiving a  response from one side; that is, the Arab side. As for Israel,  it did not offer anything and continues to blackmail, evade,  prevaricate, and procrastinate. Moreover, it is clear that  Israel will not submit to the conditions of a just peace unless  the international community makes an effective and decisive move  to impose respect for UN principles and resolutions.    Tempting Israel with billions of dollars and arsenals of  weapons so far has only yielded opposite results. It added to  the arrogance of the rulers of Israel and to their disregard of  all human values. The massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque will  continue to be a nightmare that haunts those who encouraged  Israel, especially since it will not be the last massacre.  Other more horrifying massacres will inevitably be perpetrated  if the international community does not put an end to Zionist  belligerence by ending the occupation and restoring rights.</p>

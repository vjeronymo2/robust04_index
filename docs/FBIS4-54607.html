			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 2 (CTK) -- Slovak Prime Minister  Jozef Moravcik can see no reason to meet with his Czech  counterpart Vaclav Klaus at the moment, government spokesman  Lubomir Lintner told CTK today. He was reacting to a Friday [29  April] statement by Slovak Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus that  the two prime ministers should consider the abolition of the old  bloc on the Slovak-Czech clearing account before it was  discussed by the Slovak Government.    Lintner said that Moravcik was surprised by Filkus's  statement, but added that "the times are hectic and a need for a  meeting between the two premiers may arise as early as tomorrow."    Bratislava considers the abolition of the old bloc, which is  used by enterprises in speculative payments to the detriment of  Slovakia's balance of payments, the most urgent issue in  relations with Prague. Under the old bloc, the 1-1 ratio is  applied in payments related to trade agreements concluded before  the currency split on February 8, 1993. The new bloc uses ECUs.    The Czech Government approved a proposal to abolish the old  bloc as early as in mid-April, but the Slovak Government  recently returned a similar draft for rewriting and it has not  reappeared on the government's agenda to date.</p>

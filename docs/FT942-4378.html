			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / China stands firm against N Korean sanctions China yesterday again rejected efforts by South Korea to persuade it to support sanctions against the north because of Pyongyang's refusal to open its nuclear sites to inspection. At the same time Mr Kim Yong-nam, North Korea's foreign minister, threatened the south with devastation if war broke out between the two countries. 'They should remember that if they blindly follow the policies of the United States as to sanctions and finally start a war, then in the end South Korea will be devastated,' Mr Kim told Reuters at the end of a visit to Ukraine. 'We have the strength to protect ourselves from sanctions and it is unbelievably powerful. . . I would like to peacefully advise those who want to start a war in Korea,' he said. The foreign ministry in Pyongyang also said that Japan could expect reprisals if it joined in sanctions. Japan and South Korea are backing a plan by the US to ask the United Nations Security Council to approve phased sanctions to force North Korea to comply with international demands for access to its reactors and waste storage areas. But in Beijing, Mr Shen Guofang, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said 'sanctions would only serve to push the opposing sides into confrontation with one another and result in a situation no one would like to see'. The foreign ministry official was speaking just hours after Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korea's foreign minister, visited Beijing seeking Chinese co-operation. China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, has veto power over a sanctions resolution. Beijing is arguing more time is needed for dialogue, but recognises that time is running short. China has been sending mixed signals on the North Korean issue. At the weekend, a Beijing-funded Hong Kong newspaper raised the spectre of sanctions in a prominent article unlikely to have been published without official encouragement. However, in Beijing this week Chinese officials have been at pains to emphasise the importance of relations with Pyongyang. President Jiang Zemin told the visiting North Korean Chief of Army General Staff that strengthening Sino-Korean relations was China's 'firm policy'. Western officials say China is engaged in a delicate manoeuvre aimed at defusing the crisis over North Korea's apparent diversion of weapons-grade plutonium and preserving its relationship with its neighbour and Korean-war partner. Beijing fears sanctions would further isolate North Korea.</p>

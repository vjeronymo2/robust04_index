			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: PSIT rises to Pounds 12m as property values improve PSIT, the investment company formerly known as Property Security Investment Trust, yesterday announced that pre-tax profits for the year to March increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 12m, against Pounds 9.66m. The company's net asset value per share rose 18 per cent to 168p (142p), reflecting improving property values in the UK. Total investment rents rose by Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 20.8m, and the company benefited from lower interest rates and lower debt levels, a result of its reduced property development programme. Interest payable fell from Pounds 11.1m to Pounds 9m. Income from investment securities amounted to Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 2.14m) and the company raised Pounds 314,000 from the sale of investment securities, compared with Pounds 999,000 in 1993. Mr Albert Perry, chairman, said: 'We continue to look for properties or sites which can both produce income and offer the potential for future development, and we are currently in negotiations for further acquisitions.' PSIT's extension of its Australian shopping centre has been completed and is 98 per cent occupied. New highways are under construction on its Florida site. The company has also achieved further lettings on properties in Hampshire and Cheshire. A final dividend of 2.875p is proposed, making a total for the year of 4.625p (4.125p). Earnings per share were 7.03p (5.86p).</p>

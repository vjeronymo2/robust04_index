			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Finland considers vote date Finland could stage a referendum on EU membership on the same day as other Nordic countries on November 13, the prime minister, Mr Esko Aho, was quoted as saying yesterday. Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria reached preliminary agreements on EU membership terms this month, but the accords need to be approved by national referendums. According to Mr Aho it was not an 'excluded option' that the three Nordic EU applicants would stage their plebiscites on the same day. Opinion polls show that public support for membership is larger in Finland than in neighbouring Sweden and Norway.</p>

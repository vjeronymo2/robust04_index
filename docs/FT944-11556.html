			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Browning-Ferris extends Attwoods bid Browning-Ferris Industries, the US waste services company, yesterday extended its hostile Pounds 364m cash offer for Attwoods of the UK for 15 days. BFI has received acceptances for 30.61 per cent of Attwoods shares. This includes the 29.8 per cent which it has agreed to buy from Laidlaw of Canada. Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods' chief executive, said the level of acceptances excluding Laidlaw's stake showed that 'our shareholders do not come cheap.' Mr Foreman said Attwoods would demonstrate its value to shareholders. Attwoods is expected to publish its third defence document at the end of next week. This is likely to include first quarter results as well as indications on profits for the first half. Under the takeover code, the UK company cannot publish any new financial information after November 11. The extension of BFI's bid was widely expected, with many institutions holding out in hopes of a higher offer. BFI now has until November 18 to increase its bid.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Sugar unrepentant in Spurs stand-off THE BATTLE between the two key shareholders at Tottenham Hotspur hotted up over the weekend with details emerging of why Mr Alan Sugar, the chairman, wants to sack Mr Terry Venables, the chief executive. Mr Venables, who owns 22 per cent of the company, is fighting the attempt to dismiss him. On Friday, just hours after being sacked, he obtained a High Court injunction reinstating him as chief executive until a hearing on May 25. Reasons for the attempted dismissal, according to the Sugar camp, included Mr Venables' commercial activities at the club - which he was described as pursuing 'almost relentlessly', sometimes without reference to Mr Sugar. It also emerged that Mr Sugar, the electronics millionaire who owns 48 per cent of Tottenham, had offered to buy Mr Venables' stake at the price he paid for it. 'My offer was fair, even generous,' Mr Sugar said yesterday. Mr Venables, who has invested about Pounds 3m in the club, buying most of his shares at 75p, has described the offer as derisory. If he received only Pounds 3m, that would be less than the Pounds 3.2m market value of the stake at Friday's closing price of 89p and it would also mean a loss on his financing costs. He borrowed most of the Pounds 3m he invested.</p>

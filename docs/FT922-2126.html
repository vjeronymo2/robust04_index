			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / The Bush-Yeltsin Summit: US prisoner of war issue poses danger for Bush PRESIDENT George Bush is always proclaiming his optimism and his summit with President Yeltsin, especially its substantive agreement on nuclear arms cuts, offers justification for this point of view and for his reputation as an international statesman. In election-year politics, though, the glass he sees as half-full, potentially brimming, is elsewhere perceived as half-empty and draining. In this respect, Mr Yeltsin's declaration that Russia would help ascertain the fate of Americans missing in action, or held as prisoners of war, is a complicating factor. In his powerful speech to Congress yesterday, especially his off-the-cuff promise to spare no effort to find any PoWs, Mr Yeltsin did all he could to help Russia meet US concerns and to secure US financial assistance, which is what Mr Bush also wants. The Russian president, in an inspired coup de theatre, personally collared one prominent doubting senator, Mr John McCain, the Republican from Arizona and a former prisoner of war in Vietnam. Mr McCain was so impressed that he withdrew his threat to vote against Russian aid while all PoWs remained unaccounted for - but he reserved the right to vote thus for other reasons. The Russian summit has given Mr Bush a necessary lift after the unfortunate and ill-planned excursions to Panama and Rio de Janeiro last week, which did nothing for a faltering re-election campaign partly predicated on his competence in foreign affairs. This fact alone had already raised serious doubts about Congressional backing for the US contribution to the Dollars 24bn programme to assist Russia. Democrats have said bluntly that scant resources should first be spent at home, while Republicans such as Mr McCain and Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana had seized on the PoW issue as an additional cause to block assistance. Further complicating political matters is the position of Mr Ross Perot, the prospective independent presidential candidate who has made a crusade out of trying to find Americans missing in Indochina. He has cancelled planned testimony on the subject to Congress this month, but he is unlikely to stay silent for long - likewise Mr Bill Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate, who is to have breakfast with Mr Yeltsin today. Until the unexpected announcement on Tuesday afternoon of the deep cuts in nuclear arms, the Russian initiative on PoWs, trailed by Mr Yeltsin in several interviews, had dominated the summit. The offer was variously interpreted as a well-intended gesture and an inducement to Congress to approve assistance, as well as an attempt to enhance Mr Yeltsin's own image in the US. This leaves Mr Bush with the task of getting Congress to act once Mr Yeltsin has departed. Success would be good for his reputation, but failure, or a stalemate, would again be seen as evidence of poor domestic political leadership. THE UK defence secretary Malcolm Rifkind is to be questioned in Parliament about claims that British prisoners of war captured in Korea were sent to the former Soviet Union and may still be held in Russia, our Foreign Staff writes. Labour MP Tam Dalyell last night tabled Commons questions on the matter.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat refinancing Greycoat, the property company that agreed to a rescue refinancing last week, said yesterday it had received support for the proposal from one class of bondholders. The company said the co-ordinating committee of Britannic House bondholders, representing more than 75 per cent of the class, was broadly supportive of the restructuring proposals put forward by the UK Active Value Fund. Greycoat also needs the support of the preference and ordinary shareholders if it is to avoid risking being put into default on a second class of bonds  -the zero coupon bonds.</p>

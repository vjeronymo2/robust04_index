			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WIDOW, 92, TO KEEP SAVINGS IN CIVIL LIABILITY APPEAL  </P> <P> A 92-year-old widow initially held financially liable for a nephew's car  accident will be able to keep her life's savings under a settlement reached  today in a closely watched civil liability case.  </P> <P> "I did, I did win," Luella Wilson told reporters who swarmed to her home after  the announcement.  </P> <P> "Any man with common sense would know I didn't owe that money," she said,  sipping a celebratory shot of Southern Comfort.  </P> <P> Wilson was slapped with a $950,000 judgment after a car driven by her  great-nephew plunged off a bridge, leaving one of his passengers, Mark Vince,  unable to walk.  </P> <P> Wilson was home in bed the night of the April, 1984, crash but she was found  liable for Vince's injuries under a legal doctrine known as "negligent  entrustment."  </P> <P> Wilson had loaned her great-nephew, Willard Stuart Jr., the money to buy the  car. Vince's lawyers claimed that Wilson was liable because she knew or should  have known that Stuart did not have a driver's license and had a problem with  alcohol and drugs.  </P> <P> Wilson said that she had spent $98,000 in legal fees and that the award would  clean out the remainder of her savings. Although she amassed a bank account of  $600,000 during a long and colorful life, the legal problems left her partly  dependent on Meals on Wheels for food.  </P> <P> The Vermont Supreme Court ordered a retrial of the 1987 award. Opening  statements were heard today, and one witness had begun testimony in Bennington  Superior Court when the attorneys for Vince, Wilson and the dealership that  sold the car went behind closed doors. They emerged from chambers shortly after  with news of the settlement.  </P> <P> Terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but attorneys for both Wilson and  Ace Auto Sales Inc. said the elderly widow will be able to keep her money and  her property.  </P> <P> "Mrs. Wilson is going to get everything back, and why shouldn't she settle  under those terms?" said her attorney, Fred Harlow. "I'm ecstatic."  </P> <P> "It's over. She has won," said Michael Madden, Wilson's live-in caretaker.  </P> <P> Vince, who is paralyzed and whose left leg was amputated as a result of the  accident, declined to discuss the settlement.  </P> <P> "I've got to be like this for the rest of my life. I'll never be happy," he  said as he was helped from his wheelchair to a car.  </P> <P> "I can't explain anything about the settlement. There was an agreement. I just  want to get on with my life," said Vince, now 28. "I'm happy it's over with."  </P> <P> Stuart, now 24, is a laborer.  </P> <P> Wilson's plight drew national media attention and became the focus of a legal  debate over how far a civil plaintiff should be able to reach when looking for  the proverbial "deep pocket."  </P></p>

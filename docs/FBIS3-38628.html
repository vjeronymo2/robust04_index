We will not be drawn into endless and  worthless discussions, he said.    Speaking in London, Mikhailidhis also said that the UN's  next  move will be an effort by the special representative to  determine the basic issues related to the implementation of the  measures.    Mikhailidhis was responding to correspondents' questions  following his meeting yesterday with British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd. He added that the message from the United States,  the UN secretary general, and Britain is that interest in the  success of the confidence-building measures and establishment of  a positive climate for talks on an overall solution to the  Cyprus issue has increased.</p>

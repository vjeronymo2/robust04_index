			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Honeywell doubles income after settling patent dispute HONEYWELL, the US controls group, yesterday reported third quarter net income nearly doubled, but the increase was due to special gains from the settlement of a legal dispute. The company made Dollars 170.5m, or Dollars 2.46 a share, compared with Dollars 79.1m, or Dollars 1.13, in the same quarter of last year. The latest figures included a Dollars 91.6m, or Dollars 1.32-a-share, after-tax gain from the settlement of a long-running patent dispute with camera manufacturers over Honeywell's invention of an automatic focusing device. They also included a Dollars 5.5m extraordinary loss from early redemption of long-term debt. Operating profits declined from Dollars 178m to Dollars 169.1m on sales which rose 4 per cent to Dollars 1.55bn from Dollars 1.49bn. The company's home and building controls division produced operating profits of Dollars 58.2m, down from Dollars 62.9m. It said this was due primarily to accelerated investment in new building automation products and the start of a process to streamline the North American field organisation. Sales rose 9.8 per cent to Dollars 601.8m. The industrial segment produced profits of Dollars 48.4m, down from Dollars 53.1m, on sales 10.7 per cent higher at Dollars 432.2m. Margins were down on the same period of last year as customers deferred purchases of industrial process systems. For the nine months, Honeywell reported income of Dollars 372.4m, against Dollars 228.5m last year, helped by Dollars 164m of after-tax patent gains, partly offset by the Dollars 5.5m extraordinary loss and Dollars 19.3m of after-tax cost-cutting provisions. Amdahl the US computer-maker, is to cut its workforce by 9 per cent, or some 900 people, next month, writes Louise Kehoe. It said the cuts were 'in response to a recent decline in demand for the company's mainframe computers'.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / People: Hutchinson quits Nationwide The sudden departure of John Hutchinson as corporate strategy director at Nationwide Building Society is a fresh reminder of the shaky state of affairs at the country's second largest building society. Hutchinson, a widely admired retail banking specialist, joined Nationwide from Lloyds Bank three years ago. 'Have they got the right man?' murmurred some building society chiefs gathered at a conference in London yesterday when the news leaked out. The whisper in the industry is that Hutchinson was found to be too aggressive by the other men at the top of Nationwide. 'John's departure is a clash between building society and banking cultures inside Nationwide,' one specialist said yesterday. The society itself refused to comment on the reasons why Hutchinson has gone or to say how much compensation he has been paid. Given his star billing in the retail banking world, it can be confidently predicted that he will reappear before long; some in Lombard Street do not rule out the possibility of a return to Lloyds Bank.</p>

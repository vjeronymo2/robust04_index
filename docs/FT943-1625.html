			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Spending boost for education reaffirmed Mr Don Foster, MP for Bath, reaffirmed Liberal Democrat commitment to increased investment in education - funded if necessary by raising income tax, Ivor Owen writes. Delegates approved a resolution calling for city technology colleges and grant-maintained schools to be brought under the control of local education authorities. Mr Foster said this would restore accountability and partnership to the education service. The party also wanted to provide parents with a real choice in their children's education. Mr Foster urged 'choice for all, not just for the few under the government's market forces approach'.</p>

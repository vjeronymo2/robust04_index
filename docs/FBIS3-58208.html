			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F> Franz-Olivier Giesbert -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Giesbert] First there is this  matter of the Iranians who were expelled. On 31 January, the  government decided to send back to Tehran two people suspected  of terrorism, no doubt to avoid possible reprisals. For a  government which wants to terrorize the terrorists this is not  very brave.    [Juppe] Everything has already been said about this matter  --  the interior minister explained on television under what  circumstances he proposed to the prime minister that this  decision be made, and the prime minister thus made this decision  for the reasons he gave himself.    [Giesbert] Yes, but we do not understand the reasons.    [Juppe] They were quite clearly explained, it was for  reasons  of state. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] When the Swiss minister, Arnold Koller [head of  Department of Justice], says that France has lost some of its  credibility in the fight against terrorism, should one not admit  that he is right ?    [Juppe] I do not think that Switzerland's credibility in  this  field is much greater than that of France, and in any case,  combatting terrorism is not a matter of keeping on one's  national territory those who organize terrorism. [passage  omitted] The government's determination not to give in to  anyone, the determination of [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua,  in particular, to ensure that France is not a rear base for  international terrorism can not be doubted, and furthermore we  have shown this on several occasions with action against the PKK  -- the extremist Kurdish party -- and the FIS [Algerian Islamic  Salvation Front]. This takes great courage and great  organization on the part of the government. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] The other matter, which is much more important,  is, of course, the appalling Bosnian tragedy. Yesterday, a  further five peacekeepers were injured in Sarajevo. Does this  not show that General Cot is right when he says that our  peacekeeping soldiers are tethered goats waiting to be killed?    [Juppe] I will leave the responsibility for this expression  with him, because I believe that our soldiers on the ground are  doing an admirable job. Having said this, General Cot is right  that the situation on the ground is untenable today, and the  tragic thing in this matter is that, despite all the efforts we  have made, no peace process has begun. What is in the process  of beginning today is a process of war, as all the protagonists  on the ground, and I mean all the protagonists, today want, and  are seeking, war. [passage omitted] If we do not break this  process of war then we are heading for an unprecedented  catastrophe. [passage omitted] People have to know that we can  not make peace among people who systematically seek war.    [Giesbert] Mr. Juppe, you have just said to us that the  situation is untenable, so what can be done?    [Juppe] What are we trying to do? I repeat, to break out of  this spiral of war and violence. [passage omitted] If this  spiral continues, what will happen? First, all the UN  Protection Forces, our soldiers, our blue helmets, will be  increasingly exposed, as we saw again yesterday, and the logical  consequence of all that is that at some point or other -- and  this is an argument which has already arisen in certain  countries that have sent peacekeepers to the spot -- we will be  led to withdraw them, and if we withdraw them, Sarajevo will  fall, and a disaster, an unprecedented explosion of warfare will  take place in the heart of Europe, in the Balkans. So, this  must be stopped, and this is why we want the NATO summit on  Monday and Tuesday to take a strong position. I have heard  people saying here and there that we were making an appeal to  the Americans....    [Giesbert interrupts] Yes, we are throwing ourselves at the  Americans, are we not?    [Juppe] Let me laugh when I hear that, let me laugh. Can you  imagine for 30 seconds that on Monday and Tuesday the 16 member  countries of the Atlantic Alliance -- the Americans, but also  the Germans, the British and the French -- will meet in Brussels  to discuss the stability of the European continent without  saying a word about the situation in former Yugoslavia? [passage  omitted]    [Giesbert] This matter concerns Europe, above all, and  Europe  is not doing anything.    [Juppe] This matter concerns all those who are involved with  the security of Europe. [passage omitted] I am trying to bring  about progress, and I can not allow it to be said that Europe is  not doing anything -- Europe has thousands of soldiers on the  ground, and several have died or have been injured; Europe is  sending hundreds of millions of dollars to fund humanitarian  aid; Europe has not ceased taking political initiatives over the  last few months. [passage omitted]    [Juppe] I want to talk about what we will try to do on  Monday  and Tuesday, but first please recall that there is a political  plan to attempt to find a way out of the current situation, and  it is the European Union which has put this political plan on  the table. [passage omitted] The second thing that has to be  done is for the 16 countries of the Atlantic Alliance to declare  themselves ready, if this peace plan is signed, to guarantee its  implementation on the ground, by developing an adequate ground  force; and third, the countries of the Atlantic Alliance must  say that they are ready to help the United Nations in applying  the resolutions of the Security Council, which means reinforcing  the ground forces, the troops on the ground, and also real  protection of the security zones. In particular France also...    [Giesbert interrupts] [words indistinct]    [Juppe continues] Excuse me, but this is very important,  because there are people dying there -- no one will be dying in  Brussels, at least I hope not -- and France's additional  proposal is to reopen Tuzla airport, which is at the heart of  central Bosnia, so that humanitarian aid can be brought in there.    In Brussels, as you mentioned just now, we are going to talk  first of all about the European defense identity, the adaptation  of NATO to its new missions, notably to what is happening in  Yugoslavia, and finally its extension to include countries of  the East. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] Good Day.</p>

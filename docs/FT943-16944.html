			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: New management team at Starmin as losses double Starmin, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former cabinet minister, doubled its pre-tax loss for last year to Pounds 23.2m. The total loss included Pounds 11.2m relating to the write-down of fixed assets, and Pounds 7.9m of goodwill written off. The losses and exceptional charges have cut shareholders' funds from Pounds 19.6m to Pounds 3.42m. This has raised gearing from 39 per cent to 271 per cent, putting the group in breach of its banking facilities. Ernst &amp; Young, the auditors, pointed out that the accounts have been drawn up on a going concern basis, dependent on future funding being made available. The notes say there is 'fundamental uncertainty as to the appropriateness of the going concern basis'. The banks have extended the group's facilities until the end of August. The board believes that talks 'will result in the provision of new financing arrangements for the group'. The reappraisal of fixed assets was related to the group's plans, announced last February, to acquire a large, privately-owned construction group. But market conditions have prevented the deal from going through. The group has called in a new management team headed by Mr Michael Gurner, an associate director of Postern Executive Group, a management consultancy firm specialising in financial reconstruction. Mr Owen Rout, acting chief executive since June 1993, is relinquishing his executive responsibilities and will resign from the board at the AGM. Lord Parkinson said in his statement that 1993 had 'proved to be a demanding year'. But the group had made reasonable progress in its strategy to get back to the profitable core business of landfill and the extraction of aggregates and other minerals. Losses on continuing operations rose from Pounds 4.34m to Pounds 13.3m, including a profit of Pounds 228,000 from acquisitions. Total turnover fell to Pounds 16.3m from Pounds 18.7m in 1992, when the pre-tax loss was Pounds 11.9m. Interest payable rose from Pounds 713,000 to Pounds 931,000, reflecting higher borrowings. Losses per share were 6.6p (3.6p). There is again no final dividend.</p>

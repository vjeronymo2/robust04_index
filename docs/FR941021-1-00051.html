			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FAA Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA considered all of these comments, including AOPA's section by section recommendations, during its review of part 67. The FAA's proposed standards and policy on diabetes are discussed under the proposed rule portions of this preamble. New ECG requirements are proposed in this notice. Assessment of risk factors such as cholesterol and blood pressure is included and standards pertaining to alcoholism have been updated in the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule amends the standards for third-class medical certificates in light of recent technology and medical knowledge. As noted in the discussion of the proposed rule, the standards for third-class medical certificates are less stringent than those for first- and second-class certificates in recognition of the lower level of responsibility inherent in noncommercial flight operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Received on AMA Report Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most commenters were generally opposed to any AMA recommendations that involved a perceived strengthening of the standards for airman medical certification. Only eight commenters generally favored the AMA recommendations, some with suggestions for improving them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the opposing comments from pilots were based on their reading of an editorial about the AMA Report which appeared in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flying <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  magazine (Volume 113, November 1986, page 24) entitled ``What's Up, Doc?'' While the editorial was factually accurate, it briefly summarized some of the recommendations and was primarily a subjective editorial opinion opposing certain recommendations in the AMA Report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cost and Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The most frequent comment from those who objected to the AMA Report recommendations is that the recommended changes will result in a substantial increase in the cost of obtaining a medical certificate and that there are no accident data to indicate a need for increasing medical standards and thereby medical certification costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FAA Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The review of part 67 was necessary to ensure that the standards reflect current medical technology and evolving knowledge about conditions that could affect a pilot's ability to perform safely. For the most part, the proposed revisions to part 67 are not a strengthening of the standards over current regulations and policy. They represent clarification, codification of policy, and an updating of the current standards and practices. The proposed rule would make some standards less stringent, such as the deletion of uncorrected distant visual acuity requirements and the revised wording of those requirements pertaining to the eye, ear, nose, pharynx, and larynx. In other instances, additions to the medical examination requirements such as the proposed new standards for blood pressure for second- and third-class medical certification are clearly warranted. The FAA would be remiss in its responsibility for safety if it ignored medical findings and advances that can better identify those individuals subject to incapacitation or deterioration of performance. The estimated costs and benefits of this proposal are addressed in a Regulatory Evaluation Summary later in this preamble and more fully in a full regulatory evaluation which is in the public docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

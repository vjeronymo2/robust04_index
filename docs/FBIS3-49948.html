			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the Serb republic, declared in Geneva this evening  that, considering today's Serbian-Croatian agreement and the  fact that the Bosnian Serbs and Croats decided to sign a lasting  peace, the current round of negotiations is not a total failure.    After all that happened it is evident that the Muslims have  opted for war, not for peace, Karadzic went on to say, stressing  that the Serbs would exercise maximum restraint in responding to  provocations.    Karadzic said he expected the launching of an all-out Muslim  offensive, especially in central Bosnia. "If the sanctions  against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were lifted, the  Muslims would sign the peace plan," Karadzic assessed,  underlining that everything now depended on the international  community.    Nikola Koljevic, Serb Republic vice president, recalled that  the Muslims had been offered a truce and confidence-building  measures which, as he said, they rejected.</p>

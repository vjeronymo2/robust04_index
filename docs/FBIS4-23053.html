Kudryavtsev, the Scientific Production Association  ``Khimvolokno'' developed the high strength aramide fibers SVM  and Armos. Changes in industry made it possible to distribute  these products and thereby resolve ecological problems. Aramide  fibers have a unique complex of properties making them  ecologically attractive. In addition to being strong and  resilient, they are heat resistant at temperature intervals to  250-270 C, resist bending, and have good textile  properties. These properties make them very promising for use as  filtration materials, especially for hot gases. The cyclones  used for this purpose until recently, are suitable only for  pre-filtering. In the present work the use of aramide fabric  filters to treat hot gases to remove coal ash is discussed. Test  results indicate that the new aramide materials are promising.</p>

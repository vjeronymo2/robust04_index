			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Rouble reform splits cabinet: Finance chief wants central bank measure overturned MR Boris Fyodorov, Russia's deputy prime minister in charge of finance, returns from Washington today to urge that the central bank's cancellation of pre-1993 roubles be overturned in order to restore confidence in the government's handling of the country's finances. Foreign governments and international financial institutions administering a Dollars 44bn foreign aid package view the currency debacle as a crucial test for Mr Fyodorov. As leading minister for financial reform, he needs to reassert control of the central bank and other financial levers in the fight against inflation and in order to stabilise the currency. Mr Fyodorov is aware of the profound unease in US financial institutions and the US government - which leads the Group of Seven states in providing aid to Russia - over the sidelining of the finance ministry in the decision. At stake is the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of a Dollars 3bn systemic transformation facility, which will be considered by the IMF in September. There was a further twist to the already complicated political manoeuvrings yesterday when Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, announced he had fired Mr Viktor Barannikov, the security minister, for 'infringement of ethical standards and serious shortcomings in his work'. Mr Barannikov had been admonished by the Security Council on Monday for failing to respond adequately to attacks on Russian guards stationed on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan. He has now been accused of using 'commercial structures' to send relatives abroad and his dismissal is a dramatic fall from grace for a man who swung the power of his ministry, with its thousands of troops and former KGB operatives, behind Mr Yeltsin in previous crises. The sacking was immediately contested by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, who accused Mr Yeltsin of 'removing professionals' from the government. Mr Khasbulatov said he would reconvene parliament to reappoint Mr Barannikov. Mr Khasbulatov had earlier blamed the government's 'ruinous monetary policy  . continued with the persistence of maniacs' for the decision to change the currency. Splits in the cabinet over the currency programme came into the open when Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a deputy prime minister, said the bank's decree had 'sharpened political conflict' in the country. Any benefits from the move had been outweighed by the social turmoil caused. Mr Shakhrai warned that the spiral of parliamentary legislation being cancelled and in turn cancelling, presidential decrees would create a power vacuum, and with it conditions for the seizing of power by right-wing 'patriotic' forces However, Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, said they had no 'vicious plot in mind' in seeking to separate the Russian currency from those of other republics.

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Chile groups trek the ADR path - Companies are queueing to make foreign issues Thirteen Chilean companies, including energy, telecommunications and wine groups, are planning to issue American depositary receipts on the New York stock exchange. This year, the 13 are likely to raise at least Dollars 700m in this way  - some of which will be invested in other liberalising economies, such as Argentina and Peru. Bottling company Cristaleris recently became the eighth Chilean group to gain a foreign listing. Its offering of 3.65m ADRs - each representing three shares - was priced at Dollars 23 7/8 each, valuing the issue at more than Dollars 87m. If the underwriters take up their over-allotment rights, this figure will go up to Dollars 95m. Other companies queueing to make foreign issues are Chilquinta, a regional utility, Concha y Toro, the winemaker, and Banco O'Higgins, the first Chilean financial institution to seek a listing abroad. Under strict laws laid down by Chile's central bank, each company will be required to place at least Dollars 50m of new stock. Last year, of the Dollars 2.7bn invested in Chile, Dollars 826m came via the purchase of Chilean stock abroad. The ADR ball was set rolling in 1990 when CTC, the telecommunications group, placed Dollars 93m - 12 per cent of its stock - on the US market. Today, 25 per cent of CTC's shares trade in New York with a value of about Dollars 1.25bn. Soquimich, an iodine and fertiliser producer, and Masisa, a particle board maker, have more than 20 per cent of their stock traded in New York. In addition to raising a company's international profile and securing cash for expansion, foreign demand for Chilean paper has tended to push up the share price on the Santiago stock exchange. 'The minimum position of big US pension funds is often Dollars 5m,' says Mr Matthew Hickman of Bear Stearns. 'That's a huge demand by Chilean standards, so the price goes up.' So far have ADR prices been inflated that some analysts are advising taking profits on some better-performing ADRs. Mr Geoffrey Dennis of Bear Stearns, for example, says Chilean ADRs 'have been pushed up to significant premiums in relation to most stocks in the region'. In 1993, shares in Madeco, the copper manufacturing company, rose in nominal terms by 138 per cent in Santiago, while those in Masisa leapt by 207 per cent. Both issued ADRs last year. On the day after Cristaleris closed its deal, its share price shot up by 19.5 per cent in Santiago. The seven international ADRs trading last year accounted for 44.1 per cent of the selective IPSA index, which rose 50.5 per cent in US dollar terms last year. If this year's ADR calendar is completed, ADRs will account for nearly three-quarters of the IPSA index. 'The increased buying and selling activity of foreign institutional investors is having a greater and more direct effect on the domestic market,' says Mr James Walker of Baring Securities. Some foreign institutions like the fact that a slice of of the funds raised by Chilean companies is invested in other high-growth regional economies. Chilean companies, exposed to domestic economic restructuring before most other Latin American economies, have proved adept at applying hard-won lessons to difficult foreign markets. 'People like the quality of Chilean management,' says Mr Hickman. 'Investors like the idea of buying a Chilean vehicle. What many of them are actually doing is taking a stake in Argentina or Peru.' Some Chilean companies are bypassing their domestic exchange. CCU, the beverage group which placed ADRs in 1992, is so little traded in Santiago that last month it dropped off the IPSA index altogether. Many family-run businesses, wary of losing board control and dubious of the financial advantage of trading on the often-illiquid Santiago bolsa, prefer to take their chances abroad. Foreign institutions have large sums at their disposal yet are unlikely to be seeking boardroom control. 'Why should companies bother to list on the Chilean stock exchange?' says Mr Hickman. 'The size of the market here (in New York) is so much larger that it becomes a more feasible financial source without the political risk.' However, he admits there are dangers involved in ADR euphoria. 'First, prices shouldn't really be determined by foreign investors who don't understand the market as well as a local does. Second, the size of the US funds means that you just need a swift change of sentiment by a few people to have a big effect in Chile.' Some analysts fear what might happen if international interest rates rise and institutions cash in their Chilean profits. Others are more sanguine, believing the rising cost of Chilean stock reflects the premium being paid for a combination of stability and growth potential.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / BT plans to shed 50,000 more jobs British Telecommunications is aiming to shed a further one-third of its workforce in the medium term. This will lead to about 50,000 redundancies in addition to the nearly 90,000 imposed in a cost-cutting exercise over the past four years. The redundancies, some of which may be compulsory, will reduce BT's workforce to about 100,000, less than two-fifths of its size in 1990. Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said in an interview with the Financial Times that 'roughly speaking' he regarded 100,000 employees to be his goal for servicing BT's existing network. He refused to specify a precise timescale for the reduction, and said this would not be fixed until this year's target of 15,000 redundancies had been achieved and the company had reviewed its strategy. He declined to give a commitment not to resort to compulsory redundancies to secure the reductions 'over the next five years or whatever it is', raising the prospect of job losses proceeding at the rate of about 10,000 a year after the present financial year. 'The commitment is to do the very best we can through voluntary redundancy,' he said. 'But clearly it gets stickier as time goes on.' BT has so far achieved its redundancy targets through volunteers attracted by generous severances. It appears, however, that BT may be finding it more difficult to find volunteers as the focus shifts to management grades. BT is this year seeking to shed more than 6,000 of its 35,000 managers. The move comes amid serious discontent among BT employees at the scale of job losses and uncertainty about the future, reflected in an angry meeting of BT employees attended by Sir Iain last week. Most management grades have had their salaries frozen this year, and managers were the most outspoken at last week's meeting. Sir Iain acknowledged the 'genuine feelings of uncertainty' at BT, particularly among managers. He said they were similar to those prevalent in the company in 1990-91, when nearly 20 per cent of managers were made redundant and the number of management grades was reduced from 11 to five. However, he said that a recent survey showed an improvement in overall staff morale last year. BT has set aside Pounds 750m for redundancies this year. Its first-quarter results, published last week, showed it has spent just Pounds 54m so far.</p>

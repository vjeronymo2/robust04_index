			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesman Grzegorz </F> Dziemidowicz by Maria Bninska at the Radio ESKA studio in Warsaw  on the "Guest of ESKA" program--live]    [Text] [Bninska] NATO is slowly beginning to make decisions  and speak about the possibility of bombarding Sarajevo. It is  also beginning to discuss what Tadeusz Mazowiecki proposed a  year and a half ago: the proposal to turn Sarajevo into a  demilitarized zone. Do you think there is a possibility that  NATO will eventually decide to use air strikes against the heavy  artillery surrounding Sarajevo?    [Dziemidowicz] There is such a possibility and, as a matter  of fact, NATO has for many months been studying whether or not  to take firmer steps...    [Bninska, interrupting] It has been thinking about it, but  it  has not taken any such steps.    [Dziemidowicz] Well, it is by no means a simple decision. On  the one hand, everyone is saying....[Dziemidowicz pauses] The  pressure of world public opinion is unequivocal. One cannot  passively watch entire nations kill one another, watch them  practically disappear as a consequence of all kinds of ethnic  cleansing. On the other hand, launching military action--even  limited action--entails the risk of further fueling this war,  spreading it to other areas....    [Bninska, interrupting] This is what Milosevic keeps saying.    [Dziemidowicz] It also threatens to fuel terrorism. It is  difficult to take on such a responsibility and I understand the  hesitation before the final decision is made. This decision  certainly must be reached. The senseless slaughter in Bosnia  must be stopped; however, despite all the lofty and nice  headlines in newspapers, which say what should, ought, or must  be done, the decisionmaking process is very complex and....    [Bninska, interrupting] What does that work? Is global  diplomacy based solely on money and interests? Now, in the case  of the Gulf war and Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, the decision  was made almost immediately. A few months after Iraqi troops  invaded Kuwait, the Security Council gave its assent for the  allied forces to retake Kuwait. In the case of Yugoslavia, no  one has done anything for 22 months--aside from peace talks  which have not yielded any results. Of what does global  diplomacy really consist?    [Dziemidowicz] It is difficult to speak about diplomacy in  the global dimension, of course. In every region,  different--most often conflicting--interests come into play.  However, in the case of Kuwait, the situation was rather simple:  there was an invader and an invaded country. We can, of course,  still talk about the various interests....    [Bninska, interrupting] However, in the case of Somalia, the  situation was not that simple.    [Dziemidowicz] Still, the decision was made relatively  quickly, you must admit. It was backed by public support around  the world and by practically all major politicians. The carrying  out of this operation is a different story. Now, in the case of  former Yugoslavia--because we are now speaking about the entire  area--the situation is really quite equivocal. No one knows how  to cope with this problem. We keep hearing threadbare  expressions about the Balkan crucible, a keg of gunpowder.  However, there is something about it: decades pass by and such  a conflict cannot be settled.    [Bninska] Last week Poland signed the Partnership for Peace,  which means that we are somewhere in the corridor of NATO. Now,  in the case of making such a decision, does this partnership  envision the following: if NATO decides to bombard Yugoslavia,  and after all, we are closer to Yugoslavia than France for  instance, will NATO hold any talks with Poland? I understand  that it does not consult with us about such things, but does  this Partnership for Peace envision Poland being informed before  the media?    [Dziemidowicz] Definitely yes; yes, of course. The principle  of nothing about us without us, is also binding in this case. I  think that the mechanisms of protection, information, and  consultations within the Partnership for Peace program will be  discussed many times in the media: we have only just begun, we  have only just joined this program, we have only just started  the talks with our partners at NATO Headquarters, with the  individual member states of the organization. Therefore,  everything will gradually smooth itself out. The more support  for our stance, for our readiness to take part in this program,  we gain in these first few most important months, the more fruit  we will receive later on.    [Bninska] Does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ] think  NATO should use air strikes against Yugoslavia, especially in  light of the recent massacre in Sarajevo?    [Dziemidowicz] I cannot give you an unequivocal answer to  this question. The decision will certainly be broader. It will  not be a decision made by one state or a group of states; it  will be a decision for the Security Council; it may require a  consensus. I do not think that one single state will take on the  burden, not to mention the odium, of such a decision.    [Bninska] Do we have enough money to implement the  Partnership for Peace? National Defense Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk claims that this year we will need at least half a  trillion zlotys, which the Ministry of National Defense [MON]  simply does not have. How much does MSZ think will have to be  spent on the program?    [Dziemidowicz] It may either be half a trillion or even  several times as much. Partnership for Peace consists, among  other things, in the fact that a state contributes to the  program as much as it wants to or is prepared to contribute. We  can take part in undertakings which we accept or which we  initiate. Therefore, we do not necessarily have to look at these  matters in terms of money....    [Bninska, interrupting] However, how much is the government  prepared to contribute?    [Dziemidowicz] Naturally, Minister Kolodziejczyk is right in  saying that MON does not have this amount of money. The  partnership was signed after the money was initially  distributed. Thus, it is simply not possible for any  decisionmaker in MON to pay this amount of money from the  coffers of the ministry. It is certainly a decision for the  government, and therefore....    [Bninska, interrupting] Is MSZ prepared to pay this money?    [Dziemidowicz] MSZ will definitely not pay such a sum;  however, it will participate in any expenditures related to the  Partnership for Peace to a rational extent.    [Bninska] Is this Partnership for Peace profitable from our  point of view? It entails spending a lot of money, taken out of  our pockets, which probably means that teachers or physicians,  for instance, will have a little less money. Will it pay off?  What are we going to get in return?    [Dziemidowicz] At the beginning you mentioned this corridor.  Now I will repeat the quotation that has been referred to many  times: It is better to be in the corridor than out in the cold.  I simply think that there is no alternative for Poland: it must  join Western structures, that is, the European Union and NATO.  We must do this for the future of our reforms, the process of  democratization, and first of all, for the feeling of security  for 40 million Poles. It is simply indispensable for us to join  those structures.    [Bninska] As far as I remember, in the autumn of 1990 in  Krakow, the Visegrad Group was established with a big bang. This  Visegrad Group comprised Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary;  apart from developing close economic cooperation, these three  countries decided to build up political cooperation and make  efforts to join West European structures. Does the Visegrad  Group still exist?    [Dziemidowicz] Yes, it does. I will not say that it is in  good shape; it is going through a crisis. However, I will say  what Mark Twain once said: The rumors about the death of this  group are quite premature. It is merely....    [Bninska, interrupting] Is it angina or perhaps lung cancer?    [Dziemidowicz] I would say it is angina, but not in the most  acute form. Please note that the public is being informed about  very spicy details from the statements of various politicians  which undermine....    [Bninska, interrupting] Including the prime minister?    [Dziemidowicz] Which undermine, although not entirely,  certain forms of the functioning of the Visegrad Group; we think  that there are no such forms, such as the striving for  institutionalization. Now, the Visegrad Group is functioning  quite well. I am saying this on the basis of MSZ experience at  lower levels, where consultations are held. In the individual  countries where there are embassies of the four....    [Bninska, interrupting] However, what do these consultations  yield?    [Dziemidowicz] A lot. Many joint initiatives; first of all  we  inform one another about what we are going to do in this or that  area. This is extremely important.    [Bninska] The agreement, signed a few years ago in Krakow,  also envisioned the establishment of a duty-free zone between  these three states. Has this zone been established?    [Dziemidowicz] This duty-free zone has already been  established and it will be extended, or deepened, as it were.  Namely, as the years go by, we will broaden the list of goods  that can be bought or sold in Visegrad Group states without  great difficulties. Also, as a result of internal discussions,  the process of establishing the free trade zone has been  expedited. At the beginning, in line with preliminary plans, the  finalization of this project was supposed to be in the next  century. Now we are certain that it is a matter of several years.    [Bninska] How did the Visegrad Group become ill? I  understand that from the economic point of view, it is  functioning so-so. Why is it not so that these states do not  unanimously defend each other and each other's political  interests?    [Dziemidowicz] I think that this is a kind of angina or mild  flu which has affected the people and the political elites in  this part of Europe. Namely, after the euphoria of 1989 or 1990,  everything seemed to be clear and simple: we cooperate with one  another, we are linked by common interests, we are striving for  economic and political integration with the West at the same  pace. At the very beginning, we probably failed to note that  there are conflicts of interests among us as well; that our  economies are not very compatible and that they are very similar  and therefore competitive for similar groups of commodities;  that all this calls for time.    [Bninska] What are the conflicting interests among Poland,  Czechoslovakia, and Hungary?    [Dziemidowicz] If you are referring to political interests,  I  can see none. However, as for economic interests, there  certainly are conflicts. We have similar commodities that we  want to sell, either on each other's markets or on third markets.    [Bninska] The Czech Republic accused Poland of trying to be  a  kind of boss for this group, to be the best, and to submit the  other two states...    [Bninska pauses] Three states--the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  and Hungary to itself. Is this true?    [Dziemidowicz] I do not think that this is the truth. We  certainly launched many initiatives; on many occasions we  invited our partners to discussions on various problems. I think  that this is simply normal and we will keep on doing this.  Someone must come up with ideas. However, I think, or I am even  positive that we are not at all trying to impose our point of  view; we are rather trying to set off our common interests.    [Bninska] For a few days we have seen frictions between the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party  [PSL]. Do these disputes affect the work of MSZ in any way?    [Dziemidowicz] No, they do not. However, I fear that as a  result of them, commentaries less favorable to Poland may start  coming in from abroad. We have not seen this as yet. The Pawlak  government was rather popular with the foreign press, especially  after the prime minister's visit to Brussels. I do not know yet  what it will be like this time.    [Bninska] A subcommittee of the Sejm Foreign Affairs  Committee has been established to check the personnel of MSZ. Do  those who established it belong to the government? How is the  ministry functioning within the coalition structure?    [Dziemidowicz] The ministry is functioning fairly well. The  initiatives are quite varied. There has been a deputies'  initiative concerning Poles living in Lithuania. Thus, I think  that we will resolve many problems and....    [Bninska, interrupting] Minister Olechowski was indignant at  the establishment of this subcommittee. Has MSZ changed its  mind? Will it want to cooperate with this subcommittee? Will  this subcommittee be just like former verifications?    [Dziemidowicz] Deputy Micewski is going to meet with  Minister  Olechowski. I do not imagine that any binding decisions can be  made without this talk talking place.    [Bninska] The creators of this concept of establishing the  subcommittee claimed that personnel matters, concrete persons in  concrete posts, would not be discussed. However, Deputy Micewski  did not conceal that names may be mentioned there. Who is  entitled to select employees for the ministry: the Sejm or the  minister?    [Dziemidowicz] The personnel policy in the ministry is  definitely carried out by the minister. One of his tasks,  duties, and prerogatives is to appoint and recall employees: in  other words, it is his personnel policy understood as a broad  concept. There is also no doubt that the Sejm Foreign Affairs  Committee is the organ with which the ministry is obliged to  cooperate in various areas....    [Bninska, interrupting] The committee also has sessions with  candidates for ambassadors, does it not?    [Dziemidowicz] Exactly. It is also a body which issues  opinions on ambassadorial candidates.    [Bninska] Do you think that this committee can directly or  indirectly cause any changes in the various posts in the  ministry? Is it so that the minister listens to the committee  and then decides to do whatever he wishes?    [Dziemidowicz] Personnel policy is certainly the  responsibility of the minister. However, let me reiterate that  any suggestions, especially submitted by bodies which have been  appointed to issue opinions on foreign policy, such as the  committee, are quite important and taken into account in MSZ.    [Bninska] In those disputes between PSL and SLD, we have  once  again heard about the issue of political deputy ministers in the  so-called presidential ministries. MSZ is one such ministry.  Does MSZ see the possibility of turning the posts of under  secretaries of state into political ones?    [Dziemidowicz] First of all, MSZ is just about to start the  modernization process, that is, the adjustment of the ministry  to criteria that are imposed on us by the interests of the  Polish state, the necessity of strengthening the position of  Poland among our neighbors, near and far, and the need to take a  more economic look at the diplomatic service. I said we are just  about to start this modernization. We hope that it will be  started very soon, with the full consent of the government, of  course. It must be preceded by discussions with the Foreign  Affairs Committee. Minister Olechowski promised this to the  deputies. Thus, it will be a broader discussion, a broader  debate. We hope that as a result of it, we will shape a  diplomatic service that will measure up to our needs, both  today's and tomorrow's.    [Bninska] When you already have this new diplomatic service,  do you think you will allow it to become political?    [Dziemidowicz] I do not think that will be necessary.  However, the final shape does not depend on me.    [Bninska] Thank you very much for the interview.    [Dziemidowicz] Thank you.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Charities warned over bogus 'gifts' Charities were yesterday warned to beware of possible fraud attempts involving bogus donations from Nigeria. Cafod, the Roman Catholic overseas aid agency, was notified last month that a Nigerian donor had bequeathed Pounds 150,000 to the charity in her will. But Cafod was told that the money could not be released until Pounds 6,000 in Nigerian taxes were paid to a Nigerian account through a British bank. Checks established that the donation was an attempt to defraud Cafod of the Pounds 6,000. Police are investigating whether there is any link with a number of other frauds emanating from Nigeria that are now under investigation.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: LONG-LOST 'SALLY' RESURFACES AT THE VAGABOND;  </P> <P> REVIVALS: MARILYN MILLER, FLO ZIEGFELD'S SINGING AND DANCING STAR OF THE '20S,  IS FEATURED IN THE EARLY TALKIE MUSICAL.  </P> <P> Marilyn Miller is virtually forgotten today, having made only three  long-obscure early talkies before her death from blood poisoning in 1936 at the  age of 37, but she had been Florenz Ziegfeld's shining singing and dancing star  of the '20s.  </P> <P> Her first film, "Sally" (1929), long thought lost, resurfaces at the Vagabond  today and Wednesday in a respectable black-and-white print, duped from a  two-strip Technicolor print apparently no longer extant.  </P> <P> While its appeal today is surely restricted to determined nostalgists and to  historians, "Sally" is fascinating on several counts. The early talkie  musicals, as little more than filmed plays -- in fairness, "Sally," directed by  John Francis Dillon, is more fluid than some -- are of greatest interest as a  record of popular Broadway entertainments and personalities during its most  dazzlingly successful decade, the '20s.  </P> <P> And even more than "Sally," accompanying clips from "Gold Diggers of Broadway"  (1929), "The Cuckoos" (1930) and "Show of Shows" (1929) serve to remind us how  incalculable the contributions of the soon-to-arrive Busby Berkeley and Fred  Astaire were to be in tapping the infinite resources of the camera in  photographing and staging songs and dances for the screen.  </P> <P> An adaptation of Miller's 1920 hit written by Guy Boltonq, with songs by Jerome  Kern, "Sally" is a bit of typical fluff of the period about how a klutzy  waitress, through luck and pluck, becomes a top musical comedy star. Its key  song is the evergreen "Look for the Silver Lining."  </P> <P> Miller is a pretty blond, not terribly photogenic, with a light operatic  singing voice, lovely legs and graceful whether tapping or toe-dancing in the  unsophisticated routines of the era. Her genteel appeal pales alongside the  down-to-earth Depression heroines Ruby Keeler, Ginger Rogers and Joan Blondell,  who were to succeed her shortly at Warner Bros.  </P> <P> The film's lavish sets and costumes are credited to Jack Warner's having fallen  hard for his star.  </P> <P> If "Sally" is limited in its appeal, the Vagabond's next offering, "The Narrow  Margin" (1952), screening Thursday and Friday with a razor-sharp new print, can  be recommended across the board, especially to those who have seen the current  remake, which curiously throws away the original's surprise twist while adding  credibility-destroying elaborate action sequences.  </P> <P> If ever there was an argument for less being more, it's the original "Narrow  Margin," directed tautly by Richard Fleischer and written tersely by Earl  Felton from Martin Goldsmith and Jack Leonard's Oscar-nominated screen story.  In this thriller-on-a-train film noir classic, Charles McGraw is the decent,  reflective cop escorting hard-as-nails Marie Windsor from Chicago to Los  Angeles. Playing with it is "Out of the Past" (1947). (213) 387-2171.  </P> <P> Jesus Salvador Trevino's "Raices De Sangre" (1977) and Alejandro Grattan's  "Only Once in a Lifetime" (1978), screening Sunday at 2 p.m. in UCLA's Melnitz  Theater, are the first of a series of films that the UCLA Film Archive is  presenting in conjunction with UCLA's Wight Art Gallery's "Chicano Art:  Resistance and Affirmation."  </P> <P> Trevino's film, regarded as the first 35 mm film directed by a Chicano and  dealing with crucial moral and career choices facing a Harvard-educated Chicano  attorney (Richard Yniquez), was not available for preview. Unfortunately,  Grattan's film is a disappointment -- uneven, overlong and tritely conceived.  </P> <P> The vitality that Miguel Robelo brings to his role as as struggling,  uncompromising middle-aged painter is dissipated by the film's leaden pacing  and poor acting by some of the supporting actors. It's too bad that its capable  guest stars, Claudio Brook (as a suave art dealer) and Sheree North (as a faded  ex-Hollywood starlet), had not been given more screen time.  </P> <P> Sunday: "Break of Dawn" and "Zoot Suit." For full schedule: (213) 206-FILM,  206-8013.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 6 Mar -- Deputy Russian Foreign Minister  Vitaliy Churkin has stated that the Russian Foreign Ministry  considers the protection of the rights and interests of ethnic  Russians in the Baltic states as a priority task in its work in  the Baltics. He said this today at a meeting of the Public  Chamber under the Russian president, which is examining the  position of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic  countries -- to be precise, in Latvia and Estonia -- since,  according to the participants of the discussion, "normal  conditions have been created in Lithuania for ethnic Russians."    Having pointed out that "the infringement of the rights of  the Russians and Russian-speaking population in Latvia and  Estonia is giving cause for great concern," Vitaliy Churkin  underlined that the discussion of this issue by the Public  Chamber proves that this problem has "really a political  connotation." At the same time, according to him, "this is not  paying tribute to the present state of affairs. Our treatment  of this issue is being dictated by the concern for Russians who  have found themselves beyond the borders of their fatherland."    The problem is extremely complex and the Foreign Affairs  Ministry is striving to show maximum flexibility in solving it,  the deputy minister said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS  correspondent. "You can understand the anxiety of Latvians who  think that having 40 percent Russians in their republic is a  lot," Vitaliy Churkin said. "But the problem needs to be and can  be solved in the framework of cooperation, taking into account,  if nothing else, the fact that it was the Russian Federation  that helped Latvia attain independence, and not at the price of  forcing out Russian-speakers from territory on which they have  been living for many years, many of them even having been born  there." In the opinion of Vitaliy Churkin, the time has come to  equate Russophobia with such phenomena as aggressive  nationalism, chauvinism, and antisemitism.    Vitaliy Churkin said that Russia's Foreign Ministry was  implementing three main policies in its work: the maintenance of  direct communications with Russians in Latvia, Lithuania, and  Estonia to be of practical assistance to them in adapting to new  conditions of life; a bilateral dialogue with the Baltic states;  and the use of international organizations and contacts with  leading countries of the West to draw attention to this problem.  He noted, among other things, that the Foreign Ministry of the  Russian Federation was constantly drawing the attention of the  CSCE and the Council of Europe to the situation of  Russian-speakers in the Baltic countries. A Russian delegation  at the permanent committee of the CSCE has regularly been  initiating debate on this matter, urging it to take specific  steps in this area.    After stressing that Russia "does not intend to distance  itself from the resolution of the problem," the deputy minister  said that the Foreign Ministry had detailed a program for the  defense of the rights and interests of ethnic Russians in the  countries of the CIS and Russia, which laid out a range of  measures needed to be implemented to assist where necessary  compatriots who had found themselves in a difficult situation  abroad.</p>

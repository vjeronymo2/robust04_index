			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak wants  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to include  Australia and New Zealand in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA),  without giving them membership of the association.    Dr Suphachai revealed yesterday it was possible Australia  and  New Zealand would be asked to join AFTA, despite not being  members of ASEAN.    Thailand will chair the ASEAN Economic Ministers' meeting  this year and one of the issues to be discussed may be inviting  new countries to join AFTA, he said.    Dr Suphachai said he personally believed the AFTA should  include more countries, particularly Australia and New Zealand,  to expand its multilateral trading opportunities.    If Thailand could compete effectively in terms of trade with  Singapore, it was not out of the question that it could compete  equally well with the developed Australia and New Zealand.    Both countries are potentially large markets for Thai  exports  which are produced at low cost such as chicken and textiles.    The issue may meet with resistance at the meeting as  Malaysia  and Indonesia had made it clear long ago that they did not want  non-Asian countries to join the group.    Speeding up the implementation of AFTA, very likely from 15  years to 10 years, ought to be approved in principle by all  members. The terms and conditions, such as those involving  exclusion lists and local content, may call for further  discussion, he said.    It was widely believed that China may dominate all  Indochinese and ASEAN countries in the future because of its  strong potential and relationships with the people of these  countries. Market expansion as a result of this may prove  beneficial for Thailand since China is one of the largest  markets in the world.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / People: Ford puts Gillitzer in the hot seat Ford, basking in the success of Michael Schumacher and his Benetton Ford in grand prix, and enjoying something of a renaissance in European touring car racing and rallying, has created a new top motorsport post. It is aimed at giving long-term strategic direction to one of the car industry's most valuable marketing tools. Perhaps surprisingly, the chosen candidate is not a dyed-in-the-wool career motorsport figure but a 56-year-old former product planner and design and development engineer, in the form of Australian Peter Gillitzer. He has had just three years' of motor-racing experience, as manager of Ford's motorsport programme in Australia, where he had previously been responsible for bringing a Mazda-based two seater, the Capri, to market. Gillitzer's task will be to evaluate and advise where and in what categories Ford should be competing in order to maximise the promotional benefits of competition. Gillitzer, who will be reporting directly to Ford of Europe vice-president of marketing Ingvar Sviggum, did not have a great deal to celebrate when he formally started the job yesterday - less than 24 hours earlier Ford had only managed to come fifth in the Acropolis rally.</p>

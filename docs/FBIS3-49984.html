"Therefore, it is very important the three sides accept the  establishment of peace and resolve the remaining disputes  peacefully," Koljevic pointed out.    Koljevic said the joint declaration signed by the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia was "a  significant step for overall Serb-Croat relations," stressing  that progress was much slower in the negotiations with the  Muslim side.

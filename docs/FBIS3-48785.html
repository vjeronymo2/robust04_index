			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A draft agreement to be proposed by Japan during  the auto and auto parts talks -- which has been the focus of  attention of the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  -- came to light on 18 January. In addition to such additional  measures as promoting imports of finished automobiles, the draft  agreement includes "the number of dealers selling imported  autos" as an "objective criteria" to measure the openness of  Japan's market. The draft agreement will be presented at vice  ministerial talks set to begin in Washington on 21 January.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]  plans  to provide a breakthrough in the deadlocked negotiations by  improving the condition for sales of finished imported autos in  Japan, and by giving shape to an objective criteria -- designed  to assess efforts by Japanese and American manufacturers -- as  an index which will help promote access by foreign companies to  Japan's market. However, according to MITI's International  Trade Policy Bureau, Japan still maintains "it is impossible to  compromise on such proposals as establishing an objective  criteria, which Japan says leads to establishing numerical  targets, and giving favorable treatment to  non-Japanese-affiliated makers because these proposals run  counter to the principle of a free trade system." For that  reason, the talks seem to face rough sailing.    As part of the measures to promote imports of finished  autos,  Japan plans to propose expanding the loan ceiling of the  Export-Import Bank of Japan [EIBJ] and the Japan Development  Bank [JDB] as well as improving tax incentives to promote  imports of finished autos. In addition, to increase imports of  U.S.-made auto parts, which is held in check due to the sluggish  auto market, Japan plans to expand loans by the EIBJ and JDB and  release a list of U.S.-made auto parts which meet the standards  applied to auto repairs and inspections.    As an objective criteria to measure the United States'  efforts, the draft agreement proposes the United States should  lower the prices of auto parts made by American companies and  increase types of cars having the steering wheel on the right  hand side. As Japan's objective criteria, the agreement  proposes to promote research projects in the United States and  increase the number of individual business talks.</p>

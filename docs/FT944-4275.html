			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Cubans flee camp in Panama Some 100 Cubans were still at large last night after about 1,000 inmates had fled a US-run refugee camp in Panama yesterday. Most were recaptured hours after they had run out of the camp, having torn down a barbed wire fence. Some 60 US soldiers guarding the camp were injured - but none seriously - as inmates rioted, US military officials in Panama City said. Cubans had attacked US soldiers in stone-throwing protests on Wednesday and yesterday. The refugees were taken to Panama after being picked up by the US Coast Guard during the summer, while fleeing their country by sea on flimsy craft. They have protested at what they call the slow rate of transfers from the camps to the US and other countries. There are nearly 9,000 Cuban refugees at four camps near the Panama Canal.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (33): Building on a customer-base boosts profits - Northern Rock Building Society; User View AT a time of recession in the housing market, the aim of building society Northern Rock is to stay independent. Its marketing database is so strategic to this aim that Jeg Gray, direct marketing manager, attributes improved profits to the sharpening up of marketing techniques, writes Claire Gooding. Not only has it enabled Northern Rock to avoid takeovers and mergers by staying profitable, but it won the accolade from consultants Philips and Drew of being 'the most improved building society in 1990.' As the 11th biggest in Britain, with over a million customers and 1,600 employees, Northern Rock's 124 branches stretch form Inverness to Brighton, but its main home base is in the north-east. Even here it does not pretend to be dominant: it vies with the Halifax (17 times larger), each taking a third of the northern market. This presented Northern Rock with a marketing dilemma. 'We have to ensure that we are marketing led, with a range of products and services in line with what customers and potential customers want, and from which we can make a profit,' explains Jeg Gray. Additional loans to existing mortgage customers is typical of the 'add-on' services Northern Rock wanted to sell. But three or four years ago, the company was well aware that its direct marketing was weak. It had no idea of the 'lifetime value' of customers. Senior executives were in on the discussions which led up to the acquisition of some sort of marketing database, and were unanimous that in-house resources were better used concentrating on the core business. 'Our own IT staff were busy developing new products such as mortgage and savings plans, and managing existing systems. We decided to see what the market had to offer in the way of designing and building a marketing database,' he says. Here, the financial soundness, security, and experience were the criteria. However, in the final decision, Northern Rock chose the solution they now run from CCN marketing not on the basis of any previous experience with building societies, but on the willingness of CCN to tailor the service to its precise needs, and commit considerable resources to the project. Mr Gray has high praise for the other company on the shortlist, Printronic - 'a good all-round solution, but CCN Systems' northern location was what finally swung us.' As with any marketing database, the main effort was to winnow meaningful information from the diverse in-house accounting systems. 'It was a matter of re-structuring how we held the data, looking at people, not accounts. We started with our own internal files, which held nuggets of information in lots of different places.' The data is enhanced by using CCN's Mosaic demographic database. 'This divides housing stock into 58 different categories according to postcode,' explains Jeg Gray. 'Each postcode is relevant to around 17 houses. Mosaic also has census information available to it, so by knowing the postcode we can find out a lot about our customers and how they conform to profile.' Northern Rock was one of CCN's first customers to use its Oasis data dictionary, a proprietary product for the IBM mainframe which makes the software adaptable to different account structures, making it possible to look at account level, person level, or household level. The software project took four months to complete, using a small team of business and technical experts in the marketing database field. Now, as well as selling additional loan products, Northern Rock is able to convince customers of the benefits of extra security such as insurance. It cross-sells policies to a wide range of customers, and can demonstrate that on the savings and investment side, there are several products which have sold solely through approaches made through the post. CCN's service includes a monthly production cycle of enhancements and developments, and although Northern Rock's recent purchase of a Tandem computer with Oracle database might provide the basis of in-house support, there are no imminent plans to make the move. On the contrary, Mr Gray argues forcefully in favour of the bureau approach to marketing database. 'The need for database marketing, or relationship marketing, has never been more apparent,' he says. 'The best database and strategies are likely to be provided by people with experience. It is not necessarily an internal IT function.' He stresses the value of direct marketing agencies which understand the power, flexibilities and what he calls 'strategic opportunities' that a database can provide. For this, he used WWAV North. Handing over such systems to outsiders is, he says, no problem, because marketing databases can usually run alongside accountancy-base systems. Convincing 'the powers that be' to spend on such assistance and consultancy could be more of a problem: the organisation has to persuade senior managers who are used to spending millions of pounds on TV advertising that this is good value. Mr Gray is willing to sing the praises of the system, but wary of revealing too much to the competition because of the edge he believes it has given Northern Rock in the marketplace. In the worst housing recession since the Second World War, Northern Rock's performance outstripped others: profits were up 30 per cent, total assets up 29 per cent, and mortgage lending increased by 45 per cent - thanks to the effort put into database marketing and direct mail three years ago, he says. 'We are able to reduce marketing costs by communicating with those customers we consider to be more likely to be interested in the product. This is much more cost-effective than mailing to the whole file: it's selective marketing, the difference between junk mail and direct mail.' So anxious is Mr Gray to promote this desirable difference that he has become more involved in direct marketing and has taken a place on the newly-formed board of the Direct Marketing Association.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (3): Harmony in the corridors - Sectors in partnership / The economic strategy forum In Gloucestershire, As in other parts of south-west England, there is an awareness that an individual county, in terms of its economic development, increasingly lacks the muscle to fight its corner. In the past, the south-west has done well enough to be unconcerned that it lacked agencies to promote the region and attract inward investment. But the recession and the rundown in the defence industries, on which the region is heavily dependent, have forced a rethink. Neighbourly and political rivalries are being set aside in an attempt to have a louder, and more united, voice in the corridors of Whitehall and Brussels. This year has seen the creation of the Western Development Partnership in Avon, and Westcountry Development Corporation for Devon and Cornwall. These are two public and private sector partnerships designed to provide a strategic overview. Now Gloucestershire is proceeding down a similar road. It linked with Avon and Wiltshire this autumn to apply for the European Union's Konver funding, intended to support projects in areas suffering from defence-related job losses. Influential players in the county are now setting up an economic strategy forum with representatives from the county council, training and enterprise council, Gloucestershire chamber of commerce, the CBI and the TUC. Mr Tony Burley, the county council's group planning officer, says: 'The need is to collaborate on action - and one cannot do that without a strategy forum. It has become clear that in the future we need to co-ordinate and put limited resources together.' Whatever the outcome of the local government review (which proposes abolishing the county council and creating unitary authorities), such a body would be required to provide an overview. Mr Graham Hoyle, chief executive of the Tec, says there is unanimity that the forum needs to be made to work and to resource the action it proposes. 'A fundamental strength of Gloucestershire is that it has tended to move with the times. But there are now two snags. Defence and armed-force bases have been a strength for 30 or 40 years. Insurance, particularly, and banking have been strong in the 1970s and 1980s. But the peace dividend has led to the actual shedding of staff, and in financial services the growth has ceased.' In addition, inward investment had dried up. 'Gloucestershire is still seen as a very attractive and prosperous county - and still seen that way in Whitehall - with below national average unemployment, a mixed economy, a pleasant place to live - lucky old Gloucestershire,' he says. 'But if Gloucestershire does nothing, it is on a downward slope. There is a recognition that it has to do something, and it is sensible to plan what we do.' Public and private sector partnerships are already examining education strategy and seeking to identify the county's future sunrise industries. In September, the forum commissioned Coopers &amp; Lybrand to carry out a three-month study to help to prepare its strategy. Presentations are being held to make the broader community - companies, banks, utilities and colleges - aware that Gloucestershire needs to act. Mr Vince Taylor, consultant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has been analysing the results of a questionnaire sent to public and private sector agencies. 'I was very surprised at the high degree of consensus,' he says. 'There seems to be broad agreement. 'They would like to see Gloucestershire re-established as a leading region within the UK. They want to see a balanced economy of manufacturing and commerce, rather than as in the 1980s when commerce was appearing to dominate. Education features strongly as underpinning the employment skills.' Gloucestershire, he points out, is one of the leading British counties in terms of high-technology employment, but its position has been weakening, because of the contraction of the defence and aerospace industries. The county is, he says, perceived to be a high-quality location, if rather in the shadow of Bristol and Birmingham. But to attract further inward investment, the county needed to correct an image problem, dating back to the late 1980s, of appearing to be full - that there had been enough growth, that the market for labour and property was very tight. 'I think the door has to be re-opened to inward investors. But Gloucestershire cannot just say we're open for business. In order to preserve the quality of life, it has to be very selective - to have a rifle-shot approach.' One strong message from the questionnaire, he says, was the need to preserve that quality of life. 'People unanimously thought the natural environment was very good, and the vast majority said it mattered to their organisation in order to retain staff.' The forum will need to take account of local initiatives. For example, Cheltenham has already set up its own business forum and action group to develop an economic strategy for the town, intended to sustain existing businesses and attract new ones. It also has to take account of the county's geography. While the Gloucester, Cheltenham and Tewkesbury triangle is its economic heart (traditional rivalries have often prevented it from beating as one), individual parts of the county look outwards in different directions. The south looks more towards Bristol, the north towards Birmingham, the east towards Swindon and Oxford. The forum will have to liaise with the neighbours to develop a sub-regional approach. Mr Hoyle says: 'If Gloucestershire believes it can develop an economic plan within its boundaries full-stop, it is unlikely to be successful. In getting a Gloucestershire strategy together, that has to be done with a degree of collaboration with neighbouring counties.' Mr Chris Curtis, director of the CBI's south-western region and a forum member, stresses the importance of the forum but also of this sub-regional co-ordination. Brussels was increasingly looking at a Europe of regions rather than nations, and Gloucestershire would need to look beyond its own borders. 'Gloucestershire on its own has not the depth of resource, but needs a wider horizon for strategic planning,' he says: 'The CBI believes that, in the very long run, the people who live in the south-west ought to consider a regional development function covering all seven counties of the south-west.'</p>

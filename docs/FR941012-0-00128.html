			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (g)(6) of the final rule requires that each seat be securely fastened to the vehicle. The final rule adopts the proposed requirement and applies it to all vehicles used in logging operations. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained this requirement. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g)(7) of the final rule requires applies the requirements of paragraphs (f)(2)(iii), (f)(2)(v), (f)(2)(vii), (f)(2)(x), (f)(2)(xiii) and paragraph (f)(7) to each vehicle used to transport any employee off public roads or to perform any logging operation, including any vehicle provided by an employee. OSHA believes these general work practices and brake requirements are necessary to prevent accidents involving vehicles as well as machines. OSHA believes the reasoning and explanation for including these general provisions in the paragraph covering machines applies here as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (h)&blank;Tree Harvesting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (h) of the final rule, OSHA establishes various general and specific work practice requirements regarding tree harvesting. OSHA believes these work practice requirements are necessary, especially given the high injury rate in the logging industry. According to the WIR survey, in more than two-thirds of all reported injuries unsafe working practices contributed to the accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The work practices specified in this paragraph address those work practices that when not used contributed to accidents such as those reported in the WIR survey (e.g., co-worker activity, working too fast, misjudging time or distance to avoid injury, using wrong cutting method).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA notes that those provisions in the proposed rule that specified requirements other than work practices (e.g., equipment specifications) have been moved to the applicable equipment specification paragraphs of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (h)(1)(i) requires that trees not be felled in a manner that may create a hazard for an employee, such as, but not limited to, falling on an employee, or striking a rope, cable, power line or machine. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard contained similar provisions. The proposed rule required that trees not be felled in a manner that could endanger an employee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

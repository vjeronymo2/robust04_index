			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vecto 21" newscast] </F>   [Text] General Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, former  constitutional governor of Chiapas State has been released. It  was shortly before 1800. It was becoming dark in Chiapas State  and in the rest of Mexico.    Absalon stepped onto a rural road escorted by four or five  members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. He was  received by an International Red Cross [IRC] official who then  led him to Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and  reconciliation; and to Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the mediator in this  conflict.    This has been the first step that sets the basis for what  could become a dialogue for reconciliation and peace in Chiapas,  for a dialogue in Chiapas.    Absalon Castellanos has been in contact with the media. More  than 250 journalists left early from San Cristobal Las Casas to  be at a point on the door step of the Lacandon jungle. This is  what Castellanos said:    [Begin recording] [Castellanos] The IRC has just given me a  medical examination. I want to say that I wish to see Chiapas  in peace and calm, with everybody working for progress.    [Ruiz] Several persons were unable to see the sequence of  events here. Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis came earlier and the Red  Cross preceded us adequately. Both of us, Camacho Solis and  myself, witnessed the thorough examination that the IRC  conducted on General Castellanos, whom we have found to be in  better health than ourselves.    General Castellanos himself has affirmed that he was treated  well and that he is in good health, and we have verified that.  The Zapatist Army delivered the general to Dr. Meyer, of the  IRC. Dr. Meyer then delivered the general to me, and I  delivered General Castellanos to Camacho Solis who now will take  the general to his family, if this is what is decided.    I have proposed administering the ashes now since today is  Ash Wednesday and it is also the day this event has taken place.  We will do it in a symbolic fashion. [end recording]    This is what happened a few minutes ago in Guadalupe  Tepeyac,  Chiapas State.    The general has been delivered to his relatives. Some of his  closest relatives were present for this undoubtedly moving  ceremony. The general and his wife, Elsy Herreria, embraced each  other. Their children, Absalon and Oscar, who is an  Institutional Revolutionary Party delegate in Quintana Roo  State, received the former state governor with tears in their  eyes.    Camacho Solis and Bishop Ruiz will go with Castellanos to a  military post where a helicopter is waiting to take them to a  hospital.  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 0051 on 17 February reports that the  guerrillas announced that as of Thursday they will stop  collecting the war tax "in the locations where it has been  implemented" in the State of Chiapas, as "an additional action  to create an appropriate climate" for the dialogue.]</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSAL INCLUDES FEE TO CLEAN UP OIL SPILLS  </P> <P> Declaring that California has escaped a disastrous oil spill only because of  "sheer blind luck," two state officials proposed legislation Tuesday that would  impose a 50-cent-per-barrel fee on oil to pay for spill cleanups.  </P> <P> Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy and Controller Gray Davis proposed the fee as part of  a legislative package that would make the oil industry in California subject to  tough new fines and regulations designed to force it to take steps to prevent  tanker spills along the state's coastline.  </P> <P> Both officials, who are members of the State Lands Commission, said hearings  conducted after the 11-million-gallon spill from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's  Prince William Sound had taught them that the industry cannot be depended upon  to take adequate measures on its own either to prevent spills or clean up after  one has occurred.  </P> <P> "What we learned was that California was spared (an oil spill) not because of  adequate preparation, not because of appropriate caution, but out of sheer  blind luck," McCarthy said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Industry Oil Spill Program  </P> <P> But a spokeswoman for the Western States Petroleum Assn. disagreed, saying the  industry has begun its own oil spill program by pledging $250 million to create  five regional oil spill centers capable of reacting immediately to spill  emergencies.  </P> <P> Carol Currie said the industry is also supporting federal legislation that  would create a $1-billion cleanup fund.  </P> <P> "What the industry asks is that they (the state) work with the industry to  ensure that everything works together on both the state and federal level," she  said. The state legislation, to be sponsored by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia)  and Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), would:  </P> <P> * Create a $500-million superfund to pay for oil spill cleanups. The superfund  would be financed by the 50-cent fee imposed on each barrel of oil unloaded at  a California marine terminal.  </P> <P> * Promote earlier participation by the Coast Guard in cleanup operations by  providing that money from the fund could be used to reimburse the federal  government for Coast Guard involvement.  </P> <P> * Establish tough new safety rules and make oil tanker and marine terminals  subject to a maximum $100,000-a-day fine if they failed to comply with the  rules.  </P> <P> * Impose a $10-a-gallon fine for every oil spill and a $30-a-gallon fine if the  spill is caused by "willful misconduct or negligence."  </P> <P> * Create an office of oil spill response to direct cleanup operations.  </P> <P> * Require tanker operators moving across state waters to prove that they had  the resources to cover their liability for any spill.  </P> <P> * Establish coastal tanker control facilities to prevent collisions and  groundings.  </P> <P> Lempert, who is also chairman of the Assembly Select Committee on Oil Spill  Prevention and Response Preparedness, said he will conduct hearings on the  proposed legislation throughout the fall and formally introduce it early next  year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Widespread Outrage'  </P> <P> "I think if the public knew just how unprepared we are right now to prevent  this nightmare there would be widespread outrage," he said.  </P> <P> Lempert and Keene acknowledged that the oil companies would probably pass the  new fees on to consumers in higher oil prices, possibly as much as half a cent  per gallon.  </P> <P> "Will they pass it on to the consumer?" Keene asked. "They'll try."  </P> <P> But Davis said any increases in gasoline prices would be small compared with  the 19-cent-per-gallon average rise in prices after the Valdez incident. "If  they (the consumers) get hit with a half-cent increase at the gas pump, at  least they get something for it," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Taiwan's China-watchers weigh risks of closer links 'Will smiling Siew take off the white gloves?' asks a headline in yesterday's Independence Evening Post in Taiwan. The respected liberal daily refers to the island's intricate arm's-length pas de deux with China. Mr Vincent Siew, renowned for his ever-present grin, was put in charge of shaping the island's policy toward its giant neighbour and ostensible rival in a cabinet reshuffle last week. The question embodies both the hopes and dreads of Taiwanese, who find themselves variously fearing an invasion by the People's Liberation Army, dreaming of a return to the ancestral fold and planning how to plunder the El Dorado of the orient. It also reflects the chief fear of many ordinary Taiwanese: that of being involuntarily absorbed by China, which views Taiwan as a rebellious province and threatens to use force if the island should formally declare independence. Most countries accept Beijing's view and do not accord diplomatic recognition to Taipei. 'Given Siew Wan-chang's background in trade and economics, in the future, cross-strait commerce will take precedence over politics, and some people find this disturbing,' the article says. During his previous brief as economic planning minister, Mr Siew drafted a plan to transform the island into a regional business hub. Press reports suggest that he has been brought in to head the Mainland Affairs Council to carry out that plan. The missing link - literally - in Taiwan's grand ambition to become a regional centre for business, finance and transport is direct shipping and flights to China, banned by Taipei since the Kuomintang government fled to the island after losing China's civil war in 1949. Businessmen who have investments in China and are forced to travel back and forth via Hong Kong see things differently from the average Taiwanese. In a Sunday editorial, the Commercial Times, a financial daily which broadly supports government policy,wrote in favour of the Economic Planning Ministry's suggestion to create an 'offshore transport centre' which would be used to establish direct shipping and air links with China. 'From an economic point of view, direct cross-strait transport would save time and money and promote development of two-way trade and economic development on both sides,' the paper argued. The pro-government China Times, in an editorial published yesterday, said the ruling Kuomintang would be likely to step up economic ties with China, possibly opening direct links, in order to gain support in crucial legislative elections late next year and first-time presidential elections slated for early 1996. 'The iron votes have rusted,' the paper said in a reference to the loss of once loyal supporters to opposition parties. 'Faced with upcoming elections. . . what other more effective card does the ruling party have to play?' But in a letter published last week in the United Daily News, which is seen as being more closely aligned with the Kuomintang faction whose members came from China in 1949, a Shanghai-based Taiwanese businessman wrote: 'Many people believe that Taiwanese businessmen support direct links, but actually that is not so. If direct links were opened tomorrow. . . like a magnetic force, Taiwan would be swallowed alive.' But the issue of direct links will become, in practical terms, a moot point in 2 1/2 years in any case, as the Economic Daily News hinted in an editorial last week. 'The 1997 deadline for Hong Kong is forcing us closer by the day. In the past we could avoid dealing with the direct links issue. . . but soon we will be compelled to face (China) directly,' the paper warned. The British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.</p>

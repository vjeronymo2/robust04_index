			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Sobolev: "Russian Peacekeeping Forces </F> Move Into Zone of Georgian-Abkhaz Conflict"]    [Text] And so, the political debates are behind us, and  tomorrow, 26 June, as announced by Russian Federation Deputy  Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev, the operation to maintain  peace in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict will begin. A  sketch map [karta-skhema], published today, has been provided  for by the agreement on a cease-fire and the disengagement of  forces. The security zone must be devoid of heavy combat  hardware -- artillery weapons and mortars of a caliber exceeding  80 mm, as well as tanks and APC's. This hardware will be  withdrawn into "collection areas" which are under the control of  UN military observers. It is also planned to pull Georgian  troops out of the Kodori Gorge and back across Abkhazia's  borders, as well as to disband and withdraw from Abkhazia armed  detachments which arrived there from beyond its borders.    Aleksandr Arinakhin, chief of the Russian Federation  Ministry  of Defense Sector [napravleniye] for the Leadership of  Peacekeeping Forces, explains:    "I have just returned from Abkhazia, where, by decision of  the Federation Council, the Russian forces' peacemaking  operation is getting under way. Right now, our subunits are  being moved out there. We are expecting other Commonwealth  countries to participate in this operation. I think it will be  a success: Third time lucky, as they say, and this is the third  time we will be separating the warring sides.... So the third  attempt should be successful. A dispute is now going on over  why Russia does not have an international mandate for the right  to conduct such operations. But it had no such mandate before,  during the previous operations, and it would seem that, owing to  the indecision of the United Nations, we will not get one in the  near future either. Although nor do we see evidence of any  ardent wish on the part of the international organizations to  quell the conflicts on the territory of the former Union....  Which is why we have to act on the basis of our laws and  international treaties. Let me remind you: Both Abkhazia and  Georgia requested Russia to carry out the peacemaking operation.  I will add that the experience of past years has shown that  Russian peacemaking forces operating in conflict zones do not  under any circumstances use weapons against peaceful  inhabitants. So it is that our soldiers understand the  complexity and the specifics of the forthcoming operation, and  they are prepared for it."</p>

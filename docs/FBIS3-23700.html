Russia Has  Seriously Thought of Constructing Its Own Spaceport"]    [Text] It is probable that Kazakhstan, which a little more  than a month ago signed a memorandum on the status of the  Baykonur cosmodrome, has decided if not to reexamine its  position, in any case to stall the adoption of the conditions  for use of the cosmodrome. The recent negotiations of Russian  and Kazakh experts did not yield virtually any results. The  Kazakh side criticized the proposals formulated by the Russian  representatives, but did not make their own counterproposals,  other than the resurfacing idea of transformation of Baykonur  into an international space company.    A visit of Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, to  the United States will begin on 14 February. It is proposed that  an agreement be concluded on cooperation, including in the space  research field. The Kazakh leader is attempting to clarify  whether the United States intends to participate in Baykonur  becoming a joint-stock company. The experts do not anticipate  great enthusiasm on the part of the Americans because the  appropriations for space research have recently been cut back  greatly.    According to the plan of the president of Kazakhstan, the  cosmodrome will become a joint-stock company of the open type,  with the stockholders being Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and  other countries who so desire. However, at Baykonur there would  be no place for Russian soldiers of the military space forces,  although it is precisely they who ensure cosmodrome operation.    This idea, it would seem, was cast aside because it was  unrealistic, but due to the project for construction of the  international orbital station Alpha and the possibility of  bringing the United States in as a stockholder it has surfaced  again.    The time allocated for defining the specific leasing  conditions will elapse after a month and the experts plan to  meet once again in mid- February. Then only a few days will  remain prior to the visit of Boris Yeltsin, president of the  Russian Federation, to Kazakhstan and there is very little hope  that during such a time it will be possible to arrive at a  compromise.    The status of the problem of the demilitarization of  Baykonur  for the time being remains at the level "maybe yes - maybe no."  It is evident that in such a case one of the sides must  compromise. A more complex problem is that of the amount of  lease payments. Here the requirements of Kazakhstan are  extremely significant; the Kazakh negotiations are not about  rubles, but about dollars.    In addition, the Kazakh side raised the question of  compensation for its losses sustained due to the activity of  Russia at the Baykonur cosmodrome and at three other test sites  located in the territory of Kazakhstan. According to the  calculations made by an unknown method the total cost of  restoration associated with the operation of the Baykonur  cosmodrome and three other test sites during 1992-1993 is more  than 7 billion dollars. Meanwhile it has been established that  harm to the health of the population has been inflicted only by  nuclear tests at the Semipalatinsk test site. But since the  moment that Russia proclaimed its sovereignty there has not been  a single nuclear test there.    All this will probably soon force the directors of the  Russian space branch to think seriously of the possibility of  constructing a new spaceport in the Far East, the plan for which  already exists.</p>

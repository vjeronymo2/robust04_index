			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Arts: ENO to invest in new productions The English National Opera has decided to invest its way out of its financial problems. The new general director, Dennis Marks, believes that only by freshening up the repertoire with new productions can he raise audiences and attack an accumulated deficit of Pounds 2.4m, and an annual deficit of around Pounds 500,000. In the 1994-1995 season the number of new productions is to be increased from six to eight. There will be two new 'core' operas, Tosca and Don Giovanni; two newcomers to the ENO repertoire, Mussorgsky's Khovanschina and Massenet's Don Quichotte, plus Brecht and Weill's Mahagonny; and two British works, Tippett's King Priam and Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Finally there will be a UK premiere for Schnittke's Life with an Idiot. The policy will be paid for by economies which will mean redundancies; and a New Stages Appeal this season to raise Pounds 250,000.</p>

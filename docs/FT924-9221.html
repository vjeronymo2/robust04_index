			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker sells water stake Brent Walker, the betting, pubs and property group, has sold its 80 per cent interest in Carmarthen Water, the Welsh natural mineral water company, back to its original owners supported by a consortium of property, hotel and distribution partners. Beryl and David Davies founded the company and its Prysg brand of spring water was the first to gain natural mineral water status in Wales in 1986. Brent Walker acquired the stake in April 1988, re-branded it in a new bottle and marketed it in its own outlets. Mr James Rackham, of Winefare, the drinks distributor and one of the new investors, said annual sales totalled about 650,000 litres, equivalent to about 0.1 per cent of the UK bottled table water market. Annual turnover was about Pounds 2m. The company has net assets of about Pounds 670,000.</p>

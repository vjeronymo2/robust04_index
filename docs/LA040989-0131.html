			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Pakistan warned Afghanistan's Marxist government that it risks "serious  consequences" after a Soviet-made Scud B missile landed about 500 yards inside  Pakistani territory. The Afghan government called it an accident, saying the  missile missed its guerrilla target and went across the border near the village  of Torkham. Kabul refused to apologize, again accusing Pakistan of aiding the  U.S.-backed Muslim guerrillas fighting the Afghan government. There were  conflicting reports on whether the missile caused any casualties. Pakistan's  Foreign Ministry said the incident was a ploy to persuade the U.N. Security  Council to debate the Afghan crisis.  </P></p>

Takahiro Yokomichi,  governor of Hokkaido in northern Japan, held secret talks with a  cabinet minister Wednesday night on forming a new party that  would involve a merger with the largest party in the coalition  government, they said.    Yokomichi agreed in the meeting with Science and Technology  Agency Chief Satsuki Eda to start preparations to form the new  party with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as its core, they  said. Yokomichi, a former SDP member of the House of  Representatives, told Eda, leader of the United Social  Democratic Party, at the meeting in Tokyo that he is willing to  run for a Diet seat in the next general election, they said.    He had already received a positive response to the idea of a  new party from SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and its secretary  general, Wataru Kubo, the sources said.    Yokomichi met with Kubo and Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi  Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), on February 12 and  agreed to form a unified parliamentary group among the SDP,  Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party, they said.  Yokomichi, dubbed the "prince of the SDP," was elected to the  Diet four times from 1969 and has been elected Hokkaido governor  three times since 1983.    Shinseito and Komeito want a two-party system in which the  seven coalition parties would merge into a single party, but the  SDP and Sakigake prefer a moderate multiparty system.    Meanwhile, the ASAHI SHIMBUN reported Thursday that the SDP,  the DSP and Sakigake have agreed to start regular consultations  to strengthen ties among them.</p>

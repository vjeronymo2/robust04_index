			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Management: Corporate venturing back in vogue LIKE a good 1960s pop song, the idea that large companies need an invigorating dose of internal entrepreneurship is forever bouncing back into fashion. Like Elvis Presley's 'I Can't Help Falling In Love', which has again hit the charts this summer - sung this time by UB40, a leading pop group - it tends each time to be re-orchestrated, or given a few extra chords. But unlike most songs, it also usually changes its name. In the 1960s it was christened 'venture management'. In the late 1970s, to distinguish it from the emergent venture capital craze, it was rechristened 'internal corporate venturing'. In the mid-1980s it reappeared under the dreadful name of 'intrapreneurship'. Now it is emerging once more in practice and on paper, sometimes with its old 1970s label, but also under the broader imprint of 'new business development'. The reason for its latest revival is that corporate entrepreneurship is becoming more vital than ever before to the survival of large organisations. But it remains damned hard to do - just ask IBM, General Motors or countless others why they have failed to emulate the few brilliant examplars, such as 3M or Hewlett-Packard. Time and time again, multinationals of all shapes and sizes have launched a 'new ventures' drive, only to drop it prematurely a few years later when - surprise, surprise - few if any ventures have yet grown to a size or level of profitability which is significant to the company. On one notable occasion, the night of Margaret Thatcher's first general election victory in 1979, I attended an enthusiastic gathering of 'venture group' managers from two dozen British companies. Three years later almost all the venture groups had been killed off by parent companies impatient for immediate profits and cash savings amid recession. A fortnight ago I took part in a similarly hopeful meeting of 'business development' and strategy managers, but this time at Breda in the Netherlands, with managers from several continental European countries. It was the fifth annual 'longest day' on new business and creativity which an enterprising Dutch consultancy has organised around the summer solstice - a sort of corporate version of Britain's Glastonbury music and arts festival. The event illustrated vividly that the practice of internal venturing has moved on in several important ways since the heady 1960s, and even since the 1980s. First, interest in venturing is at last ceasing to wax and wane in tandem with companies' faith - or loss of it - in diversification by takeover. The latter is rightly out of fashion, but managers are recognising that new business development has been made more important than ever by the shortening of product life cycles and development times. As one hard-pressed Dutchman said: 'We need to create more with less, faster.' Second, corporate venturers are benefiting from the newly popular concept of 'core competences' (or 'core capabilities'). This is not at all the same thing as a 'core business'. Instead, it emphasises a company's unique, competitively relevant, and defensible expertise in such things as technology, production, marketing, distribution, customer service, or alliance management. One example is Honda's competence in engine technology, another 3M's unusually innovative culture, plus its experience in abrasives. The emphasis on core competences is causing many companies to look again at how they can exploit more effectively what they already know - or 'leverage' it, in American parlance - rather than forever chasing after some new hare-brained diversification. As the Breda conference showed, this is giving 'internal venturing' a new lift. It is also stimulating a third new variation: greater selectivity. Most companies used to take a 'casino' approach: they spawned scores of new ventures, covering a wide range of frequently unrelated activities and compentences. They then ran them in parallel, in the hope that the proverbial one in seven or so would be successful after up to 10 years (eight was the popular average). As a manager from one Belgian company said: 'We had 25 projects taking 10 years to be completed. Now we have only a handful and they'll succeed in three or four years - or we'll fail them.' Another had 86 projects a year ago, but now has only five. They are larger than before, and are being given far greater resources, so that they have a better chance of rapid take-off and success. A fourth variation is that many companies are no longer putting all their eggs into one isolated 'new ventures division', where they tend to get forgotten or squashed when their top management sponsor moves on. Which brings us to the fifth and most important variation. Instead of thinking that they can 'nurture' ventures in a ghetto in one corner of the company, as conventional wisdom used to suggest, today's venture managers realise they will not get far unless the corporate culture of the whole enterprise around them can be made much more innovative. Of the 30 participants at Breda, no fewer than 19 voted 'management mindset' or 'conflict with the corporate elephant' as the prime challenge to their new business efforts. This frustration now needs to be harnessed in helping large companies see the urgent need not merely to raise their productivity through 're-engineering' and other measures, but also to unleash the internal entrepreneurship which is essential if they are to create new businesses, and thereby regenerate themselves. For many companies it may, in the words of another Presley song due for revival, be a case of 'It's Now Or Never'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 18 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav Foreign  Ministry on Monday summoned the charge d'affaires at the French  Embassy in Belgrade and strongly protested over a terrorist  assault on the Yugoslav cultural centre in Paris and demanded  that the French Government take urgent and energetic measures  against its perpetrators.    It also demanded that the French Government secure and  guarantee conditions for normal and safe work of the Yugoslav  cultural centre, duly punish the perpetrators and prevent  similar incidents against Yugoslav diplomatic and other offices  in France from happening in the future.    A group of French citizens and Moslem extremists, headed by  notorious activists from Paris' political demimonde, stormed the  Yugoslav cultural centre on Monday, threw out the personnel,  vandalised the premises and occupied the premises.    Police and the authorities reacted to the situation with  less  than desirable alacrity, allowing the vandals to use the centre  for brutal anti-Serb and anti-Yugoslav propaganda.    The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry conveyed to the French charge  d'affaires its bitter resentment at the escalation of vandal  attacks on Yugoslav offices in the city which boasts of being  the world's cultural capital.    Yugoslavia insisted that everything, including the property  of the cultural centre, should be restored to the status quo  ante.    Special concern was expressed at the fact that the incident  had happened despite warnings from the Yugoslav side that  something of the kind might be in the offing and demands for  adequate measures to be taken to protect the Yugoslav offices.    Belgrade explained that assaults of this kind were  encouraged  by an unprecedented systematic anti-Serb and anti-Yugoslav  campaign in the French media.    The French diplomat expressed regret at the incident and  said  he would convey this in his (?note) to his government.    The Yugoslav charge d'affaires in Paris too lodged a protest  with the French Foreign Ministry on Monday over the deplorable  incident.</p>

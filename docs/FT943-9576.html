			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: VVL focuses on a small, smart camera - US and Asian groups may dominate the world's high technology industries but the UK has its share of small, entrepreneurial companies exploiting ingenuity and enthusiasm. How are these companies coping with the demands of growth, finance and competition US and Asian groups may dominate the world's high technology industries but the UK has its share of small, entrepreneurial companies exploiting ingenuity and enthusiasm. How are these companies coping with the demands of growth, finance and competition, asks Alan Cane in the first of a new series. In a laboratory in the Corstorphine area of Edinburgh sit tiny machines capable of analysing human fingerprints, counting the spots on gaming dice and recognising dazzle in a car's rear view mirror. They are among the prototypes and products from a company which seems to have secured a useful lead in one of today's most exciting technologies - machine vision. VLSI Vision (VVL) makes the smallest, cheapest and least power-hungry video cameras in the world. The entire camera, image sensing unit and signal processing circuitry is inscribed on the surface of a silicon chip. Add a conventional lens and a microprocessor to endow the camera with intelligence and the entire 'imputer' (image computer), as VVL describes its smart camera, is about the size of a box of matches. It costs Pounds 180 in quantities of 1,000. Conventionally, it takes Pounds 3,000 worth of video camera, accessory circuity and computer to do the same job. The scope for using VVL's cameras extends from manufacturing control systems and surveillance equipment to children's toys. The technology which underpins VVL's products is the work of Professor Peter Denyer, 41, VVL managing director and one of the UK's outstanding semiconductor specialists. Working in the late 1980s on a fingerprint identification system for De La Rue, the security printer, he made the conceptual breakthrough which made possible sensor and processor on the same chip. Other semiconductor companies have so far failed to match his achievement and his technology is hedged with patent protection. Prof Denyer teamed up with Mr Roy Warrender, a 50-year-old engineer specialising in computer techniques, to form VVL in 1990. Mr Warrender is now commercial director. About Pounds 200,000 in venture capital and loans was provided by Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund and the former Scottish Development Agency. VVL has since had some 10,000 enquiries for its products and systems. The availability of tiny, low cost video cameras has opened up a world of new commercial and social opportunities. One of the first products VVL developed was a simple security camera - by transmitting a handful of video pictures to a control centre it confirms whether a breach of security has taken place. Some 96 per cent of alarm calls are false, resulting in wasted time and money. Security is an important growth area for the video camera business. Local authorities which have installed cameras in public places have seen a dramatic fall in casual crime as a consequence. The company's growing need for funds was met last year through a cash injection amounting to several million dollars from Donnelly Corporation of Michigan. The US company, one of the world's largest vehicle components manufacturers, now holds a sizeable minority stake in the Scottish company. Donnelly's logic for its involvement rests on its belief that conventional vehicle mirrors will eventually give way to electronic imaging systems. The first fruit of its collaboration with VVL is a rear view mirror fitted with a video camera which detects excessive glare and modifies the reflectivity of the mirrors accordingly. VVL sells its video products in several versions; it sells the basic chips, modules ready for incorporation into other manufacturer's products and entire cameras. Modules, selling at about Pounds 20 a time, are the most popular. Prototypes the company is working on include: A gambling machine intended to automate games involving the throwing of dice. VVL's imputers are capable of distinguishing and counting the spots on a pair of dice tossed on to a green baize background. As a consequence of the work with De La Rue, a fingerprint recognition system that will match a sample print against a small group of prints in a second or less. Such a system could typically be used to allow or deny access to an office or building. The individual presses his or her finger against a glass panel where it is scanned by a VVL camera. The fingerprint pattern is recorded using a set of calculations developed by Prof Denyer and compared with those on file. If a match is made, access is allowed. VVL is also working with games and toy manufacturers. Here cost is critical. While easily available vision systems offer the possibility of many futuristic kinds of toy, the selling price must be strictly within traditional limits. VVL has responded by developing the world's first single chip video camera selling for less than Dollars 10 (640p). The company has turnover in excess of Pounds 1m a year at present. It has been profitable in the past but now is investing heavily. Mr Warrender says, however, that the company's forward order book is worth Pounds 5m. It is likely VVL will be looking for new money in the next 12 months to fund the next phase of its development, but he says he is keeping an open mind - and a closed mouth - about the way the new funding will be achieved.</p>

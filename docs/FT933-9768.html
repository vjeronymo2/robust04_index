			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: TV-am/Crockfords TV-am's shareholders must be well aware of the dangers of betting following the TV franchise auction. That may not stop them taking advantage of this terrible instinct in others by backing the reverse takeover by Crockfords casino. Doing so, however, is a pure punt. And anybody who doubts that gambling is a mug's game would do well to peruse Crockfords' profits record. Last year the casino made operating margins of 45 per cent. Over a long period, it becomes clear that the house always wins. Nevertheless, with 40 per cent of last year's profits dependent on one particularly ill-starred high roller, Crockfords brings a new dimension to the concept of earnings volatility. As much as 5 per cent of Crockfords' annual profits can be won or lost in one night. It is astonishing that TV-am's respectable list of institutional investors seem so keen to sink money into such an inherently unpredictable business. The 7 1/2 per cent yield on the new shares certainly has its attractions. The shares are also likely to command a premium when they start trading. But how sustainable the yield will be is entirely dependent on Lady Luck. Crockfords will seek to lessen the risks by buying other casinos. Even so, Crockfords is hardly one for widows and orphans. Indeed, it might not even be for the married and contented. TV-am's more cautious shareholders should cash in their meagre chips before the game begins.</p>

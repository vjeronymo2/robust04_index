			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 28 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government has expressed concern to the United States about an  atmosphere being fostered to give the impression that "tension  is building up on the Korean peninsula," a senior Foreign  Ministry official said on Friday. The official said the  worrisome air is being fed by the recent wholesale report by the  American press of a U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles in  Korea, the dispatch of a U.S. intelligence support team to  Korea and the introduction of Apache helicopters by the U.S.  forces in Korea.    "The government has expressed to the United States the wish  that U.S. military authorities will restrain themselves from  leaking such information," he said.    The official said the deployment of Patriot missiles was  first requested by the commander of the U.S. forces in Korea to  President Bill Clinton toward the end of last year as part of  steps to beef up his command's conventional strength.    "Presently it is in the stage of being affirmatively  reviewed  and it would take several months before they are actually  operationally deployed," the official said. He added that the  introduction of Patriots missile will have no effect on the  North Korean nuclear issues.    As for Apache helicopters, the official said the issue is by  no means anything new. "Their introduction was decided on in  the late 1980s," he said.    Regarding the intelligence support team, the official said  it  is true that the U.S.'s DIA has sent a state intelligence  support team of five to six men to Seoul. But, he said, their  tour is a routine mission designed to see if  intelligence-gathering programs are going on alright.    "Their stay here does not mean that the U.S. intelligence  team here has been reinforced," said the official. "They will  leave Korea before long."</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Mehta probe fears hit Indian shares: Inspectors freeze dealing in leading stocks INDIAN shares fell sharply yesterday following news that income tax inspectors had frozen dealings in large blocks of leading stocks as part of an investigation into the affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of last year's Bombay financial scandal. Even though the Bombay Stock Exchange urged investors to stay calm, the index of 30 leading shares fell 42.86 points to 2,621.20 amid concern that the inspectors' order could prevent trading in certain stocks for an indefinite period. The exchange said in a statement that the inspectors' freeze applied only to specified blocks of shares in nine stocks and not to all trading in these stocks. Last night it said the total value of the shares was some Rs1.5bn (Pounds 31.7m). The inspectors' action has undermined the recent optimism in the market inspired by evidence of foreign financial institutions buying large amounts of Indian shares for the first time. The inspectors' orders apply to shares held by 134 companies and individuals connected to Mr Jagdish Narayan Bhatt, a Bombay stockbroker who dealt on behalf of Mr Mehta. The stocks in question are all large Indian companies. They include Reliance Industries, the chemicals and textiles group, Great Eastern Shipping, the transport company, and ITC, the tobacco and hotels group which is part owned by BAT of the UK. The income tax inspectors' investigation began last year after Mr Mehta was arrested for his alleged involvement in the Rs42bn scandal which rocked the Bombay securities market last year. Mr Mehta and others were accused of trading illegally in the interbank securities market in order to siphon funds into the stock market. While the Criminal Board of Investigation probed the accusations of illegal trading, the income tax authorities began to examine possible infringements of income tax law by Mr Mehta. The tax investigation culminated in yesterday's announcement. Mr Mehta, who denies all wrongdoing, is fighting his case hard. Earlier this year he claimed he had presented Mr P V Narashima Rao, the prime minister, with a suitcase full of cash. The statement rocked political circles and led to a no-confidence debate in parliament. Mr Narashima Rao won the vote but has not been able to dispel fully the damage done by Mr Mehta's claim. Punjab National Bank, one of the largest and most prosperous of India's state-owned banks, has taken over New Bank of India, a lossmaking state bank. The long-awaited move, first mooted by the Finance Ministry in 1990, was seen by officials as the only way of saving the New Bank of India from collapse. But the takeover was held up by disputes over the relative seniority of staff at the two banks. New Bank of India lost Rs754m in the year to March, and the Punjab National Bank made a net profit of Rs380m.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Venezuelan reform pledge VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez, speaking from a palace still scarred by a recent coup attempt, said the country's political woes would not turn him into a lame duck in his last months in office and he expected Congress to approve all pending economic reforms, Reuter reports from Caracas. The president said on Tuesday that tax bills critical to attacking a growing budget deficit in this oil-rich nation were likely to be approved this month and other reformist legislation would be passed before December general elections. Mr Perez, 70, who cannot by law seek re-election, acknowledged that he has felt isolated for scrapping popular subsidies and introducing austerity policies, but he said he was undeterred even by two attempts by rebel troops to topple him last year.</p>

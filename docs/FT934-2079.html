			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taiwan surges 3.5 per cent to 21-month high Small-lot technical trading dominated activity as investors focused on political developments, and the Nikkei average closed lower for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-share index lost 18.60 at 17,308.73 after moving within a narrow range of 17,415.74 and 17,263.43. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 11.13 to 1,451.01. Volume was 200m shares, down from 221m. Declines outscored rises by 565 to 391, with 199 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.56 to 1,190.45. With the government's decision over rice out of the way, there was a perceived need for the Japanese prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, to extend the current parliamentary session to allow for the passage of the political reform bill. Investors are cautious over threats by Liberal Democrats, the leading opposition party, to oppose such a proposal. If the government and the LDP cannot come to an agreement, the decision will be left to Ms Takako Doi, speaker of the lower house. Concern over whether the supplementary budget bills for the current fiscal year will pass through parliament by Wednesday, the last day of the current session, also weighed on yesterday's trading. The government's official acceptance of a compromise deal to open Japan's rice market spurred buying in related stocks. Kamugumi, a port transporter, gained Y10 at Y1,160 and Mitsubishi Warehouse and Transportation rose Y40 to Y1,480. Skylark, a restaurant chain, surged Y240 to Y2,280 on rumours that a leading Japanese broker was promoting the stock; it posted the largest percentage rise of the day. Foreigners sold bank shares, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank declining Y50 to Y1,850. Profit-taking hit high-technology issues, which gained ground on Monday, while heavy electricals were also lower, with Hitachi down Y25 to Y815. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone firmed Y1,000 to Y736,000 while East Japan Railway fell Y5,000 to Y417,000. A rise in gold bullion prices in overseas markets supported mining shares, with Sumitomo Metal Mining climbing Y26 to Y800 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting adding Y12 at Y370. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 121.55 to 19,201.24 in volume of 29.6m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, advanced Y210 to Y7,100 on bargain hunting. Roundup Hong Kong took a tumble after the recent bull run, but further records were set elsewhere in the Pacific Rim. Bombay was closed as brokers boycotted business to protest at Monday's ban on carry forward deals announced by the authorities in a bid to restrain the sharply advancing market. TAIWAN surged ahead 3.5 per cent to a 21-month high in turnover that rose to its heaviest level since April 1991. The weighted index added 173.15 at 5,102.96 in turnover that expanded to TDollars 104.9bn from Monday's TDollars 93.87bn. The bullish sentiment was helped by media reports quoting Finance Minister Lin Chen-kuo as saying the ministry's proposal to reimpose a stock capital gains tax, expected by the end of this month, would not have a big impact on the market. The banking sector jumped 6.7 per cent as several brokers noted strong foreign buying, especially in insurance issues. MANILA ended at its high for the year, spurred by a rise in bullion prices. The market index peaked at an intraday 2,618.95 before profit-taking left it finishing 4.28 up on balance at 2,583.49. KARACHI closed at a record peak for a second consecutive day, the KSE 100-share index jumping 36.98 to 1,909.60. HONG KONG retreated 2.2 per cent as profits were taken, but sporadic bargain hunting helped the Hang Seng index pick up from the day's low of 9,992.39 to close 227.11 down at 10,021.48. SINGAPORE encountered a wave of buying towards the end of the trading day that helped to push the Straits Times Industrial index up 7.04 to its fourth closing high in a row of 2,252.31. AUSTRALIA paused after the recent strong rally and the All Ordinaries index ended 7.9 easier at 2,086.6. Wall Street's overnight performance and a rise in metal prices gave the market some impetus in early trade, but it petered out after a sharp reversal in futures trading and a lack of buyer interest. SEOUL overcame early consolidation as blue chip manufacturing shares rallied. The composite stock index finished 7.17 higher at 857.20. KUALA LUMPUR was mostly lower on profit-taking but strong gains in some component stocks pushed the key Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange composite index up 2.31 points to a new closing peak of 1,092.66. BANGKOK encountered profit-taking that left the SET index 2.18 lower at 1,482.99 in robust turnover of Bt23.59bn. NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 capital index weakened 18.58 to 2,087.54.</p>

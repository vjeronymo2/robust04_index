			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Valentin </F> Karabashev by Svetlana Krusteva; place and date not given:  "Government Should Work Much More as a Team"]    [Excerpts] [Krusteva] Mr. Karabashev, when interviewed in  the hospital, Professor Berov explained that he had appointed  Matinchev as his successor because during that period you had  foreign trips planned. What changes would you make to the  present government if you were able to?    [Karabashev] In principle, especially at the present  juncture, a government should be much more of a team. I would  increase the degree of team work. Team spirit is enhanced when  the views of the individual ministers on the main issues are  closely similar. Naturally, arguments must occur from time to  time, but nonetheless as far as economic policy is concerned,  ministers should not have radically opposed views. A cabinet is  not a parliament, it is a government that has to work as a team.    [Krusteva] Journalists have stated that the most important  recent piece of news was Dr. Zhelev's statement in which he  withdrew his confidence in the government. The president  motivated this decision by leveling accusations against the  cabinet. Which of his charges do you accept and which do you  not?    [Karabashev] I would prefer not to analyze what the  president said. As a citizen of the country and as president,  he is fully entitled to make his own assessment of the  government's work. It is another matter whether his confidence  or lack of confidence has ethical or political grounds, but his  statement has no particular importance as far as it concerns the  cabinet's future, which depends solely on parliament.    I believe that the president was largely incorrect on  privatization. In fact, Ms. Indzhova has invested and is  investing great efforts in speeding up the privatization  process. I am trying to help her within my powers, because she  is in fact the one who under the law is able to implement the  privatization. The numerous attacks against me claiming that  this process is not proceeding fast enough show that these  critics have not read the Privatization Act.    As deputy prime minister, I have no direct functions  concerning privatization, I cannot make any decisions, nor can I  carry them out. This is the task of the individual ministers  and, first and foremost, the Privatization Agency. As minister  of trade, I think that I am fulfilling my functions. Mine is  the only ministry that fulfilled its privatization program in  1993, and it will fulfill it in 1994 as well. [passage omitted]    [Krusteva] Your party's leader, Prof. Nikolay Vasilev, has  stated that you are the only member of the cabinet who is trying  to carry through the privatization. Who is stopping you from  doing this?    [Karabashev] Krustyu Petkov asked me the same question. I  have mentioned before the factors that are hindering me,  including personal ones. Now I would like to give a very  concrete example, something that I have not done until now, and  which I am telling your newspaper for the first time. You  probably recall the big arguments about the "Karabashev" and  "Berov" privatization models during the summer of 1993, more  than eight months ago. If the so-called "Karabashev" model had  been adopted, the situation would be very different now. My  project provided for a specific number of enterprises to be  included in investment funds of holdings before the changes, and  a dispute arose about the name. The management of these  holdings was to be placed on a financial and economic basis, to  make them much more independent of the state. After the first  results of the activities of the holding companies had been  reported -- which would be now, in April 1994, by passing the  law one could then go ahead with privatizing these funds or  holding companies. However, this was not done. Instead, we  adopted a compromise version, and now, even if the Privatization  Act is amended, this program, which will take a long time to  complete, will be launched only as of now.

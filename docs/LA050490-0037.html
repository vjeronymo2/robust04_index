			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> ENSEMBLE PLAYS WORKS BY FACULTY COMPOSERS  </P> <P> There are lots of university composers writing lots of music, some of it very  good. But much of the music exhibits a kind of sonic anemia, the symptoms of  which include dullness of rhythm, textural sameness and a marked avoidance of  drama.  </P> <P> There were at least three case studies of the malady on display Wednesday at  Cal State Northridge, the site of a faculty composers recital.  </P> <P> Hardly affected by the syndrome, however, was Daniel Kessner's Chamber Concerto  No. 4. There wasn't much melodic activity of interest, but a good deal of  rhythmic, timbral and above all textural variety, and Kessner's sense of  proportion proved unusually keen. Under the baton of the composer, seven  members of the CSN New Music Ensemble gave a surprisingly ragged performance.  </P> <P> Severely smitten with academic tediosis was William Toutant's "Small Suite for  Piano." With its ceaseless motoric rhythm and lack of melodic direction, the  work imparted no sense of purpose, Kary Kramer's attentive reading  notwithstanding.  </P> <P> Frank Campo's Concerto for Piano With Winds and Percussion displayed more  textural and timbral variety, but one grew tired of the same old brass barks  and tone clusters repeated again and again. Francoise Regnat brought energy and  virtuosity to the solo part, and members of the CSN Wind Ensemble, conducted by  Kessner, played serviceably.  </P> <P> One could find rhythmic interest in Aurelio de la Vega's "Magias e  Invenciones," a setting of five poems by Gaston Baquero -- but only in the  piano part (superbly played by Delores Stevens). The vocal part, delivered  without much poetic insight by soprano Anne Marie Ketchum, consisted of a  series of slow, disjunct and rather amorphous melodic lines. TERRY McQUILKIN  </P></p>

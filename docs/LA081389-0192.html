			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors on Wednesday will decide whether to narrow the  list of possible sites for a new landfill in northern Orange County to three.  County officials have spent more than a year looking at more than half a dozen  potential sites, and county staff is recommending that the choices be narrowed  to three: Olinda-Alpha Canyon, Gypsum Canyon and West Fremont Canyon. If the  recommendation is adopted, county officials will begin a new round of  environmental impact reports on each of those sites with a selection of a new  landfill sometime early next year.  </P></p>

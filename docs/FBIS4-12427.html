			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Pending the signing of the one-year stand-by  agreement with the IMF, the financial and monetary authorities  have announced that the value of the national currency, the  dinar, will be devalued as from today by 40.17 percent.  Accordingly, $1 will be equivalent to 36 dinars, compared to 25  dinars in the past.    The loan and monetary council has also announced a tangible  increase in interests on loans. These corrective measures come  to confront the current economic stagnation and to ensure  boosting the economic mechanism in the future. [passage omitted]</p>

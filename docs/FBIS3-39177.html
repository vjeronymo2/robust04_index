And it should bring them to their senses, to avoid the  destruction and slaughter of the powderkeg Balkans, which will  lead to a tragic stalemate.    Intervention in a civil war in the form of an air raid or  any  other force is irrational and leads nowhere. In a civil war,  you cannot point to the aggressor. A civil war is mutual  slaughter without mercy.    The air raid opens dangerous roads and, leads to the extreme  and the almost certain engagement of other forces.    The engagement of other forces is not impossible, as there  is  only one superpower and also other powers with incredible arms  reserves, even though they may be economically weak.    The threat of the "fatal mistake" is palpable. The "fatal  mistake" of the anachronistic thinking of colonial  interventions, which also helps the military industry, prevails.    The international community today cannot withstand the  dramatic cost of the "fatal mistake." In terms of human lives  and irreversible damage, the cost would be huge.    Humanity has learned the irrationality and consequences of  civil war in Vietnam and recently in Somalia, where the  "peaceful initiative" with military means did not bring any  result.    The countdown in the threat for the "big evil" has begun. At  the same time, all efforts for an agreement should "run"  together, so that in the Balkans we do not have another Vietnam,  prolonged bloodshed.</p>

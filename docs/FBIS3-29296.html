The letter dated February 12 says the seminar expressed full  support for and sympathy with the teachings of Comrade Kim  Chong-il that it is the basic way for achieving independent  development in developing countries to oppose neo-colonialism,  establish a fair international order which embodies democratic  principles, adopt a political mode suitable for the reality of  one's own country and strengthen the internal political forces.    It notes that the participants in the seminar are convinced  that only when the outstanding idea and theory on the  independent development and cooperation of the people expounded  by Comrade Kim Chong-il are applied to the reality, is it  possible to achieve the complete economic liberation of the  country and steadfastly defend its political sovereignty.    It points out that they confirmed the truth of the chuche  idea that to form independent internal forces and enhance their  role in every country by uniting the people closely around the  leader and the leading organization is vital to defending  independence, the life and soul of the country, and shaping the  destiny of the popular masses.    It says they have been greatly inspired by the wise guidance  of Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is leading the people to  convincingly advance along the road of socialism chosen by  themselves and by the struggle of the Korean people, who are  steadfastly defending the sovereignty of the country, closely  united around the leader.    The letter wholeheartedly wishes Comrade Kim Chong-il good  health and long life.</p>

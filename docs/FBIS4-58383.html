			<p>BFN     [Text] Sindh Chief Minister Syed Abdullah Shah has said  that the government is committed to eliminating all sorts of  terrorism and violence from the country's politics and to bring  about normalcy in the province. In a broadcast over the radio  and television a short while ago, he referred to the violence  carried out in Karachi and Hyderabad which is masterminded by of  the Muhajir Qaumi Movement [MQM] and said that it exposed their  nefarious designs. They want to see Pakistan economically weak.  The chief minister said that these people, at the behest of  their foreign masters, want to divide not only Sindh but the  country, too. The Sindh chief minister said that the MQM  extremists are demanding the withdrawal of cases against its  chief Altaf Hussain which had been filed by their allies  themselves during the rule of the previous government. He asked  why Altaf Hussain should fear facing the court and demand the  withdrawal of the cases. He said that these elements through  their violent activities are harming their own brethren and  damaging national properties. The chief minister said that  although there is no substitute to precious human lives,  however, the government will pay compensation to families of  those killed in these incidents. Similarly, he told the people  whose vehicles were burned during the incident to submit their  applications.</p>

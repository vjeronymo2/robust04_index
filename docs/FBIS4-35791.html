			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The brother leader of the revolution [Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi] and President Idriss Deby of Chad this morning  attended the opening session of the Arab Libyan-Chadian talks to  boost and promote bilateral relations. [passage omitted]    The brother leader of the revolution made an address in  which  he said:    [Begin Al-Qadhdhafi recording] In the name of God. We  welcome our dear brother President Idriss Deby, and the  high-level delegation accompanying him. We thank him for paying  this visit. They are at home, among their brethren. Their visit  at this time is considered as standing on the side of their  brother the Libyan people in this confrontation [as heard], and  their presence among us lifts the morale of their Libyan  brothers. We are meeting now that all the problems that were  pending between the two countries are finished. This was  realized with the victory of fraternal will. The Libyan people  sacrified a great deal in order to help their brother the  Chadian people in a long battle in which victory was won by the  Chadian people, a victory which is also considered as a victory  of the Libyan people at this hour. Now we can cooperate hand in  hand for construction and edification, and in order to  consolidate brotherhood between the two fraternal peoples. In  fact, the Libyan people and the Chadian people are of the same  origin. [passage omitted]    We are happy with this meeting today, and in accordance with  our common wish we are founding the basis for a joint strategic  action for the good of the two peoples. The two countries have  considerable potentials which, if integrated and exploited in a  common program, will greatly benefit the two peoples. Those who  consider Chad as being poor are mistaken. Chad has a basic  capital: It is rich in raw materials, most important of which is  water. Libya has known potentials, and each country needs the  other. Each country has its own important possibilities. With  fraternal spirit and revolutionary will we can integrate these  resources and exploit them for the good of the two peoples.  [passage omitted] [end recording]    President Idriss Deby then made a speech in which he said:    [Begin Deby recording, in French, followed by Arabic  translation; translated from the French] Brother leader of the  Libyan revolution; on behalf of the delegation accompanying me I  thank you very sincerely, yourself and your government, for the  very warm and fratern welcome accorded us. On the same  occasion, and as I said yesterday during our meeting, I have  come here at the head of a very important delegation consisting  of members of the government, the pariament and political  parties in order to salute the courage of the leader of the  Libyan revolution, the Libyan people and its goverment for  having done their utmost in resolving the problem which for more  than two decades constituted a major handicap in our relations.  [passage omitted] We can say that a new era of cooperation  opens today between our two peoples. You mentioned that the  Libyan people shed its blood for the Chadian people and the  Chadian people shed its blood for the Libyan people. They are  two peoples that have many things in common, and the time has  come for us to make of our space a space of fruitful  cooperation, a space for peace, a space for development for the  benefit of our two peoples, who have much in common, as I said.    Brother leader of the revolution; your role and that of  Libya  in the development of Chad is very important. We consider that  your brothers in Chad, in this precise framework, need unlimited  support to enable them to resolve their problems and the  difficulties they often face. We believe that this visit is a  first of its kind, which in our view will permit the laying down  of the foundation stone of peace, friendships and cooperation.  This will also enable commissions to meet to examine all the  possibilities of cooperation between our two countries, without  limits.    Brother leader of the Libyan revolution; be assured that the  Chadian people support the Libyan people in their difficulties,  in their problems. The Libyan people will not betray this  position of principle, a global, African and Arab position of  principle. Thank you. [end recording]</p>

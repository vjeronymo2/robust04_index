			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fidelity launches third investment trust Fidelity is to launch its third investment trust, a UK special situations fund to be run in parallel with the group's existing special situation unit trust. Fidelity Special Values will be managed by a team led by Mr Anthony Bolton, the respected manager who has been responsible for the special situations unit trust since its launch in 1979. It ranks second of 54 funds in the UK equity growth sector over 10 years, and fourth of 130 over three years, but 54th of 116 over five years (source: Micropal). The investment strategy for both funds is based on a contrarian approach, concentrating on individual companies rather than economic factors. Fidelity's team of UK analysts looks for companies with recovery or growth potential not fully priced into the shares, under-researched and undervalued companies, takeover candidates, restructurings and so on. The fund will be at least 80 per cent invested in the UK, with small amounts elsewhere in Europe and the US. Fidelity has a programme of launching investment trusts based on its most successful unit trusts, to broaden the appeal of its range to investors. The new trust will be launched with a placing and public offer, due to open on October 19. Ordinary shares at 100p will have warrants attached in a one-to-five ratio, and the trust will be geared by the issue of equity index-linked loan stock, up to the value of 25 per cent of the net proceeds of the share issue.</p>

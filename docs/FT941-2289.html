			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Consumer confidence sinks to four-year low Consumer confidence con-tinues to decline as April's tax rises approach and is at a four-year low, according to a new poll. Gallup found in its March survey of consumer confidence that 42 per cent of people think that their household's financial position will deteriorate in the next 12 months and only 17 per cent think it will improve. The balance of pessimists over optimists has risen for two successive months and is at its worst level since April 1990. Consumers have also become more pessimistic about the prospects for the economy in general. While 23 per cent of people think that the economic situation will improve in the next 12 months, 40 per cent of people say that it will deteriorate. The negative balance of 17 per cent is the worst since February last year. People are increasingly concerned about unemployment. The balance of people expecting a rise in the number of jobless in the next 12 months against those expecting a decline is 44 per cent, up from 33 per cent in February. The survey shows more people are thinking of postponing their spending. Gallup reports that a balance of only 9 per cent of people say that there is an advantage in making an important purchase now, down from 11 per cent last month. Gallup says the survey's findings suggest 'that many people are expecting to be worse off when the new tax year begins, and this obviously has serious implications for the strength of economic recovery'. The report says that next month's survey may show more confidence in the recovery since February's fall in unemployment was announced too late in March to influence people's feelings for this month's poll. The survey of 2,029 people was conducted by Gallup for the European Commission between March 3 and March 15.</p>

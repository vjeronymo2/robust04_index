			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Saatchi predicts gloomy outlook THE WORLD advertising industry can expect only the faintest of upturns this year, Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, said yesterday as he unveiled a dismal set of results for the advertising and marketing services group. Worldwide revenues were likely to rise by only 1 per cent at best. But in the US, where Saatchi generates about half its turnover, a further decline of some 3 per cent in real terms was expected. With group revenues showing no improvement this year, Mr Louis-Dreyfus was planning more cost cuts - the prime target being the wage bill. The group's 12,900 employees earned an average Pounds 23,255 each last year. Some 300 executives were earning more than Pounds 150,000 a year. They were about to be asked to forgo large fixed salaries for the promise of considerably more through performance bonuses when - or if - the fat days return. Moreover, the group still had to hand out some Pounds 30m of earn-out payments over the next three years, only Pounds 5m of that in shares. The City remained cautious about Saatchi's prospects after yesterday's news of a Pounds 63.6m loss after exceptional items for the 15 months ended December. Mr Louis-Dreyfus said that estimates of pre-tax profits of Pounds 18m in 1992 'were not unreasonable'. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits rising to some Pounds 43m in 1993 and about Pounds 70m in 1994. The only immediate blip on the horizon is the probable loss of the Dollars 30m Rover account.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tax relief for 60 percent of the country's economic  activities will be cancelled in the second five-year economic  development plan.    According to Economics and Finance Minister Morteza  Mohammad-Khan the above mentioned activities currently include  water, electricity, gas, communications, oil, and other sectors  currently tax exempt. All such tax exemptions are to be scrapped  according to the second development plan.    Mohammad-Khan stated that oil revenue constitutes the  country's highest source of income. He said: Tax incomes are  very low in comparison; during the past five years the country's  economy has moved from a disorderly and irregular situation to a  disciplined, steady, and structured economy.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Blair's vision targets consumers Mr Tony Blair yesterday held out a vision of Labour as the party of national renewal in his personal manifesto for the contest to succeed John Smith. The 20-page manifesto promises a modernised Labour party committed to consumer rights in a market economy, shunning interventionism, nationalisation and economic isolationism. There are few specific policy commitments in the paper, which was accompanied by a four-page colour brochure aimed at the 4.3m voters in Labour's leadership election. The social democratic language of the manifesto does open up a clear ideological gap between Mr Blair and the two traditional socialist candidates - Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting leader, and Mr John Prescott, employment spokesman. Mr Blair said he was seeking to modernise Labour's traditional values, rather than abandon them. Supporters of the two leftwing candidates said he was scrapping the party's basic prin-ciples. The manifesto says that the market economy is in the public interest, and indicates that a Blair government would limit intervention to 'developing and guiding' industry in areas such as technological innovation and research and development. 'The difference between this approach and the perception of Labour policy in the past, is that the purpose of economic intervention is not so that government can run industry, but that it should work with it,' it says. 'Government must concentrate on what only it can do, and do it well.' The manifesto explicitly rules out 'trying to pick winners or run industry' and promises 'macroeconomic stability through sensible demand management and international co-operation, not the policies of boom and bust or economic isolation'. Much of the manifesto is concerned with ways of helping people to cope with economic and industrial change by strengthening community values and balancing individual rights with responsibilities. It focuses on ways of increasing individual opportunity through community action, and promises 'social solidarity' to replace the 'insecurity and uncertainty' of Tory Britain. The manifesto endorses Labour's policies on progressive taxation, devolution, education and training, parliamentary and local government reform, crime prevention, minimum wages and the European Union, including lukewarm support for a single currency. It also promises to use the tax and benefits system to reduce the poverty trap and return the welfare state to its 'original aims' of 'providing opportunity for people to escape poverty, not creating a dependent group of people in poverty'. The manifesto is strongly consumer-orientated, reflecting Mr Blair's conviction that Labour can win the next general election by appealing to a wide range of people disillusioned by economic decline and social disarray. It even risks a clash with the public-sector unions by promising to rebuild public services 'free from vested interests of any sort'. Mr Blair, the shadow home secretary, is the runaway leader in the leadership contest, which will be decided on July 21. Mrs Beckett is expected to issue her manifesto next week.</p>

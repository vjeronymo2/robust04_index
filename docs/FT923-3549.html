			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Observer: Open debate The cabinet mole didn't say whether ministers expressed any views on Sir Anthony Jacobs's interesting pump-priming proposal to give tax relief on all personal sector borrowing. But provided they've been able to tear their eyes away from the tabloids, they can hardly have missed his ads in the serious press. Sir Anthony, who sold his British School of Motoring for Pounds 40m a couple of years ago, spent Pounds 25,000 on 'An Open Letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer'. Sir Anthony is not an economist or a crank. He is a chartered accountant who used to be a big wheel in the Liberal party and was once an adviser to John Pardoe. However, he stresses that his ideas were not vetted by any political party. They may be daft, but they are his own and he is not representing any vested interests. But why waste money on an advert? Sir Anthony never has much difficulty getting to see ministers. 'They don't skimp you with their time, you can normally get an hour, ' he says. But the problem is the civil servants. 'They don't like radical ideas and as soon as you leave they spend their time demolishing them,' says Sir Anthony who was concerned his idea wouldn't see the light of day. So he has decided to go public with his views. 'I've never done anything like this before, and will probably not do again,' says Sir Anthony. Good luck to him.</p>

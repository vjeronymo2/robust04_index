			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar's tax heaven A tie-up between Trafalgar House and Northern Electric would be a marriage made in financial heaven. The strategic fit might be questionable, but the tax savings would be very real, far outweighing the Pounds 26m windfall pay-out to Northern's consumers if Trafalgar succeeded. Trafalgar holds substantial capital gains losses, after two terrible years. These would off-set capital gains from the demerger of Northern's National Grid stake, saving at least Pounds 50m in tax. The bidder has a further Pounds 223m of unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax to be used against electricity profits, and there are trading tax losses on top. The financial logic should dissolve shareholder concern over the logic of moving into electricity distribution, about which Trafalgar knows little. Trafalgar's strategy of building stable earnings to fund infrastructure projects may not appeal to shareholders who had invested in a cyclical engineering and construction company, but Northern's share price, 30p below the cash offer, suggests little expectation of a bidding war. Delay through a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission seems more likely, but it is hard to imagine the grounds on which the bid could be blocked. The current discount to the offer price may instead reflect the fact that Trafalgar appears to have offered a full price. Only last week, political concerns were hounding the sector, and the likelihood of Labour government can hardly be said to have receded at Dudley West. Taxation notwithstanding, Trafalgar's non-Hong Kong investors may make it hard for the company to pay more.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed "tl": "CDU Is Opposed to a Solidarity </F> Surcharge for a Limited Period of Time"]    [Text] Bonn -- Differences between the CDU [Christian  Democratic Union] and the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany] are playing an increasing part in the 1994 elections.  While CDU General Secretary Peter Hintze explained that Germany  was well on its way to coming out of the recession following a  CDU Presidium meeting, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping only talked  of a "slight economic recovery."    Nevertheless, speaking in Mainz yesterday, the SPD candidate  for chancellor said that the number of unemployed will increase  in 1994. If it takes over the government, the SPD wants more  money for the creation of jobs and for unification.    By contrast, Hintze felt that what he has been saying has  been confirmed, because the coalition had always rejected the  SPD's expenditure program and has thus practiced a "policy based  on a lot of staying power." In contrast to the Social  Democrats, Hintze said, the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] and  the FDP [Free Democratic Party] had placed Germany's future as a  center for industry and the competitiveness of the German  economy at the center of their policies. They would place more  emphasis on what has been achieved in maintaining a stable  currency.    According to Hintze, the CDU Presidium has come out against  reviewing the solidarity surcharge in three years' time as the  FDP has called for. The general secretary said that the CDU was  not now prepared to set a fixed period of time over which the  surcharge would be levied.    Yesterday, the SPD Bundestag Group's spokesman on  environmental matters, Michael Mueller welcomed "the greater  emphasis on ecology" in the Social Democrats' government  program. The Government Program Commission and the SPD  Presidium had previously agreed on improvements. Thus, the  program will include a much clearer stance in support for  "ecology taxes" and give precise form to a new course on energy,  said Mueller. The section dealing with energy policy envisages  a new law on energy. The entire preamble of the present draft  has been dropped and will be replaced by personal introduction  by Chairman Scharping, which will be presented to delegates to  the SPD party conference in Halle on 22 June.    Although the SPD's plan does not mention a specific speed  limit, in view of the general pattern in Europe, the Social  Democrats are considering a limit of 130 km per hour. The  improvements to the environmental section of the government  program have nothing at all to do with a "U-turn," explained  Mueller. He said it was a good thing that Scharping had taken  up suggestions from within the party.    That is evidently not enough for some Social Democrats.  Yesterday, the chairman of the SPD Bundestag Group, Hans-Ulrich  Klose, called for a more detailed section on the environment.  "The program is not good enough in this respect," he said in  Bonn. It requires a more concrete form and a precise  description of ecological taxation reform and its implementation.    SPD General Secretary Guenther Verheugen announced that  employment would remain the key element in the election campaign  debate, but the second lime of attack would focus on public  finance. The SPD would actually fulfill the present government's  promise of "a solid and consistent fiscal policy."</p>

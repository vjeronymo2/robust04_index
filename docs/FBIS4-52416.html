			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Anachronistic Jargon"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The new justice minister  of the Japanese Government, Shigeto Nagano, contended that "it  is wrong to say the Pacific War was a war of aggression" and the  purpose of the war lay in "liberating colonies and establishing  the greater East Asia coprosperity sphere."    Commenting on his remarks, NODONG SINMUN today brands this  as  a crude distortion of history and an intolerable insult to the  Asian peoples who underwent terrible misfortunes and sufferings  due to the aggression by the Japanese imperialists.    The analyst says:    Nagano's remarks represent the view of the Hata cabinet on  the war of aggression in the past and reveal the reactionary and  aggressive nature of the Japanese Government. And this tells us  that the Japanese Government has wholly taken over the mode of  thinking of the predecessors who started the war of aggression  in the past and it is standing on the extention line of the war  cabinet of imperialism of the bygone days ideologically and  mentally.    Openly crying for the institution of "A Law on the Case of  Emergency" almost everyday, the Hata cabinet is trying to easily  mobilize manpower and material resources in a war of aggression  by establishing "an emergency system" and a "wartime  mobilisation system".    By attempting to justify the past war of aggression as "a  war  of liberation" Nagano sought to establish an ideological and  political logic favorable for the policy of the militarists  staging a comeback to Asia.    His description of the past war of aggression as "a war of  justice" for "the greater East Asia coprosperity sphere"  discloses the wild design of the militarist reactionaries to  revive the old order of colonial domination in which Japan  behaved like the master in Asia.    It is a shame of the Japanese people that such a fellow as  Nagano is holding an important post in the Japanese cabinet.    If Japan again take the road of aggression and war, failing  to draw a lesson from its defeat in the past, it will suffer a  more miserable defeat.</p>

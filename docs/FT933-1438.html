			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Bankruptcies rise in Germany BANKRUPTCIES in western Germany increased by 26.9 per cent in the first half of the year, with more than 6,000 companies becoming insolvent, the Federal Statistics Office reported yesterday, Small and medium-sized enterprises unable to weather the domestic recession formed the bulk of bankruptcies. Only 108 bankruptcies led to creditors having claims of more than DM10m (Pounds 4m), and 1,179 bankruptcies led to claims of above DM1m. But the average bankruptcy size increased from the first half of 1992 as creditors' financial claims doubled to DM8.4bn for the first six months of this year. Bankruptcies in eastern Germany increased by 129 per cent for the period, with creditors' claims reaching DM2.2bn in the region. In western Germany, 40 per cent of bankruptcies were in manufacturing. The number of bankruptcies this year is likely to reach the high levels recorded in the mid-1980s, the Cologne-based Institute for the German Economy said. Bankruptcies in Germany peaked in 1985.</p>

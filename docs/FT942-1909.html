			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Pensions white paper to dilute reform advice The government is expected to release a white paper tomorrow on regulatory reform of the occupational pensions industry in Britain that will be a pale reflection of the reforms recommended by the government's advisers last autumn. In particular, the paper, which is intended as a blueprint for a bill in the next parliamentary session, contains a far more modest proposal for a new pensions regulator than that recommended by the Pension Law Review Committee. The committee, chaired by Mr Roy Goode, a professor of commercial law, urged establishment of a government-funded body which would monitor pension scheme solvency, investment activity and administration. It is expected that a scaled-down version will be proposed and that the government will urge professional advisers to each scheme to act as a kind of watchdog. Mr Nigel O'Sullivan, partner at actuarial consultants Bacon and Woodrow, said the failure to institute a tough regulator could raise the costs to the industry of a compensation scheme. The white paper is expected to propose a compensation scheme for losses caused by theft, fraud or malfeasance that would require other schemes to finance 90 per cent of the assets lost. Mr O'Sullivan said he had calculated that a Pounds 200m charge on the compensation scheme would cost a Pounds 50m pension scheme Pounds 40,000 in levies. A Pounds 1bn scheme would have to pay Pounds 800,000. 'This is a Pounds 500bn industry,' he said. 'If we can't afford to have somebody decent regulating it then I don't know what we are doing.' The white paper is also expected to back away from a requirement that all occupational schemes with more than 50 members be required to allow members to appoint at least one-third of the board of trustees. The paper will say this is regarded as best practice, but the government will not make it obligatory. Among other proposals, the report will urge adoption of a modified 'minimum solvency standard' requiring schemes for the first time to hold enough assets to pay at least 90 per cent of their retrospective pension obligations. But this standard is watered down from the Goode proposal that schemes calculate the 'cash equivalent' of buying each member's retroactive benefits. Calculations of cash equivalent values are tied to UK government gilts yields and the actuarial profession has suggested a compromise to allow higher equity yields to be taken into account when calculating the pensions of younger people. In other areas, the white paper is expected to recommend severing the link between benefits paid by the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme to those not in an employer's scheme and guaranteed minimum pensions which are paid to those who are. The white paper will propose that employers need no longer provide benefits equivalent to those available under Serps - and the government will no longer have to make up the shortfall for those which do not. In return, schemes will have to guarantee that pensions in payment are increased each year by 5 per cent or by the rise in retail prices, whichever is the lower. Guaranteed minimum pension, which accounts for up to 20 per cent of each employee's occupational pension, must currently be uprated each year by 7 per cent. But there is no government requirement that pensions in payment be increased in line with inflation.</p>

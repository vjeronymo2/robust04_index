			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / VW in deal to reduce work time Volkswagen and the IG Metall engineering union yesterday agreed a framework deal temporarily cutting working times in VW's six German works by 20 per cent, but gave strikingly different views on how it would affect wages and costs. Mr Jurgen Peters, chief union negotiator, said the annual incomes of around 100,000 workers would be reduced by 10 per cent, while Mr Jochen Schumm, representing VW, said the pact would cut total personnel costs by almost 20 per cent or DM1.8bn (Pounds 713m) a year. The draft pact, which still needs much detailed work before final approval, according to VW officials, will be presented to a meeting of the group's supervisory board in Wolfsburg this morning. Agreement was reached under the shadow of threats from VW that 30,000 of the company's 100,000-plus German jobs would have to go unless cost-savings could be reached through other means. The settlement on a basic 28.8 hour working week would apply 'in principle' to all 105,000 employees, a spokesman said last night. While trade union officials saw the deal as opening the way for widespread reductions in working hours - the union movement's favoured way of spreading work and preventing lay-offs - economists and industrialists were sceptical. Mr Thorsten Neufeld of the Deutsche Bank said the package would not lead to reductions in unit labour costs necessary to restore VW's competitiveness. Adam Opel, VW's main rival, said it was not an appropriate starting point for restructuring the car industry. Mr Ludwig Horatz, head of Hamburg components supplier Phoenix, said the deal had been made possible by VW's generous pay scales which, he claimed, were at least 20 per cent above the metal industry average. Audi, part of the VW group, where pay rates are already 10 per cent below those at the parent, said it was examining the idea. Volkswagen's project is widely seen as an emergency stop-gap measure to allow the deeply troubled company to avoid conflict with its labour force and its principle shareholder, the Social Democrat/Green party government of Lower Saxony. Already committed to bailing out its Spanish subsidiary Seat with a DM1.5bn emergency cash injection, VW would be hard-pressed to find the funds to finance 30,000 redundancies, according to critics of the scheme. Details so far available include withdrawal of a 3.5 per cent general pay increase, which took effect on November 1. Christmas bonuses, holiday payments and other perks are to be reduced and the balance will be distributed monthly instead of in one-off sums.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: United Biscuits snaps up snack maker for Pounds 24m DERWENT VALLEY Food, the northern England snacks maker whose rapid growth made it one of the entrepreneurial success stories of the Thatcher era, is to be sold to United Biscuits, Britain's largest biscuits and snacks manufacturer, for about Pounds 24m. Derwent Valley, founded 11 years ago in Consett, the former steel town in County Durham, is best known for its Phileas Fogg tortilla chips and other corn-based products. It pioneered the British market for adult premium snacks, worth about Pounds 70m a year and the fastest-growing sector of the snacks business. Mr Roger McKechnie, managing director, said the company wanted to step up its international expansion. After failing to find an industrial partner willing to help, it had decided last year to seek a buyer. The company had considered raising capital through a stock market flotation. It rejected the idea, however, because it feared that pressure from shareholders to maximise short-term returns would prevent it from making the large investments needed to develop the business. Derwent Valley, which has 350 employees, expects a Pounds 2m trading profit on sales of Pounds 24m in the year to March. Its existing management have agreed to continue, and Mr McKechnie will join the board of KP Foods, UB's snacks division. United Biscuits is paying Pounds 15m in cash and Pounds 9m in shares, and assuming about Pounds 3m of debt. The deal is conditional on clearance by the Office of Fair Trading. About two thirds of Derwent Valley's shares are owned by founders and directors and 27 per cent by 3i, the investment capital group which helped finance the company's formation. The rest of the shares are owned by staff. Mr McKechnie said that under United Biscuits' ownership, Derwent Valley would enjoy stronger financial backing and planned to expand distribution from 8,000 to about 50,000 UK retail outlets. Until now, relatively low volumes and a small sales force had made it difficult to extend distribution much beyond large supermarket chains. The companies hope in the next five years to double the sales of Derwent Valley and to turn Phileas Fogg into one of Britain's five best-selling snack brands. Derwent Valley has 2 per cent of total British snacks sales and about a third of the adult premium sector. KP, which had estimated sales last year of more than Pounds 530m, claims to be the leader of the UK snack market with a 36 per cent share by value but it has only 4 per cent of the adult products market. Derwent Valley's management will remain responsible for manufacturing the Phileas Fogg range in Britain. Mr McKechnie expects expanded production at the Consett plant to add at least 100 jobs. 'This is a good day for Consett,' he said yesterday. Consett was reeling from the closure of its British Steel plant when Derwent Valley was set up there in 1982 by Mr McKechnie, who had a background in the food industry, and colleagues. KP, which has operations in the US, continental Europe and Australia, plans to step up Phileas Fogg's sales effort outside Britain and may eventually make its products in factories abroad. Derwent Valley has annual exports of about Pounds 2m, to Australia, France, the Netherlands and Spain. Although it has tried for several years to expand international sales, particularly in Europe, it has been handicapped by lack of experience and limited distribution. The company has held talks with several other prospective bidders. They are believed to have included PepsiCo of the US, the world's largest snacks manufacturer, which owns the Smith's and Walker's brands in Britain, and Dalgety, owner of the Golden Wonder brand. Mr McKechnie said United Biscuits had been chosen because it offered 'the best fit in terms of clout, expertise and corporate culture'. He would not say if it also submitted the highest bid. Derwent Valley will remain an independent company within the KP group, and its management will continue to be responsible for UK operations. See Observer</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow reverses in line with bond market Wall Street FALLING BOND prices left leading US stocks lower yesterday, although a late rally kept losses to a minimum, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.55 at 3,640.63, well off its lows for the day. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.50 lower at 460.54. Smaller company stocks and secondary indices fared better. The Amex composite finished up 0.79 at 454.99, and the Nasdaq composite up 2.68 at 734.07. Trading volume on the NYSE was 196m shares. Equity prices have been following bond prices higher all summer, so the morning's declines in bonds had an immediate effect upon stocks when the markets opened. Amid considerable profit-taking, the benchmark 30-year government bond fell more than a point, pushing the yield back up towards 6.2 per cent. That decline sparked heavy selling of stocks, sending the Dow more than 20 points lower. Later, bond prices recovered somewhat and in late trading the 30-year bond was down at 101 17/32 , yielding 6.133 per cent. Equities initially failed to match the bond market's recovery, but staged a rally in the final hour-and-a-half of trading to end in more respectable territory. Analysts were not perturbed by yesterday's sell-off, noting that volume was relatively light throughout the day session. Optimists believed that the correction in prices could have set the stage for the Dow to assault 3,700. National Medical Enterprises lost Dollars 3 1/8 , or almost 30 per cent, to Dollars 8 in volume of 7m shares on news that more than 20 of the company's facilities were raided by FBI agents as part of a broad inquiry into alleged criminal misconduct by National Medical, which operates private hospitals. American Telephone&amp;Telegraph bucked the trend, climbing Dollars 2 to Dollars 62 3/4 in volume of 2.8m shares on hopes that talks between the telecommunications group and cable companies about creation of a multi-media communications network would bear fruit. Drug stocks were mixed. Merck rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 32 7/8 and Bristol-Myers Squibb gained Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 55 7/8 , but Pfizer gave up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 63 and Schering-Plough fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 59 7/8 . Nichols Institute, traded on the American Stock Exchange, fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 5 3/8 , and Unilab, traded on the Nasdaq market, fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 6, after being told to expect federal investigators to subpoena company documents as part of an investigation into possible Medicare fraud by medical testing laboratories. Canada TORONTO ended the week on a positive note, posting a solid gain in moderate trading. Based on preliminary figures, the TSE 300 composite index was up 17.80 points to 4,133.40, for a gain on the week of about 56 points. Advances led declines by 421 to 304 and volume fell to about 55m shares from Thursday's 57.6m. The best gains were posted by golds and industrials.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Study reveals larger PC market The world personal computer market is significantly larger than previously estimated, according to a new market study. The latest PC product announcements also point to rapid expansion in the consumer segment of the business. Computer Intelligence InfoCorp, a leading PC market research firm, now estimates that 43.8m PCs were shipped in 1993, an increase of 6.9m units over its previous estimates. CII's forecast for 1994 sales is 49.4m units, a rise of 7.5m. Small manufacturers, who typically build PCs to order, have been largely overlooked in prior estimates, CII said. 'The so-called clone-shops are the forgotten many and represent an important role in the distribution of PC systems. Our data show that the majority (59 per cent) of computer dealers and retail computer stores carry non-branded PCs,' said Mr Dan Ness, director of microsystems research at CII. Intel, the leading supplier of microprocessors to the PC industry, said the new CII numbers were a more accurate reflection of the overall size of the PC market. Another important PC market trend is the growth of consumer sales. About one-third of all PC sales in the US last year were to consumers or businesses with five or fewer employees, according to market researchers. This year, the consumer segment is expected to be closer to 50 per cent of all US PC sales. Digital Equipment yesterday became the latest PC manufacturer to focus on this high-growth segment, with the introduction of new models aimed at the US retail market. Taking an approach similar to that of market leaders Compaq, Packard Bell and IBM, Digital has developed PCs pre-loaded with software that enables buyers to set up the computer in 15 minutes or less. In a separate PC industry development that promises broader availability of software applications, IBM and Hughes Network Systems yesterday announced a partnership to deliver software to retailers and corporate customers via satellite transmission.</p>

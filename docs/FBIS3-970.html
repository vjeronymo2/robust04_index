			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Raul Domingos, head of the Mozambique </F> National Resistance delegation to the Supervision and Control  Commission, by Lourenco Jossias at Hotel Cardoso in Maputo; date  not given]    [Excerpts] [Jossias] You have just visited the United  States. Can you tell us what the objective was of your visit and  your itinerary?    [Domingos] My visit had two parts. The first part involved a  program organized by the U.S. Information Agency. Our group  included people from different nationalities. We visited  different institutions, such as the Senate's Center for  Strategic Affairs, the Carnegie Peace Institute. [passage  omitted]    [Jossias] And what was the second part of your program?    [Domingos] As an official of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], I took the opportunity to hold talks with  U.S. officials. As you are aware, we could not travel to the  United States during the war to make contacts in favor of Renamo.    Once I was in the United States, I could not lose the  opportunity to establish contacts that would be useful to my  party. Thus, I again returned to New York and Washington.    In New York, I held talks with a number of UN officials. The  highest contact I had was with James Jonah, UN assistant  secretary general for political affairs. In Washington, I had  contacts at the level of the State Department, and the highest  contact I had was with George Moose's assistant because Moose  was out of the country.    I held very important meetings with people in charge of  African affairs.    I was very fortunate in my contacts because they were held  at  a time when independent voices spoke well of the progress of the  Mozambican peace process and the troops' confinement.    People always thought it would not be possible to reach a  peace agreement with Renamo. They thought Renamo had no control  over its troops. One year has passed and our troops have not  carried out one unusual movement. We were able to show that we  can order an effective cease-fire, that we are able to confine  our men in a disciplined manner. We were able to demonstrate  that there is command within Renamo and this gave us a certain  credibility with the U.S. public and the State Department.    When all this information is received by the United States,  it gives us a certain credibility that we did not enjoy before.    I had the opportunity to speak to people who in the past  were  Renamo's critics, like Chester Crocker. It could not be  expected that he would receive someone from Renamo. Herman  Cohen, with whom I met on many occasions in Rome, was also very  amenable.    I was also fortunate because of other reasons: My visit to  the United States took place at a time when the Electoral Law  had already been approved, the electoral commissions and the  Elections Administration Technical Secretariat are already  functioning. There is significant progress in the troops'  confinement process, particularly considering that Renamo is  confining larger percentages of troops compared with the  government.    I also had contacts with the International Center for  Strategic Studies, the Republican Institute, and the National  Democratic Institute. They were all very positive meetings.    [Jossias] What was the reason for all these contacts?    [Domingos] Most of my meetings were aimed at briefing the  officials there about the present situation in Mozambique and to  prepare the visit of my president to the United States.    [Jossias] When is he visiting the United States?    [Domingos] Well, at first, we thought the visit would take  place in April, but we have now realized that that is not the  best time. First, there will be Easter celebrations during the  month of April and many people go on holidays. Second, in  April, there will be elections in South Africa which will  attract the attention of both the U.S. people and Mozambicans.  There is a very short period between Easter celebrations and  the elections. That is why we set President Dhlakama's visit to  the United States for May.    [Jossias] Does the choice of the date depend entirely on you  or does it also depend on the United States?    [Domingos] We made the last alterations together. First,  President Dhlakama will visit the United Nations at the  invitation of the UN general secretary. Then he is thinking of  going to Washington for contacts with the State Department.    [Jossias] Mr. Raul Domingos, do you think you have been able  to change the image that the United States had of Renamo, that  it was a terrorist movement?    [Domingos] Well, at least I, myself, was not received as a  terrorist. I cannot say that I was the one who changed the  situation because that cannot be done in a few days. A series  of actions that we have been carrying out contributed toward the  change of image.    The image that people had of Renamo in Washington, United  States, is no longer the image of Chester Crocker's Renamo and  the Gerson Report.    The image that Renamo had as a result of the Gerson Report  disappeared following my visit, the progress registered here  with the approval of the Electoral Law, the beginning of the  confinement process, and the behavior of our forces in assembly  areas. All this helped to change the image.    What I did in the United States was to give the true picture  of Renamo. I can therefore safely say that the present Renamo's  image is not the Gerson Report's image. It is the image of the  Rome Accord.    [Jossias] And what about the coincidence between your  departure for the United States and the publication of the U.S.  State Department report accusing Renamo of human rights  abuse...didn't it harm your visit?    [Domingos] Not at all. I was at the State Department, and I  told the officials there that the accusation was false. The  State Department lamented the report and also agreed that it was  not true. It said there are people who collect information and  write and the department has no authority over these people.  The department officials believe the report was exaggerated.    I believe that this is the work of forces hostile to Renamo  and perhaps it was not just a mere coincidence that the report  was published when I was leaving for the United States. All  the same, there were other credible news sources which at the  time said good things about Renamo. When I arrived in the  United States, the NEW YORK TIMES had just published a series of  positive information on Renamo. This established the necessary  balance, which enabled us to see that our image there was  positive.    [Jossias] Did you meet with Renamo representatives during  your visit to the United States?    [Domingos] Yes, I met with some members. As you are aware,  they do not live in the same city. Some of them had come here,  but they were very happy to see me there. As they said, it was  the first time that a Renamo leader from the bush in Maringue  had visited the United States. Only Renamo officials living in  Germany and Portugal had visited the United States. Thus, they  said I was bringing special warmth because I was coming inside  the country.    During my visit to the United States, I was able to  introduce  my colleagues there to officials in the State Department. It  was not an official introduction because of the formalities  involved. All the same, I took the opportunity to introduce  them as our men there and this gave them greater strength.    [Jossias] Did you meet with other Mozambicans, apart from  Renamo members?    [Domingos] I was unable to because of my working agenda.    [Jossias] What went wrong during your visit to the United  States?    [Domingos] Nothing really. If I had to make an assessment of  my visit, I would only think of one thing that was bad, the  weather. It was very cold there.</p>

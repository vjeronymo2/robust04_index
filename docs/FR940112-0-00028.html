			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the NPRM, the final changes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;404.1579(e)(2), 404.1594(e)(2), 416.994(b)(4)(ii) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 416.994a(g)(2) also explain that we will consider the factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in &sect;&sect;404.911 and 416.1411 for purposes of determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally whether an individual has good cause for failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperate in a review of his or her entitlement to benefits based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on disability. (Current &sect;&sect;404.911 and 416.1411 explain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors we consider in determining whether an individual has good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause for missing a deadline to request review of a determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or decision under our administrative review process. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained later in this preamble, we are amending &sect;&sect;404.911 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 416.1411, which apply to title II and title XVI cases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively, to provide explicitly for the consideration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitations described in section 10305 of OBRA 1989 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining whether an individual has good cause for missing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadline to request review.) We are also revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;404.1586(d) and 416.986(c) to clarify that we will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider the factors described in &sect;&sect;404.911 and 416.1411,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively, for purposes of determining generally whether an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual has good cause for failure to cooperate in a review of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> his or her continuing entitlement to title II benefits, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing eligibility for title XVI benefits, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blindness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Without Fault_Waiver of Adjustment or Recovery of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Overpayments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under sections 204(b) and 1631(b)(1)(B) of the Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery or adjustment of overpayments to a title II or title XVI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiary may be waived in situations where the individual is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without fault in connection with the overpayment and recovery or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment would defeat the purposes of the program or would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against equity and good conscience or, with respect to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title XVI program, would impede efficient or effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of title XVI because of the small amount involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our existing regulations explain that in determining whether an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual was without fault, all pertinent factors surrounding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the overpayment will be considered, including the individual's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> age, intelligence, education, and physical and mental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 10305(b) of OBRA 1989 amended section 204(b) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act to provide that the Secretary, in making determinations or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions of ``without fault'' for purposes of section 204(b), must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take into account any physical, mental, educational, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> English language) the individual has. In addition, the amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to section 1631(c)(1) of the Act made by section 10305(e) of OBRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989 provides that, for the purposes of the title XVI program,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary must take these same limitations into account in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining, among other things, whether an individual is without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fault.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are making the following changes in our regulations which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement sections 204(b) and 1631(b)(1)(B) of the Act to reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pertinent amendments made by section 10305.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Amend &sect;404.507 to provide that in making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations of without fault with respect to title II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overpayments, we will take into account any physical, mental,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility with the English language) the individual has.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

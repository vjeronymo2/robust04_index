Dalian Industrial Zone is the first project developed on a  large scale by Japanese enterprises in China as well as the  first project developed on a large scale with joint investment  by Dalian and even China. This zone is developed with the  investment jointly provided by China and Japan. A committee in  charge of the development of Dalian Industrial Zone has been  organized. This committee is composed of the managerial  committee for Dalian Development Zone which stands for the  Chinese side as well as 22 Japanese enterprises, including the  Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, Itochu, Matsushita, Maruko,  Kokyo Bank, and Tokyo Bank. The total investment in the  jointly-funded development and management limited company of  Dalian Industrial Zone is $65 million. The period for  management of this company is 15 years. The right to  utilization of 2.169 square kilometers of land for 50 years has  been purchased from the management committee of Dalian  Development Zone.    The construction of this zone started on October 19, 1992.  So far, the infrastructural facilities of this zone have been  completed. Simultaneously, 27 enterprises have formally been  approved to enter the zone. Of them, seven started construction  and two formally went into operation. A group of large  enterprises of world fame with high technological levels and  first-grade management levels, such as Shanwu [name as  transliterated], Huoniweier [name as transliterated], Fuji  Electronics and Machinery Company, Konica, Luomu [name as  transliterated], and Baoshazao [name transliterated], have  entered the zone in advance. The enterprises that will be  introduced to the zone this year are expected to use  approximately 60 percent of the total development areas. Some  80 to 100 enterprises will be introduced to this zone. The  total investment will surpass $600 million.    Li Tieling, member of the political bureau of the CPC  Central  Committee and state councillor, paid a special visit to Dalian  to attend the ceremony for the completion of the infrastructural  facilities. On behalf of the Chinese government, he extended  warm greetings to the achievements made through the cooperation  of China and Japan and expressed cordial regards to the  construction workers of both sides.

He hoped that  both the Chinese and Japanese sides would further make efforts  hand in hand, introduce high-quality projects, and make Dalian  Industrial Zone become an example in large-scale development  through Sino-foreign cooperation.    Present at the ceremony were personages of all circles in  Japan, including Niwaki Kentaro, vice minister in charge of  political affairs under the Ministry of Finance in Japan;  Xiaoyuan Yutian [name as transliterated], consul of Dalian  office under the Consulate General of Japan in Shenyang; and  Hayashi Akirahiko, director of the Overseas Economic Cooperation  Fund.

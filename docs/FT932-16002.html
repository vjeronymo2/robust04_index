			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Kazakhs move slowly to negotiate deals that will unlock their riches: An ex-Soviet republic with multi-billion dollar resources KAZAKHSTAN, with some of the world's richest oil, natural gas and mineral reserves, has a rosier economic outlook than most of its former Soviet compatriots. Unless it deliberately botches the job, the central Asian republic is destined to be rich. Kazakhstan and its western business partners are engaged in painstaking talks on two multi-billion-dollar oil and natural gas deals that are bound to trigger an economic boom. And the republic and foreign bankers are debating how, in a five- or six-year transition, to make the expansion sustained and broad. Until the negotiations and debate are resolved, Kazakhstan - starting from scratch in creating a market-oriented economy - will not have the hard cash it needs to begin turning around its struggling, inflationary economy. 'The Kazakhs are trying very hard to get it right,' said a western diplomat in the Kazakh capital of Alma Ata. 'They're not prepared to do deals where in 10 years they're left with nothing. Nor should they be. They hesitate a little, because they feel they don't have the expertise to deal with these very large, very clever western companies.' Since the Soviet Union broke up more than a year ago, Kazakhstan has attracted a lot of attention because of the Baikonur space centre, from which flights were launched, and the Semipalatinsk nuclear-weapons testing facility. These, plus its natural resources, nuclear arsenal and geographic position - sandwiched between Russia, China and the rest of central Asia - have given the republic of 17m people political status in and out of the Commonwealth of Independent States. In this role the Kazakh president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been a leading advocate of restoration of economic links among the ex-Soviet republics, and a moderate voice on nuclear issues. Kazakhstan's prospects are immediately hinged on two deals currently in negotiation. Chevron, the fourth largest US oil company, is bidding to develop the Tengiz oil field which, with at least 6bn-9bn barrels of recoverable reserves, is in the same league as Saudi Arabia's largest. The deal would pump an initial Dollars 1.5bn into the Kazakh economy over the next three years, and could be worth Dollars 20bn over 40 years. At the same time, British Gas and Italy's Agip are negotiating to develop the Karachaganak field, which contains 20,000bn cubic feet of natural gas, plus 2bn barrels of oil and condensate. This deal involves Dollars 6bn in investment in the first decade. Kazakhstan also possesses substantial chromium, gold, silver, zinc, lead and iron ore deposits. The republic mined 130m tonnes of coal in 1991, a quarter of the Soviet total, and last year exported 10m tonnes of wheat. The government is also starting to examine bids on a Dollars 100m deal to refurbish a huge cigarette factory in Alma Ata and revitalise Kazakhstan's tobacco crop. The bidding is among the same three companies warring across Europe - British-American Tobacco, RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris. Meanwhile, however, Kazakhstan is largely stagnated in its Soviet past, and is moving only slowly to consummate the deals and begin its predicted ascent. Both the Chevron and British Gas-Agip agreements - complex negotiations involving installation of basic infrastructure in remote, backward regions as well as a huge build-up of extraction technology - were supposed to be completed by April 1. Neither is likely to be soon, say government officials. 'Karachaganak won't be finished before October,' Mr Galiausat Keshubayev, the energy ministry's head of foreign relations, says of the British Gas-Agip negotiations. For now the republic, about the size of western Europe, is in economic collapse. The economy shrank 14 per cent last year after a 10 per cent fall in 1991. Inflation was 2,500 per cent in 1992 and real wages fell 20-30 per cent. The government says the 1993 unfinanced budget deficit will be Rbs182.9m, or 7.9 per cent of gross domestic product. The inflation rate, still raging at 25-35 per cent a month, particularly worries international bankers. Almost all of it is pinned to Russia's hyperinflation, largely through the rouble's plummeting value and the spiralling price of goods imported from Kazakhstan's northern neighbour. Budgetary pressure is intensified by Mr Nazarbayev's policy of containing the social costs of the economic collapse. A delicate population balance, for one, complicates his decisions: Kazakhs and ethnic Russians each make up about 40 per cent of the population, and Mr Nazarbayev is trying carefully not to antagonise either. In conservative Central Asia, he is also intent on limiting the kind of economic upheaval that has rocked Russia. To keep Kazakhs working - there are just 80,000 officially unemployed - the president is subsidising state factories; thus far, there has been no attempt to target unprofitable factories for closure. With what he calls an 'anti-crisis programme', Mr Nazarbayev also has established a safety net in which 3m people, mostly pensioners and war veterans, are receiving a monthly income of Rbs3,000, Rbs500 above the minimum wage. The key problem now is with the International Monetary Fund. After 18 months of talks, the IMF is stalling up to Dollars 700m in assistance, mostly over the fund's belief that Kazakhstan should leave the rouble zone and establish its own currency. IMF reasoning is that, with little prospect of Russia managing inflation, other republics in the rouble zone stand little chance of taking control of their own economies. Thus, the IMF's strict economic targets would be hard to meet, and Kazakhstan would also be hard-pressed to repay its debts. Kazakhstan, however, though conceptually agreeing with the fund, is worried about supporting a currency: it has few reserves, and there is no guarantee that a Kazakh currency would be stronger than the rouble. The chances are that the republic will not bend to the IMF's will on the currency issue at least for the next few months, says Mr Oraz Jandosov, deputy economics minister and one of the president's leading economic architects. So Kazakhstan will probably be left for now without the cash to finance the deficit and begin fundamentals such as building basic infrastructure. Together, the problems make the coming years look rocky. 'This country has great potential,' says a foreign banker. 'But you're looking at five or six years of transition before you get there.'</p>

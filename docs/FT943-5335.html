			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Transrail targets smaller loads The biggest of three British Rail freight companies being prepared for privatisation launches its operations today with a fresh livery and a new service to attract smaller loads off the roads. Transrail, which specialises in the distribution of bulk freight such as coal, steel and building materials, is creating two 'motorways' to take loads overnight between London and Scotland and between the north-east of England and the south-west. The service, dubbed Enterprise, is expected to be competitive with road haulage for as little as 50 tonnes. At present the minimum viable load is about 1,000 tonnes. Transrail, which is expected to be sold late next year or early in 1996, expects Enterprise to absorb more than 100,000 lorry journeys in its first year. The service will be available between Kent and Aberdeen, guaranteeing the arrival of overnight loads in Aberdeen by 9am. The second route will run between Cornwall and Teesside. There will be five hubs where loads can be delivered or collected. Each Transrail train carries up to 2,000 tonnes of freight, compared with 25 tonnes on the biggest lorry. The company said it had delivered more than 95 per cent of its loads during the current rail dispute. Mr Julian Worth, managing director of Transrail, said: 'Enterprise is carefully targeted at long-distance freight movements within the UK. 'It will exploit the economics of big train operations to provide a competitive service, offering an attractive alternative to the congested motorways.'</p>

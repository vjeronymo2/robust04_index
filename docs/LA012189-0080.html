			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY DEADLOCKS IN LETTER-BOMB TRIAL; MISTRIAL DECLARED  </P> <P> A federal judge declared a mistrial Friday in the case of a millionaire real  estate broker and an Israeli-American woman charged with mailing a fatal letter  bomb to a Manhattan Beach computer company after jurors announced that they  were hopelessly deadlocked.  </P> <P> After five days of deliberations that some jurors said disintegrated Friday  into a shouting match, the jury announced that it was deadlocked 6 to 6 on the  real estate broker, William Ross, and was leaning 10 to 2 in favor of  convicting his alleged associate, Rochelle Manning.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors said they do not know whether they will seek to retry the  case, but defense lawyers said they will ask U.S. District Judge Dickran  Tevrizian next week for judgments of acquittal.  </P> <P> "Of course, I'm disappointed that he wasn't acquitted completely. The man is  innocent, and I think the jurors indicated there was a strong feeling as to his  innocence," said Mitchell W. Egers, attorney for Ross, a Hawthorne real estate  broker accused of hiring Manning and her husband to mail the bomb as a result  of a business dispute.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Nancy Wieben Stock had described Ross, 52, as a man of  "quiet cowardice" who became enraged when Manhattan Beach businesswoman Brenda  Crouthamel Adams demanded repairs on a bungalow he was selling her and refused  to give him an exclusive listing on her own home.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Ross contacted Manning's husband, Robert Manning, an old  associate of his from the Jewish Defense League, and hired the Mannings to mail  a bomb to Adams' computer company in July, 1980.  </P> <P> A secretary for the company, Patricia Wilkerson, 32, was killed when she opened  the parcel, plugged it into the wall as an accompanying letter instructed, and  the device exploded.  </P> <P> The prosecution presented evidence that Rochelle Manning's fingerprints were  found on the letter and Robert Manning's fingerprints were on the cardboard  package in which the device was mailed.  </P> <P> Prosecutors also tracked two telephone calls from Ross's office to the office  and home of Robert Manning on the day of his argument with Adams. Robert  Manning is also charged in the case, but he is a fugitive, now living in the  Israeli-occupied West Bank.  </P> <P> Ross's attorneys said there was no evidence that it was Ross who made the  telephone calls and argued that the wealthy businessman, who owned nearly a  dozen pieces of property in Los Angeles worth $1 million, had no reason to kill  someone over the sale of a modest bungalow.  </P> <P> Manning's attorneys, Michael Adelson and Alan Rubin, said her fingerprints  could have gotten on the letter "in a hundred ways at a hundred different  times" and undoubtedly got there before the letter was typed.  </P> <P> One member of the jury, William Farrer, a Huntington Park teacher who held out  for acquittal of both defendants, said jurors began shouting in frustration  toward the end of their five days of deliberations, although he admitted, "I  was by far the most abrasive person."  </P> <P> "I just didn't think the evidence was there for either of them," he said.  </P> <P> With Manning, he said, "the evidence was incontrovertible that she touched the  paper, and believable that she may even have folded the paper. But it's a very  long step from that to conclude she had the intent to kill."  </P> <P> Farrer said the purported link between Ross and the Mannings was "very weak."  </P> <P> "Most of the testimony seemed to center on the two phone calls (from Ross's  office) and it wasn't proven who the parties were on either end of the phone  calls," he said. In addition, he said, "there was no proof that the so-called  confrontation (between Ross and Adams) was anything out of the ordinary."  </P> <P> Adams, he said, was a "strong-willed" woman who herself listed as many as 15  people who might "harbor grudges" against her.  </P> <P> Another juror, Dillena Okray, also said the government's case was not strong  enough.  </P> <P> "To me, the evidence that was presented was pretty weak, and the jury was more  or less put in a situation where they had to grasp at straws to reach any kind  of decision," she said.  </P> <P> Okray admitted that the fingerprint evidence against Manning was strong, but  was not conclusive, she said. "We didn't rule out the idea that she typed it,  but why would she type it, knowing that it was going to be sent with a bomb?"  </P> <P> The judge scheduled a hearing for next Friday to set a new trial date and  consider any motions from the defense.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bodil Jessen: "Nyrup Denies Conflict on Defense </F> Policy"]    [Text] Toward Election: The Social Democratic Party (SDP)  is standing fast on the National Compromise, which, among other  things, says no to joint defense in the Western European Union  [WEU].    The four government parties are going into the Folketing  election on their own platforms and will not run on a joint  program, asserted Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (SDP)  yesterday [12 February]. Nyrup denied on the same occasion that  the Center Democrats' [CD] positive stand on the Western  European Union would be a problem in a future governing  coalition.    This is being said following CD political spokesman Peter  Duetoft's announcement last week that Danish participation in  the West European Union should be part of [the program] in a new  governing coalition.    "The Center Democrats have their view, but this will have to  be dealt with when we know the election outcome," said Rasmussen  after a meeting between the SDP Folketing group and the party's  leadership council.    At the joint meeting the SDP's European and domestic policy  goals were adopted. The SDP stands firm on the National  Compromise and says no to a common defense and a common currency.    Regarding the latest cabinet shake-up, Rasmussen said: "The  leadership council understands the government shake-up of 28  January. The decision yesterday (the departure of Bente Juncker  -- BERLINGSKE TIDENDE SONDAG editor) had been under study by the  leadership council, which was unanimous in the decision."</p>

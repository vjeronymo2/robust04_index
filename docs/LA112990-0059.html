			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG DRUG TRIAL IN LAST STAGE;  </P> <P> NARCOTICS: MONEY-LAUNDERING CASE HAS SET RECORD AS LONGEST CRIMINAL TRIAL IN  L.A. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE. IT IS NEARLY READY TO GO TO JURY.  </P> <P> A record-setting trial of more than seven months, in which nine defendants are  accused of conspiring to launder about $350 million in drug money through a  business in Los Angeles' downtown jewelry district, appeared nearly ready to go  to the jury Wednesday.  </P> <P> The case, which grew out of a lengthy federal investigation code-named  "Operation Polar Cap," has set the record for the longest criminal trial in Los  Angeles' federal courthouse, according to a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney.  </P> <P> Jury selection began last April 11 and testimony from nearly 100 witnesses  began on May 22.  </P> <P> It is expected the government will conclude its final rebuttal argument today  so that U.S. District Judge William D. Keller can instruct jurors before they  start deliberations.  </P> <P> In his rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Atty. Russell Hayman told jurors Wednesday it  was not necessary to produce evidence of drug deals to prove that the millions  of dollars in small bills that flowed through the Andonian Bros. Manufacturing  Co. represented drug profits.  </P> <P> Of the nine defendants, including the brothers Nazareth and Vahe Andonian,  Hayman said: "It wasn't their job to handle drugs. It was their job to handle  receipts."  </P> <P> Hayman and co-prosecutor Assistant U.S. Atty. Jean Kawahara argued that the  defendants conspired to participate in an international drug-money laundering  scheme which was concealed through purchases of large amounts of gold bullion.  They alleged that the cash was returned to South American drug lords to  underwrite their operations.  </P> <P> In an affidavit filed with the court, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent  Michael Orton estimated that between 1986 and February, 1989, when the  defendants were arrested, the Andonian firm and another downtown jewelry  company which is the object of a separate trial, Ropex Corp., "deposited in  excess of $1 billion in cash into their accounts at Los Angeles area banks."  </P> <P> The government has alleged that the individual who orchestrated the money  laundering scheme was Raul Vivas, 38, a gold dealer from Buenos Aires.  </P> <P> Vivas' attorney, Martin L. Schmukler, told jurors Wednesday that his client  "was held in very high regard" in the precious metals business and was "a man  of integrity."  </P></p>

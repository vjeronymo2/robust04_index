			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Government today held a meeting with  major and independent oil marketers in the country, in the  ongoing efforts to find a solution to the petroleum problem of  fuel scarcity, which has persisted for some time in the country.  Also in attendance were officials of the Ministry of Petroleum  and Mineral Resources, NNPC [Nigerian National Petroleum  Corporation], NUPENG [National Union of Petroleum and Natural  Gas Workers], and (PENGASEN) [expansion unknown].    In a press statement issued from the office of the chief of  general staff, the government said in the course of the meeting  it was identified that the current crisis is as a result of  cummulative lapses in the maintainance of NNPC infrastructure in  the past few years. It was reportedly acknowledged by all  participants that concrete and adequate measures are currently  being put in place to deal with the situation.    According to the statement, oil marketers have pledged to  put  in place adequate control measures to help in checking any  diversion of petroleum products, while necessary measures are to  be taken to remove all lapses that have been identified within  the distribution system. The Federal Government said it wishes  to assure the public that necessary machineries are already put  in place, to bring the current situation under control and  restore normalcy to the distribution of petroleum products in  the country.</p>

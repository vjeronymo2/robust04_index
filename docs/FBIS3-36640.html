			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamyshev report: "Fate of 14th Army Determined. </F> Russian Military Will Receive Legal Status"]    [Text] The persistence of the Dniester region leaders in  trying to hound General Lebed, commander of the 14th Army, from  Tiraspol has so far been yielding the opposite results. In  Moscow yesterday, Moldova Prime Minister Andrey Sangheli  discussed, among other questions, the problem of concluding a  Russia-Moldova agreement on temporary status for the Russian  army. Should the document, whose draft has already been  approved by Boris Yeltsin, be signed, the positions of the 14th  Army and its commander would become as strong as they have ever  been.    The more than two-year presence of the 14th Army on the  territory of the self-proclaimed Dniester Moldovan Republic, on  the one hand, has constantly energized anti-Russian sentiments  in Moldova, and on the other, has served as a reliable lever  with which Russian leaders have been trying to divert Chisinau  from thinking about uniting with Romania. Stating the readiness  to pull out the 14th Army, Moscow at the same time linked this  question with the progress of settlement of the Dniester  conflict. Given the sharpness of the present differences  between the sides, this formula virtually means an indefinite  presence of the Russian military in Moldova. It is not  surprising that, unable to get rid of the Russian military,  Chisinau would wish at least to put certain limits on their  activities in the Dniester by concluding a special agreement on  legal questions pertaining to a time frame for the presence of  Russian military formations on Moldova's territory.    No details of this documents are known so far, but the  political circumstances in which it was approved by Boris  Yeltsin are remarkable. On the one hand, Moldova is in for  parliamentary elections where, many believe, supporters of an  independent state within the framework of the CIS would score  victory. At the same time, the conflict between the authorities  of the Dniester Moldovan Republic and General Lebed has led to  the 14th Army commander's transformation from a hero of the  Dniester to an "enemy of the people" and "traitor." Now, after  the signing of the agreement with Moldova, the general and his  soldiers would be under Moscow's and Chisinau's legal protection  whereas Tiraspol's influence on the 14th Army would virtually be  reduced to zero.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / French president steps into 'Gaullist fraud' case France's Socialist President Francois Mitterrand yesterday intervened after a FFr1m (Pounds 118,200) bribe was allegedly offered to get a magistrate to drop his investigation of possible Gaullist financial improprieties. The magistrate, Mr Eric Halphen, is investigating allegations of false invoicing on public housing contracts awarded by the city of Paris, whose mayor is Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist presidential candidate. In the wake of the investigation, Mr Michel Roussin, France's foreign aid minister, who used to work for Mr Chirac, has already resigned. In addition to Mr Roussin, Mr Halphen has placed 13 others under formal investigation for financial impropriety. One of them is Mr Didier Schuller, a Gaullist local politician. He has accused Mr Halphen's father-in-law, Mr Jean-Pierre Marechal, of demanding money in return for trying to persuade his son-in-law to drop the inquiry. After receiving FFr1m in a little box from Mr Schuller at Charles de Gaulle airport, Mr Marechal was arrested by police and charged with extortion. Yesterday Mr Marechal claimed he had been 'framed' by Mr Schuller, whom he said he knew professionally. Mr Marechal claimed he thought Mr Schuller had given him a box of cigars, and said he was amazed to find it contained FFr1m instead. France's justice minister, Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, has said he will leave it to the public prosecutor to decide whether Mr Halphen should now be taken off the case. The public prosecutor, in turn, has given Mr Halphen a few days to come to his own conclusions about the propriety of continuing his investigation. Strongly supported by fellow magistrates, Mr Halphen was yesterday ploughing on with his probe into Paris municipal contracting. But with the Socialist party warning the government not to bury the investigation, President Mitterrand has now asked the Superior Council of the Magistrature, which he chairs, for their opinion on whether Mr Halphen should continue. Handing the dossier to another magistrate would almost certainly delay a conclusion to the investigation until after next May's presidential election.</p>

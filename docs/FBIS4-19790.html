During his appearance before the Congress of Deputies Foreign  Affairs Committee, Solana recalled NATO's two air strikes  against the troops besieging the city, but deplored the  statements by Russian President Boris Yeltsin: "In my opinion,  his words gave the Serb forces some hope." "Perhaps a permanent  member of the (UN) Security Council should have weighed his  words more carefully," because they reduced the effectiveness of  the NATO action, he added. The minister attributed Yeltsin's  "mistakes" to factors relating to the domestic policy of Russia,  a country where nationalist feeling is on the increase.    The Russian head of state, who was in Madrid at the  beginning  of last week, just after the NATO attack, criticized the use of  force by the alliance, complained that Moscow had not been  consulted or even informed, and urged continuing to negotiate.    In milder terms, Solana intimated his bewilderment about the  Clinton administration's recent actions. He recalled that both  Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the U.S. chief of  staff had ruled out strikes against the Serbs hours before they  finally occurred. "It is true that there were statements --  fortunate or otherwise -- which gave cause for the senseless  Bosnian Serb forces to make decisions (to attack), perhaps  believing that they were safe because of the international  community's inaction."    As a result of Washington's and Moscow's "indiscretions,"  "the Bosnian Serb forces' position is now a strengthened  position," the minister stressed, and he warned: "Until the  international community presents a united front, the Serbs will  take advantage of any chink."

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Milken goes free - up to a point MR MICHAEL MILKEN, freed from federal custody this week, must now decide how to serve the 1,800 hours of community service in each of the next three years required to fulfil his sentence for securities fraud. The former head of the high yield bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert, and the driving force behind the growth of 'junk bond' financing in the 1980s, still faces strict curbs on his activities. The Securities and Exchange Commission has banned him for life from the brokerage industry. He also faces trouble of a more personal kind - coping with prostate cancer. Mr Milken had spent 22 months in a prison in Northern California, having pleaded guilty in 1990 to charges of violating US securities law, and then a further month in a halfway house - which had once been the residence of Mary Pickford, the movie star - in Hollywood. For the 30 days immediately before his official release from federal custody on Tuesday, Mr Milken had lived at his California home, under government supervision. He had originally been sentenced to a 10-year prison term by Judge Kimba Wood, in the New York Federal District Court, a particularly heavy penalty when compared with the treatment of other Wall Street criminals. However, this sentence was subsequently cut to two years, on the grounds that the former financier had agree to co-operate with the authorities. Mr Milken must now present a community service proposal to the judge. In retrospect, there has been much debate over the extent of Mr Milken's co-operation; critics of the sentence reduction note that his public testimony against former colleagues at Drexel has been ambiguous and not particularly helpful to prosecutors. However, in February last year, the financier agreed to pay an additional Dollars 500m (Pounds 352m) into a Dollars 1.3bn 'pool', to be divided among the various parties who had filed claims against Drexel Burnham Lambert. The investment bank, now defunct, went into bankruptcy in 1990. Mr Milken had already paid Dollars 400m into an SEC disgorgement fund, and the aggregate Dollars 900m penalty was said to represent 80 per cent of his personal wealth. However, this figure did not allow for assets held by Mr Milken's wife, Lori, or by his family.</p>

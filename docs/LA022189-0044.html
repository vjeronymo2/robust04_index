			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Members of Greenpeace USA built a makeshift wire fence around several open  barrels of cyanide found abandoned in a field in the Kern County desert  community of Rosamond several weeks ago. Greenpeace workers were dressed in  protective gear when they erected the 200-foot-long fence around the field to  keep people out until the barrels can be removed, a spokeswoman for the group  said. The group also posted a large sign at the location that read, "Warning:  Cyanide Site Neglected by Your State Officials." Greenpeace said the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency will begin an investigation this week to find  out who dumped the barrels there. Greenpeace alleges that the state has known  about the cyanide for more than a year but has made no plans to remove or  dispose of it.  </P></p>

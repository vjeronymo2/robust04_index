			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> The simulated version of "The Terry Anderson Story" shown March 10 on "Saturday  Night With Connie Chung" employed a technique that was entirely out of place  for the theme -- the plight of the American hostages in captivity.  </P> <P> The theme is so strong and so heart-rending that any theatrics imposed on this  story can only be in poor taste. It was a disservice to our hostages to treat  their story in such melodramatic style. Moreover, the acting was a sham and the  notion that news can be so manipulated is disgraceful.  </P> <P> M.

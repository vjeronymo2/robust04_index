			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by David Millward: "Drug Dealers Caught With Guns </F> Could Face Life Jail"]    [Excerpt] Drug dealers face the prospect of life sentences  if caught with real or imitation guns.    Ministers plan to amend the Criminal Justice Bill to impose  stiffer penalties on those responsible for a rising tide of  drug-linked violence in inner-cities.    Involvement in trafficking and supply will be included  alongside assault, theft, arson and resisting arrest as a  specific offence under section 17 (2) of the 1968 Firearms Act.    The change would close a loophole that allowed traffickers  to  be treated less severely when arrested while holding a gun than  someone involved in these other crimes who was similarly armed.    The clause now sets a maximum penalty of life imprisonment,  an unlimited fine or both on conviction.    The Government has indicated it will accept proposals drawn  up by the Home Office's Firearms Consultative Committee, chaired  by Lord Kimball.    With the Criminal Justice Bill currently going through  Parliament, the committee approached Mr Michael Howard, the Home  Secretary, directly on the subject rather than wait to issue its  annual report on firearms legislation.    Lord Kimball, a former Conservative MP, told the Home  Secretary that his proposals would help "allay public concern"  at the increased use of firearms in drugs-related offences.    Such concern was provoked by the murder of Pc Patrick Dunne,  44, in Clapham, south London, last October. The community  policeman is believed to have been the victim of one of a number  of drugs gangs in London.    Police believe armed drugs gangs have also been operating in  Moss Side, Manchester, south London and in several other cities  across the country.    In October last year police discovered arms including a  sub-machine gun and six pistols with a &pound;85,000 drug haul in  Coventry.    Increasingly violent territorial battles between gangs has  led to calls from police and politicians for action to curb  their activities.    Explaining the need to change the law, Lord Kimball said:  "There is a danger there will be a public reaction which will  create unnecessary problems for legitimate users of firearms.  This is something we are hoping to pre-empt."    There was support for the plans from Mr Peter Butler, Tory  MP  for Milton Keynes North East and a member of the all-party Home  Affairs Committee. "It seems to be part of an excellent solution  but I think there must be minimum sentences.    "I think there has been a groundswell of public concern  about  drugs and violence and this does seem to address both issues."  [passage omitted]</p>

The crystals were prepared from high-temperature  aluminum solutions. A mixture of Al and the B-10 (99%) or  B-11  (90%) enriched elemental boron powder was placed in an  alumina  crucible and heated under an argon atmosphere up to 1500C,  kept for 3 h, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The  crystals of (_a_-AlB[.sub]12[/](B-10) or  (_a_-AlB[.sub]12[/](B-11) grown in the reaction mixture were  separated by dissolving an excess of Al with hot hydrochloric  acid.    Well-formed single crystals with an approximately octahedral  form bounded with [101] planes were used for the lattice  constants and intensity measurements, which were made with a  four-circle diffractometer equipped with Mo  K[.sub]_a_/_a_1[/] radiation. Starting from published  data,[.sup]1[/] the structure was refined with the aid of a  full-matrix least squares program to the R(Rw) values of  0.028(0.035) and 0.025(0.033) for _a_-AlB[.sub]12[/](B-10)  and a- AlB[.sub]12[/](B-11), respectively. The structural  parameters (atomic coordinates, occupancies of Al sites,  temperature factors) obtained for one crystal were the same as  their respective equivalents for the other, demonstrating that  the crystal structure including the nature of metal distribution  is the same in both crystals. As shown in the following,  however, there were appreciable differences in the lattice  constants of the two crystals:    (Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 four-circle diffractometer;  MoK[.sub]_a_l[/], 0.70930 Angstrom, 20C)    _a_-AlB[.sub]10[/](B-10): a = 10.1570(4),c =  14.2622(7) Angstrom    _a_-AlB[.sub]11[/](B-11): a = 10.1559(4),c =  14.2587(7) Angstrom    reflecting the difference between the mass numbers of B-10  and B-11, which may affect the thermal vibration of boron atoms  in a different degree and thus producing different B-B bond  lengths of the icosahedral B[.sub]12[/] network in the two  crystals. Structural details of the _a_-AlB[.sub]12[/]  structure and metal distribution in it will be presented.  References:    1. I. Higashi, T. Sakurai, and T. Atoda, J. SOLID STATE  CHEM.

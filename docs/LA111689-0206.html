			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CIGARETTE PROMOTION IN KOREAN CENTER ASSAILED  </P> <P> On the eve of a national "smokeout," a Korean tobacco company was handing out  cigarettes Wednesday at a Korean community center in Orange County, promising  that a portion of any donations would go toward building elderly housing in the  Los Angeles metropolitan area.  </P> <P> An Orange County health official immediately assailed the promotional tactic  Wednesday, accusing the government-run Korea Tobacco and Ginseng Corp. of  playing upon the national sentiments of Korean immigrants to increase cigarette  sales.  </P> <P> "It's obscene to me," said Nampet Panichpant-Michelsen, program manager for the  International Immigrant and Refugee Health Assistance program, an arm of the  Orange County Health Care Agency.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the tobacco firm said Wednesday that it was unaware of the  no-smoking effort, but said the promotional campaign for Korean-made cigarettes  was intended to benefit Korean communities in the United States, not to build a  market for the company's products.  </P> <P> "We didn't know about the" Great American Smokeout being held today, Lee Hyung  Sub, managing director of Overseas Affairs for the privately owned cigarette  corporation, said in a telephone interview Wednesday from his office in Taejon,  South Korea.  </P> <P> Proceeds for the cigarettes will go to a Korean senior citizens group and to  sponsor a community anti-crime committee, Lee said. He added that his company  does not plan to sell cigarettes in the United States until late December.  </P> <P> But Panichpant-Michelsen accused the tobacco company of "dumping" its product  on new Asian immigrants who may not be aware of the health hazards of smoking.  </P> <P> "It's one thing if you're educated and you make a conscious effort to kill  yourself," she said. "But it's another if you are doing it because you are not  sophisticated enough to know you are being manipulated by aggressive  advertising tactics."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, several promotional posters advertising the cigarettes were  hanging in the Korean Community Center in Garden Grove. The posters, written in  Korean, said the company was proud to announce that the cigarettes from the  "motherland" had arrived, according to a Korean translator who works for the  county. The posters said the company had donated $30,000 worth of cigarettes  and the proceeds would be used to build elderly housing. Among the name brands  advertised were "Eighty-Eights," and "Lilac Slims."  </P> <P> Officials at the Korean Community Center on Garden Grove Boulevard could not be  reached for comment on the cigarette promotion. However, county health  officials said center representatives had been handing out boxes of the  cigarettes at the senior center for at least a month.  </P> <P> Panichpant-Michelson said she learned of the promotion earlier this week when  she visited the center to ask an official there if he would stop smoking for a  day during national smokeout week.  </P> <P> "I approached him to see if he would stop smoking for 24 hours and learned that  (the tobacco company) had dumped $30,000 worth of cigarettes claiming to be low  tar," she said. "They have been very clever in that they have been able to  identify the needs of the people. It's so obvious and blatant in terms of the  aggressive advertising tactics."  </P> <P> She said although the advertisement for the cigarettes is in Korean, the  Surgeon General's warning is written in English.  </P></p>

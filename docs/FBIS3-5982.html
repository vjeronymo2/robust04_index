The assembly on Wednesday began a six-day  meeting during which members will debate legal amendments  approved recently by Cabinet, including a proposal to allow the  setting up of an industrial estate. A senior Laotian official  said yesterday the proposed amendments would provide more  incentives for foreign investors in Laos, mostly Thais.    Proposed changes included allowing businessmen longer tenure  on rented land. "Businessmen are authorized to transfer the  rental right to a third party -- which is not provided for in  the present foreign investment law," he said. Businesses would  not need to try to buy the land, because the lease period would  be for up to 99 years, more than adequate for business planning.  The amendments would also provide more protection for foreign  investors.    It is proposed to establish an industrial estate, partly  because Laotian authorities are understaffed and already  hard-pressed to monitor the 40-odd foreign industries already  operating in Laos. "To have them in the same location will make  our work easier and will also be to their advantage as the  government will certainly develop necessary infrastructure and  facilities in the estate," he said.    The first industrial estate is expected to be developed  about  30 kilometers north of Vientiane, on the way to Nam Ngum dam, if  President Nouhak Phoumsavan announces approval. The official  said the planned estate will not be located near Vientiane, to  avoid polluting the capital.    Leuan Sombounkhan, vice president of the committee for  planning and co-operation, told THE NATION that tax incentives  would be given to businesses which locate in industrial estates.    The National Assembly conference is presided over by Saman  Vi- gnaket, a member of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party  central committee and president of the National Assembly. The  opening was attended by Prime Minister Gen. Khamtai Siphandon  President Nouhak and other Politburo members, National Assembly  members and Cabinet members. In his opening address, Saman told  the assembly the world situation could have both favorable and  complicated effects on national development and security.    "The world's people, especially those of developing and  less-  developed countries, struggle to safeguard their political  independence while focusing efforts on socio-economic  development to improve living conditions," the official quoted  Saman as saying.    In Southeast Asia the emerging trend was towards peace,  stability and co-operation between nations, which would  facilitate national development.</p>

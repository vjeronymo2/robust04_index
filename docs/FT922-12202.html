			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Labour faces a snub from workers: David Goodhart in Perth finds the unions reviewing links with their traditional party THE LEADERS of some of Britain's biggest unions, gathered yesterday in Perth for the annual meeting of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, seemed agreed on one thing: Labour's election defeat will mean a significant loosening of links between the unions and the party. How far, financially and politically, the disentanglement will go is still not clear, but Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, is talking about shifting resources from the Labour party at national level to European lobbying, industrial campaigns and local government. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, wants a swift cut in the union block vote at the Labour party conference from 90 per cent to 50 per cent, a shift in union influence in the party from national to local, and a complete withdrawal of the unions from the electoral college for electing the leader, where they now hold 40 per cent of the votes. Why, then, has Mr Edmonds been popping up on our TV screens over the past week, like a union baron from the 1970s, hinting that his union, like the other big unions, will be delivering the vote for Mr John Smith as leader? Mr Edmonds says that as long as unions have 40 per cent of the electoral college they cannot deny their political role. At least his union is holding a workplace ballot on how the union should vote. The AEU engineering union has come out firmly against a ballot and the TGWU is dithering. Thanks to the GMB example and a bit of prodding from the Labour leadership campaign, some momentum is now building up behind balloting in all unions. The whole incident has been an embarrassing reminder that the Labour party remains far from the European-style social democratic party to which most of its leaders aspire. In the medium term, the prospects for moving closer to that model, at least regarding the union-party link, must be good. Mr John Smith, the probable next leader, has hinted he wants reform and many leading union figures agree. Mr Edmonds, a forward thinker, believes that while Labour remains financially dependent on the unions, they cannot de-affiliate. He adds that unions still provide necessary 'ballast' against the constituency parties. He does, however, want union withdrawal from the electoral college and a big cut in the block vote plus a re-organisation in the way it functions to prevent small delegations or single leaders from wielding millions of votes. He also wants a permanent shift in the union role from the national level, where unions inflict political damage on Labour, to the local level, where unions could - in view of the failure to create a mass party - be politically beneficial by getting activists to join the party as individual members. However, in the short term the Labour party will get the worst of all worlds from the unions. It will suffer politically from the insensitively obtrusive role of the unions in the leadership contest. It will suffer financially because the unions' first step, after the election defeat, will be to cut affiliation payments. In the run-up to the election, many unions were affiliating more members than was justified by their declining rolls. Affiliation fees will now be realigned with reality, which may mean a drop of about 10 per cent. In the past, Labour might have asked for a corresponding increase in the affiliation fee or for one-off top-ups from the big loyalist unions, the TGWU and the GMB. Both Mr Edmonds and Mr Morris made clear yesterday that both requests would now be rejected. While the unions do not rule out funding future Labour election campaigns - they paid 90 per cent of the last one - the non-union element of Labour running costs will have to increase from the present figure of 50 per cent. Where will the unions' resources be diverted? Mr Morris offers the idea of sponsoring local councillors and also suggests that several unions might combine to staff a professional lobbying body in Brussels. The unions will, above all, need all the revenues they can keep for their mundane industrial work. Falling membership may be exacerbated by the government's intention to press on with plans to change the rules on 'automatic check-off'. Mr Morris talks about a 'sharper industrial focus' and mentions broadening the collective bargaining agenda to include training and corporate-investment strategies. There is some hope that the new government may be open to dialogue in consensual areas such as health and safety, equality and training. Yesterday the TGWU and GMB, which many believe could formally merge within three years, appealed to the government to support their campaign for a minimum of five days' training for all workers each year. The unions will present this demand in all major bargaining units. Mr Edmonds said: 'This is an opportunity for the government and the employers to follow up their fine words on training with some action.'</p>

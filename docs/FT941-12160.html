			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / People: Friedman moves from Stoy to Arthur Andersen Brian Friedman is joining Arthur Andersen, the UK's fourth largest accountancy firm, after jumping ship from Stoy Hayward, the tenth. Friedman, who said his move from Stoy was 'amicable', will head a new pay and employee benefits practice, drawing on his experience as head of Stoy Benefit Consulting. The move is significant because his role will be to help build up the discipline for the firm around the world and not just in the UK. Most Andersen disciplines have by contrast been led from the US, where the firm was founded. The UK practice recently took the lead in developing a worldwide insolvency practice. Jim Wadia, Andersen's managing partner in the UK, expects the UK employee benefits' practice to be billing more than Pounds 3m within two years; and the worldwide practice Dollars 15m-18m. Andersen already carries out similar work in France, Spain and the US. It was the first UK accountancy firm to devise its own profit-related pay scheme for staff, since mirrored by other firms including Stoy. The UK team working with Friedman will include 20 professional staff drawn from the tax and other existing practice areas, and is likely to begin hiring new staff.</p>

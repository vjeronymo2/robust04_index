			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1700 GMT on 7 January devotes its 15-minute "Straight Talk"  program to highlighting what program guest Luis Sexto, a BOHEMIA  journalist, describes as the first potential problem of which he  has heard in connection with the functioning of the new Basic  Cooperative Production Units [UPBC].    Program host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia notes that Sexto gets  letters from people at both Radio Rebelde and BOHEMIA, and that  certain subjects, such as today's, are too important not to  address.    Sexto says: "I have just received a letter signed by Dr.  Rafael Gonzalez, a veterinarian from Sancti Spiritus Province.  This is an excessively respectful letter -- if the adverb  `excessively' can ever be fitting in describing the respect one  feels toward, or shows, others! It is a letter in which,  although he does have a personal problem, what most concerns him  is the problem in general; that is, how such a problem could  affect the nation. Briefly, the case is as follows: Dr. Gonzalez  was the veterinarian at a state agricultural-livestock  enterprise. He does not say whether it was a place that raised  cattle, or one that grew cane, or a miscellaneous crop  enterprise. In any case, the farm where he used to work became a  UBPC [Basic Cooperative Production Unit]. So he agreed to become  a member of that UBPC; and when the farm formally turned into a  UBPC, he was told that the only thing he could do there was be  an agricultural laborer, that there was no place there for a  veterinarian.    "He, of course, refused -- for reasons everyone understood  but no one did anything about. Moreover, he argues that he also  has physical handicaps that prevent him from, that constitute  obstacles to, working in the fields, since agricultural work is  so tough.    "He writes me because he has visited many people, and the  Sancti Spiritus labor agency told him it had no work for him.  The Institute of Veterinary Medicine here in Havana told him  that that's the way it is, [repeats] that that is just the way  it is. The legal directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture also  told him that that is just the way it is. And he, who says he is  a revolutionary, a 36- year-old veterinarian trained by the  Revolution, is not complaining. He is not cursing, or recanting,  or regretting anything, or making any reproaches. Although he is  having this personal problem, he simply says that he is worried  about there existing, in the UBPC's, a tendency to do without  professionals in the work force."    Sexto continues: "He says that much good has been spoken  about the UBPC's; that he has heard many good things about the  UBPC's -- even referring to a recent article of mine on the  UBPC's that appeared in BOHEMIA -- but that he has heard nothing  negative about the UBPC's anywhere, nothing negative that can be  foreseen about the UBPC's. And he thinks that what is happening  to him might also be happening to other people, and that that  could be a negative aspect of the UBPC's that we must intercept,  watch out for, follow."    Roque and Sexto then explain what the UPBCs are and why they  came to be.    Sexto says: "The fact is that Dr. Gonzalez is worried that  doing without professionals in the work force in the UBPC's  could be a negative tendency of this formula for agricultural  organization, of this new relationship between the man and the  land -- a tendency which might obstruct, or prevent, the UBPCs'  developing to their full potential. I think he is right.  Unquestionably, no one can achieve profitability, or become  efficient in production, without science or technology...nor can  anyone defend the UBPCs' doing without, or attempting to do  without them. That could be a negative tendency, which must  constantly be watched for, put a stop to, and controlled."    Roque notes that "the objective is to achieve direct  production -- not to have a lot of people in offices, too many  people affecting the profitability of a UBPC, of course."    Sexto agrees, noting that "agriculture with good yields,  good  results, that is profitable, that is productive, cannot be  achieved through man's labor alone. That is clear. And I think  that Dr. Gonzalez is very right to worry about what is worrying  him. And I think maybe no one in the country has thought that  this might happen, that the UBPC's might have a tendency to try  to do without professionals on their work force."    "Of course he does not explain to me what kind of an  enterprise this was, whether or not it was a cattle-raising  enterprise. There cannot not be a place for a veterinarian in a  UBPC devoted to raising livestock? Maybe in a miscellaneous  crops enterprise! On the other hand, a veterinarian might indeed  not be necessary at a miscellaneous crops enterprise, or a  cane-growing UBPC.    "Now, let's look at another aspect of the problem. If the  UBPC is a cattle-raising UPBC...[rephrases] I do think a place  for that veterinarian must be found at some other cattle-raising  UBPC that needs a veterinarian."    Roque adds: "And even if his UBPC is not a cattle-raising  UPBC, a place for that veterinarian must be found, because how  can we afford to leave a veterinarian without a job?"    Sexto agrees: "Exactly! Because certain paradoxical factors  come into play here: If the Revolution is concerned with making  sure that the medical student who is today in the classroom has  a guaranteed job when he graduates, how can we possibly allow a  veterinarian with 12 years' experience -- that means 12  additional years of study, in addition to the practice -- to be  without a job because no one can find a place for him?    "It is possible that it might be difficult, at the present  time. But we must begin thinking about a solution....    "I also want to tell you, Juan Carlos, that the responses of  the authorities to whom he has gone, whom he has told about his  problem, have been pretty indifferent, although they understood  the problem. We think he cannot be told: Well, it is  unavoidable, Doctor. Just resign yourself.    "I think no state organization can be allowed to give such  an  answer!"    Roque notes: That is where the problem of coordination comes  in. I think these institutions have to have exchanges with  others. The Labor Ministry in Sancti Spiritus, or the  enterprises he himself has visited directly, have to begin  seeking a solution to his problem, even if the problem is not  their own. They too have to begin to make suggestions."    The speakers agree that the nation is seeking to make  changes  and find solutions to problems, but that erroneous  interpretations of things do occur; also, not everyone does the  right thing. Deficiencies continue to exist.    Sexto adds: "This also has to be looked at from another  point  of view, because if Decree-Law No. 141 permitted that  veterinarian to treat privately, as a self-employed person, all  the dogs and cats in Sancti Spiritus, it is possible that this  man would not be facing the worry, the personal situation he is  in today; but Decree-Law does not -- for now -- permit him to  exercise his profession as a self-employed person. I think that  this has to be kept in mind. I think cases like this could crop  up not only in Sancti Spiritus but all over the country.    "There could be misinterpretations, and there could be  objective situations that prevent there being work for a  veterinarian, but formulas must be sought. What cannot be  allowed to happen is for a veterinarian to (?remain) in such a  situation. The country cannot afford the luxury of doing without  such members of the work force!"    Roque agrees, saying that a lesson must be learned from this  case. Sexto says that in his letter, the veterinarian says he  knows of other cases like his own.    Sexto adds: "I want to say that this kind of problem is not  solved with either a bureaucratic spirit or a bureaucratic  mentality. I think a revolutionary, especially if he is an  official, has to empathize with a citizen's problem as if it  were his own. I think that is basic, in leading this country."  Sexto says, further, that he thinks this is a case for the  agricultural-livestock workers union. He says: "A recent CTC  [Cuban Workers Federation] editorial in the newspaper  TRABAJADORES said the unions had to follow such cases very  closely, step by step, so as to avoid having injustices,  deformations, and misinterpretations occur. And I think the case  of Dr. Gonzalez in Sancti Spiritus must be assessed by the  province's union. That union has to seek a solution."    Roque notes: "There lies the role -- first and foremost --  of  the union sections, at the grassroots level. I am talking about  the base-level, because many of these problems might be able to  be solved at the very bottom."    Sexto notes that he wondered what the union's role might be  at a UPBC if the workers own the production and if the president  can be removed by an assembly of the workers when he messes up.  "Now I think that role is, precisely, first of all, for the  union to keep watch over the nation's best interests; and also  to watch for cases such as this, which are obviously injustices,  where people have obviously failed to think."    Roque concludes: "This is an alert to the entire country."</p>

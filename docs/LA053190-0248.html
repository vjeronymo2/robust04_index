			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> KHASHOGGI'S CONNECTIONS PROVED  </P> <P> Any doubt that Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi mixes with the rich and famous  was dispelled Wednesday when one of his personal phone books was admitted into  evidence at his fraud trial.  </P> <P> Entries in the loose-leaf book included politicians, entertainers, athletes,  business figures and apparently Leona Helmsley.  </P> <P> Among the politicians: former Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter;  former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger; and Robert C. McFarlane, the  former national security adviser under President Reagan.  </P> <P> Actors and entertainers included Christopher Reeve, Farrah Fawcett, Liza  Minnelli, Paul Anka, Wayne Newton and Brooke Shields. Also listed was George  Hamilton, a close friend of Khashoggi's co-defendant, Imelda Marcos, who  earlier testified at the trial.  </P> <P> The book also held phone numbers for Muhammad Ali, Chrysler Chairman Lee A.  Iaccoca and a "Mrs. Helmsely," an apparent reference to hotel queen Leona  Helmsley, who was convicted of tax evasion last year in the same Manhattan  federal courtroom where Khashoggi and Mrs. Marcos are being tried.  </P></p>

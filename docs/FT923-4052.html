			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Lamont fends off criticism with strong rejection of devaluation MR NORMAN LAMONT has moved to pre-empt a row over the economy at next month's Conservative party conference with a robust defence of his refusal to devalue the pound. The chancellor reassured Tory activists that the economy would emerge from recession during 'the course of this year'. His comments, in the latest issue of the party newspaper, will be followed tomorrow by a renewed attempt from Mr John Major to reassure industrialists and to steady the nerves of government supporters over economic prospects. The prime minister, who earlier this week sought to quell the revolt within his party over the Maastricht treaty, plans to restate his conviction that the pain of recession will bring the reward of a sustained upturn. Conservative MPs returning from their summer break have reported growing unrest in constituency associations over the length and depth of the recession. Ministers are adding their voice to predictions that criticism of Mr Lamont's strategy may sour planned conference celebrations of April's election victory. A number of constituencies - whose associations tend to be dominated by small business owners and the self-employed - have tabled critical motions. Most call for early interest rate reductions, with some making a link with the need to devalue or withdraw sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism. In the long and strongly worded article published in Conservative Newsline, Mr Lamont rejected suggestions that a lower pound would speed economic upturn. He insisted: 'Devaluation would not help recovery. It would lead to a collapse in market confidence and a damaging rise in interest rates.' He added that withdrawal from the ERM would be a bigger mistake. 'We would see a huge fall in the pound and an explosion in inflation.' Anticipating what is expected to be a central theme of Mr Major's speech in Edinburgh, Mr Lamont promised that the current strategy would bring an end to 'stop-go' economics. The sharp and continuing fall in Britain's inflation rate had been overlooked. 'Yet those figures tell us more about the future of the British economy and our long-term prospects than any other bit of economic news.' But those who argued for what would be a 'quite disastrous' decision by the government to ease up in the battle against inflation had to recognise that prices were rising faster in the UK than in France or Germany. He pointed to a range of economic indicators to dismiss predictions that the recession might be prolonged indefinitely. Manufacturing output had risen for two successive quarters, exports and retail sales had increased in the second quarter and the growth of unemployment had slowed. The chancellor added: 'I expect growth to resume in the course of this year.' The recovery would be slow at first but the 'critical point' was that 'the only way to secure a long-lasting recovery is to put in place a stable medium-term framework which will deliver low inflation'.

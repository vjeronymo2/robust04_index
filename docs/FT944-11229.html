			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (10): The roar of the dragon - City Profile, Shanghai Shanghai was opened up to the outside world some 10 years later than other coastal areas, such as Guangdong and Fujian. But China's largest city, with a population of close to 13m, is desperately striving to make up for that lost time. According to the official statistics, the city's gross domestic product has been rising, in real terms, at almost 15 per cent a year over the past three years. If growth were to be sustained at this rate, Shanghai's economic activity would double every five years. Already the richest place in China, it looks almost certain to be the first significant part of that vast country (apart from Hong Kong) to attain developed status. Shanghai's recent dynamism represents a marked change from the 1980s, when Shanghai was kept on a chokingly tight rein by a central government dependent upon it for more than half its revenue. Between 1985 and 1991, Shanghai's real income stagnated, while those of Guangdong and Fujian more than doubled. But the decision to loosen the reins was finally taken at the highest levels of a government that contains many officials from the city. Now it is talked of as 'the dragon head' of the Yangtse river basin, home to more than 300m people. Construction is everywhere, with work continuing day and night. An official publication, Shanghai Today, writes of 5,000 constructions sites. The statistics on Shanghai's dynamism are as impressive as the visible signs of activity. They have evidently impressed potential foreign investors. Last year 3,650 foreign investment projects were approved for a total investment of Dollars 7bn, according to Wang Zu Kang, chairman both of Shanghai's Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Commission and of its Foreign Investment Commission. (The first director of the latter was, he notes, Zhu Rongji, now China's senior vice-premier in charge of economic reform). In the first nine months of 1994, a further 3,000 projects have been approved, for a nominal value of Dollars 7.7bn. Two-thirds of all the projects approved for Shanghai since 1988 have, in fact, been approved since the beginning of 1993. The aim of Mr Wang's commission is, he says, to provide 'one stamp, one bridge, one window and one station' for foreign investors. This seems to work. Shanghai is already, notes Mr Wang, home to investments (mostly joint ventures) by almost 140 leading multinationals, including Volkswagen, AEG and BASF of Germany, Pilkington of the UK, General Electric of the US and Philips of the Netherlands. The VW joint venture produces 100,000 cars a year and is, he says, expected to produce 200,000 soon. The question that must occur to any visitor is where cars that end up in Shanghai will fit. The biggest disadvantage of the city, apart from the relatively high cost of land, is the creaking infrastructure. Shanghai is choking. In rush hour, for example, it can take two hours to drive from Pudong to the Bund, the celebrated area of old Shanghai on the Huangpu river. In response, the municipal and central governments have invested Yn20bn (Dollars 2.3bn) in large projects in the past three years. There are now 10 more, while investment is running at Yn20bn a year. The authorities recognise the scale of the required investment and hope foreign investors will help fill the gaps. Investments include two completed bridges, an overhead inner ring-road, an outer ring road, a port, a new airport, new power plants and a new underground. Most important of all, in Pudong, across the river from old Shanghai, a new economic zone with an area of 522 sq km is being constructed. It already contains 4,000 industrial enterprises with 400,000 workers. Yet the city possesses advantages along with the drawbacks, now being partially remedied. It is, for example, China's principal port, with exports and imports of Dollars 12.7bn last year. It is also the country's financial capital, hosting the dynamic stock market and the still newer foreign exchange market, established only in April of this year. Shanghai contains China's largest reservoir of skilled labour. It has 50 colleges and universities, with a total enrolment of more than 120,000 students and 1,600 research and development institutes. Foreign employers praise the technical skills available, although skilled office staff is scarce. A particular concern - says Dr Hans Geelhaar, general manager of Shanghai Gao-BASF Dispersions - is a shortage of people who combine English with knowledge of modern accounting and finance. Employees used to traditional practices can also prove somewhat reluctant to take responsibility and display initiative. Inevitably, Shanghai has the problems of any old and long neglected city attempting rapid economic growth. But this particular old city has huge potential. Great difficulties lie ahead: some of the speculative building is, for example, certain to prove a mistake. But there is no mistaking either the energy of the people or the determination of the authorities. As befits the head of the dragon, Shanghai is roaring.

Addressing the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research  Institute, Hurd remarked that Turkey is becoming increasingly  closer to Europe. He noted that ways to advance this process  will be explored during the talks in Ankara. Hurd explained  that this process will be accelerated if Turkey resolves its  economic problems such as high inflation and the budget deficit  as soon as possible. Noting further that Turkey has great  knowledge and experience concerning its geographical region,  Hurd declared that Britain understands the struggle waged  against terrorism and believes that this problem will be  surmounted within the framework of democracy.</p>

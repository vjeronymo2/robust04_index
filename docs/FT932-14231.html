			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Observer: Border raid on Belgium There was something of a run on the Belgian franc yesterday morning, and, for once, the central bank was powerless to defend the currency - it managed to lose some BFr70m of it to armed robbers through its own back door. Even for connoisseurs of Belgian curiosities a successful robbery of the central bank is a rarity, and bank officials were keen to play down its importance. 'The robbers didn't attack the bank; they attacked a postal van,' insisted a bank spokesman, although he admitted that the raid had taken place in the bank's backyard. In other respects, the would-be speculators played it entirely by the book, mounting their dawn raid not on the bank's Brussels HQ but on an outlying sub-office near the Luxembourg border. Like many Belgians seeking to avoid home-country scrutiny of their income, the thieves may even have nipped across the frontier and tried to deposit the booty at one of the Grand Duchy's 200 or so banks. Could it have been an inside job? Bank officials were mystified as to how the thieves got in. Bank governor Alfons Verplaetse was in Basle for a meeting of EC central bankers, so he had a perfect alibi, as did Belgium's most wanted man, Patrick Haemers, who went on trial yesterday. Happily, there were no casualties in yesterday's raid, except perhaps the central bank's pride and, of course, the Belgian national debt - now up to BFr8,557,070,000,000.</p>

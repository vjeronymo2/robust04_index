			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD traders were divided yesterday on the likely direction of the market's next decisive move. An early rise in reaction against Friday's setback was capped by profit-taking at Dollars 395 a troy ounce and the price closed at Dollars 394.05 an ounce, up Dollars 1.30 on the day but Dollars 5.45 below last week's peak. At the London Metal Exchange the COPPER market continued Friday's retreat as profit-taking and general liquidation weighed down sentiment. Expected support at Dollars 1,950 a tonne failed to hold as the three months delivery contract slipped Dollars 46 to Dollars 1,937.50 a tonne. ALUMINIUM prices lost further ground following the International Primary Aluminium Institute's announcement of a 50,000-tonne rise in producer stocks in May, which reinforced bearish pressure. The three months price closed at Dollars 1,217.50 a tonne, down Dollars 27 on the day, taking it below the level ruling two weeks ago when Aluminum Company of America sparked an upturn with the announcement of plans for substantial production cuts. Dealers said disappointment at the failure of other producers to follow Alcoa's lead had eroded the constructive impact of that move. Compiled from Reuters</p>

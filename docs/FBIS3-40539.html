			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     The research group of Professor Takaaki Nagao and Assistant  Professor Mamoru Teruishi of the industrial mechanical  engineering department of the University of Tokyo's engineering  faculty has developed a precision machining system that can  fully use the senses of sight and hearing.    Precision machining, unlike ordinary machining, generates  virtually no noise. The beauty of the new system is that it  transforms resistance to cutting into artificial noise in  response to the degree of strength used. The operator feels as  if he has entered and is working in a micro-world which makes  his work easier. Assistant Professor Teruishi mentioned plans  for applying the technology to ``micromachine production,  computer board wiring modification, and micro-surgery such as  connecting nerves.''    This system can be used to detect strength when a strength  sensor is attached to a tool used in micro-work. It does  parallel processing by computer of output from the tool's  movement and strength sensor.    There are two types of methods of converting degree of  strength into noise. The first is to amplify directly the output  of the strength sensor into noise. The other is to create  man-made sound in proportion to strength. Either method produces  a man-made sound similar to that produced when large objects are  machined. In experiments, paint was removed that had been  painted on an aluminum alloy surface of several millimeters  angle. The tool had a long narrow chisel of 0.15 millimeters in  diameter. Paint was cut away as the operator watched tool's tip  displayed enlarged on a monitor screen by a charge coupled  device (CCD) camera. Human hand movements were conveyed through  a computer to the manipulator moving the chisel. It was  difficult to work with steady strength by relying on the monitor  image, so strength changed greatly. However, when man-made noise  was generated simultaneously, pushing was almost steadily  controlled at optimal value.    Operators who machine metals, woods, and other materials  make  use not only of sight, but also of hearing and of sensations  felt from the tool. Sound provides very valuable information for  machining. The strength and the highs and lows of the sound  generated by the contact between the tool and the machined  material is important for controlling the strength of the tool.    However, although reflected information can be collected by  microscope and CCD cameras and strength information can be  collected by strength sensors, it was difficult to make the  noise emitted by micro-machining loud enough for humans to hear  because it is lower than the noise level picked up by a  microphone.</p>

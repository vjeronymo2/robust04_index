			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Misstatement -- It was mistakenly stated in Wednesday's Calendar that the  Associated Press had reported that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Dept. had  suspended the Vertigo club's license. An AP story said that the department was  seeking a 30-day liquor-license suspension of the downtown club. The club  remains open.  </P></p>

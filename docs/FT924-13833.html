			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Algerians sign gas deal with Italy SONATRACH, Algeria's state oil and gas monopoly, has signed a 20-year contract with the Italian state electricity company ENEL whereby Sonatrach will deliver 4bn cubic metres of gas a year starting in 1995. The gas will go through the trans-Mediterranean pipeline which takes gas to the Italian mainland through Tunisia and the Straits of Sicily, and whose capacity is being doubled. The contract means Sonatrach will more than double its exports to Italy by the year 2000, to 30bn cubic metres a year. Mr Franco Viezzoli, president of ENEL, has signalled his company's wish to start immediate talks on doubling the amount it has contracted to buy. Gas now accounts for about 19 per cent of Italy's electricity, a figure set to rise 50 per cent by the year 2000. The contract with ENEL underlines the advantages for Sonatrach of the more flexible oil and gas policy adopted by Algeria since 1988. Selling gas for electricity generation is a competitive business if compared with the more rigid liquefied natural gas trade. Sonatrach hopes to double its gas output over the next few years as demand abroad has outstripped the company's capacity to deliver. Mr Hacen Mufti, Algeria's energy minister, has indicated Algeria will allow oil companies negotiating for enhanced oilfield recovery schemes the option of acquiring equity sharing in some oilfields. Premier Belaid Abdesselam appears to attach less importance than his predecessor, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, to getting large front-end cash bonuses from companies sharing in such schemes, preferring to stress the importance of developing proper technical models to develop the fields.</p>

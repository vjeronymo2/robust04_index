			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (4): Key lessons to be learned - Japan-EC trade relations NISSAN, the Japanese motor manufacturer, leapt in 1991 to become Britain's 14th largest exporter: 90 per cent of the cars built in its new UK plant are exported. It is playing a lead role - along with Toyota and Honda - in transforming the UK from a significant net importer of cars to a large net exporter. The strategic investments by Japanese car manufacturers in the UK over the past two years provide some striking insights into the EC's trade relationship with Japan. UK car imports fell 10 per cent in 1990, and a further 31 per cent last year. At the same time, exports leapt 20 per cent in 1990 and a further 21 per cent last year. The UK produces 400,000 more cars today than it did in 1984. Nissan alone spent Pounds 450m on supplies in 1991 - Pounds 350m of them coming from other UK companies. The trend will be magnified in 1993, when cars start rolling off production lines at Honda's plant in Swindon, and Toyota's Derbyshire factory. The evidence is clear: Japanese investment is playing a critical role in transforming a once-moribund British motoring industry. It has boosted competition across Europe, forcing other manufacturers to improve quality. Yet Japan, perhaps more than any other country, raises Europe's protectionist hackles. It is the hapless target of 150 import quotas, and of an average of 40 anti-dumping investigations every year. Products affected range from photocopiers and videos to toys, colour televisions and ball bearings. Behind this pressure from European industry for protection is a steadily-mounting trade surplus in Japan's favour. Exports to the EC rose from Dollars 54bn in 1990 to Dollars 59.6bn in 1991, while imports from the EC fell from more than Dollars 35bn in 1990 to Dollars 32bn in 1991 - leading to a visible trade balance in Japan's favour of Dollars 27.6bn. In the face of persistent complaints by 'big industry' in Europe that Japan 'dumps' products by using 'predatory pricing policies', the European Commission has bowed again and again to demands for protection. Sometimes 'countervailing duties' are imposed. In other instances 'voluntary' restraint agreements are reached under which Japanese exporters informally accept limits on the volume of products sold into the EC. At the same time, European exporters complain that Japan's domestic market is impenetrable. They cite arcane distribution networks, informal agreements between vertically-integrated 'families' of Japanese companies, and close collaboration between Japanese companies and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti). Objective evidence in support of either kind of complaint is hard to find, however. In the words of a recent report on Japan by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 'there is little evidence to support the contention that import impediments imposed by the (Japanese) government are a decisive factor in Japan's trade surpluses.' Similarly, the global trade watchdog, the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, concluded in its most recent study of Japan's trading practices that industrial groupings and local distribution practices 'may be less important than is often claimed.' Using much more robust language, Mr Phillip Oppenheim, in his new book 'Trade Wars', argues that 'trade barriers in Japan have been, and are, exaggerated, often for self-serving reasons.' He attacks European industrialists who lobby Brussels for protection as 'a pretty cossetted bunch of professional scapegoat-seekers.' Similar conclusions are reached by Mr Walter Eltis, director general of Britain's National Economic Development Office (Nedo) in a detailed study of the impact of recent Japanese trade and investment on British industry. Drawing parallels with Japan's impact on the UK car industry, Mr Eltis recalls the collapse in the 1980s of Europe's colour TV industry in the face of Japanese competition. His evidence shows that producers like Philips or Thorn may have suffered, but that consumers and workers alike benefited. While production by British-owned companies ground to a halt in 1988, the UK is now home for 18 of the 32 Japanese TV-manufacturing plants in Europe. A long-standing trade deficit in colour TV sets has been transformed, with the UK earning a Pounds 446m surplus in 1991. 'Today's mainly Japanese-owned industry is sufficiently competitive to make a very considerable net contribution to the balance of payments when the previous British-owned companies had entirely failed to achieve the price and quality standards set by international competition,' he notes. In parallel with Japan's growing trade surplus with Europe has been the ten-fold growth in Japanese investment over the decade, largely driven by the creation of Europe's single market on January 1 1993. After peaking at over Dollars 67bn in in 1989, Japan's direct investment settled to Dollars 45bn in 1990, lifting the cumulative total to more than Dollars 250bn. While almost 80 per cent of Japanese investment has been in non-manufacturing areas like banking and insurance, the residual 20 per cent has generated an estimated 94,000 jobs in 500 plants across the EC  - almost all opened since 1985, and at an 'infant' stage where significant further expansion is expected. The UK has been the prime target for Japanese investment, partly for reasons of language, regional incentives, and the role of the city of London, but significantly because of the British government's positive support for investment. In allowing wholly-Japanese-owned plants on green field sites, the UK government has enabled Japanese manufacturers to import state-of-the-art technologies, and labour relations unsullied by entrenched trade union practices. One can argue therefore that within the EC, Britain has perhaps been the main beneficiary of trade and investment relations with Japan. Investment has helped to speed industrial restructuring, and has begun to create new industry attitudes to the concept of quality. Although Europe's trade and investment relationship with Japan has generated much political heat, it is important to provide perspective by emphasising how comparatively small a part Europe continues to play as a destination of Japanese goods or investment. According to data compiled by Mr Jocelyn Probert at Insead's Euro-Asia Centre in France, Japan in 1991 accounted for 2 per cent of the EC's exports, while just 5 per cent of the EC's imports came from Japan. The EC accounts for only 6 per cent of Japan's foreign investment, and in 1990 attracted just a quarter of the Japanese investment flowing into the US. This occurred at a time when the EC was the world's leading recipient of investment, accounting for almost 45 per cent of global investment flows in 1990. Needless to say, the US remains Europe's biggest source of investment. A number of recent developments also suggest Japanese investment flows to Europe will slip back in the mid-1990s: Investment linked with 'strategic positioning' ahead of creation of the single market is now mostly in place. Recession in Europe means that most recently-built Japanese plants have more than enough capacity to cope with foreseeable demand. The bursting of the 'bubble economy' in Japan means that many of Japan's strongest foreign investors are hard-pressed, more inclined to pull in horns rather than add to investments overseas. Higher Japanese interest rates mean investment capital is more expensive today than it was throughout the 1980s. Whatever the likely trend for the immediate future, the fact of the 1980s has been that Japan has emerged to play a significant role in the EC, both as an exporter and an investor. Most reliable evidence suggests that Europe is gaining more from this relationship than it is losing - whatever the special pleading of protected European manufacturers. The best strategy for the 1990s must therefore be, in Mr Eltis's words, 'to have the Japanese firmly inside Europe as role models for others to learn from . . . and learn with the greatest possible rapidity.'</p>

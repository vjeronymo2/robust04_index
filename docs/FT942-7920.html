			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Analysts still wary of Fed 'neutrality' - London The response from UK stock market analysts to the Federal Reserve's eagerly anticipated rate rises sounded somewhat muted by the end of the week, particularly when contrasted with the applause which preceded the move. Confident predictions that the Fed had set the stage for a rally in global bond markets which would set London stocks free to celebrate economic recovery are now carrying the health warning: 'dollar permitting'. Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research, who is still the most bearish of the UK analysts, has told clients bluntly that the US bond rally would not hold and that the dollar's failure was beginning 'to look terminal'; this scenario implies sharply higher US rates, he warns. London markets have shown themselves more readily influenced than continental European markets by developments in the US, and Mr Knight remains pessimistic about interest rate trends in the UK 'and the impact of rising rates on equity prices'. Nikko Securities rejects the assumption that the Fed's statement implies that it has 'achieved neutrality', and believes the Fed remains willing to raise rates further if need be. The chances of the Footsie climbing convincingly away from 3,150 this week will depend on the progress of the bond markets, and of course, the dollar. But since the Fed is unlikely to move again so soon after last week's broadside, share prices can still respond to good news. The broader market remains weak, however. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index has fallen almost 2 per cent this month, contrasting with an admittedly unimpressive 0.3 per cent gain in the FT-SE 100 Index. Nervousness ahead of the German money supply figures may prove a distraction for the UK market. There are plenty of healthy company results in the pipeline, with building industry groups likely to show the beneficial effects of the slide in UK interest rates over the past 12 months. The oil share sector continues to have a significant impact on market trends, if only because of the international stance of the blue chip stocks and the background of global crude oil prices. Indeed, oil prices are probably the most significant factor in the Enterprise/Lasmo bid situation. But excellent first-quarter results from BP and some US majors should not overshadow the impact of the 24 per cent rise in oil prices since the end of March. The NatWest Securities oil team believes the market may now have seen the largest part of the oil price recovery and while some further increase is likely, emphasis may now shift to such other factors as the squeeze on downstream margins. NatWest says that BP, notwithstanding its recent outperformance of around 22 per cent to the market, remains 15 to 20 per cent below its relative standing to Shell in the late 1980s. The unexpected increased BP dividend will emphasise the pressure to switch from Shell into BP.</p>

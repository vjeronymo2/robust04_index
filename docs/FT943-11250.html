			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / French may delay Rwanda pullout: UN reinforcements may not arrive before deadline for France's withdrawal Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday hinted he might postpone the departure of some 2,000 French peacekeeping troops in south-western Rwanda if the safety of civilians were at risk. Aid agencies have been urging the French to stay beyond the expiry of their UN mandate on August 22 to prevent another mass exodus of Hutu refugees into Zaire. Mr Balladur, who was on a visit to Goma, in Zaire, to inspect the pullout of troops, said: 'If we felt our action (withdrawal) could make the situation more fragile and cause new unrest, a new exodus, that would certainly weigh upon our decision.' He was speaking after touring the civilian safe havens created by France's Operation Turquoise in Rwanda. The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front, which took power in Rwanda two weeks ago, claims sovereignty over the French-controlled territory but has avoided entering the area so as not to sow panic among the 2m Hutus who have sought sanctuary in the French zone. The RPF has, however, asked the French forces to disarm Hutu militia and former government soldiers who have taken refuge behind French lines. South-western Rwanda was the scene of some of the worst massacres perpetrated by Hutu extremists against the minority Tutsi community. Fewer than 12,000 Tutsis survive in an area where more than 100,000 once lived. UN officials believe reinforcements from other countries are unlikely to arrive in time to replace the French by the August 22 deadline. 'Rwanda may suffer another humanitarian catastrophe unless the international community can pull itself together in the next few days,' Mr Peter Hansen, UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, said in Nairobi. He said the response of western countries to a UN appeal for an enlarged peacekeeping operation in Rwanda had been 'pathetic'. Goma was chosen as the main base for France's Operation Turquoise but the intervention has been eclipsed by the needs of 1.2m Hutus who invaded the border town following the RPF victory in Rwanda. Mr Balladur confirmed that France would leave logistics units in Goma to support the relief operation for the refugees. Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, made a separate visit to Goma yesterday to step up US assistance to hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees at risk from cholera, dysentery and starvation. He inspected a US water purification plant on the shores of Lake Kivu, which is only operating at half capacity because there are not enough tankers available to deliver clean water to the camps. Mr Perry also visited Kigali, the Rwandan capital, where US troops are set to start a round-the-clock airlift for the Rwandan refugees. 'We should be able to more than double the flow almost immediately of supplies into Goma by using the Kigali airport,' he said. He is expected to report on the aid effort to President Bill Clinton, who asked Congress on Friday to provide an additional Dollars 320m (Pounds 206m) for Rwanda's humanitarian crisis.</p>

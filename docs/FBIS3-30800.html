The shell  was lobbed from 1-1.5 km within the territory under the control  of Muslim forces, in relation to the separation line with the  Army of the republic of Srpska.    This was confirmed to a TANJUG correspondent this evening by  very reliable and confidential sources in the UN Protection  Forces Command who wished to remain anonymous. [passage omitted]</p>

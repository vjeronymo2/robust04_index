			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: MORE EATERIES:  </P> <P> Cafe Capistrano, 31752 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Open daily, 7  a.m. to 4 p.m. (714) 493-0607. A cross between a truck stop and a country  kitchen, this place exudes the kind of small-town, Western flair that attracts  customers with cowboy boots and turquoise jewelry.  </P> <P> Be sure to sit by the window for a view of the mission and great people  watching. And ask for the Capistrano Omelette: peanut butter, apricot-pineapple  preserves and bacon.  </P> <P> Las Barcas Mexican Restaurant, 21032 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. Open daily,  11 a.m. to 9 p.m. (714) 536-2616. Oversized portions, the hodgepodge decor and  a colorful variety of local folk make this tiny eatery a beachside winner. The  food is good and cheap, featuring ranchero-covered burritos, fresh snapper  tacos and homemade tortilla chips. Be prepared to take out, though, there's  always a crowd. AMY McCURDY  </P></p>

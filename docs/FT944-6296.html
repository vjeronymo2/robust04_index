			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Minister in credit after uneasy past - Profile of Jonathan Aitken, colourful chief secretary Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, may receive the plaudits for the Budget speech. But Mr Jonathan Aitken, the chief secretary to the Treasury, will be hoping for much of the credit for the substantial public spending cuts announced yesterday. Since his appointment as Treasury minister in charge of expenditure last summer, Mr Aitken has been in the headlines - but nearly always for the wrong reasons. He was the subject of newspaper investigations into his associations with Middle Eastern businessmen, including Mr Wafic Said, one of the world's most successful arms dealers. He was accused of breaking parliamentary rules by failing to fully disclose a stay at the Ritz Hotel in Paris. And, although he has escaped unscathed from these allegations so far, some Tory MPs privately admit that the 52-year-old cabinet minister's past - 'long as your arm' as it was once described - could still cause him difficulties. But the substantial expenditure cuts announced in the Budget yesterday may mark a turning point in his brief cabinet career. When Mr Aitken was appointed chief secretary in Mr John Major's reshuffle last summer, there was comment - and concern - at Westminster about his colourful past. A self-made millionaire and nephew of newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook, his curriculum vitae includes exploits with which few Tory cabinet ministers would wish to be associated. In the 1960s he campaigned for the legalisation of cannabis. In 1970, he was prosecuted under section two of the Official Secrets Act (he was eventually acquitted) after obtaining a confidential Ministry of Defence document confirming that the UK was supplying arms to Nigeria. His later business activities included an association with the Slater Walker group in the 1970s. In 1982 he attracted yet more controversy after rescuing TV-AM, the breakfast TV company, in a boardroom coup. But it is his reputation for careful diplomacy which explains why he was moved to the Treasury in the run-up to a Budget whose main theme has been public-sector restraint. A firm rightwinger and free-marketeer, Mr Aitken has never hidden his determination to see public expenditure reduced wherever possible. But he has conducted negotiations with spending ministers in a more friendly manner than Mr Michael Portillo, his abrasive predecessor. Much of that experience of careful negotiation was honed in his previous job as the defence minister charged with cutting some Pounds 750m from military spending. It is striking that the chancellor pointed out yesterday how Mr Aitken had carried out those defence cuts without upsetting service chiefs. But some Tory MPs have been dismissive of Mr Aitken's performance in his first spending round. They argue Mr Portillo had already done the groundwork by introducing his Fundamental Expenditure Reviews and taking the 'political pain' of signalling tough measures. They also say the task of cutting expenditure this year will have been easier, because of better-than-expected figures for inflation which will reduce wage and benefit costs. However, if the Treasury's projections for public borrowing come true, his job will get easier. And, in his first rocky months in the cabinet, he has proved to the press and opposition MPs that he is a tough political survivor whom it will be difficult to dislodge.</p>

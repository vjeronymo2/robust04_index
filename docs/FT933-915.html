			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Opec talks stumble over quotas for Kuwait, Iran THE allocation of new production quotas to Kuwait and Iran emerged last night as one of the main stumbling blocks facing oil ministers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in their attempts to halt the recent slide in oil prices. The 13 ministers will meet in closed session in Geneva this morning to review progress made so far in talks aimed at setting a new overall production ceiling and quota allocations to individual Opec states. An Iranian delegate last night dismissed a quota figure proposed for Iran as 'far away' from that which the Tehran government wanted. Iran is understood to object to special treatment for Kuwait, which left the production ceiling earlier this year after unsuccessfully demanding parity with the United Arab Emirates. According to one Arab delegate, Iran wants a similar percentage increase to that which might be offered to Kuwait. He suggested Kuwait might drop its parity demand if it won an allocation of close to 2m barrels per day. Yesterday a sub-committee of 'three wise men' plus Mr Subroto, the Indonesian secretary general of Opec, met the Saudi Arabian, Iranian, Nigerian and Algerian delegations in a series of bilateral meetings. They are due to meet Kuwait officials before today's full ministerial meeting, at which time the 'wise men' may propose a new production ceiling to replace the existing one of 23.5m b/d. The ceiling has been widely ignored by a number of Opec states, whose over-production has combined with low demand and the prospect of growing output from other sources, including the North Sea, to drive down prices. A Gulf Arab delegate said the 'desired ceiling was in the range of 24m-24.5m b/d, the level of recent Opec production. He suggested the market could bear an Opec ceiling as high as 25m b/d, but conceded that it would not improve prices, a priority for all member states. Analysts say any successful agreement would require Saudi Arabia to maintain or even cut its output.</p>

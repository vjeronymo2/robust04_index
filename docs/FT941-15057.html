			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK figures point to strong growth and low inflation A clutch of economic statistics yesterday added to recent evidence that the UK is enjoying an unusually favourable combination of strengthening growth and low inflation. December's producer price index shows that companies did not pass on the full amount of the Budget increases in excise duties. 'Inflation is under better control than it has been for a quarter of a century' claimed Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the UK Treasury. Other economic news pointed to a robust growth picture: December retail sales volumes recorded their highest annual increase since April 1990, according to the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey. The rise in sales was felt across the industry and confirms anecdotal evidence of a buoyant Christmas shopping season. November's industrial production figures indicate that output has returned to pre-recessionary levels, with the index reaching 100.2 (1990 = 100). Over the three months to November, the annual increase in production was 2.7 per cent, compared with the same period in 1992. Manufacturing output in the three months to November was 0.8 per cent higher than in the previous three months and 1.8 per cent higher than in the same period in 1992. The Central Statistical Office revised upwards, from 1 to 1.5 per cent, its estimate for the annual trend in manufacturing output growth. Unit wage costs in the manufacturing sector rose by 0.2 per cent in the three months to November, compared with the same period in 1992. Productivity measures continued to improve with increases in manufacturing output per person employed, and per working hour. The labour cost statistics, which showed a lower increase than expected, backed up the evidence of producer prices that UK industry faces restrained cost pressures. The producers' output price index rose by 0.5 per cent between November and December. Although this was higher than expected, and pushed the annual increase up to 4 per cent, from 3.6 per cent in November, the CSO said if the Budget rise in excise duties had been passed on in full, the monthly rise would have been 0.7 per cent. The main reason was that lower crude oil prices offset higher excise duties on petrol. High sales confirmed, Page 10</p>

The former chief minister, Mr S.  Bangarappa, today said his new regional party, the Karnataka  Congress, proposed to contest all the assembly seats in the  elections. He however, added that the issue of having seat  adjustments with political parties such as the Janata Dal was  still open.    Addressing a news conference here to announce the formal  launching of his party, Mr Bangarappa said a decision on the  party aligning with other political parties would be taken by  the parliamentary board of the party, adding that he could not  make any announcement suo motu. "As of today the Karnataka  Congress plans to field candidates in all the assembly  questions. However, I will keep the matter of seat adjustment  open," he added.    Mr Bangarappa maintained that his party was the real  Congress  as the Congress under the present leadership of the Prime  Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, had failed to uphold the  principles and ideologies laid down by the founding fathers of  the party.    Mr Bangarappa said the response from the people to his new  regional party was overwhelming. This was one of the reasons for  him to advance his earlier programme of launching his party in  April in Davangere at a public meeting apart from the fact that  there was a possibility of the zilla and taluk panchayat  elections being announced any moment.    Mr Bangarappa admitted that many regional and national  parties launched in the past were a failure. However the latest  trend was of regional parties and he was optimistic of a bright  future for his party.    To a question whether the Samajwadi and Bahujan Samaj party  combine parties success in Uttar Pradesh had prompted him to  launch a regional party, Mr Bangarappa replied in the negative  and said there was no need for him to go so far when regional  parties such as the AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra  Kazhagam) and the Telugu Desam had clicked in the neighbouring  states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.    On the decision to field candidates in all the assembly  constituencies and whether the purpose was to defeat the  Congress or ensure the victory of the new party's candidates, Mr  Bangarappa quipped: "Suppose the same members had continued in  the Congress headed by Mr Rao, do you think they would have won?  It is not a question of victory or defeat for the Karnataka  Congress but a matter of principles."    Mr Bangarappa, however, made it clear that tickets would not  be given to those who would want to contest from his party after  they are denied a ticket from the Congress.    Mr Bangarappa said he would be launching his campaign by  touring the districts from January 10. This would also help him  to gauge the situation regarding his party position vis-vis the  other parties.    Mr Bangarappa said he would be the president of the party  till a president was elected in a democratic manner. Ad hoc  executive and parliamentary committees would be formed shortly,  he added.    He said since his party was based on the principles and  programmes of the traditional Congress. It would have the  Congress flag and `get the symbol allotted by the election  commission.'    Mr Bangarappa, also demanded the resignation of the Prime  Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, on the alleged involvement of  his family members in the multi-crore securities scam.    He said the Prime Minister had said that follow-up action on  the report of the Joint Parliamentary committee which went into  the securities scam would be taken up within three months. Since  the names of the family members of the Prime Minister figured in  the report, Mr Rao had no right to order any follow-up action,  he added.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P puts Dai-Ichi Kangyo debt ratings under review STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, is reviewing debt ratings of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, for a possible downgrade. S&amp;P said it had placed its AA - rating on DKB's long-term debt and A-1+ rating on its short-term debt on a 'creditwatch with negative implications' due to the bank's substantial level of non-performing loans. DKB's non-performing loans totalled Y1,300bn (Dollars 12.3bn) at the end of March this year, comprising 3.8 per cent of total loans. S&amp;P said while non-performing loans at all Japanese banks were expected to rise during last fiscal year to March 1993, the increase at DKB was greater than expected. The credit agency will evaluate the extent of DKB's asset deterioration and assess the impact on the bank's operating profits over the medium term.</p>

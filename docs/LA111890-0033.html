			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TICKET TO BOOGIE  </P> <P> Re Lisa Wolfenbarger's Oct. 21 letter (which complained about people blocking  the view at rock concerts): You're damn right any ticket I buy to a rock  concert entitles me to boogie till the cows come home. Real rock 'n' roll is a  passionate form of music that rarely calls for sitting on your keister.  </P> <P> If you're too old (in your heart) to rock 'n' roll, please stay home! Or go see  Barry Manilow next time.  </P> <P> PEG POLLARD  </P> <P> Rancho Bernardo  </P></p>

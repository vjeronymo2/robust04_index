			<p>BFN     [Text] Some soldiers are removing their military uniforms  and hiding among Rwandan refugees in Uganda. They are hiding  among refugees. It is understandable for one to take refuge,  especially if one does not want to assist the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF] combatants in fighting the war. However, it is not  understable for one to take refuge and hide one's identity. How  would one know there is no other objective?    Why do the soldiers want to hide among civilians? We have  spoken on several occasions about the mistreatment of people in  our country. Enemies hide where civilians are taking refuge and  then start killing them. There is that possibility.    Let us hope that the government forces who are fleeing and  hiding do not have such plans. They should not try to hide.  They should wear their military uniforms while in hiding.  There is war so they can flee but they should present  themselves to the Ugandan authorities who will show them where  to stay. They should not stay in the country disguised as  civilians. It is better for them to identify themselves rather  than to disguise themselves.</p>

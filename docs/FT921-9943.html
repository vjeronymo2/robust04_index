			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Ukraine beats tactical retreat on Black Sea fleet command THE war of words between Russia and the Ukraine over the Black Sea Fleet based in the Crimea seemed yesterday to produce a tactical retreat by the Ukrainian President, Mr Leonid Kravchuk. This follows a threat by the Russian parliament this week to open the issue of whether Crimea should be part of Russia or Ukraine. At the same time, another senior figure in Russia's defence establishment called for an end to delay in creating a Russian military force. The issue of the military command is due to be discussed by the heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Minsk next Friday. Mr Kravchuk said he would insist in Minsk that Ukraine has a fleet for the defence of its borders. 'We do not say that we want a big Black Sea fleet - that is not necessary for us.' His comments appear to bring the Ukrainian leadership more into line with what has been proposed by the military commanders and the Russian leadership  -that is, that the bulk of the Black Sea fleet remains a 'strategic' part of the CIS naval forces, leaving a small part as a Ukrainian coastguard. However, the issue is complicated by the growing sentiment in Russia for its own forces - which would include the Black Sea Fleet. Mr Alexander Kotionkov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's committee on defence, said yesterday that the 'planned creation' of separate republican armies and their collaboration in a Nato-type union would be better than the 'painful uncertainty' now facing the Soviet military. Echoing General Konstantin Kobets, military adviser to the Russian president, earlier this week, Mr Kotionkov said that Russia needed its own military doctrine and called for a more coherent structure of political decision-making on military matters. At present, he said, seven committees and organisations had some responsibility for military decisions - meaning that no one was ultimately responsible. The Ukraine is willing to take over, together with Russia, the entire foreign debt of the former Soviet Union, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister said yesterday, Reuters reports from Bonn. Quoting President Kravchuk, Mr Mollemann told reporters, 'Ukraine is prepared to take over its part and additional parts from other republics (of the CIS)'. Under the Ukrainian plan, the other CIS states would be relieved of payment obligations on their foreign debt. The government and bank debt of the former Soviet Union is estimated to total some Dollars 70bn (Pounds 39bn).</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: W German inflation declines West German inflation resumed its slow decline during July, dropping to 2.9 per cent from 3 per cent in June, according to preliminary figures issued yesterday. The fall, which came later than expected because of unusually sharp fluctuations in summer food prices, is now forecast to continue in September after a standstill in August. Economists predict a 2.5 per cent rate by the end of the year. Fresh data from the engineering sector yesterday showed a real 26 per cent increase in demand for German machinery and plant during June. Foreign orders surged 44 per cent above year-earlier levels, while bookings from domestic customers rose 11 per cent, the VDMA industry association said. While the month's figures indicate continuing economic recovery in the industry's main export markets in the European Union - where demand was up 34 per cent - they may have been distorted by bookings of unusually large contracts. However, orders in the first six months of this year were 10 per cent higher than in the same period of 1993, the association said. Export demand was up 19 per cent while German orders rose only 1 per cent. Christopher Parkes, Frankfurt French household spending on manufactured goods rose 0.3 per cent in June after falling a revised 1.1 per cent in May, the national statistics institute, Insee, said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given this situation, one approach would be to wait until after the new rules and procedures have been in place for an entire presidential election cycle before evaluating what additional streamlining methods are warranted, if any. In the alternative, the Commission welcomes suggestions for further streamlining these processes, and seeks comments on several possible changes that are explained below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission notes that it is important to ensure that whatever streamlining measures are adopted do not adversely affect the statutorily required audit process, the committees' due process rights when repayment determinations are made, or the Commission's ability to effectively conduct subsequent enforcement actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for modifications to the actual audit and repayment processes, the Commission is first considering whether the committee's oral presentation should be held at an earlier point. Currently a committee may request the opportunity to make an oral presentation if the committee submits written materials disputing the initial repayment determination contained in the FAR. 11 CFR 9007.2(c)(3), 9038.2(c)(3). Please note that the Commission is not considering adding a second hearing to the audit and repayment processes, but only whether the current hearing should be held at a different point. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission recognizes that some committees might prefer to make this presentation earlier in the process. Moving up the hearing could also help the Commission resolve issues at an earlier date. However, it is unclear whether advancing the hearing would in and of itself shorten either the audit or repayment process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's experience has been that many issues are resolved or narrowed as the audit progresses and the amount of the repayment is further refined. Hence, an earlier date could result in a longer, less manageable hearing on more issues. To date, the Commission has averaged only five oral hearings per cycle, because sufficient issues were resolved in or before the FAR in the other audits to make a hearing unnecessary. The earlier in the process a hearing is held, the more likely it is that a committee will request one. This approach could thus slow down, rather than speed up, the audit process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also seeks comments on whether to shorten the time between various stages of the audit, repayment, and enforcement processes, or to eliminate some of these stages. For example, the IAR currently includes a preliminary repayment calculation, while the FAR includes an initial repayment determination. 11 CFR 9007.1(c), (d); 9038.1(c), (d). The Commission issues the final repayment determination following consideration of the initial repayment determination in the FAR, along with,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  information contained in the committee's written response or presented at the hearing, if one is held. 11 CFR 9007.2(c)(4), 9038.2(c)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One alternative would be to include the initial repayment determination in the IAR, and include the final repayment determination and statement of reasons in the FAR. The committee would then respond to the IAR with a written statement and could request the opportunity to make an oral presentation, as is now done following the FAR. This hearing and related documentation would serve as the basis for the FAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee would continue to have the right to petition for a rehearing, in accordance with 11 CFR 9007.5 and 9038.5, but would exercise this right following the FAR/final repayment determination, rather than after the later, separately-issued final repayment determination that occurs under the present rules. Please note that including the initial repayment determination in the IAR would not change the rule that issuance of an IAR serves as notification of repayment determinations. See 11 CFR 9007.2(a)(2) and 9038.2(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A variation of this approach would be to provide a staff draft of the IAR to the committee at the same time it is sent to the Commission, much in the manner that the Commission currently provides a probable cause to believe brief to respondents pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(3). The committee could provide a written response to the staff-prepared IAR and request a hearing before the Commission. The hearing and additional materials submitted would serve as the basis for the Commission's adoption of the FAR. The Commission would subsequently issue the final repayment determination and statement of reasons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this approach could take less time, committees might prefer to know when they are preparing their responses whether the Commission agrees with the staff's analysis of the issues presented. This would not be possible if the committee received the staff draft of the IAR at the same time it was sent to the Commission. Also, the staff draft could not contain an interim repayment determination, as that must be approved by the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is also concerned with how confidentiality requirements could impact on these proposed revisions. When committee activities raise both repayment and enforcement issues, the current confidentiality provisions require that matters already determined by the Commission to warrant enforcement action not be made public during the Commission's discussion of the initial repayment determination. For example, the publicly released FAR does not discuss the referral of specific matters for enforcement under 2 U.S.C. 437g. See 11 CFR 9007.1(e)(2), 9038.1(e)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

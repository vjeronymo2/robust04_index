			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Following the agreement with the Paris  Club on the rescheduling of Algeria's official debts, conditions  of the agreement and modalities of the repayment of the debts  were the main topics of the news conference held yesterday by  Minister of Finance Ahmed Benbitour. More details with  Abdelkader Djeridi.    [Djeridi] Minister of Finance Ahmed Benbitour stated at  yesterday's news conference that the agreement on rescheduling  Algeria's official debts, signed on 31 May 1994, stipulated a  gradual repayment as from the fifth year [1999].    The minister of finance pointed out that such a method,  known  as a shared repayment, was different from the method drawn up by  the Houston Club for debtor countries with a low income.    As concerns Algeria, whose $5 billion in debts were  rescheduled over 16 years with a four-year grace period, it  would be paying from the fifth year 1.39 percent of the original  loans. It would be paying 2.17 percent in the sixth year, 3.06  percent in the seventh year, 4.08 percent in the eighth year and  so forth. Accordingly, in eight years Algeria would have paid  10.7 percent of the original loan and in 10 years 22.5 percent,  he added.    Houston conditions would, according to the minister, have  cost the country 28.6 percent more in 10 years.    The minister of finance also pointed out that the agreement  with the Paris Club would allow Algeria to go back to the  financial markets. He affirmed that the agreement, which was  supported by a letter of intent, would open the way for another  meeting with the Paris Club next year.    As far as commercial debts were concerned, Mr Ahmed  Benbitour  pointed out that talks on the technicalities were under way  between Algerian banks and foreign banks in order find out  whether such debts could be refinanced or rescheduled with the  London Club. In either case, however, commercial debts would not  exceed the amount of the official debts that were recheduled  recently.    As far as banking system was concerned, the minister said he  would support any initiative to set up private banks for the  sake of creating competition within the Algerian banking system.    [Announcer] On the other hand, the minister of finance has  given more details on the agreement with the Paris Club, and  asserted that Algeria had big development potential, had made a  great leap forward in the economic reforms, and had the ability  to find solutions.    [Djeridi] Mr Benbitour has affirmed that Algeria has, in  addition, human, hydrocarbon, agricultural, and huge  infrastructural potentials which could be developed further.  When these winning cards are well utilized, Algeria can  overcome its crisis, he added. However, population growth,  which is serious, would create huge social demands and require a  production mechanism which would reach 50 percent of its  potential.    In this context, Ahmed Benbitour pointed out that Algeria  could achieve growth of 3 percent this year and 6 percent in  1995, without having to look for further investment. The  potential of the existing installations was sufficient to meet  such a target as long as there was a good supply of semifinished  raw materials.    In a second stage, production could be increased to more  than  70 percent through industrial restructuring, more investment,  and fruitful partnership.    At his news conference, Minister of Finance Ahmed Benbitour  dwelt on the economic program. It is based on economic growth  through developing the gas sector as well as small and medium  companies, creating jobs and economic stability, and controlling  the money supply and inflation.</p>

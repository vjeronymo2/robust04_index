			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Restoring fish stocks in north Wales The tunnelling company of TRAFALGAR HOUSE CONSTRUCTION has won a design and construct contract in north Wales to build a Pounds 410,000 fish pass around the Conwy Falls, near Betws-y-Coed. The fish pass is designed to restore stocks of salmon and sewin in the upper reaches of the River Conwy and its plans have been under discussion for 10 years. The company and its consulting engineers, Donaldson Associates, won the contract after submitting an alternative proposal to the Conwy Trust and the National Rivers Authority. The fish pass has been specifically designed so as not to spoil the scenic beauty of the area and trees which have to be removed while work is in progress will be replanted. The pass will consist of a 48 metre tunnel containing 28 separate pools to allow the fish to move upstream. As the river prevents access to either end of the tunnel, work will commence with the sinking of a 14 metre deep circular access shaft adjacent to the falls. From this shaft the company will drive a tunnel 15 metres uphill and 33 metres downhill without breaking through to the surface. All the work on the shaft and tunnels will involve hand drilling and blasting with debris being removed by a grab mounted on the end of a crane. The breakthrough will form the last stage of the project as water must be kept out of the tunnel to allow the construction of the pools. The pools will be formed from reinforced concrete and will be about three sq metres , allowing the energy of the water to be dissipated and making the fish's 13 metre ascent easier. The level between pools will be 500mm and a notch will be carved in the tunnel wall to assist the fish's climb. Walkways will be installed over the pools and will be reached via the original access shaft which will be capped and covered with a manhole. The scheme will be completed in time to attract fish migrating upriver in the autumn.</p>

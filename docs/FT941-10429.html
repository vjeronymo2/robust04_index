			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Commonwealth Bank surges 32% to ADollars 318m midway Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which has been partially privatised over the past three years but is still 50.1 per cent government-owned, yesterday provided further evidence of the recovery in the Australian banking sector. It reported a 32.1 per cent rise in after-tax profits in the six months to end-December. CBA said it made a net profit of ADollars 317.9m (USDollars 228m) in the period, compared with ADollars 240.7m a year earlier. Earnings per share were 35.5 cents, up from 27.8 cents, and the interim dividend goes up by 4 cents to 24 cents. CBA admitted it had been a mixed half-year. Competition in the mortgage market, the pressure on margins following the general reduction in interest rates, and low levels of demand for business finance hampered progress. As a result, interest income fell by just over 10 per cent to ADollars 3.04bn, and operating profit slipped to ADollars 2.13bn, compared with ADollars 2.25bn in the previous year. The interest spread during the half-year was 3.34 per cent, against 3.61 per cent, while the interest margin dropped by almost 10 per cent, to 3.86 per cent. However, the boost to profits came from a much lower charge for bad and doubtful debts. This totalled ADollars 182.9m in the six months, against ADollars 346.5m last time. By the end of the period, CBA's net non-accrual loans stood at ADollars 1.29bn, down 27.3 per cent on the ADollars 1.77bn at the end of 1992. CBA said staff expenses were stable at ADollars 826.7m, with some initial savings from the bank's operational restructuring offset by a resumption of superannuation payments last July. Looking forward, CBA said the improving economy should further help the bad debt situation, and increase business demand for finance. However, it warned that 'strong competitive pressures . . . will continue'. 'The contraction of revenue has stabilised in the past six months, but the constraints on net interest income will remain in the short-term at least,' said Mr David Murray, managing director. The outcome for the full year, he added, should be 'satisfactory'.</p>

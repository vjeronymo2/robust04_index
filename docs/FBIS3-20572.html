Grain  system reform in China's market economy has become a hot spot to  which economists and government policy departments pay close  attention. Thus, this newspaper is printing portions of the key  problems research report (the full text of which consists of  approximately 70,000 words) of the Rural Development Institute  of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. This report was  managed and written by the noted agricultural economist, Mr.  Deng Yiming [6772 0001 7686]. It is hoped that this report will  cause more experts and scholars to pay close attention to and  further examine the problem of grain market reform.    By now grain prices have been substantially deregulated  throughout the country, and grain markets have been opened up.  However, because of the incompletely developed market mechanism  as well as frictions between the new and the old systems, some  new problems will unavoidably appear in the wake of grain market  deregulation. Only by facing these problems squarely can reform  be further intensified.  <H5>  The Grain Price Fluctuation Problem </H5>   Price fluctuations are unavoidable during the period of  change from planned grain procurement and marketing to a market  mechanism. The reasons are three:    1) The peasant household grain self-sufficiency rate is  high,  but the commodity rate is low.    In China, approximately 80 percent of the population is  engaged in agriculture, and the grain self-sufficiency rate is  approximately 70 percent. Thus, during lean harvest and bumper  harvest years, the decline and rise in the market supply of  grain is greater than in a country in which all grain is  commodity grain.    2) The peasant household degree of self-sufficiency is high,  but the elasticity of supply and demand is slight.    In China, where the degree of self-sufficiency in grain  production is fairly high, the elasticity in grain supply and  demand is much lower than in a country where all grain is  commodity grain. According to price elasticity theory, when the  supply and demand curves change causing a rise or fall in  prices, supply and demand curve elasticity determines the size  of the price change. In China, which has high self-sufficiency  in grain production, once the grain market is deregulated,  market price fluctuations are bound to intensify because of the  low elasticity of supply and demand.    3) The risk avoidance behavior of grain producers and  consumers.    Chinese peasant households farm on a very small scale, each  household farming an average 6.4 mu. The same applies to the  scale of products farmed. The commodity grain rate is low, each  household supplying approximately 600 kilograms of commodity  grain a year. Storage capacity is very small. Peasant household  reaction to market prices is very much the same. In bumper  harvest years when market supply increases, grain prices fall.  Peasant household expect prices will fall further, so they rush  to the markets to sell off their grain. This causes a sudden  increase in the grain supply. Supply is far greater than demand.  This drives grain prices far down. In lean harvest years when  market supply declines, grain prices rise, and peasants expect  that prices will rise further. They hoard their grain, thereby  further decreasing the supply of grain in the market. This  drives prices up, intensifying market grain price fluctuations.    In China, city and town residents are the main grain  consumers. An overwhelming majority of them have low incomes, so  they are unable to withstand great ups and downs in prices.  Market deregulation, which causes a slight grain shortage,  frequently results in panic buying, which causes a tremendous  rise in grain prices in turn. When grain market prices fall,  urban residents expect that grain prices will continue to fall.  A wait-and-see attitude results in low market demand for grain,  so the market price continues to fall. The foregoing features of  grain producer and grain consumer production and consumption is  risk avoidance behavior following the setting of grain prices by  the market. This behavior seeks to reduce to the minimum both  production and consumption risk.  <H5>  The Problem of Grain Price Differences </H5>   During the period of state monopoly procurement and  marketing, the price paid peasants for their grain was held down  in order to industrialize rapidly, and transportation expenses  were borne by the state. This permitted the maintenance of low  consumer prices, which were in keeping with low consumer wages.  Thus, industry made super profits. However, this dampened  peasant interest in growing grain, thereby accentuating the  difference between supply and demand for grain. In order to  increase the grain supply to ameliorate the difference between  supply and demand, the state had no choice but to raise the  grain procurement price tremendously during the late 1970s while  keeping the consumer's price the same. This produced a grain  production and consumption price inversion, the shortfall made  up by the state treasury. By 1990, the public grain subsidy  amounted to 42 billion yuan. The treasury found this to be an  unbearable burden, so a rise in the sale price of grain became  imperative. As a result of two consumer price rises, the  procurement and the market price has become identical. There is  virtually no difference between the grain production and  consumption price. The next step will be to deregulate grain  markets, impelling grain producers, dealers, and consumers  toward the market. Once grain markets have been deregulated, the  grain production and consumption price difference is expected to  widen.    1. Analysis of the reasons why the grain production and  consumption price will widen following grain market deregulation.    First is system change factors. Following grain market  deregulation, the state will abolish government subsidies to  producers and dealers. The following formula will be used to  handle prices between producers and consumers: grain producer  price + grain dealer price (transportation and selling costs +  profit) = consumer price. The identical buying and selling price  will become history. Second is transportation and marketing  system efficiency factors. The size of the difference between  the grain producer and grain consumer price depends on the  efficiency of the transportation and marketing system. If  efficiency is high, the difference is small; if efficiency is  low, the difference is great. The current state of China's  transportation and marketing system is as follows:    First, more than 90 percent of the dealings in commodity  grain in China are by state-owned grain enterprises. Once grain  markets have been deregulated and state-owned grain enterprises  are pushed into the markets, they will very likely become grain  corporations of a monopoly character that manipulate market  grain prices to garner super monopoly profits. This will widen  the difference between the production and consumption price.  Second, since the scale of production and consumption of China's  grain producers and consumers is small and extraordinarily  scattered as well, in addition to which the infrastructure is  antiquated and markets are greatly cut up, transportation and  marketing system profits and storage losses are very great. Once  grain markets are deregulated, bank interest rates will rise  again. That will dramatically increase transportation and  marketing costs, thereby leading to a widening of the production  and consumption costs. Third, China's road and communications  facilities are antiquated, and markets are very much chopped up  weakening contact among markets. In addition, storage facilities  are inadequate. Storage losses are great and costs are high.  This increases the difference between grain producer and  consumer prices.    2. Detrimental effect of the widening of the difference  between grain production and consumption prices.    Once grain markets are deregulated and the difference  between  grain production and consumption prices widens to a certain  point, the result will be detrimental to both producers and  consumers, and ultimately the damage to people having low  incomes will be greatest. Politically speaking, the peasants  grumble about too low grain prices. They wish grain prices were  somewhat higher so that their income would be somewhat greater.  Consumers complain about grain prices being too high. They wish  grain prices were somewhat lower so that they did not have to  pay as much. This puts pressure on the government. In addition  are problems such as the price risks of grain producing areas  and needy marketing areas.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: Nestle bid triggers inquiry THE European Commission has launched a preliminary investigation into Nestle's FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.39bn) bid for Perrier, its second probe into the network of bids and counter-bids involving the French mineral water group. On Monday, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, will decide whether the Agnelli family's FFr5.6bn agreed bid for Exor, Perrier's controlling shareholder, raises 'serious doubts' about its effects on competition in the EC. If it does, the Commission will launch a full four-month inquiry into the offer, which would freeze the bid. Both the Agnelli/Exor deal and the proposed Nestle/Perrier merger crossed the turnover threshold which triggers an automatic investigation. The process could also be set in motion by the counter-bid for Exor by BSN, the French food group, and by this week's full bid for Perrier by Exor.</p>

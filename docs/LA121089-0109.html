			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION;  </P> <P> WHY SCHOOLKIDS HANG IN THERE (OR DON'T)  </P> <P> We need no reminding that too many of our kids can't read, can't do math, can't  understand basic geography. The Japanese are far ahead of us; so are plenty of  others. Searching for a cause, we blame the schools; schools blame parents.  </P> <P> Looking for a palliative, writers write and publishers publish hundreds of  information books for children, fingers crossed that someone -- an alert  librarian, a sensitive teacher, an involved parent -- will get these books into  the hands of kids to whom they'll matter.  </P> <P> The range of subject matter explored in nonfiction for young readers reaches  from here to the stars. Heiderose and Andreas Fischer-Nagel use magnified  photographs to explore the fascinating goings-on in An Ant Colony (Carolrhoda  Books: $12.95; 48 pp.). At the other end of the size spectrum, E. C. Krupp, an  astronomer and director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, and his wife,  Robin Rector Krupp, an artist, collaborated to make The Big Dipper and You  (Morrow Junior Books: $13.95; 48 pp.) a clear and sometimes amusing  introduction to the sky.  </P> <P> William Jaspersohn, a writer in Vermont, and Chuck Eckart, an artist in  California, combined talents in How the Forest Grew (Greenwillow Books: $10.95;  56 pp.), an attractive portrait of the long, slow cycle of nature that  transforms open farmland to mature forest. The changing plant and animal life  are illustrated by Chuck Eckart in nicely detailed pen-and-ink drawings.  </P> <P> Why does anyone write? And what do the life stories of women writers, past and  present, say to young people -- those who are merely curious and those who  dream of the writing life -- about what it is to be a writer?  </P> <P> Lucinda Irwin Smith explores these questions in Women Who Write (Messner:  $9.95; 192 pp.), with profiles of seven writers from the past -- women as  varied and distinct as Emily Dickinson, Anne Frank, Agatha Christie, and  Virginia Woolf. She also interviews 12 contemporary authors, including  journalists, novelists, poets, and others whose names may not be so familiar.  The final section is addressed to "You, the writer." I might quibble now about  some of this -- the interviews could be more effective -- but I would have  devoured this book when I was a kid, secretly writing, secretly dreaming.  </P> <P> All of these books are interesting and attractive enough to kindle a spark of  interest in many kids. They are solidly non-controversial. But two other  nonfiction books are guaranteed to provoke heated debate.  </P> <P> E. D. Hirsch Jr.'s A First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy: What Our Children  Need to Know by (Houghton Mifflin: $14.95; 271 pp.) is a collection of more  than 2,000 brief entries alphabetically arranged in 21 categories, from history  and geography to art and science. Hirsch, author of a similar book for adults  published last year, believes there's a broad common body of knowledge with  which everyone should be familiar in order to understand American culture. He  also believes there is a core of knowledge that children need to learn by the  end of sixth grade.  </P> <P> Hirsch's ideas have led to the debate in educational circles about the value of  creating a core curriculum for our schools, a standard by which all high school  graduates would then be judged. But this "First Dictionary" is appallingly  Eurocentric. The dark side of Eurocentrism, an outdated and rather quaint  notion if it weren't so dangerous, is that it denigrates or ignores the  contributions of all other civilizations, particularly those on our own  continent. Whose culture are we talking about when we say American culture?  </P> <P> Another book that could provoke thoughtful discussion is When I Was Young I  Loved School: Dropping Out and Hanging In (Meckler Corp., distributor: $9.95,  paper; 213 pp.), compiled by the Children's Express, a news service reported by  children under age 13 working with teen-age editors. If you've ever wondered  why kids drop out, why they run away, and what makes some of them come back to  school to try again, take a long, hard look at these interviews. Thirteen of  CE's teen-age editors talked to hundreds to kids -- no adults allowed -- and  wound up with 23 edited interviews; also included are a principal who was  himself once a dropout, and a teacher.  </P> <P> The results are stunning. You can't ignore the pain and fear and anger of the  teen-agers whose voices are recorded here; nor can you help noticing their  stubbornness, their self-centeredness, and their rationalizing. Some lack  direction and self-discipline; others seem to have been blocked at every turn  by, or abandoned by, the adults responsible for them. Some kids blame their  parents, and it does seem that many of the parents lack stability and  self-discipline themselves. Some kids blame their teachers, and it's plain that  may teachers either don't care or have been worn down by overwork,  under-funding, and a classroom full of out-of-control kids. It's nobody's  fault, and everybody's.  </P> <P>  "Wild Rover," Meyer's newest novel for teen-agers, was published recently by  McElderry Books.  </P> <P> </P></p>

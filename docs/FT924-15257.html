			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Fei Pang seeks to win hearts in Hong Kong: But legislators suspect 'President Patten' WHEN tickets for the two public meetings that Mr Chris Patten will hold this Thursday and Friday went on sale last week, all 2,700 seats were snapped up in 30 minutes: Britain's 28th and presumably last governor of Hong Kong is riding an unprecedented wave of popularity. This is Mr Patten's week and tomorrow his day. At 2.30pm he rises as president of Hong Kong's Legislative Council to outline his plans. Unlike previous governors, who presented their administration's policies for the year ahead, Mr Patten will lay bare his blueprint for the last five years of British colonial rule. His address is expected to cover changes to the structure of government, his thoughts on the conduct of Hong Kong's 1995 elections (which he will then have to negotiate with China), and his spending priorities in areas such as education, health and the environment. The latter will be presented under the rubric of 'sound finance' and the continuation of low taxation. But, with his officials projecting an accumulated budget surplus of more than HKDollars 70bn (Pounds 5.25bn) by the end of British rule in June 1997, there is plenty of money for an ambitious politician and the 'kinder, gentler 1990s'. The speech will define his agenda but it will also be the document to which reference will be made for the next five years. As one official observed: 'He's made a political decision, and he's the one who is going to have to live with it, and get on with it.' Television advertisements showing Mr Patten kissing babies, helping old ladies across streets and generally meeting an adoring public have been running for the past week. Hong Kong has been witnessing a political campaign the like of which it has not seen in the past 150 years of British rule, and it is just the beginning. In the wake of tomorrow's address, Mr Patten has an appointment with talk-back radio, and will face a television studio audience of political commentators and invited guests and appear in the legislature to take questions from members. Mindful that he is also a political figure in Britain, BBC television and radio slots have also been booked. In between, Mr Patten will telephone Lord Howe - British foreign secretary during the Anglo-Chinese negotiations which led to the 1984 Joint Declaration on the colony's future - and Lord Wilson, his immediate predecessor in Hong Kong, to inform them of his plans. His calculated attempt to go directly to the people has won short-term favour with the locals, who seem genuinely to like the man they have dubbed Fei Pang (Fat Patten). But it has put legislators off-side. They see him as 'President Patten', trying to marginalise law-makers, especially democratically elected ones. When that worry is added to some of his rumoured plans for change, such as splitting the executive branch of government from the legislature, then the concerns transcend mere pique. 'Mr Patten may be a decent man and capable of running a presidential style of leadership openly, but what happens in 1997 if Beijing does not appoint a Chinese equivalent of him?' asks one Hong Kong liberal politician. 'All power will reside in the executive branch of government.' Quite how China views Mr Patten's dash for popularity is unknown but, because the Chinese always favour playing a long game, there is a sense in Beijing's silence of 'give him enough rope and he will hang himself'. What is known is that Beijing sees itself as the representative of the people of Hong Kong, whom it refers to as 'compatriots'. The sight, therefore, of the last British colonial governor presenting himself as the representative of the Chinese in the colony is bound to rankle. How Mr Patten plans to deal with China is indicated by the words he uses. 'Openness', 'frank', 'trust' and 'direct' are his stock words when talking about the sort of relationship he wants with Beijing. Towards the end of this month he goes to the Chinese capital for his first meeting with the Chinese leaders. A calculated risk was taken two weeks ago when Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, briefed Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, in New York on Mr Patten's plans for Hong Kong's constitutional development. So far, the pro-Beijing press in the colony has not been used to ventilate and criticise those proposals, a fact Mr Patten's advisers have found encouraging. But, as Mr Patten knows, tomorrow afternoon's address to the Legislative Council is just the beginning of a process. On Thursday morning he may well find that both local legislators and Beijing oppose his plans. And that is when Fei Pang will have to start running.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- A Japanese Government  advisory body Monday [20 June] proposed scrapping a law that  limits imports of petroleum products for use by oil refiners.    In an interim report presented to the trade minister, the  Petroleum Council said the provisional measures law on the  importation of specific kinds of petroleum refined products has  helped perpetuate substantial price gaps between the domestic  and overseas purchase prices of gasoline and other petroleum  products.    If the law is abolished as recommended, businesses such as  trading houses will be able to import petroleum products after  March 1996, when the law expires.    The report also proposed revision of petroleum storage  regulations, in order that new entrants, such as trading houses,  will be required to make provision for a certain level of  petroleum stockpiling when launching an import business.    The report also recommended formulation of a new law  designed  to ensure high quality standards for imported petroleum.    At present, Japanese consumers pay roughly four times as  much  for gasoline as, for example, their U.S. counterparts.    The council said the latest proposal is intended to  introduce  a market mechanism into the Japanese petroleum industry by  promoting competition with foreign products.    The step would put downward pressure on prices of petroleum  products, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) told a press conference.    In order to compete with cheaper foreign products, refiners  would be forced to make further cost-cutting efforts, which  would in the long run reinforce their financial standing, the  official said.    The proposed reform of the petroleum storage law does not  mean that prospective importers must have a capability to  stockpile petroleum products, he said.    If such a requirement is attached under the proposed import  liberalization, it would be virtually impossible for trading  houses to enter the oil import business, and the status quo  would not change, the official said.    As one way of ensuring stockpiling as required under the new  proposal, prospective importers could rent storage tanks from  refiners, he suggested.    During Monday's Petroleum Council meeting, some council  members voiced concern that scrapping the provisional petroleum  import law could have negative effects on Japan's energy  security, the MITI official said.    But others supported the step as "most appropriate" for  deregulating Japan's petroleum market and the industry, he said.    The council report also recommended that Japan's petroleum  distribution system be reformed to make it more efficient.    Specifically, the report called for more competition to be  introduced in operation of gas stations by gradually abolishing  a designation system for building such stations.    Expected restructuring of gas stations, most of them  financially fragile, under competition policy may erode their  profits further, but the interest of consumers should also be  considered, the report said.    Operators of gas stations should listen to public criticism  that they are providing "excessive services" at the expense of  price attractiveness, it said.    The report refrained from addressing whether or not  self-service gas stations should be allowed, saying the issue  should be studied by the Fire Defense Agency.    Asked if MITI would accept an expected request by the  refinery industry for increasing prices of kerosene, gas oil and  other daily necessities, the official said the ministry has no  intention to "intervene in pricing of such products during the  era of free competition."    If gasoline prices fall under the proposed policy, the  refinery industry is expected to call for raising prices of  kerosene and gas oil, which have been set at relatively low  levels by MITI to balance high gasoline prices in the wake of  the oil crisis during the 1970s.    The petroleum council will create two working panels in  August to study various problems involved in abolition of the  petroleum law, including how to secure a stable amount of  stockpiling by new entrants and to ensure high product quality,  the MITI official said.    The council will work out a final report in December, the  official said.</p>

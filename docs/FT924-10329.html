			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK markets Judging by Thursday's Mansion House speech, the gradualists are still in charge at the Treasury. Having been too optimistic about recovery for two years, policy makers now think that the recent fall in sterling and cuts in interest rates are enough to give the economy a good kick. Interest rates will be reduced further, but no chances are to be taken with inflation. Of course, part of that can be discounted as rhetoric to support sterling on the foreign exchanges, but the chancellor may once again have too complacent a view of events. Confidence has been hit badly in the wake of sterling's departure from the ERM, and businesses are once more vigorously cutting staff and capital expenditure. Sentiment in the housing market remains very poor - depressing consumers and encouraging them to save rather than spend. Allied to this is the heavy debt burden which both groups still carry. All of this implies caution about the prospects for the UK stock market. Analysts, who are often over-optimistic about earnings growth, expect dividends to grow by less than 2 per cent this year, and perhaps 3 to 5 per cent in 1993. Even these figures are based on the questionable assumption that the economy will grow by some 1.5 per cent next year. The recent rise in the market discounts much of the devaluation boost. Overall dividend figures also hide as much as they reveal. Sectors such as the utilities and some consumer groups have good cover and can manage real dividend increases. In some capital goods sectors, though, more dividend cuts are on the way and cover will remain low until the mid-1990s. While the chancellor may protect some construction projects, prospects for private sector construction remain grim. Capital goods shares have been hit badly this year, but there is little reason to expect much recovery. Despite devaluation, defensive stocks may still be the best bet.</p>

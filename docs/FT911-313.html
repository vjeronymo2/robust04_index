			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Gilts: Market looks ahead to bleak signs THE GILTS market is looking ahead to a week of bleak news about the extent of the UK recession. The government is likely to announce on Thursday a large rise in unemployment and a further slump in manufacturing production. A day after this comes the latest information on inflation, as measured by the retail price index, which is expected to show that the annual rate of increase was just over 6 per cent last month, from 8.2 per cent in March. Whether the government will use the latest economic indicators as an opportunity to make a further cut in base rates, now at 12 per cent, is hotly contested. The Bank of England has already made its views known. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank governor, issued a thinly veiled warning last week about the dangers of cutting interest rates too quickly. The Bank is especially worried about underlying inflation - usually measured by the RPI, less the effects of the poll tax and mortgage payments - which is falling far less rapidly than the 'headline' rate. According to this argument, the expected fall in the RPI is explained more by technical factors, related to changes in the poll tax and interest rates, than by continued signs of demand being squeezed due to recessionary forces. Mr Leigh-Pemberton's statement was followed on Friday by the Bank lending to the money market at the prevailing base rate of 12 per cent for two weeks - a move which underlined the Bank's view that an imminent cut in rates would be inappropriate. Despite the Bank's signals, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has the final say over monetary policy. He may feel that recessionary conditions are so tough that a  1/2 percentage point cut is justified - as part of the series of moves which have brought base rates down by 2 percentage points since February. Even more to the point, a cut in rates this week might help the Conservatives' chances of winning the general election, which could be held later this year. In the gilts market, the expectation is that Mr Lamont will cut rates soon. This sentiment helped to bring down yields at the short end of the market over the past week, while those for long-dated gilts stayed virtually static in lacklustre trading. In deference to the Bank's views, some believe Mr Lamont may make his announcement not on Friday, at the time of the RPI figures, but a few days later. If Bank officials are looking forward to this week's events with a certain grim foreboding, they are probably glad to have last week out of the way. What had been an embarrassment to the Bank - a tranche of Pounds 800m-worth of 9 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 2008 which had remained unsold for a month - was disposed of last Wednesday by the straightforward move of cutting the price by 2 points. The manoeuvre led to sniping by some gilt specialists, who reckoned the market-makers buying the securities gained too much of a bargain. Some eyebrows were raised because the Bank sold the stock at a price of 1/16 less than the market price. This discrepancy meant the Bank (and ultimately the taxpayer) gained from the transaction some Pounds 500,000 less than it would have done by selling at the market price. However, to show that it was not put off by the episode, the Bank announced on Friday the sale of Pounds 200m-worth of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock  -one segment worth Pounds 100m carrying a maturity in 2001 and the rest due in 2011. The securities, available for dealing from today, should be far easier to sell and should make last week's headaches for the Bank seem like a bad dream.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Arts: Tribute to Sir Geraint - Gala Concert in Cardiff Few opera-lovers today can recall opera before Geraint Evans. For many of us, he was already part of the firmament when we discovered opera. It is therefore good to know that his name continues in the present tense in the Geraint Evans Scholarship Fund, which has supported young singers at the Welsh College of Music and Drama since shortly before his death in 1992. On Sunday, in St David's Hall, Cardiff, a number of celebrated Welsh singers joined a gala chorus, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, and conductor David Pryce-Jones for 'A Gala Tribute to Sir Geraint,' a concert whose proceeds will benefit this fund. Every good gala should have its surprise; this once had an unknown Verdi aria. Dennis O'Neill, who has sung Foresto in Verdi's Attila at Covent Garden, introduced an alternative aria that in 1846 Verdi wrote, at Rossini's request, for the tenor Ivanoff to sing. The aria, 'Sventurato] Della mia vita', was never published; O'Neill is the first since Ivanoff to sing it. He sings it well, and it deserves to become better known. Everything about it says, splendidly, 'Verdi' - the mixture of legato and staccati in the arching vocal lines; the staccati triplets that quietly, feelingly, accompany the initial phrases; the woodwind that join in and link it to the particular sound-world of Attila's more lyrical scenes; the orchestral tutti that join its swelling climax; the muted orchestral close straight after the tenor's final high note. In case we needed reminding, the gala demonstrated the strength of Welsh singing. O'Neill, who planned and organised the gala, also sang Lensky's aria from Eugene Onegin with elegiac beauty, and joined Margaret Price in the love-duet from Verdi's Otello. Price, whose pure entry into notes remains phenomenal, later sang Desdemona's Willow Song and Ave Maria, making every phrase, every word, count. I love the way she makes the first calls of 'Salce]' sound like a distant voice, and how she matches her phrasing here to the oboe. Della Jones, fresh from her Proms appearance the previous night, sang the rondo finale from Rossini's Cenerentola with sparkling aplomb. True, her divisions and top notes are not as breathtakingly clean as they were 10 or 15 years ago, but this is still a wonderfully exciting account of this irresistible scene (here given with a little joke cadenza referring to the gala's previous aria, 'Non piu andrai'). I have space only to mention and praise the contributions of Gwynne Howell (in music from Onegin and Don Carlo), Arthur Davies (fresh from the Covent Garden opening-night Butterfly, singing the Carmen Flower Song), Jason Howard (in Posa's death scene from Don Carlo) and Rebecca Evans (in Susanna's aria from Figaro). Most glorious of them all, Bryn Terfel. When Caruso heard Lotte Lehmann, he complimented her by saying 'Brava - una vera voce voce italiana': which leaps to my mind as I hear Terfel today. His baritone, so secure, is placed that you hear his whole body and face in every phrase; he has spontaneity, virility, force, individuality. He sang 'Non piu andrai' from Figaro, and the Honour monologue from Verdi's Falstaff - both Geraint Evans roles, both here given immense panache. Yes, in the latter opera he has been singing Ford (and only the night before in Cardiff); he has already all the eloquence for Falstaff. It was a smart touch to end each half of the gala with a big ensemble. The sextet from Donizetti's Lucia preceded the interval; but it was effaced by the great fugue from Falstaff, which brought together all the evening's soloists: Margaret Price as Alice, Della Jones as Meg, and so on. The intricacy of Verdi's writing, and the bubbling glee with which his music is shot through, have seldom been more apparent.</p>

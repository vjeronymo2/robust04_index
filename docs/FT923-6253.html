			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Drought decimates Romanian harvest THE WORST drought since 1947 has hit key Romanian agricultural areas, threatening a shortfall of 2.5m tonnes of wheat. The government believes it can ensure supplies only until the end of January. Mr Petre Marculescu, the minister of agriculture has refused to disclose crop estimates, but admits that 38 per cent of the maize crop has already been affected and has declared crop calamities in Constanta and Tulcea, two of the country's most fertile counties. The drought could hardly come at a worse time. With Romanian agriculture severely dislocated by the transition to a market economy and plantings of barley and wheat well down on last year, Romania was already set to import record amounts of grain. By the end of June, the country, which prior to communist rule was one of Europe's richest agricultural nations, had already imported 1.16m tonnes of wheat. Bread shortages are already evident. In four counties in the north and west, rationing has begun, while in many regional towns long queues have developed outside private shops despite prices three or four times higher than in the state sector. The shortages, coupled with rising unemployment, are adding to growing tension ahead of next month's general election, causing the government to rethink a second round of subsidy cuts on basic foods and electricity agreed with the International Monetary Fund as part of the country's economic reforms and due on September 1 With an austerity budget in place and currency reserves low the country is likely to have major difficulties paying for additional food imports through the winter months. A month-long drought has seriously affected 11m hectares (27m acres) of crops in South China and reduced drinking water supplies for 20m people, the official Farmers Daily said. Rainfall in parts of South China is as much as 90 per cent below normal, it said. The drought extends through almost every one of the country's major grain producers, affecting even Sichuan and Guizhou in the south-west. The daily said there was some hope of a little rain in part of the affected area in the near future.</p>

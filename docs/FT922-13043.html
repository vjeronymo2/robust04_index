			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Clowes ordered to pay Pounds 6m damages to DTI MR PETER CLOWES, the jailed fraudster, and his wife Pamela were yesterday ordered to make an immediate interim payment of Pounds 6m damages to the Department of Trade and Industry. The DTI took over the claims of investors who lost money in the collapse of the Barlow Clowes investment group. The High Court order by Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, follows a judge's ruling last month that the couple had 'no defence' to the damages claim launched by the DTI to recoup what it can. The exact amount of damages has yet to be assessed by the court, but the judge said it was 'inevitable' that the figure would exceed Pounds 10m. Mr and Mrs Clowes had argued that they should not be ordered to make an interim payment because they did not have the means to pay. The liquidators of Barlow Clowes have made claims against all of Mr Clowes's assets. Sir Donald said this case was 'far removed from the run-of-the-mill' and there was nothing unjust in ordering an interim payment, even if the amount was beyond the couple's means and had the 'extreme consequence' of bringing bankruptcy on them. Interest is to run on the interim payment, but the judge granted a stay of his order pending an appeal by Mr and Mrs Clowes. Mr Clowes, who is serving a 10-year prison sentence for fraud, was in court for the brief hearing. He and his wife, who was not present, are receiving legal aid. The DTI claim is one of many against Mr Clowes, 49, who cheated investors of an estimated Pounds 113m by promising to invest in gilt-edged securities while spending the money on a yacht, an executive jet, expensive cars and various business enterprises.</p>

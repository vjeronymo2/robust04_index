			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for Cabinet  Affairs and information minister, has denied reports that Jordan  shipped weapons to Yemen. He said the current fighting there is  a purely internal affair. He also said that Jordan believes in  legitimacy as chosen by the Yemeni people and that when it  mediated among the brothers in Yemen it did so at the clear  request of all parties.    Reacting to statements by some Yemeni Socialist Party  officials who alleged that Jordan shipped weapons and military  equipment to Yemen on board military aircraft, Dr. al-'Anani  said: Jordan sent civilian aircraft to Yemen to evacuate  Jordanian expatriates home after it became impossible for them  to stay there because of the fighting and the eruption of fierce  battles. At the same time, Jordan also used these aircraft to  evacuate many citizens, families, and children from fraternal  Arab and friendly foreign communities. Jordan was the only  country to fulfill such a humanitarian role.    The minister explained that because of the high insurance  rate -- $500,000 --levied on civilian flights to fraternal  Yemen, Jordan had to use and send C-130 military aircraft to  rescue innocent civilians and evacuate Jordanians working in  Yemen, as well as other nationals of brotherly and friendly  states. He said: These aircraft were the only way to evacuate  them and carry them back to the homeland. These flights were  made in public and in full sight of all countries in the world,  and in the presence of local, Arab, and foreign journalists.    Dr. al-'Anani said it is not unusual or new for Jordan to  engage in such humanitarian actions. Jordan has done this  before, during the Gulf crisis when it received and hosted on  its territory more than 1 million people, he added.    The minister said he hopes the crisis in fraternal Yemen  will  end and the shedding of innocent blood among the brothers will  stop, for the benefit and interests of the Yemeni Arab people  and for the interests of the sons of the Arab nation.</p>

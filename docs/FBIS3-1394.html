ANC Regional Office Deputy  General Secretary Obed Bapela said that when the marchers got  outside the organisation's offices they had stopped and begun  hurling abuse at the ANC. They were also brandishing guns, Mr  Bapela alleged.    As the ANC's security retreated "there was a burst of  gunfire", in which one man was wounded. Mr Bapela said he did  not know who the gunfire had come from. "We want to dismiss the  police story that there was a sniper in this building."    The ANC had agreed to co-operate with police in allowing  them  to carry out ballistic tests on the security guards' weapons, he  said. The ANC earlier telephoned SAPA to say its regional  office was being "attacked".    Police told SAPA's reporter on the scene minutes after the  shooting, however, it appeared as if the wounded man had been  hit by a sniper who had been aiming at the marchers.    By 9.20 AM, with the bulk of the Zulu marchers still due to  arrive at their kick-off venue at the Library Gardens, a state  of near-hysteria seemed to hang over Johannesburg.    Security personnel hovered around with walkie-talkies,  merchants gossiped in little groups in their shops, work  apparently forgotten, and SAP [South African Police] officers  patrolled four-abreast. The streets, for this time of the day,  remain relatively deserted.    Mr Bapela said he and ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] General Secretary Tokyo Sexwale would be doing a  helicopter fly past to "assess the situation".</p>

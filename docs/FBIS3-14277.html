			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>   [Text] Amman--The Lower House of Parliament on Tuesday [22  March] condemned the U.S. abstention from voting on references  to the status of Jerusalem and other Israeli-occupied  territories in Friday's U.N. Security Council resolution  condemning the Feb. 25 massacre at a mosque in the West Bank  town of Hebron.    In a statement issued on the last day of its first regular  session, the House said the U.S. abstention during voting on  Resolution 904 signalled a "clear change in the American stand,"  which had hitherto viewed Jerusalem as well as other Palestinian  territories as occupied.    "The Lower House of Parliament condemns the American  position  and calls on the parliaments of Arab and Islamic countries as  well as those of countries which support just causes to protest  against the American stand," the statement said.    The Lower House said it "deeply regretted the weak  coordination among the Arab delegations at the world body"  leading to the adoption of the resolution which did not satisfy  the Arab position.    It was an indirect swipe at the Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO), which held extensive consultations with the  U.S. on the wording of Resolution 904 since it was first drafted  shortly after the Feb. 25 massacre.    The delay was caused by American insistence on deleting  parts  of the draft and differences with the PLO on the phrasing and  wording of the document.    His Majesty King Husayn said in a recent interview that  Jordan was not a party to the consultations over the draft and  noted that he had launched a personal effort to come up with a  joint Arab stand vis-a-vis the issue a few hours before the  Security Council adopted the resolution.    The king said the door would not have been open for the U.S.  to abstain on parts of the resolution had the document omitted  any specific reference to Jerusalem and referred to the  territories that Israeli occupied in the 1967 war in a general  context.    The American abstention has sounded alarm bells in Jordan,  which saw Washington's posture as paving the way for the  eventual recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.    Since 1967, the U.S. stand on the occupied territories had  remained constant based on the rejection of Israeli occupation  of the land until Friday's vote, which cast doubts on the U.S.  intentions.    The American stand was viewed as an intentional  precedent-setting move to eventually change its rejection of  Israel's unilateral annexation of East Jerusalem.    The king said he was seeking an expalantion from Washington  whether there was any shift in the U.S. stand.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said after the  vote that Washington did not want to prejudge the outcome of  Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations by adopting any position  on issues involved in the conflict.    Officials said Tuesday that the issue was to be raised  during  talks with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross who was paying a brief visit  to Amman late Tuesday.    "We hope to get some explanation of the American stand and  what its obstention means," said one highly-placed official (see  separate story).    Tuesday's parliament statement also expressed regret that  Resolution 904, adopted after "three weeks of delays and  procrastination...only condemned the massacre, carried out by  Zionist settlers aided by the occupation forces, and did not  condemn the Israeli authorities responsible for the massacre."    The statement called on Arab leaders to put aside their  differences and convene a summit conference to discuss the  "situation of the Palestinian people living under Zionist  occupation" and to "shoulder their responsibilities towards  Palestinians who are subjected to consistent campaigns of  genocide."    The House voiced appreciation "of the steadfastness of the  Palestinian people and their commitment to their land and their  rights" and reaffimed Jordan's support for the Palestinian  struggle for liberation.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFI L.A. INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL: CAPSULE REVIEWS  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'Fable of the Beautiful Pigeon Fancier'  </P> <P> Brazil, 1988, 103 minutes  </P> <P> 7:15 p.m.  </P> <P>  Just as in "Letters From the Park," Gabriel Garcia Marquez based this  screenplay on a two-page fragment from "Love in the Time of Cholera"; it's a  sensuous, cruel love story about a compulsive seducer with waxed mustache whose  obsessive romanticism brings on catastrophe. Cinema Novo mainstay Ruy Guerra  ("Erendira") has turned into a master of gorgeous surfaces, but he never loses  sight of the devastating social satire Marquez has secreted within his  Scheherazade-style storytelling and jeweled metaphors. RECOMMENDED. -- MICHAEL  WILMINGTON  </P></p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A LARGE single trade by a leading US house in the September Footsie futures contract boosted turnover in the sector as general trading in the derivatives continued to be dominated by this week's expiry in both the options and futures, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, US investment bank Salomon Brothers stole the limelight with a single cross trade of 6,500 lots in the December contract. It was executed at 3,060, and dealers said the trade was the equivalent of around Pounds 490m in underlying equities. That trade boosted volume in the December future to 15,837 contracts. In the September future, trading was volatile as dealers continued to close positions and roll forward ahead of Friday's expiry. It opened at a discount to cash at 3,017, but recovered to trade ahead of cash for most of the session before a poor opening on Wall Street pulled it back in the last few minutes of the day. It still finished at a 5-point premium to cash at 3,033, with volume reaching a hefty 16,342 lots. Volume in the traded options jumped to 43,455 contracts, against 29,789 for the previous day. Amstrad, whose September stock options expire today, was the day's busiest trade with volume of 13,649 lots. Sheppards was said to have sold 6,200 of the September 30 calls and bought 6,200 of the December 30 calls. Reuters, Zeneca and Glaxo were also busy.</p>

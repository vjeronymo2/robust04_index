			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Europe's prospects hang on Germany / Assessing the outlook for the continent's economies in the wake of the ERM crisis GERMAN interest rates have fallen, a number of European countries have devalued their currencies, but the outlook for the continent's economy remains as uncertain now as it did a week ago. Economic growth looks set to slow further next year in most European countries, the result of the high interest rates in Germany and throughout Europe that are responsible for the crisis within the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The economic consequences of Germany's continuing power struggle between the government and the Bundesbank will continue to dominate the European economic scene, whether or not the ERM survives its current turbulence. Only the UK can be relatively confident that its economic growth rate will accelerate somewhat over the coming months as a result of last week's turmoil. Burdened by unusually heavy personal and corporate-sector debts, the UK economy has suffered more than elsewhere from the high interest rate floor that Germany's tight monetary policy has given to Europe. Freed from the ERM constraint, the UK government should now be able to cut British interest rates below Germany's so long as it postpones any refixing of sterling against the D-Mark. Elsewhere the immediate outlook looks much less certain. Any positive impulse towards lower European interest rates as a result of last Monday's disappointingly small cut in the German discount and Lombard rates has probably been offset by the rise in interest rate differentials resulting from the growing uncertainty within the ERM. A general breakdown of the ERM would be one possible route to lower interest rates outside Germany. Far more likely, a No or narrow Yes vote in Sunday's French referendum could provoke a similar speculative attack on the franc and a general ERM realignment. Appreciation of the D-Mark against still more currencies, and the resulting disinflation within Germany, would probably be enough to persuade the Bundesbank to cut German rates once more. For France, this could mean a welcome fall in interest rates. But the chances of a noticeable acceleration in French economic growth before 1994 still look poor, even if interest rates were to start to fall. In Italy, the opportunity to cut its interest rates below those in Germany may remain elusive, despite its temporary departure from the ERM. The government's finances remain in a parlous state. And without the stick of the ERM commitment, and maybe also the carrot of membership of a European monetary union, the Italian parliament may be reluctant to agree to a budget package which bites deeply into its powers of patronage. The government's proposed deficit reduction package of L93,000bn (Pounds 42bn) in new taxes and spending cuts in 1993 is bound to reduce Italian economic growth in the short term if it receives parliamentary approval. But the package may still prove too small to convince markets that the government can finally set the public debt on a downward path. Unless the government can also obtain executive powers to allow further budget consolidation, the Bank of Italy will have to keep interest rates painfully high. For Italy, the collapse of the Maastricht Treaty could spell disaster. But elsewhere in Europe, freedom from the treaty's tough fiscal policy convergence criteria would also be good for economic growth. Germany's economic problems will continue to place a question mark over the medium-term prospects for European economic growth. 'Europe's growth prospects will improve and interest rates fall as a result of an ERM breakdown,' says Mr David Walton, economist at Goldman Sachs investment bank. 'But the medium-term outlook will remain closely tied to events in Germany. If the German economy stays very weak, then the chances of a robust European recovery are poor, whether or not the ERM survives.' Whether slow growth will turn to recession depends, in large part, on how long the Bundesbank will keep German interest rates high. Unless the government can come up with a credible plan to cap its growing fiscal deficit, interest rates may stay high for some time yet. ERM or no ERM, a recessionary Germany spells danger for European economic growth.</p>

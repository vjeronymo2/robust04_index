			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / What a laugh] Now anarchy is respectable: Comedy has replaced pop music as the stairway to the stars for the young and talented. Antony Thorncroft reports on radical changes in a cut-throat world IT WAS a rough Friday night Up the Creek and the comedians were taking casualties. One young man, covering his whimsy inadequately with a guitar, first reduced the audience to silence; then set it talking among itself; and, finally, brought out the hecklers. Realising his cause was hopeless, he quit the stage suddenly. 'Where's he gone?' said Malcolm Hardee, the bemused compere and owner of the comedy club in Greenwich, south-east London. 'He was crap, wasn't he?' A few minutes later in the pub next door, Hardee, a veteran of the comedy circuit, was buying the young man a drink, building him up and sketching out his career. In the cut-throat world of 'alternative' comedy, there is no room for faint hearts, sensitive nerves or delusions of grandeur. But there are plenty of opportunities for making a great deal of money, very quickly. Comedy has replaced pop music as the stairway to the stars for the young and the talented. It is very different comedy from the quick-fire gags of the old music hall comedians, or northern comics. It is even further removed from the satire of the first wave of graduate comedians. The performers rely more on charm than vicious wit. In some clubs, you can pass a whole evening without hearing one joke. Instead, the comedians talk about the most intimate aspects of their lives, expecting to strike chords with their audience. It is the humour of group therapy, of shared embarrassment. A male comedian can build an entire act around the ritual of undressing in front of a new girl friend; a female comedian on how chocolates provide real joy while sex is just a wet patch in the bed. Take Harry Hill, who is halfway up the ladder. Hill trained as a doctor and remains one when times get desperate. But, as a medical student, he found that appearing in the end-of-year show was the best part of the course. So, after qualifying, he mixed working in a hospital with working the clubs. 'It was easy:  you could just turn up at an open spot and perform.' Most comedy clubs have open spots on certain nights where you get five minutes to do your stuff. If you are any good, you are spotted by the club manager or other comedians, invited back - and paid. Hill covered the country gaining experience, receiving the typical fee of Pounds 30 for a 20-minute spot. Often, the deal would be a percentage of the box office take (which, invariably, was nothing) or a free meal. often, he was booed off. His mixture of mild jokes ('I was walking home last night and a man said 'Give me your wallet.' I blame all these self-assertiveness classes') and surreal word play delivered in a bemused, confiding style, rather like the late Harry Worth, makes the audience work. Hill was doing all the right things, though. He was writing lots of new material; he was earning an extra Pounds 100 a week by sending jokes to the Radio 4 programme Week Ending; and he was preparing his act for the Edinburgh festival fringe, the annual showcase for new comedy where TV and radio producers who cannot bother to trawl the London clubs look for talent. Hill lost Pounds 1,000 appearing at the 1991 fringe but he was voted the most promising newcomer last August by the Perrier pick-of-the-fringe judges. Suddenly, his career moved up two notches. Now, club bookers ring him. He can make Pounds 100 or more for an appearance, and, if he had the energy, like the music hall stars of old, he could dash around London doing three gigs a night. Hill has appeared on television and this month he is recording a pilot for Radio 4. He reckons he is earning as much as when he was a full-time doctor. He also has Avalon, the leading management company riding the comedy boom, to plot the development of his career. In the three years that Hill has been in the business, it has changed out of all recognition. Take the experience of Jack Dee. He is a contemporary of Hill who worked in a restaurant by day and the clubs at night. In 1991, he caught the eye of the Perrier judges, and the television producers, with his cool, staccato delivery and made the break quickly from the club circuit to the national stage. He has his own TV show and, by touring the land, can earn more than Pounds 6,000 a night filling 2,000-seat theatres. There is the Jack Dee video, the Jack Dee spots on North American television, the Jack Dee beer commercials. All that remains is the Jack Dee movie. What has transformed the comedy world has been the voracious appetite of radio and television, stimulated in the past year by the new commercial television contractors. There had always been a tradition of bright young graduates becoming comedy stars - a tradition linking the Beyond the Fringe quartet with the Monty Python team, with Rowan Atkinson and Not the Nine O'Clock News. Then came Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, Ben Elton, and Rik Mayall, who got their start in the comedy clubs which first appeared in the UK around 1980. But this graduate flow was always the anarchic alternative to mainstream comedy: now, it is mainstream comedy. The heads of light entertainment at the BBC and the commercial television stations woke up suddenly to the fact that the day of the traditional comics  -who tended to be northerners such as Ken Dodd, Russ Abbott and Cannon and Ball - was over. For decades, the prime-time weekend TV spots were hogged by variety shows and old-style funnymen. Overnight, the audience was no longer laughing, leaving the way open to the 'alternatives.' The turnaround is remarkable. Switch on Radio 4 early evening and late at night and you are likely to hear one of the new breed, Nick Revell perhaps or Richard Herring. Radio 5 commissions comedy. Even Radio 1 has a comedy spot, with club stand-ups Mark Thomas and Kevin Day. It was Radio 1 which first transmitted The Mary Whitehouse Experience, the work of four young writer-performers, Baddiel and Newman and Punt and Dennis, who previously had contributed jokes to Week Ending. The show moved to television and became a youth cult. Now, the two duos tour the country like old-fashioned rock acts, playing student unions and filling the 3,500-seat Hammersmith Apollo in London for four nights  - at a fee of around Pounds 10,000 a night. And, unlike the rock acts with their expensive 'roadies' and lighting crews, the comedians travel light and are more reliable. Richard Alan Turner of Avalon, who manages Baddiel and Newman, is now talking with Columbia Pictures in Hollywood about a Dollars 5m movie for the pair. Jonathan James-Moore, head of BBC Radio light entertainment, has watched the changes at first hand. 'We were interested in the new wave of comedians from the start. I went down to the Comedy Store (London's oldest comedy club) when it first opened in 1979 and recorded four hours of material. We edited it down to 15 minutes and it was still too crude for the powers-that-be.' Since then, attitudes have changed on both sides. The comedians have become less aggressive while the BBC has become bolder. For James-Moore, the greatest changes in the past few years have been in the style of comedy and in the voracious appetite of television. Today's comedians develop story lines rather than simply firing off a succession of jokes. As for television, it has an insatiable appetite for comedians. James-Moore notes: 'The companies lurch above us like vultures picking our vital organs.' Not all comedians are tempted by television. Hill's ambition is to have his own show, but he is suspicious of making one-off appearances. 'You might get Pounds 700 for a five-minute spot but you use up all your best material.' A successful female comedian, Jo Brand, once heard her club audience repeat the punch-lines of some of the material she had used on TV the previous night. Other club comedians make a virtue of refusing to appear on television (or perhaps they are not asked). They are the remnants of the days when the circuit was political - when you got an easy laugh by comparing the former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, unfavourably with King Herod. These days, few political comedians remain: they have lost heart. Paul Blackman, of Battersea Arts Centre in south London, thinks audiences and performers are more at ease with themselves.' They are comfortable with being anti-sexist and anti-racist and anything goes. You can tell mother-in-law jokes again and get away with it.' Already, though, old-timers are complaining that success has ruined comedy. Audiences come to see their TV heroes and are tamer. Heckling is rare. Some clubs are programming novelty acts, magicians and fire-eaters and moving towards an old-fashioned vaudeville bill. Few these days will give an open spot to a new face without an audition. Management is taking over. Companies such as Avalon, which has increased its turnover from Pounds 100,000 to more than Pounds 2m in four years, looks for comedians with writing potential who can develop from creating one-liners to writing plays and TV sit-coms. This path was pioneered by Elton and has been travelled by Sean Hughes and Arthur Smith (whose West End hit, An Evening with Gary Lineker, is being adapted to fit Australian football). Avalon makes sure that its artists do not blow a club routine, which has kept them living comfortably for three years, for the glory of a six-week TV series. It knows that the big financial rewards lie in corporate entertainment, voice-overs, and videos. Avalon's main management rival, Off the Kerb, run by Addison Cresswell, still backs the stand-ups. He describes the primrose path. 'It's the club circuit; Edinburgh; a first TV series. Then comes the difficult one, the second series. You call in writers and you are lost to the world of sit-com.' Some of his stable of comedians, notably Julian Clary, have managed the transition successfully but Cresswell is suspicious of writers. 'They become prima donnas. They all want to get into films.' Cresswell is happy packaging programmes of stand-ups to tour the country, sponsored by beer companies such as Holsten. The brewers have been quick to appreciate the link between the uninhibited, anarchic atmosphere in a comedy club and selling lots of drink. While alternative comedy now is mainstream, it still looks to the clubs for constant revitalisation. Little of the wealth has trickled down there; they remain, in the words of Kim Kinney, 'the factory floor.' Kinney manages the Comedy Store, an underground shoe box in Soho which crams in 240 people and, until recently, was unwilling to expand. The Comedy Store gave a first chance to Elton, Mayall, French and Saunders, Alexei Sayle, and more. Now, perhaps jolted by the success of Jongleurs  - which, last month, opened another outlet in a former rock club, Dingwalls, at north London's Camden Lock - it is moving to larger premises nearby. Jongleurs was spurred by events in the US, where new comedy is a big business: two cable channels concentrate on comedy and Catch a Falling Star has established 20 comedy clubs around the country. Like the Comedy Store, Jongleurs was content for years to pack its club in Battersea with yuppies. Now, it aspires to expand into the regions. As proof that new comedy is supreme, it is keen to book the older generation of comedians - the Ronnie Corbetts, the Dave Allens and the Billy Connollys - if they are prepared to perform for a percentage of the door money. But the Comedy Store and Jongleurs are not the only important venues in London: there is also the East Dulwich Tavern which now also runs the 350-seat Civic, created from a moribund community centre in Peckham. Many are suspicious of the changes. To them, comedy is being used as an opiate rather than as a weapon to speed the revolution, and as a way of persuading people to laugh their way through the recession. What began as anarchy and an anti-Establishment tirade - the riposte of radical youth to the seeming inevitability of Thatcher's Britain - has been consumed by show business. Some keep the faith, though. Marxist comedian Jeremy Hardy prefers to perform at community arts centres: for him, the clubs have become a night out for hen parties and celebratory young professionals. Much of the humour is indeed escapist and whimsical. Here is comedian Hattie Hayridge overcoming her fear of air travel: 'There is a one in a 100m chance of being on a plane with a bomb on board. It's one in 400m against being on a plane with two bombs on board. So, I always carry one with me to improve the odds.' Even more of it is scatological: Arthur Smith has built a good living on a celebrated routine which begins: 'Whatever happened to white dog shit?' But the insatiable demand for new talent, for variety, still breaks through. Hill is likely to become a star because he is safe, charming and funny. In the clubs, he will leave behind acts like Woody Bob Muddy, who recreates a Roman circus by whipping up the audience to a frenzy as it shouts out which old albums should go to 'Record Heaven' and which should be nailed to a board and smashed to pieces by his silver hammer. As the hysterical crowd saves Abba and dooms Buck's Fizz, you admire the skill with which alternative comedy has enabled eccentrics to share their secret worlds and the British to shake off their inhibitions.</p>

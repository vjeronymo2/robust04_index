			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Ratners to shut stores and cut overheads RATNERS Group, the UK jewellery retailer which pioneered 9 carat gold earrings for 99p a pair, has decided to reverse its marketing strategy in an attempt to return to profitability. Mr Gerald Ratner, chief executive, who once boasted that his earrings cost less than a prawn sandwich from Marks and Spencer, yesterday said: 'We cannot carry on being a sales-led organisation.' The emphasis would now be on profits. The group will close 180 of its 880 shops in the UK and 150 of its 1,000 shops in the US over the next three years. Staff costs and other overheads will also be cut. Ratners blamed the effect of the recession on consumer spending for a pre-tax loss of Pounds 122.3m in its last financial year, to February 1, compared with a profit of Pounds 112.1m in the previous year. The losses included Pounds 98m of exceptional costs relating largely to rationalisation of the business. Ratners also announced an agreement with its bankers to continue existing loans until the end of June next year. Mr James McAdam, who joined the group as executive chairman in January, said the performance of the 250 shops in the Ratners chain had been particularly poor after a remark by Mr Ratner in April last year incurred 'adverse publicity'. Mr Ratner told a conference at the Institute of Directors that one of the group's products was 'total crap'. Although Mr Ratner had expressed similar opinions previously in more discreet surroundings, his speech was widely reported and alienated customers. Sales in the Ratners chain fell 24 per cent in 1991 on a comparable store basis. Mr McAdam said there had been an over-dependence on low prices and promotional activity. The group's acquisition-led growth had also resulted in 'self-destructive competition' between the company's shops. The Ratners stores will bear the brunt of the UK closures, with 112 shops to be shut. The other UK jewellery chains, H Samuel and Ernest Jones, will focus on middle and upper sections of the market. Mr McAdam said sales had fallen again in the first half of the current year, but added that the group was 'not banking on any sales recovery' in its attempts to turn the losses around. Mr Ratner said: 'We are succeeding on the margin front and the overhead front. The sales downturn is being mitigated by those factors.' Banks extend borrowing facilities, Page 8 Lex, Page 22</p>

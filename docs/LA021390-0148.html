			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARTS;  </P> <P> NEIMAN ARTWORKS STOLEN IN N.Y.  </P> <P> Thieves smashed through a SoHo gallery's front door today and snatched $750,000  worth of art works -- including nine oil paintings and drawings by LeRoy Neiman  -- in a lightning-fast pre-dawn heist, police said.  </P> <P> The burglars broke through glass panels in the double doors at Dyansen Gallery,  hot-wired an electronic operated steel security gate and made off with the  artworks in less than five minutes.  </P> <P> A gallery official said a Neiman drawing of TV's David Frost was among the  loot.  </P> <P> In addition to the paintings and drawings by Neiman, whose paintings often  depict famous people at play, the thieves made off with six other paintings and  four sculptures, said a Dyansen official. The stolen works were valued at about  $750,000 by the gallery.  </P></p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Decline in tobacco profits leaves T&amp;S 6% lower A DROP in profits from tobacco retailing and from shop disposals lay behind a fall of more than 6 per cent at T&amp;S Stores last year. The pre-tax figure declined from Pounds 13.4m to Pounds 12.5m on sales up 10 per cent at Pounds 345.3m (Pounds 314.2m). Operating profits were ahead to Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 12.4m), but lower profits from disposals, reduced interest income and a charge for reorganisation hit the pre-tax line. Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman and chief executive, said it had been a frustrating year. 'A number of growth opportunities came to nothing as either price, quality or a combination of both proved to be a stumbling block.' The group remains keen to expand its convenience store network. It has admitted that it looked at the Circle K chain, recently sold to Watson &amp; Philip for Pounds 21m. The Dillons convenience stores increased their profits to Pounds 3.89m (Pounds 3.12m) on sales of Pounds 68m (Pounds 52.1m). Eleven stores were opened, mainly in the second half. However, the advance in convenience stores was undone by a fall in profits from Pounds 3.76m to Pounds 3.16m, on sales of Pounds 175.3m (Pounds 165.4m) at Supercigs. Margins were squeezed by increased competition. To try to improve the business, the discount formula was being rolled out from cigarettes to magazines and greetings cards. At the Dillons newsagents, profits were flat at Pounds 5.59m (Pounds 5.57m) on sales of Pounds 102.1m (Pounds 96.7m). T&amp;S said Pounds 1m of annual costs had been taken out of the business. At the year-end the group's overdraft was Pounds 9.5m, compared with Pounds 12m. The company said this was seasonal and it often had up to Pounds 10m cash in the bank. Earnings per share slipped to 15.17p (15.71p). The final dividend goes up to 3.5p to give a total of 5.9p (5.5p). COMMENT T&amp;S has some defensive virtues, but in a weak market these have not been sufficient to keep earnings moving ahead. Growth is seen as coming mainly from acquisitions, but it is a long time since the big leap forward made in spring 1989 with the acquisition of Preedy and Dillons from Next. Analysts are not only holding their breath waiting for the next deal - and the anticipated issue of paper - but also on the outcome of the discount magazines experiment. Previous attempts have fallen foul of the wholesalers. T&amp;S believes it has the muscle to pull it off and that scrutiny of the trade by the MMC will keep the wholesalers on their best behaviour. Because of a sharply rising tax charge, the group would have to sprint this year to stay level on earnings per share. Profits are forecast to rise to more than Pounds 13m, giving a prospective p/e of 12-13 on yesterday's close of 173p. At this discount to the market, it is well worth holding.</p>

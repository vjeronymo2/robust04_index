			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAGGART TESTIMONY IN DOUBT AMID NEW REVELATIONS  </P> <P> New revelations Friday cast doubt on congressional testimony this week by  former California Savings and Loan Commissioner Lawrence W. Taggart on his  financial ties to a failed Texas thrift and his decision while commissioner to  grant speculative investment powers to Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine.  </P> <P> The revelations suggest that a personal loan provided to Taggart was used by a  now-defunct Texas thrift to invest in a California savings and loan without  proper regulatory approval.  </P> <P> The disclosures also show that Taggart approved broader investment powers for  Lincoln in 1984 after being named a director of a San Diego company that  Lincoln invested in a short time later. Lincoln's risky investments were a key  factor in its subsequent failure, an event that will cost taxpayers as much as  $2 billion.  </P> <P> Late Friday, Taggart denied any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> In his testimony Tuesday before the House Banking Committee, Taggart  acknowledged that Vernon Savings &amp; Loan -- a high-flying thrift that was  closed in 1987 amid federal allegations that it was looted by its officers --  bought a 1985 loan of his from San Diego National Bank.  </P> <P> Taggart planned to use the $600,000 loan to buy a one-third stake in Shelter  Island Savings Bank, a fledging San Diego thrift that never opened because it  was unable to get federal deposit insurance. Taggart, the state's top thrift  regulator in 1983 and 1984, was working as a consultant then.  </P> <P> Taggart told the committee that he discovered Vernon's connection to the loan  "when I started getting statements from Vernon Savings and started asking  questions." Taggart said in his testimony that he borrowed money from the San  Diego bank and found out subsequently that the note had been sold to Vernon.  </P> <P> But two bank memos obtained by The Times show that Vernon's purchase of the  loan was arranged at the time it was funded in September, 1985. One memo,  written in August, 1985, by a former senior officer at the San Diego bank, said  Vernon would assume the note by the end of 1985. Another, written by former  Vernon President Patrick G. King in September, 1985, specifies that Vernon  would pay $620,000 for the Taggart loan.  </P> <P> "Both Vernon and Taggart were in the loan at the same time. It was up front,  not after the fact as he indicated in his testimony," said committee member  Rep. Richard Lehman (D-Sanger).  </P> <P> In an interview Friday night, Taggart repeated that he was unaware of Vernon's  involvement. "I didn't know about it at the time the loan was taken out,"  Taggart said.  </P> <P> The loan arrangement with Vernon, along with other loan-related memos, raises  questions about whether Vernon was trying to invest through Taggart in Shelter  Island Savings without proper regulatory approvals. A separate memo obtained by  The Times, written by a Vernon loan officer in July, 1986, states that the  purpose of the transaction was "for Mr. Taggart to purchase a savings and loan  institution in San Diego on Vernon's behalf."  </P> <P> Taggart denied that the purpose of the loan was to make thrift investments for  Vernon. "That is the very first time I've ever heard that," he said.  </P> <P> Taggart worked for Vernon in 1986 as a $10,000-a-month consultant.  </P> <P> In a separate development Friday, San Diego financier Thomas C. Stickel is  disputing Taggart's congressional testimony on when he joined Stickel's TCS  Enterprises financial services firm in San Diego as a director, according to a  published report.  </P> <P> Stickel, quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle, said Taggart was named a TCS  director effective November, 1984. That contradicts Taggart's testimony that he  became a TCS director on Jan. 1, 1985, when he also became president of a TCS  subsidiary.  </P> <P> The date Taggart joined TCS is significant because it would show he had  business ties to the firm on Dec. 7, 1984, the date he authorized Lincoln  Savings to invest $800 million in speculative investments. A little more than a  month after Taggart's decision, Lincoln provided TCS a cash infusion of $2.9  million in exchange for a 20% stake.  </P> <P> Stickel was traveling and could not be reached for comment. But James B.  Kylstad, a TCS executive vice president, confirmed that Taggart was named a  director that November.  </P> <P> In his testimony, Taggart said that he had no involvement with TCS until 1985  and that the November date on Securities and Exchange Commission documents is  wrong. In an interview, Taggart said he knew he would be joining TCS at the  time of the Lincoln decision but said it was unrelated to his action.  </P> <P> "They (Lincoln executives) didn't have the slightest idea I was going with  TCS," Taggart said.  </P> <P> Taggart said that even though he knew he would join the firm, he was not active  with it until 1985.  </P></p>

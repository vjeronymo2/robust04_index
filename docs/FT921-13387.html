			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Nationwide group of clubs planned to meet needs of small businesses PLANS for a nationwide network of small-business clubs were announced in London yesterday. Durham Small Business Club, which is promoting the idea, hopes the new network, named Small Business Clubs Nationwide, will start to operate with 20 member clubs on April 1. It is intended for small established businesses, many of which find chambers of commerce are too expensive or too formal. According to Mr Tom Moffat, chairman of the Durham Business Club, member clubs of the new organisation would have to be professionally managed with full-time staff and a range of activities making them self-supporting - unlike many existing business clubs which were run on a part-time, voluntary basis. Clubs would pay Pounds 2,500 to join the national organisation plus Pounds 5 of their annual Pounds 35 members' subscription to maintain the central organisation. Mr Moffat said the new network needed at least 20 members to raise the Pounds 50,000 required for public limited company status but could start on an unincorporated basis with 10 to 12 members. At a conference to launch the plan in London yesterday 10 representatives of existing business clubs, training and enterprise councils and local authorities said they were interested. A second conference is to be held in Durham tomorrow. Mr Moffat said chambers of commerce had reacted cautiously to the plan and were watching developments. He believed business clubs would complement rather than compete with the chambers. They might eventually form part of a three-tier business support network with start-ups helped by enterprise agencies, smaller established businesses belonging to a club and larger businesses belonging to a chamber. Few businesses take steps to reduce the risk of bad debts or to encourage their customers to pay on time, according to a survey by Barclays Commercial Services (BCS), the bank's factoring subsidiary. Four out of five businesses polled said they had no form of credit protection cover for their invoices even though late payment and non-payment were significant causes of business failure. Only one in four said they offered a discount for early settlement. BCS surveyed 298 businesses, of which 29 per cent were engaged in manufacturing, 26 per cent in retailing and 21 per cent in services. Just over half had sales of less than Pounds 2.5m and 10 per cent sales of Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 10m.</p>

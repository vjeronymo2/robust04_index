			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   South African-Zimbabwean Relations Thaw -- Johannesburg THE  STAR in English on 9 February in a page-14 editorial believes  the "previously frosty relations between South Africa and  Zimbabwe" are continuing to thaw. The "latest defrosting is  marked by the meeting in Harare between South Africa's Minister  of Justice, Kobie Coetsee, and his Zimbabwean counterpart,  Emerson Mnangagwa." An earlier meeting between President Mugabe  and President F.W. de Klerk resulted in the "revival of the  extradition treaty between the two states." Now Zimbabwe is  urged to "heed South African pleas for the release of five  prisoners" who are "suspected South African agents, who were  captured and convicted for their role in destabilising Zimbabwe  during the height of the armed struggle." These men "deserve  the same right to amnesty as the hundreds of men and women who  have been freed from prison since De Klerk's decision to seek a  solution around the negotiating table rather than on the  battlefield."    Right Wing, Buthelezi Play Kamikaze Politics -- Allister  Sparks writes in an article on the same page that the right wing  and Inkatha Chief Buthelezi are engaging in "Kamikaze politics,"  and "self-destruction with a vengeance." "Sure the right wing  can launch a campaign of sabotage and terrorism. They can make  things extremely uncomfortable and do great damage to the new  South Africa. But in the process they will set themselves up as  the targets of vengeance and loathing for years to come. No  minority group can survive that for long. If ever there was a  formula for national suicide, this is it." Chief Buthelezi of  the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) is also following this hardball  strategy pursued by the right wing. Sparks believes the "true  explanation" for this is that "his ego is such that he cannot  face the prospect of fighting an election he is likely to lose,  and so he wants out. From the beginning Buthelezi has wanted to  secure for himself a third position equal in status to that of  Nelson Mandela and President de Klerk. He now knows this is  unattainable and he cannot come to terms with the idea of  playing second fiddle to anyone."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Criticism of COSATU Undemocratic Support for Single Ballot  --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 9 February in a page 10  editorial asks "someone who understands democracy" to "pay a  call" on Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU)  headquarters. "Lessons in the workings of a democratic system,  and a word or two about political tolerance, are sorely needed."  The COSATU leadership "clearly does not understand" that the  "single ballot it supports so fervently is undemocratic. It  clearly cannot appreciate that people could oppose the single  ballot on democratic grounds without aligning themselves with  any party political cause. And it ignores the fact that the DP  [Democratic Party] an the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] also  support the double ballot -- two parties which can hardly be  said to be in bed with the right wing. COSATU deeply resents  anyone taking a view opposed to the ANC/COSATU `line'."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Danger of Sidelining Freedom Alliance -- Johannesburg  SOWETAN  in English on 9 February in a page 8 editorial warns there are  "dangers" which can be prompted by sidelining the Freedom  Alliance (FA). Although the FA "does not have the will to  fight," and there are many civil servants in the homelands who  "are not happy to sacrifice everything for the ambitions of  their political masters," there are "elements in the FA who have  the ability to terrorise the people of this country."  Therefore, "it makes sense to forge a deal now before the  country is plunged into civil strife. This should be done  without compromising the sovereignty or integrity of the new  South Africa."</p>

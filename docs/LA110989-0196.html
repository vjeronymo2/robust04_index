			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> DRAMARAMA MIXES SPACE AND TIME FOR PUNCHY, SELF-CONSCIOUS SHOW  </P> <P> All right: who messed with the space-time continuum controls at the Roxy?  </P> <P> Dramarama -- the L.A. via New Jersey band that has built a loyal local  following through KROQ airplay over the last couple of years -- performed last  week decked out in colorful, '60s-ish shirts on a stage strewn with Love  Generation flowers; its music reflecting an array of '70s glitter and punk  influences, its audience a slam-dancing morass of collegiates and skinheads  drawn to the band's '80s suburban-Angst themes. The group plays the Coach House  in San Juan Capistrano on Friday.  </P> <P> Actually, each of those phenomena was approached too self-consciously to  simulate authenticity. But that didn't lessen the fact that Dramarama's music  at its best carries a punch as real as the bruises the slammers took home.  </P> <P> Celebrating the release of its new "Stuck in Wonderamaland" album (and  suffering from some serious-sounding head colds), the band powered its way  through 70 minutes of catchy but raw rockers and well-placed, self-doubt-laden  ballads, spiced by tributes to David Bowie (an almost Neil Young-like version  of "Sweet Thing") and the New York Dolls. John Easdale, singing like a cross  between Iggy Pop and Ian Hunter and looking -- with his beard, shoulder-length  hair and flat expression -- a bit like the Mad Monk, is a solid, sometimes  compelling frontman. Still, something seemed to be missing.  </P> <P> But if you (correctly) think of Dramarama as sort of the Replacements' older  brothers, something's missing. The sextet shares the 'Mats overwhelming sense  of emotional frailties while singing about the same kind of concrete  inspirations ("70's TV") and needs (a "Last Cigarette" before bed). The  frustrations -- sometimes specific, sometimes nebulous -- come through as real.  </P> <P> But the band could pick up a few tips from its little "siblings." Replacements'  shows are erratic, as likely to be a sloppy mess as a brilliant display, but  (or because) they're tied to the emotions of the moment. They do (or don't)  play particular songs simply because it's what they feel like doing right then.  </P> <P> Although its stage command has grown by leaps an bounds over the last couple of  years, Dramarama last week seemed as if it were doing songs because they were  on the set list. And whatever aura of spontaneity might have survived was blown  when Easdale preceded "Last Cigarette" by asking if anyone had a light for his.  </P> <P>  Dramarama and Tommy Keene play Friday at the Coach House, 33157 Camino  Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Show time: 9 p.m. Tickets: $15. Information:  (714) 496-8930.  </P> <P> </P></p>

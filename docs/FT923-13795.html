			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Greene King extends its Pounds 103m bid for Morland GREENE KING, the East Anglia based brewer, has extended its Pounds 102.6m hostile bid for Morland, the Thames Valley brewer, until Friday, July 24. The offer was to have closed yesterday. But Greene King said it wanted to give investors more time to make their decision following the recent ruling from the Takeover Panel preventing it publishing its results for the year to May 3. The Panel decided that publication of the results, due to take place yesterday, could have affected the outcome of the bid. Greene King has 46.9 per cent of Morland. In a separate move Morland sent a circular to shareholders accusing Greene King of not being 'entirely frank' in its documents. Sir Humphrey Prideaux, chairman of Morland, said: 'Its difficulty is that Morland, we believe, is a far more successful company . . . It (Greene King) has therefore, had to resort to the absurd suggestion that past and current performance of a company are no guide to its future.' Morland has forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.6m for the year to September 30, compared with Pounds 5.9m. Over the past few weeks Greene King has been challenged by Morland to issue a similar profit forecast for the year which was why Greene King wanted to announce its full year results.</p>

To review the year's  development, our reporters (Deng Xiujian) and (Shi Yan)  interviewed Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei and two  international affairs researchers. Here is (Lin Shaowen) with  this year-end special "Global Briefing 93."    Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei says that 1993 is the  second post Cold War year. The world on the whole is gradually  becoming a multipolar system. He admits that instability is on  the rise, although a new world war is unlikely in a short time.  Tian Zengpei says one important change in 1993 was the rise of  the Asia-Pacific region in terms of political and economic  importance. Tian Zengpei says the rapid and steady economic  growth in Asia has become the focus of world attention and  contrast with the recession elsewhere, especially in the  industrial world. The national GNP in major Asian nations rose  by 7.1 percent in 1993. He says the combined total economic  strength of Asian nations around the Pacific Rim is now one  quarter of the world total. This has forced many countries to  adjust their foreign policies. The U.S. Government has  gradually shifted its foreign policy focus to the Asia Pacific  as President Clinton believes that it will play a most important  role in the U.S. economy. Signs show Japan is returning to Asia  economically. With half of its overseas investment in East  Asia, Japan has surpassed U.S. as the leading investor in the  area. European countries such as Germany have also adopted new  policies toward Asia. In contrast, industrialized countries all  suffer from a kind of post Cold War syndrome. Tian Zengpei says  many western countries suffer from the longest economic  recession since World War II. This caused social problems and  political instability. Public demonstrations continue. Some  ruling parties which have been in power for long period were  crushed at the polls. Some government leaders have to be  replaced. The vice foreign minister calls it the second most  important characteristics of the year. [passage omitted]    Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei says regional economic  cooperation is most valued. The European Community has approved  the Maastrict Treaty on closer European union. The United  States, Canada, and Mexico endorsed the North America Free Trade  Agreement to develop the region into the world's largest free  trade zone. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum held  its first minister meeting and an informal leadership meeting,  pledging to strengthen cooperation in economic and trade  matters. And finally, in December, after tough bargaining, 117  countries concluded the Uruguay Round agreement on global trade  under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade.

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (11): The race is on to build the big 'un - A look at the industry's next challenge, the super jumbo The world's two leading commercial aircraft manufacturers - Boeing of the US and the European Airbus consortium - have been stepping up the pace in their efforts to meet what they believe will be the next big challenge for the industry: the development of a new generation of super jumbo airliners capable of seating 600-800 passengers and possible even more. For the past two years, Boeing and the four Airbus partner companies including Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain have been conducting joint studies on how to develop and market together a Very Large Commercial Transport (VLCT). But the two sides have also remained deeply suspicious of each other and have continued to pursue their own studies in the event their ambitious VLCT collaborative project collapses. So far only two airlines have said they would be prepared to commit themselves to buying a super jumbo. Not surprisingly, the two are the world's most profitable carriers, Singapore Airlines and British Airways. However, most other international carriers, still struggling under the burden of financial losses and debt accumulated during the industry's worst post-war recession, have been reluctant to express anything more than a vague interest in a large capacity airliner which is likely to cost them around Dollars 200m a piece. That has not deterred the two manufacturers on each side of the Atlantic to pursue their studies. They believe that in the longer term there will be a requirement for around 300-500 super jumbos in the next century. They see these extra large aircraft as providing a solution to increasing congestion at busy international airports and air routes at a time when air travel is expected to continue showing steady expansion and in some areas in the Asia-Pacific region vigorous growth. 'We think a big aircraft is necessary to cope with traffic growth and congestion at airports, especially when you consider that 33 airports alone account for 50 per cent of world air traffic,' says Claude Terrazzoni, head of the commercial aircraft division of Aerospatiale, the French Airbus partner. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, explains that a super jumbo would help the UK carrier tackle some of the growing congestion problems at its London base of Heathrow. It would also give BA the opportunity to offer new services for passengers. BA has already made its own design studies for the configuration of such an aircraft, including the introduction of inflight business offices equipped with faxes, telephones and personal computers, a cinema-style inflight entertainment room, and even a work-out section for fitness addicts. 'We see the use for such an aircraft on Far East routes, Australasia services and across the Atlantic,' Sir Colin says. 'And we would be willing to go forward with a new aircraft of 600 seats offering the same long range but also 20 per cent lower operating costs than the Boeing 747-400,' he adds. Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, believes there will be demand for a very large aircraft by the turn of the century. 'By around 2002, airlines will have to consider replacing their existing 747-400 fleets,' he explains. But both Boeing and Airbus agree that there is unlikely to be room in the market for more than one new super jumbo project in view of the programme's heavy development costs estimated at around Dollars 8bn-Dollars 10bn. This was the main reason behind the decision of Boeing and the four Airbus partners to consider collaborating in the same way as US, European and Japanese manufacturers believe that the eventual development of a next generation supersonic airliner to replace Concorde will need the broadest possible international co-operation. Although Boeing and the Airbus partners have pursued their joint VLCT studies, there have been growing signs of tensions emerging between the two sides and strong possibilities that they will ultimately decide to part ways. Airbus has become increasingly worried that Boeing is using the joint studies as a tactic to delay the European consortium's entry into the very large aircraft market and challenge the US company's traditional monopoly of this sector with its 747. The Airbus theory is that Boeing is in no hurry to launch a new large aircraft development programme at a time when its hands are already full with other projects including its new 777 widebody twin-engine airliner, the renewal of its 737 family of narrowbody twin-engine airliners and the development of a cargo version of the 767. Boeing has clearly been anxious to protect its dominance of the top end of the market and has maintained close contacts with airline customers. Apart from the joint studies with the Airbus partners, Boeing has been considering developing a bigger version of the 747 with a new wing. It has also been studying the development on its own of a new very large aircraft. With increasing signs that Boeing's preferred option is to build a bigger derivative of the 747 and that the Seattle manufacturer is already quite advanced with its studies, Airbus recently decided to step up its own efforts to develop a new 500 to 600-seat jumbo, the A3XX. 'You simply cannot afford to be out of such an important segment of the market if you want to remain a leading aircraft manufacturer,' says a senior Airbus official. All manufacturers expect the top end of the airliner market to become increasingly important with aircraft of more than 400 seats accounting for more than 40 per cent of the value of the civil aircraft business in the next 20 years. 'We must give Boeing the strongest possible signal that Airbus will develop its own jumbo if Boeing decided to go it alone with a bigger 747,' adds Louis Gallois, the Aerospatiale chairman. This has prompted the Airbus supervisory board to give the consortium the go-ahead to start marketing in September its new A3XX jumbo to a selected group of international airlines after the Farnborough Air Show. The Airbus plans involve an aircraft with two decks running the full length of the fuselage, powered by four engines and would have a range of 7,000-8,000 nautical miles. With the probabilities increasing that Boeing and Airbus will ultimately decide to go their own separate ways in the jumbo market, the race is now on to build the world's biggest aircraft.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson suffered side effects associated with steroid use  19 months ago, including breast enlargement and insomnia, his family doctor  said.  </P> <P> Testifying in Toronto as part of a Canadian inquiry into drugs and sports, Dr.  Jack Sussman said he had been baffled by tremendous muscle development in  Johnson, who had first visited him as a scrawny Jamaican immigrant in 1979.  Johnson was stripped of an Olympic gold medal when steroids were found in his  urine last fall at the Seoul Games.  </P> <P> Referring to medical charts throughout his testimony, Sussman said he had  suspected that Johnson was on banned muscle-building drugs in October of 1987,  when the sprinter's left breast grew unnaturally large.  </P> <P> The condition is one of the less serious side effects of steroid use. But  Sussman said that when he asked Johnson directly, he denied using steroids.  </P></p>

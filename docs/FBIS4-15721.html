			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "We Will Share the Newcomer with </F> KOLOBOK"]    [Text] The pilot issue of the first official CIS weekly  SNG: OBSHCHIY RYNOK [CIS: Common Market] was published today.  The decision to publish it on the basis of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA was  made by the Council of Heads of Government of the 12 states at  the meeting held in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] 23 December last year.    The economic weekly's start-up money comes from equal  contributions paid in by the copublisher-states. The total sum  for the current year is 950 million rubles and $200,000 (the  foreign currency is for equipment). From next year the  newspaper is to be a self-financing operation.    The editorial office of OBSHCHIY RYNOK, which finds itself  in  straitened circumstances (three desks and one phone for four  people, which are shared with the magazine KOLOBOK),  nevertheless decided not to postpone publishing a proper version  but to make the pilot issue as close to the real thing as  possible. It carries articles from all 12 states and devotes  pages to policy statements. The new publication's journalists  think that they will be able to start regular publication in the  very near future.</p>

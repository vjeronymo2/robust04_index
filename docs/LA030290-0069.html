			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FESTIVE AIR PREVAILS AT RITES FOR PUBLISHER MALCOLM FORBES  </P> <P> Former President Richard M. Nixon, actress Elizabeth Taylor, Chrysler Corp.  Chairman Lee A. Iacocca and hundreds of other mourners filled St. Bartholomew's  Episcopal Church here Thursday for a memorial service for publisher Malcolm  Forbes.  </P> <P> Forbes, who died Saturday at age 70, loved a good time, from partying to racing  motorcycles to riding in hot-air balloons, and his memorial service at the Park  Avenue church had a festive rather than funereal air.  </P> <P> The service featured music on a variety of instruments loved by the Forbes  magazine owner, including Scottish bagpipes and English horns.  </P> <P> Parked outside the church was Forbes' red, tan and black Harley-Davidson, an  America flag on one handlebar and the flag of Scotland on the other.  </P> <P> Nixon sat in the front pew of the landmark church, near his daughter Julie  Eisenhower, Miss Taylor and former Mayor Edward I. Koch.  </P> <P> Other mourners included Barbara Walters, Joan Rivers and David Rockefeller.  </P> <P> In a eulogy, Forbes' son Robert broke down as he said, "I have dreaded this  moment. It has been a hell of a party. Thanks for the trip."  </P> <P> Forbes' most famous party was a $2-million birthday affair his children threw  for him last year in Morocco.  </P></p>

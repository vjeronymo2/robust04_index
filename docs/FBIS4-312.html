			<p>BFN     [Text] The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola  [MPLA], the acknowledged winner of the first Angolan elections  and, therefore, responsible for the formation of this country's  first democratic government, today reacted to the statement of  the 14 parties making up the so-called Democratic Civilian  Opposition. MPLA Information Secretary Joao Lourenco has granted  an interview to the People's Television of Angola in which he  commented on that statement.    [Begin recording] [Lourenco] The statement issued yesterday  by the self-styled Democratic Civilian Opposition is absurd, to  say the least. That is because we do not understand how a  country that has existed for some 20 years can remain forever in  a state of transition. What the so-called Democratic Civilian  Opposition parties want is for the present institutions, which  emerged from the 1992 elections, to be scrapped. That is  absurd. It cannot be accepted. That would be tantamount to  betraying the large majority of Angolan people who cast their  votes in September 1992. The people turned out at the polls to  vote for the party they regarded as being the best and the one  best equipped to defend their aspirations. It is necessary that  the electorate's choice of the MPLA be respected in full.    [Unidentified correspondent] Would the MPLA be in the  position to make concessions? For instance, those parties have  asked for the demilitarization of all forces. They also asked  for a greater number of blue helmet forces to be sent over.  Would the MPLA be willing to make concessions regarding those  points?    [Lourenco] It seems to me that the so-called Democratic  Civilian Opposition is beginning to behave irresponsibly, to put  it mildly. It does not even have an idea about what its  responsibilities should be. It is true that the country is  going through a crisis. There is a fierce conflict between the  government and a political party that is illegally armed. That  party has begun a war throughout Angolan territory and that war  has had serious consequences, meaning that the opposition  parties should act in accordance with the laws in force in this  country and demand that the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA], which is contravening the law,  be the only party to be disarmed, so that UNITA can start  operating in accordance with the Constitutional Law and other  laws in force in this country. So, if any side is to be  disarmed, that side should be the one with an illegal army. To  my knowledge, the sole illegal army in this country belongs to  UNITA. In view of that, only the UNITA army should be  demilitarized and disarmed.    We believe that it would be at the very least suicidal to  disarm the Angolan Armed Forces and the Angolan Police. We  believe such measures would place in jeopardy the very existence  of the Angolan State. [end recording]</p>

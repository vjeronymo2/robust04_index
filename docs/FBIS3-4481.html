			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 30 (CNA) -- The fifth meeting of the  GATT working party screening Taiwan's membership application has  been postponed until June, a Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT)  official said Wednesday [30 March].    "The postponement will enable Taiwan to complete bilateral  tariff reduction talks with more countries under the framework  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)," said Tsai  Lien- sheng, director of the BOFT's Third Department. The  meeting was originally scheduled for may.    Twenty-one GATT contracting parties have expressed interest  in holding bilateral tariff talks with Taiwan, Tsai said.  Taiwan has so far held consultations with only seven -- the  United States, Hungary, South Africa, Chile, New Zealand, Turkey  and Australia.    The talks with those countries in February and March did not  produce any concrete results because nearly all were not  satisfied with Taiwan's market-opening plans, Tsai said.    Although Taiwan promised to replace its current quota and  area restrictions on farm trade by imposing high tariff rates on  agricultural imports within a certain period of time, most of  those countries opposed the proposal. "They insisted that  Taiwan liberalize farm trade immediately and adopt tariff rates  compatible with GATT requirements," Tsai explained.    Taiwan originally planned to reduce its tariff rates on  agricultural imports to GATT-acceptable levels within six to 10  years.    "After the first round of talks with those countries, we  have  come to understand that the chances of realizing our originial  plans are slim," Tsai noted.    "We can now only seek to gain a shorter `adjustment period'  for our farmers to cope with open market challenges," he said.    Against this background, Tsai said, the government must  modify trade liberalization plans before it can begin  multilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties.    "We have therefore asked for the postponement of the fifth  GATT working meeting on our membership bid," Tsai noted.    Taiwan is scheduled to hold first-round tariff reduction  talks with Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore in  April, Tsai said, adding these countries are also most concerned  about Taiwan's farm trade liberalization plans.    Taiwan will also consult with the 12-member European Union,  El Salvador and several other countries on tariff and non-tariff  trade issues before June, Tsai added.    Taiwan was granted GATT observer status in September 1992  and  is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.</p>

(``EPS'') constituted a tying arrangement that was per se unlawful under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;1, and that constituted a means whereby EPS unlawfully had maintained a monopoly in access to regional automatic teller machine (``ATM'') networks in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the States of New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia and New Hampshire, and in substantial portions of the State of Ohio (collectively the ``affected states''), all in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;2. The United States simultaneously filed a proposed Final Judgment, a Competitive Impact Statement and a Stipulation signed by the parties consenting to entry of the Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sixty-day waiting period provided for by 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(b) for submission of public comments expired on July 11, 1994. The United States received comments from Cash Station, Inc. (``Cash Station''), Chemical Banking Corporation (``Chemical Bank''), Citicorp Credit Services, Inc. (``Citicorp''), William R. Kennedy, Meridian Bancorp, Inc. (``Meridian''), Midwest Payment Systems, Inc. (``MPS''), Money Station, Inc. (``Money Station''), and The New York Switch Corporation (``NYCE''). The United States also received an anonymous comment. The United States responds herein to these comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Stored Value Cards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The subject raised most often by the comments was the treatment of stored value cards under the proposed Final Judgment. Stored value cards are designed to accept a ``deposit'' of funds, which are then drawn down by transfer to other parties in transactions. The card effectively replaces cash in these transactions. The most common use of stored value cards today is in public transit, most notably in the Bay Area Rapid Transit system in the San Francisco area and the Washington, DC Metro system. Rather than paying separately for each ride, a customer purchases a card for a certain amount, that amount is ``deposited in'' the card, and the cost of each subsequent ride is deducted from the value in the card. The passenger may add value to the card with additional ``deposits.'' Libraries also commonly sell stored valued cards for use in their copying machines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Slobodan Jarcevic Monday  [24 January] warned the U.N. Security Council that Croatia  wishes to occupy the R.S.K. by military aggression and that it  is striving to get the approval of the international communty to  this end.    Jarcevic said that the R.S.K., republic proclaimed in 1991  by  the Serbs in the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of  Croatia where they are in majority, will defend its independence  with determination. He underlined that the U.N. must help the  just struggle of the R.S.K. and the right of its people to  self-determination, guaranteed by the U.N. Charter.    Already in 1990, through terror and ethnic cleansing,  Croatia  caused the creation of two purely national states in the  territory of the former Croatia : the Republic of Croatia and  the R.S.K., Jarcevic said in a letter to the U.N. Security  Council chairman. Jarcevic was reacting to a letter addressed  on January 22 to the Security Council by Croatian Foreign  Minister Mate Granic, demanding that the international community  help Croatia annex R.S.K. territory.    Croatia believes that the joint declaration of the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) and Croatia on the normalization  of their relations gives it the green light to occupy the  R.S.K., he said. Croatian President Tudjman Saturday warned  that Croatia would recover the R.S.K. territory by other means  if not through an agreement. The F.R.Y. has signed the  declaration in order to normalize relations with the Republic of  Croatia, and not to help Croatia annex the R.S.K. as the  Croatian minister claimed in his letter, Jarcevic noted.    F.R.Y. and Croatian representatives signed on January 19 in  Geneva a joint declaration on the normalization of their  relations. Since the former Yugoslav Federation disintegrated,  the two states have had no economic or political relations.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency believes that Congressional enactment of RCRA establishes a strong Federal interest in effective management of solid waste. EPA also notes that, where solid waste affects ground water which has pathways that allow it to migrate readily, it would be practically very difficult to separate out the effects of solid waste disposal on non-Indian fee land within a reservation from those on Tribal portions. In other words, any environmental impairment that occurs on, or as a result of, activities on non-Indian fee lands is very likely to impair Tribal lands. This also suggests that the serious and substantial effects of solid waste within the non-Indian portions of a reservation are very likely to affect Tribal health and welfare. EPA believes that a ``checkerboard'' system of regulation, whereby the Tribe and State split up regulation of solid waste on the Indian Lands, would exacerbate the difficulties of assuring compliance with RCRA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency also believes that the effects on Tribal health and welfare necessary to support Tribal regulation of non-Indian activities on Indian Lands may be easier to establish in the context of environmental regulation than with regard to zoning, which was at issue in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brendale.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is a significant distinction between land use planning and environmental regulation of solid waste under RCRA. The Supreme Court has explicitly recognized such a distinction: ``Land use planning in essence chooses particular uses for the land; environmental regulation does not mandate particular uses of the land but requires only that, however the land is used, damage to the environment is kept within prescribed limits.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> California Coastal Comm'n  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Granite Rock Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 480 U.S. 572, 587 (1987). The Court has relied on this distinction to support a finding that States retain authority to carry out environmental regulation even in cases where their ability to carry out general land use regulation is preempted by federal law.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 587&hyph;89.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, management of solid waste serves the purpose of protecting public health and safety, which is a core governmental function, whose exercise is critical to self-government. The special status of governmental actions to protect public health and safety is well established. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  By contrast, the power to zone can be exercised to achieve purposes which have little or no direct nexus to public health and safety. See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brendale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 492 U.S. at 420 n.5 (White, J.) (listing broad range of consequences of state zoning decision). Moreover, solid waste may affect ground water, which is mobile, freely migrating from one local jurisdiction to another, sometimes over large distances. By contrast, zoning regulates the uses of particular properties with impacts that are much more likely to be contained within a given local jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This special status has been reaffirmed by all nine justices in the context of Fifth Amendment takings law. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass'n  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> DeBenedictis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 480 U.S. 470, 491 n. 20 (1987);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at 512 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Operationally, EPA's generalized findings regarding the relationship of solid waste management to Tribal health and welfare will affect the legal analysis of a Tribal submission by, in effect, supplementing the factual showing a Tribe makes in applying for program approval. Thus, a Tribal submission regarding jurisdiction on fee lands will need to make a relatively simple showing of facts that there is or may be solid waste within the meaning of Subtitle D on the reservation and that the Tribe or Tribal members could be subject to exposure to that waste. The Tribe also must explicitly assert that activities of non-Indians regarding that waste would have a serious and substantial effect on the health and welfare of the Tribe. Once the Tribe meets this initial burden, EPA will, in light of the facts presented by the Tribe and the generalized statutory and factual findings regarding the importance of solid waste discussed above, presume that there has been an adequate showing of Tribal jurisdiction on fee lands, unless an appropriate governmental entity (e.g., an adjacent Tribe or State) demonstrates a lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Tribe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency recognizes that jurisdictional disputes between Tribes and States can be complex and difficult. However, EPA's ultimate responsibility is protection of the environment. In view of the mobility of environmental problems, and the interdependence of various jurisdictions, it is imperative that all affected sovereigns work cooperatively for environmental protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of this determination, Tribe is defined to mean any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community which is recognized by the Secretary of the Interior or Congress and which exercises substantial governmental duties and powers over any area. While the definition of Tribes in today's determination does not explicitly include Alaska Native Villages, EPA has not determined that such entities are ineligible to apply for permit program approval. Alaska Native entities (e.g., villages) may apply for permit program approval. Alaska Native Villages that demonstrate that their permit programs meet the requirements of today's proposal will be deemed adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Campo Band of Mission Indians  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 15, 1994, the Campo Band submitted an application for adequacy determination. EPA reviewed the Campo Band's application and tentatively determined that the following portions of the Tribe's Subtitle D program will ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. General criteria governing scope and applicability, definitions, and consideration of other federal laws (40 CFR 258.1, 258.2, 258.3);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Location restrictions for airport safety, floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, seismic impact zones, unstable areas, and closure of existing units (40 CFR 258.10, 258.11, 258.12, 258.13, 258.14, 258.15, and 258.16);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Operating criteria for exclusion of hazardous waste, cover material requirements, disease vector control, explosive gases control, air criteria, access requirements, run-on/run-off control systems, surface water requirements, liquids restrictions, and recordkeeping requirements (40 CFR 258.20, 258.21, 258.22, 258.23, 258.24, 258.25, 258.26, 258.27, 258.28, and 258.29);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

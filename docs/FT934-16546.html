			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Campbell TV debates fail to impress voters: Canada's Liberals need to take support from Quebec separatist parties to form a majority government after the election MS Kim Campbell, Canada's prime minister, was yesterday struggling to regain her footing after a lacklustre performance in two televised debates before the October 25 general election. With less than three weeks to go to election day, the question uppermost in commentators' minds is now whether the opposition Liberal party will garner enough votes to form a majority government. Recent opinion polls show the Tories slipping steadily behind the Liberals, but also show strong support for two regional parties, the Bloc Quebecois in Quebec and the populist Reform party, whose main strength is in western Canada. The televised debates, one in English and the other in French, were widely seen as one of the last opportunities for the Conservatives to make an impression on voters. But the inexperienced Ms Campbell was thrown on the defensive several times by her opponents, notably by Mr Lucien Bouchard, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, which has siphoned off a large chunk of Conservative support in Quebec. Quebec newspapers yesterday gave wide prominence to Ms Campbell's remark immediately after Monday night's debate that 'only Quebeckers will swallow' Mr Bouchard's budget deficit projections. Callers to radio phone-in shows also appeared unconvinced by Ms Campbell's promise to eliminate the CDollars 35.5bn (Pounds 17.4bn) budget deficit in five years without raising taxes or cutting costly social-security programmes. The Bloc Quebecois is far ahead of the other two parties in the francophone province, with a chance of winning 40 or more of Quebec's 75 seats in the House of Commons. The BQ's support comes partly from a hard core of Quebec separatists. But the group's promise to put Quebec's interests first has also attracted voters whose primary concerns are high unemployment and slipping living standards. But Mr Jean Chretien, the Liberals' leader, used the debates to make a forceful plea to his fellow Quebeckers not to heed the BQ's promises. 'Canada has enabled the francophone community to survive in North America,' Mr Chretien said. The Liberals' ability to form a majority government will depend heavily on their success in drawing support away from the BQ in Quebec over the next two weeks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ardian Myslimi: "Reform in the Military and the </F> Honor of Zhulali Are Defended by Facts and Laws and Not by  Servileness and Demagoguery"]    [Text] After defending a dissertation by attacking and  decimating the militaristic plans of NATO and the United States,  the author of the editorial in the 17 November 1993 issue of the  [Ministry of Defense] newspaper USHTRIA DHE KOHA appears to be  defending another thesis, this time by attacking newspapers and  defending its beloved minister. Attempting to convince us that  the mission of this newspaper is different from that of a  supplement of RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE, he convinces us even more  that, at the present time, the newspaper of the Ministry of  Defense is for the personal use of [minister of defense] Zhulali  and his staff. It has only words; it lacks logic and lacks the  facts and laws which support its reasoning. Reform in the  military is essential and all political forces are united in  this opinion. But it is abnormal and antidemocratic to give the  current government the sole credit in this area. It would be  more realistic to concede that the need for reform was conceived  during the time of the Nano government and the stability  government. Indeed, during the stability government, despite the  difficult conditions which the country and the military were  experiencing, serious work was done to carry out reform in the  area of laws, organization-building, regulations on exercises  and preparedness, and living conditions, so people began to say  that only the clocks and the officers were working in the  country. If you condemn and criticize issues related to reform  this does not mean that you are against reform. None of the  newspapers attacked the need for reform but only the means,  forms, and methods and the violations of the law. There are  thousands and thousands of soldiers who can prove that this  reform has been carried out on the basis of partisan criteria.  It is a bitter reality that the appointment and dismissal of  cadres are being carried out on the basis of authorization from  Democratic Party cells. It is unfortunate that the current  command and control apparatus is completely politicized. This is  not only illegal but also very dangerous for the future of the  military and of defense. If you claim that everything which has  taken place in the army has been achieved during the period of  the democratic government (that is, during the Democratic  Party's governing), this is an extremely nihilistic and hostile  claim. You forget, and not unintentionally, that the basic laws  on removing the military from political and party control were  passed during the time of the stability government and the  technical government. There has been a lot of talk, even by the  minister of defense, about the fact that military reform  requires a package of laws. Where are the laws besides the law  on ranks to which the minister added four perverse, offensive,  and illogical articles? Where are the law on social security,  the law on labor relations, and the decision on the 42-hour work  week? All these are lacking because no one is interested in  having the army being directed by these laws and in having a  reform carried out with a full juridical platform. Experience  and tradition are national resources in the army, just as in any  other field. Investments have been made for them and cannot be  lightly dismissed. It is not just a matter of economic treatment  which leaves much to be desired in the moral sphere or of the  melding of generations to conserve and utilize the experience  and skills of the elders and to keep the so-called "generation  conflict" out of the army. With such a well-thought out and  scientific melding, the army would be stronger and the tasks  would be carried out with fewer sacrifices. Can it be said that  this is good for the army: almost 70 percent of the officer  cadres who have attended Tirana University, about 65 percent of  the cadres who have attended the Academy of the General Staff,  hundreds of skilled specialists and technicians, and about 50  percent of the military with scientific titles and degrees have  left the army? New appointments have been made only by order,  with authorization. Promotions of two or three levels have been  made within four or five months and, what is worse, assignments  have been given on the basis of region. We never said that the  most inept have been left behind but the inept are in charge.  Aren't the following data sufficient proof: about 30 percent of  the division commanders are from Kavaje and 40 percent are from  Diber and, with some exceptions, their level is below average.  This practice of assignment on the basis of region, which has  the blessing of Zhulali, has resulted in transfers for no reason  at all, unjustified dismissals and appointments. Within a year,  four or five division commanders have been transferred and this  practice is continuing. Is is normal for a person who studied in  more than two university departments and who knows four foreign  languages to be replaced as director of intelligence by a person  who has only military training, to satisfy the needs of the  times? This and other appointments prove that appointments and  dismissals have taken place on the basis of the cell system.  Without giving exact figures, it is sufficient to mention that  the staff which is currently directing this reform considers  that only the cadres from Diber, Kukes, and Tropoje are the most  trusted. The testing which takes place in the army is only a  smokescreen to cover up and justify appointments on the basis of  partisan criteria. Isn't it revolting that cadres with truncated  military training are assigned to positions and youths who have  studied at military schools, the academy, and departments of  Tirana University, and who know foreign languages, are out on  the streets, selling cigarettes? The Tirana garrison is  monopolized by people from Tropoje and Diber. They are occupying  positions while talented specialists and soldiers are out in the  cold. A short time ago, six newly appointed young cadres in the  Academy of the General Staff were dismissed for no reason. These  are problems which are reflected in the entire structure of the  army. Their results are felt by thousands of officers. However,  the accusations of corruption which are being made against the  minister of defense continue to be disturbing and should disturb  the entire management apparatus of the ministry. The name of the  minister is never mentioned alone; it is linked with the names  of other cadres from the top military hierarchy. The task which  the author of the article in USHTRIA DHE KOHA has taken upon  himself is nothing but unjustified servileness. Safet Zhulali  has never had the strength and courage to break away from his  blind partisan position. During his entire activity with his  staff, he has tried to organize and manage his work according to  a blue ideology. It would have been to the credit of the  newspaper and it would have been courageous of those servile  newsmen not to protect corruption but to delve deeply to expose  it, regardless of the names, colors [orientations], and  positions the people involved might have. So far, they have not  said anything about the accusations which have been directed  against the minister of defense. This newspaper and its newsmen  have not dared to say that the expenditures in the homes of  generals currently in the Ministry of Defense are violations of  the law. How can this be defended in light of the undeniable  fact that $400,000 have not yet been repaid to the Ministry of  Defense. Also, a ship with contraband cigarettes set sail for an  unspecified destination, by order of the fleet commander. Ships  with goods which have not passed through customs have entered  Albanian territorial waters and the minister of defense and  other high-ranking military officials, whom their newspaper,  USHTRIA DHE KOHA, can only defend, have been implicated. Reform  is defended by laws, with arguments and facts. Corruption is not  defended by writings, by servileness, and by demagoguery. The  truth will come out, whether or not Zhulali, his generals, and  his servile scribblers want it. Perhaps tomorrow this reform  will be analyzed more than it has been analyzed by a major in  USHTRIA DHE KOHA and the responsibility and duties will be more  extensive. Perhaps tomorrow another Blerim besides Mr. Cela will  have the courage to examine corruption to its very core. Then  what will be left for the servile journalists? They will  continue their work and, if another Zhulali appears, they will  continue to do what they have always done. They will continue to  fanatically defend the superior who keeps them in their job.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAACP INVESTIGATING SUSPENSION OF ATHLETES;  </P> <P> PURDUE PUNISHES BLACK FOOTBALL PLAYERS AFTER FIGHT WITH WHITES, WHO WERE NOT  DISCIPLINED  </P> <P> An NAACP chapter says it is looking into the suspension of six black football  players at Purdue University in connection with a March 18 brawl with members  of the school's wrestling team.  </P> <P> The six football players were punished, but the three wrestlers, who are white,  were not disciplined.  </P> <P> "Our concern is that the six football players were treated unfairly," said Carl  Briscoe, the chairman of the Political Action Committee of the Lafayette  chapter of the NAACP.  </P> <P> "Only six football players were identified and disciplined."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 4 Ineligible to Play  </P> <P> Four of the players -- guards Scott Conover and Larry Taylor, defensive back  Tony Brown and tight end Kelly Turner -- were suspended for the fall semester,  making them ineligible for the 1989 season. All are appealing their suspensions  and hope to learn their fate before practice begins Aug. 14.  </P> <P> Defensive backs Steve Jackson and Jarrett Scales were suspended for the summer  semester and are eligible this season.  </P> <P> The brawl occurred at a party in an on-campus house where three Purdue  wrestlers and three non-athletes lived. An argument between a football player  and a wrestler escalated into a fight in a nearby parking lot, Briscoe said.  </P> <P> The football players left but returned to retrieve a jacket. When they  re-entered the house, officials said, the altercation again erupted.  </P> <P> Briscoe said the wrestlers struck the football players with bottles, punched  them in the face and taunted them with racial slurs. But a witness said that  the football players returned to the party with sticks and that one of them  broke the jaw of the brother of one of the wrestlers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Police File No Charges  </P> <P> Local police filed no formal charges. The incident led to on-campus hearings by  the dean of students' office in April.  </P> <P> "Each individual student complained of racial, derogatory and ethnic statements  of personal character," Briscoe said.  </P> <P> "We're not suggesting that the football players are innocent but were treated  unfairly. It takes two to fight."  </P> <P> Purdue's vice president for university relations, Joe Bennett, said race was  not an issue in the disciplining of the football players.  </P></p>

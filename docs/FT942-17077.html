			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Assassination claim as African presidents die The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed yesterday when their aircraft crashed while landing at Kigali, the Rwandan capital. The aircraft was hit by rocket fire in a double assassination, according to Rwandan diplomats. Rwandan President Major-General Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundi President Cyprien Ntaryamira were flying back from a regional meeting in Dar Es Salaam on ways to end conflict between Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups in both countries. Their deaths are a blow to peace moves. In Burundi more than 100,000 people are believed to have died since the killing last October of the country's first democratically elected president. Mr Ntaryamira, from the majority Hutu tribe, was recently nominated by a cabinet of both Hutus and Tutsis, although he had been unable to halt sporadic clashes. More than 400,000 Burundi refugees remain in squalid camps in neighbouring countries. Although the cause of the air crash was not officially confirmed, diplomats believe Gen Habyarimana had amassed enough political enemies during his 20 years in power in Rwanda to give credence to assassination claims. Gen Habyarimana, a Hutu, signed a ceasefire with the rebel Rwandese Patriotic Front in 1992 but there have been delays in implementing peace. In spite of the presence of 2,500 UN peacekeepers, there has been rising tension in the army and population over the country's rapid slide into bankruptcy. Diplomats believe it is unlikely the RPF is involved in an assassination as it was close to negotiating a share in power.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Irish bank staff suspended Over 600 bank staff in Ireland have been suspended from duty since Thursday, as Allied Irish Bank retaliated against employees who have stopped processing bank charges. Last Monday, the Irish Bank Officers' Association instructed its 13,000 members to stop processing charges to customers, as part of a stepped-up campaign of industrial action in support of a 6.5 per cent pay demand, writes Tim Coone in Dublin.</p>

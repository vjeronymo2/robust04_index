			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ATLANTA URGED TO SEEK OLYMPICS  </P> <P> The president of the International Olympic Committee encouraged Atlanta  officials today to continue fighting to host the 1996 Summer Games.  </P> <P> Juan Antonio Samaranch was making his first visit to the city since it became  the U.S. nominee for the 1996 Olympics. His schedule included a tour of the  city's sports facilities as well as meetings with government and business  leaders.  </P> <P> "What can I say -- you will be one of the six candidates," he told a joint  session of the Georgia Legislature. "But I think with public and private  support, the beautiful Atlanta can be very, very strong."  </P> <P> Samaranch was accompanied by Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and Bob Helmick,  president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. After a lunch with former Olympians  from Georgia, he was to cut the ribbon to officially open the Atlanta  Organizing Committee's office.  </P> <P> Samaranch told the Legislature that he is often asked what a city must have to  put together a winning package for the Olympics.  </P> <P> His answer, he said, is always "the right people . . . and I hope and I think  you have the right people now working and fighting to get the games for  Atlanta."  </P></p>

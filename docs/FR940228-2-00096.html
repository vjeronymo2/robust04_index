			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. To induce key employees to remain in the employ of applicant and its subsidiaries and to increase the incentive and personal interest of such employees in the welfare of applicant and its subsidiaries, applicant's Board of Directors on August 25, 1993, approved the 1993 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the ``Plan''). Applicant's shareholders subsequently approved the Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Plan, which is substantially similar to the previous plans, provides for the grant of options to purchase a maximum of 100,000 shares of applicant's common stock. Applicant has agreed not to issue more than 85,672 shares under the Plan, so that the total number of shares that may be issued under all of applicant's incentive stock option plans will not exceed 7.5% of applicant's currently issued and outstanding shares without a subsequent SEC order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Only key employees of applicant and its subsidiaries will be eligible to receive options. The Plan provides that if an option granted under the Plan expires or is terminated unexercised, the shares of common stock covered by that option will again be available for the grant of new options under the Plan. In addition, the Plan provides that not more than 29,985 shares may be issued to one participant through the exercise of options granted under the Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicant currently has five key employees (its three executive officers, its controller, and its general counsel), who serve in identical capacities with the Subsidiary. Applicant anticipates that options to purchase shares of common stock under the Plan will be granted to applicant's three executive officers when and if the requested order is received. The number and specific terms of the options to be granted to such persons have not yet been determined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Applicant's executive officers not only have the responsibility for making applicant's investments, but also for making all executive and operational decisions. As the executive officers of applicant, their performance directly affects applicant's performance and the value of applicant's common stock. To a lesser extent, the performance of applicant's controller and its general counsel, who participate in operational decisions, but do not make executive decisions, also directly affects the value of applicant's common stock. The performance of applicant's other employees does not directly affect applicant's performance. It therefore would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Plan to grant such employees stock options, since no matter how competently they performed their duties, their performance probably would not affect the value of applicant's common stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of applicant's Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee consists of five directors of applicant, a majority of whose members are not ``interested persons'' of applicant, as defined in section 2(a)(19). Members of the Compensation Committee may not receive options under the Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. All of the options to be granted pursuant to the Plan will be incentive stock options within the meaning of section 422 (formerly section 422A) of the Code. As incentive stock options, the following restrictions apply: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The Plan must state the aggregate number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of options and the class of employees eligible to receive options; the Plan also must be approved by applicant's shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) All options must be granted within ten years of the date the Plan was adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Options may not be exercised more than ten years after the date on which they are granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The exercise price of the options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. In accordance with this provision, options will be granted at the last quoted sale price of the underlying stock on the date of grant or, if there is no sale on such date, the options will be granted at the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Options may not be transferable by an optionee (otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution), and may be exercised during the lifetime of the optionee only by the optionee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Options may not be granted to persons owning more than 10% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of applicant's common stock at the time the options are granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

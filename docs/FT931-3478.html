			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: No clear-cut favourite - The three options for reforming the law on abuse of market power by dominant companies The UK government is shortly expected to announce its preferred option for reforming the law on companies abusing their power in the marketplace to stifle competition. In a green paper published last November, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, canvassed three options. These are: to retain the existing case-by-case approach under the 1973 Fair Trading Act and 1980 Competition Act for dealing with anti-competitive practices. Under this option, the Office of Fair Trading would be given stronger investigatory powers and businesses would be made liable for damages and possible civil penalties for continuing abuse; to introduce a general prohibition on abuse of market power based on Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome, backed by tough investigatory powers for the OFT and fines on companies of up to 10 per cent of worldwide turnover; to introduce a general prohibition, give tough investigatory powers to the OFT and authorise stiff financial penalties, but retain the investigation provisions of the Fair Trading Act, which allow for industry-wide monopoly inquires. Initial reading of the green paper suggested that the government favoured the third option. This in itself was a big shift from its position just two years ago. Speaking about competition policy in July 1990, Mr John Redwood, then corporate affairs minister, said: 'Existing UK competition law has plenty of powers to enforce open and fair markets. There are already several statutes giving extensive investigatory powers to the authorities. The government has decided not to introduce a prohibition-based policy on abuse of dominant position but to concentrate on effective use of existing powers.' The change in attitude since 1990 reflects growing pressure for comprehensive reform. The government remains committed to reform of restrictive practices legislation, and is aware of the contradiction of changing the law on anti-competitive agreements while leaving the law on abuse of market power unchanged. Since 1990, subsidiarity - allowing decision-making to be carried out at the lowest appropriate level - has emerged as a leading issue within the EC. Brussels has made it clear that in future it will deal only with the most significant competition infringements or cases which are likely to advance the law, leaving the rest to the national courts. There is also genuine concern that the present UK system is not working. It is weak on deterrents, and the 1980 Competition Act has provided slow and ineffective procedures for tackling abuse. In light of such pressures, those businesses hoping that the consultation exercise will result in a decision not to change the law on monopoly power are likely to be disappointed. The key question, however, is whether the responses to the green paper have persuaded the government to shift ground since November, away from a position close to option 3 - calling for a general prohibition - to one based on option 1 - retaining the case-by-case approach. Mr Heseltine's problem is that no clear consensus on the best option has emerged. The Confederation of British Industry, after extensive consultation with its own members, is broadly against any reform, but if the government is determined to press ahead, then it would favour some variation based on option 1. Businesses used to competing with a dominant player in the market, such as Mercury Communications, are generally behind option 3. The Consumers' Association also supports it. 'Restraints on competition almost always act against the consumer, by encouraging inefficiency, by limiting choice and by enhancing the power of vested interests,' says Mr Stephen Locke, CA's director of policy. 'What is needed, and already exists at Community level, are clear prohibitions, substantial penalties for breaching them and full rights for third-party redress, enforced by an agency with strong powers of investigation.' The views of competition lawyers appear to vary with the position of their corporate clients. But when they divorce their views from their clients' interests, most appear to favour options 2 or 3. The government, too, finds itself in a quandary in that a prohibition on abuse of a dominant position would have a huge impact on the regulated utilities, such as telecommunications, gas and electricity. It retains a golden share in most of them and might understandably be reluctant to adopt a regime which could have a big effect on the way they currently do business. On the other hand, the government is aware that there can be no justification for a prohibition not applying to the regulated utilities. The view of the CBI will undoubtedly carry weight. The employers' organisation says a prohibition is too inflexible and 'an inappropriate tool for ensuring that markets are competitive'. Even dominant companies must be in a position from which they can react to competitive pressures, it says. The CBI wants to retain a system which enables cases to be dealt with on an ad hoc basis rather than attempting to devise rules which make generalised distinctions between competitive and anti-competitive practices and ban the latter. It is unacceptable, the CBI adds, 'that business could become liable for fines for behaviour which at the time it was undertaken was believed to be legal'. The CBI also believes a system based on prohibition would impose very high costs on business in the form of compliance and these costs would not be offset by any benefit resulting from the change - a view which is partially supported by many competition lawyers. This looks like a 'big industry' response to the issues raised by the green paper. But the CBI insists that it represents the views of its members across the board. The CBI's smaller-companies council is particularly concerned that small and medium-sized enterprises would bear a disproportionately high percentage of the costs imposed by a prohibition system. The views of companies such as Mercury (which has competed against BT, the dominant player in telecommunications, for the past 11 years) cannot be ignored, however. In contrast to the CBI's 'if-it-ain't-bust-don't-fix-it' message, Mercury believes that if the present system is proven to be inadequate then tinkering with it should not be an option. It believes that, for the regulated industries, industry-specific rules are not effective enough to deter anti-competitive behaviour. Instead, it argues, a radical solution is needed. It favours the introduction of a prohibition system making anti-competitive conduct per se unlawful, backed by a choice of effective remedies including the right to bring private legal actions. Bringing private legal actions would be extremely difficult, however. It would take a long time to gather the necessary evidence, and the English courts have no experience in judging such complex economic issues. But Mercury says the intention is not to overload the courts with lengthy cases. Rather, it wants a system under which the 'deterrent effect will be sufficiently strong to replace the existing incentive to abuse market power until told to stop'. Mr Heseltine faces some tough choices. The underlying pressure to beef-up the law on abuse of market power and to bring the UK into line with its European partners remains. But the government will also be wary of imposing a heavy new burden of costs on UK industry as it begins to emerge from recession.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: IBM will not subscribe to Groupe Bull rights issue International Business Machines of the US will not subscribe to next year's FFr8.5bn (Dollars 1.44bn) recapitalisation programme for Groupe Bull, the loss-making, state-owned, French computer group. The US computer group, which acquired 5.6 per cent of Bull's shares in early 1992, cited 'other financial priorities' for its decision. IBM itself is struggling to cut costs to improve its weak financial performance. But IBM said it remained committed to its alliance with Groupe Bull and that the two would continue to work on joint projects. IBM said it would continue to collaborate with Groupe Bull on Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor technology. Bull said other existing industrial agreements, such as the manufacture of circuit boards by Bull for its US partner would also continue. Bull's other main shareholders, the French state, France Telecom, and NEC, the Japanese electronics group, have agreed to provide their share of the refinancing package.</p>

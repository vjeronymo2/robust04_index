			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, January 22 (XINHUA) -- Iranian Deputy  Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi [name as received] here today  denied any competition between Iran and Turkey over Central Asia.    "No, there is no reason for us to compete with Turkey or  other states," Mahmoud Vaezi said in an exclusive interview with  XINHUA correspondents.    "There is a lot of room for cooperation, for work and  activities" in the Central Asia, he said. "If turkey or any  other countries want to enter the Central Asian region, they can  and we welcome all the countries to enter the region for  cooperation."    The world media have constantly reported that both the  Islamic countries of Iran and Turkey want to occupy the vacuum  in the Central Asian countries after the disintegration of the  former Soviet Union.    Asked about the worry about Iran's Islamic export to the  Central Asian countries, Vaezi termed the worry as unnecessary  since Iran does not want to interfere in the internal affairs of  any other countries.    "This is our policy. It does not matter whether it is a  Central Asian country or an European country," he said, adding,  "actually it is not the Central Asian countries that worry about  the Islamic revolution."    "It is the Western correspondents who wrote such things  everyday because they do not want good relations between Iran  and those countries", Vaezi said. It is just a propaganda in  order to separate Iran from those countries, he noted.    Referring to Iran's cooperation with the Central Asian  countries, he said that Iran has started its cooperation with  the Central Asian countries in many fields, such as  telecommunications, air, road and shipping transportation,  trade, industry and so on.    Four months ago when Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani  visited five Central Asian countries, 64 documents were signed  between Iran and those countries, most of which cover the fields  of economic cooperation, he said.    The Central Asian countries have good resources but they  need  help in many fields, he said. The cooperation with those  countries benefit both sides, he stressed.    Some Iranian officials said earlier that Iran could promote  its non-oil export and reduce its reliance on oil revenue by  reviving the ancient Silk Road and expanding cooperation with  the Central Asian countries.</p>

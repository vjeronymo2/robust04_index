			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): The view from Bournemouth  -Former Midland Bank chief Sir Brian Pearse talks to Richard Gourlay about lending to small companies Earlier this month Sir Brian Pearse spent an uncomfortable few hours in Bournemouth, southern England. Speaking to an invited audience of 250 businessmen, Sir Brian was shocked to hear that antagonism towards the banks was quite so pronounced. 'I thought things were getting better but I am beginning to wonder,' says the man who retired as chief executive of Midland Bank, the UK high street bank, in March. 'The strength of anti-bank feeling was quite strong. The relationship is still disappointingly adversarial.' This continuing tension between banks and their customers is something Sir Brian believes has to be addressed if Britain's unemployment problem is to be tackled. Smaller businesses, which will be creating the jobs in future, cannot do without the banks. And the banks, which he says have probably only broken even servicing smaller companies over the last 10 years, have to find a way to make this business profitable. Sir Brian, who is sometimes seen as a traditionalist, believes this cause will be best served by better implementation of old-fashioned banking principles - getting closer to customers, understanding their businesses, plans and management. But he says there is also a place for banks to look at other sources of income - such as taking equity stakes or equity options in customers' businesses as part of a normal banking relationship. Sir Brian's desire 'to do something about unemployment' was one reason he has just accepted the post of chairman of the Housing Corporation. The largest government quango, the corporation supervises the non-profit-making housing associations which own and manage 700,000 rented homes. But he has long believed that smaller companies should play a central role in creating jobs. He became particularly alarmed by the way relationships were developing between the banks, smaller businesses and the government at the end of 1992. It was a time when banks were being accused of benefiting most from base rate cuts. 'The prime minister even said in a Guildhall speech that he just hoped an interest rate cut would get passed on to the customers,' Sir Brian says. Until last week's Bournemouth meeting, Sir Brian thought things had been improving. The government, he says, had largely delivered what it promised, improving the loan guarantee scheme, replacing the Business Expansion Scheme and taking some action on late payment of debts. From the other side of the fence, banks were encouraging businesses to recognise they were too dependent on overdrafts and should look at longer term forms of finance. He accepts that the banks have made mistakes. They should, for example, never have moved decision makers to big banking centres from the field, where they could maintain strong links with their customers. Midland is now reversing this and has put 208 senior head office bankers back into the field after retraining because, as Sir Brian says, 'some have lost the ability to lend'. But Sir Brian believes the people who run smaller businesses are partly to blame for poor relationships with the banks. There is, for example, a 'startling lack of training' among businessmen and women. He compares the ease with which people can set up in business in Britain with the German experience, where overall training levels are monitored and approved by local chambers of commerce. 'Far too many people have gone into business who should not have gone into business,' he says. Too many businesses are under-capitalised, he says. And too many businessmen are unrealistic about what they should pay the banks for overdrafts, a form of finance which is often effectively risk capital. Too many businessmen 'expect equity on debt prices and quite cheap debt prices', he says. 'Customers don't think: 'how much of my own money can I get into my own business', but, 'how much can I borrow', a startling difference with Germany.' Sir Brian is not overly-enthusiastic about banks taking equity stakes in their customers' businesses, but believes there is a case for taking options and 'phantom options' - instruments that allow the bank a share of any up-side in the business in addition to their regular loan margin. 'Options and phantom shares allow you to lend slightly more generously,' he says. They also mean bankers would have to become more involved in the way the businesses were running.</p>

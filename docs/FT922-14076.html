			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / SE will start service to aid small stocks THE STOCK Exchange is to introduce a special service to try to improve dealing in 120 small stocks which are difficult to trade or illiquid in the Official List and Unlisted Securities Market. The exchange is starting a company bulletin-board service from April 27 which will run on Topic, its electronic information system. Information about the companies will be provided, including details of the last 10 trades, the name of the company's corporate broker and current indicative and firm market orders. It will provide a more formal role for corporate brokers, who will be responsible for providing information and easing trading in the stocks. In the same way as an accredited dealer, corporate brokers will use best endeavours to match and execute business. Members receiving buy or sell instructions will first have to take account of any outstanding orders displayed on the service if the same or a better price is available. The changes follow criticism from investors and professionals about poor liquidity in smaller stocks, and concern that information on potential buyers and sellers is difficult to find. Although liquidity of some tightly held shares will not be improved, the exchange hopes the new service will make dealing in smaller companies more efficient.</p>

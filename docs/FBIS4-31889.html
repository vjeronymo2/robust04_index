			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 14 June (MTI) -- Hungarian Prime Minister  Peter Boross sent a telegram to Austrian Chancellor Franz  Vranitzky expressing his good wishes on the occasion that the  vast majority of the Austrian people opted to join the European  Union.    Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky on Monday [13 June]  congratulated by letter Austrian counterpart Alois Mock, on the  referendum result. The letter, sent to MTI on Tuesday [14  June], says, "The outcome of the referendum is a clear signal to  the whole of Europe. Both Austria and the Union stand to benefit  from Austria's membership, which will also promote European  unification. To Hungary, it is particularly important that  neighboring Austria will be in the European Union."    Jeszenszy believes Hungary will be able to count on  Austria's  support in the EU. Hungary, which has applied to join, is  confident that both countries will jointly help build a single  Europe.</p>

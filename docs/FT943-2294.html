			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Ready for take-off: The share issue by Germany's Lufthansa The crane, emblem of Germany's flag-carrying Lufthansa airline, was passed over by the nature protection league as 'Bird of the Year, 1994'. Instead, it chose the threatened white stork, harbinger of luck, health and prosperity. Investment analysts, on the other hand, are virtually unanimous this year in hailing Lufthansa as a success story. They pay tribute to its rapid restoration to viability in the three years since Mr Jurgen Weber was installed as chairman. Today the airline will set the seal on this change in its fortunes when subscriptions open for a rights issue and government share sale to raise an urgently-needed DM1.7bn to restore the group's eroded capital base. Lufthansa's return to favour is a recent phenomenon. Scepticism still abounded as recently as 12 months ago, even though the government had just negotiated renewal of the restrictive post-war US-German air traffic agreement. This opened up swathes of previously inaccessible air space to be exploited by a new co-operative venture between Lufthansa and United Airlines. But with no sign of any substantial easing in competition on transatlantic routes, and the lack of binding ties such as cross-shareholdings between the two lines, the deals were welcomed only coolly. The mood changed in May when the last hurdle to privatisation was dismantled by an agreement disentangling Lufthansa's pensions from the civil service scheme. The deal, in which the DM4bn cost of bolstering the airline's pension fund was split between government and airline, opened the way for the current rights issue. The issue was launched in Frankfurt last week at a ceremonial preview, to the accompaniment of management forecasts that annual profits would improve by up to DM700m within three years. By virtue of Bonn's decision not to exercise its rights and to sell some of its stock, the issue will dilute its majority stake to around 35 per cent. More disposals will follow, although Bonn has yet to make clear how far it is prepared to reduce its stake. In fact Lufthansa has been run as a de facto private enterprise since Mr Weber took over as chairman in September 1991. In that time he has done much to cut costs and inject flexibility into the airline. Like other top German companies, Lufthansa entered the 1990s laden down with an over-sized fleet and workforce, and hobbled by a gridlocked bureaucracy which stretched from the boardroom to the check-in desk. Misplaced optimism over the prospects offered by the purported completion of the single European market on January 1 1992 had tempted the board into an unprecedented spending spree. In the three years to the end of 1991, it added 120 aircraft to its fleet, spending some DM8bn on the way, and building net debt up to DM6bn. As was to emerge shortly after Mr Weber took over in September of that year, the airline had made its first net loss - of DM426m - in 20 years. As Mr Weber was to admit for the first time publicly last week, Lufthansa's existence was threatened. As a first step, he announced a 10 per cent cut in the workforce for 1992 and 1993. Since the programme started biting in mid-1992, the payroll has been slimmed by 17 per cent, unit costs have been cut 25 per cent, and productivity has soared 31 per cent. Even though average Lufthansa salaries were last year still more than 20 per cent higher than those at arch-rival, British Airways, analysts have been impressed by the scale and speed of the turnround, and compare recent developments with the 37 per cent rise in payroll costs between 1989 and 1992 when productivity increased by a mere 7 per cent. Reviewing the new management's performance so far, observers have concluded that restructuring and the concurrent building up of Lufthansa's inherent strengths in freight and Far East traffic leave it well placed to benefit from the revival in the industry's fortunes. The group's cargo business, reinforced by a 25 per cent stake in DHL, for example, has been an early beneficiary of the international economic recovery. Cargo haulage is estimated to have risen around 20 per cent so far this year, when measured in cargo tonne kilometres (CTKs), and yields have risen an estimated 4 per cent. Lufthansa's newly introduced twice-weekly service to Shanghai, supplementing its Beijing flights, and its stake in the Beijing-based aircraft maintenance joint venture, Amerco, give it a strong position in one of the fastest growing markets in the world. Even the north Atlantic routes, where the group's business has shrunk from 22 per cent of total revenue from route operations in 1989 to 15 per cent in 1993, were already showing improvement last year when the passenger load factor rose from 72 per cent to more than 76 per cent. In its home base, Europe, which still accounts for 50 per cent of operational turnover (19 per cent in Germany) low cost-base operations such as Lufthansa Express and the regional Cityline are winning it market share. Passenger load factor was 58 per cent last year, compared with around 51 per cent in 1992. At the same time, the economic recovery is helping bolster bookings of premium-priced seats. Although no regional breakdown is available, Lufthansa's first- and business-class bookings in the six months to June rose to 40.2 per cent of the total compared with 38.7 per cent in 1993. While passengers may be prepared to spend more on their comfort in transit, the story within Lufthansa has been one of continued economies. But the greatest luxury to be sacrificed was the illusion that the group could sit tight in its high-cost German base and do everything as in the past - by itself. Deal after deal has been struck to widen and deepen Lufthansa's reach in the international market. Holdings have been built in Austria's Lauda Air and Luxembourg's Luxair. Co-operative links were forged with Varig of Brazil. A 25 per cent holding in Sky Chef of the US fattened the catering division. Collaboration in a freight hub at Sharjah in the Gulf has been followed by negotiations for a similar distribution base in Indonesia, further to extend the group's reach in the fast growing far eastern market. Now, together with information and systems, Lufthansa's maintenance and cargo operations are to be spun off as free-standing businesses. Functioning as profit centres in their own right, along with the Condor tourism line and catering, they will provide services at market-competitive prices both to the parent and outside customers. In a global air traffic market forecast to grow by an average 4-5 per cent a year for the foreseeable future, Lufthansa has a chance to test its entrepreneurial wings.  ------------------------------------------- Lufthansa: flying into the private sector  ------------------------------------------- Revenue from route operations (DM billion)  -------------------------------------------                     1989         1993 Europe               3.8          5.3 North America        2.5          2.4 Asia Pacific         2.3          3.0 Germany              1.4          2.9 Others               1.5          2.0  ------------------------------------------- Total            DM 11.5bn    DM 15.6bn  -------------------------------------------</p>

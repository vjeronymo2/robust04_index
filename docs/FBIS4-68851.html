			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Conference statements by First Deputy Minister of Railways </F> O.A. Moshenko, reported by N. Davydov: "Wages at the Right Time"]    [Text] The continuing recession in transport services  and the inoperative payment mechanism are not giving railroad  workers any hope for a peaceful life. Despite the fact that  continuous service is being provided for freight and passengers,  the sector's economic situation is very disturbing. As First  Deputy Minister O.A. Moshenko emphasized in opening a recent  selector conference, roughly one-third of the wages for March  still had not been financed by 12 May, although it is already  time to pay the wages for April.    We have written repeatedly about the reasons for this. The  problem of problems is the shortage of "ready" money in the  railroads' income accounts because of their clients' insolvency.  It has already become the rule that at best, half of the funds  earned are in money, and the remainder are in reciprocal  credits, the output of debtor enterprises, and so forth. And in  order to pay all the wages for March and half of April, let us  say, by the end of May, it is necessary to have no less than 924  billion rubles [R], or 57 percent of all receipts from  transportation services, in the accounts.    But if it is taken into account that the railroads received  less than 42 percent of their planned earnings in cash in April,  it becomes clear how difficult it will be to resolve the  problem. Without painstaking work every day to reduce the debt  owed to the railroads, to reduce expenses and increase incomes,  to bring maintenance personnel into conformity with the volume  of transportation, and to bring down the costs from loads that  are not safeguarded and fines for delays in freight deliveries,  and so forth, it will be difficult to count on positive results.    But after all, we have to finance not only the wage fund for  the railroads and the plants, but manage the funds deducted for  social needs (social insurance, the pension fund, medical  insurance, and other items--39 percent altogether) and taxes for  the state budget.    The situation is aggravated because a number of railroads  have permitted an unjustified wage increase, so to speak, over  the amount granted by the Wage Agreement. The increasing  expenses for these purposes have been made a catalyst to a  certain extent for delaying the periods for settlement with  labor collectives. The wage fund was exceeded by more than R14  billion in the first quarter (in relation to December 1993) on  the October and Sverdlovsk railroads. The overexpenditure was  half of this but still quite substantial on the West Siberian  and Far Eastern railroads. As we see, the rates exceed the ones  planned.    The MPS [Ministry of Railways] and the trade union central  committee have been forced to make adjustments, since the faster  indexing of wages is making the task of eliminating the payments  debt even more difficult. Especially as the right to warning  indexation was stipulated by the Wage Agreement only for the  first quarter, but managers of the Gorkiy, Kemerovo, Sverdlovsk,  and certain other railroads raised wages by 12 to 17 percent in  April. Although the predicted increase in consumer prices (in  conformity with which indexing should be conducted in the second  quarter) was no more than 10 percent and actually was less than  9 percent.    All this has had a negative effect on attempts to completely  eliminate the indebtedness for wages, and only the Moscow and  Kaliningrad railroads are paying them on time at present. This  is a serious problem for nearly all the other railroads. Which  has been confirmed by statements made by the mainlines'  managers, in fact. Nevertheless, the railroads have been  supporting the strategic line proposed by the ministry--to bring  the schedule for wage payments back to normal by Railroad  Workers' Day.    In short, the essence of the strategy is as follows. The  wages for March should be paid in full before 20 May, the April  wages should be paid by 15 June, the wages for May should be  paid by 5 July, and the wages for June should be paid by 30  July. So with June's wages, we begin a normal routine for  payment. That is, over a period of 2 and a half months, we have  to collect R3.3 trillion in money from clients; this will be  48.8 percent of the earnings planned for this period. The task  is very difficult, but as discussion has shown, it can be  accomplished.    It was stressed in particular that the sum designated is  adequate under the condition that not 1 ruble will go toward  other needs. Realistically this cannot be achieved, and for this  reason, the task set is to obtain no less than 60 percent of the  earnings in money. In addition, to more fully utilize other  sources to obtain money.    First of all, to sell the products received in payment for  debts more expeditiously. This can yield about R100 billion  every month.    Secondly, through other proceeds (local incomes, fines,  various services, and so forth), the monthly increment may  amount to no less than R80 billion.    And finally, the ministry has urged a more active effort to  recover debts from so-called other clients. In the system as a  whole, they now owe R1.77 trillion. This is a difficult task,  but transport cannot continue to operate in debt. As O.A.  Moshenko emphasized, the credits, debts, and  earnings--everything should be accounted for specifically now.  Each railroad manager should have a detailed plan on the table  and daily supervision is essential to carry it out.    Participants in the conference came to the conclusion that  in  the system as a whole, the amount of "ready" money in the  railroads' income accounts must be increased by 6 percent in  order to finance wages in conformity with the schedule adopted.  But this is an average. The Sakhalin, Transbaykal, and  Baykal-Amur railroads must have 65 to 75 percent more of such  earnings. Collectives of the West Siberian, Krasnoyarsk, East  Siberian, Far Eastern, and Kuybyshev railroads will also have to  make a serious effort to work this out.    We cannot fail to mention that the situation in the plants  is  even worse than in transport service itself. Of course, the sums  needed here are less, but it is no easier for workers at the  enterprises. But in the figure cited above--R3.3 trillion--funds  have also been provided to pay the wages of workers at the  ministry's plants. Serious claims have been made against the  managers of loading railroads who sometimes "forget" about their  financial obligations with respect to the transit railroads. And  there is a special question--recovery of debts from the railroad  administrations of the CIS countries, which are already over  R400 billion.    Summing up the discussion, the first deputy minister called  upon the railroad managers to show that they are more demanding  toward their clients and not to bypass nontraditional incomes  which are "beckoning" directly to railroad workers. But the main  objective is to look for and find uncommon means of increasing  incomes and reducing expenses.</p>

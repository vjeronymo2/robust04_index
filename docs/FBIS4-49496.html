			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li  Lanqing said here today that a complete legal system for the  protection of intellectual property rights in China has provided  a legal safeguard for the country's development of licensing  trade.    Li made the remark when meeting with representatives to a  conference of the Licensing Executives Society (LES)  International, which was opened here Friday [6 May] with  businessmen, jurists and scholars from some 30 countries and  representatives from international organizations in attendance.    Li said that China will make greater efforts to transfer  technology abroad while introducing more technologies from  foreign countries.    China's legal system for the protection of intellectual  property has been improved, Li said, and the country's  new-amendment to the Patent Law and the Trademark Law have  strengthened the protection of patent and trademark rights.    The vice-premier said that China's participation in the Bern  Convention and the World Copyright Convention has basically made  its copyright protection meet the requirements of international  practice.    The country's protection of trade secrets has been  stipulated  in the Anti-Unfair Competition Law enacted last December, he  added.    Li congratulated the opening of the conference on behalf of  the Chinese Government and appreciated LES's contribution to the  dissemination of licensing knowledge in China, the exchange of  licensing information and enhancement of the working skills of  licensing executives.    Li said that as China is accelerating its pace of  establishment of a socialist market economy and maintaining a  sustained and healthy economic development, the country has seen  a speedy development of technology transfer.    Statistics show that China has signed a total of 7,000  contracts of technology import and export with a contractual  value totalling 48 billion U.S. dollars.    Li said that China is to import more advanced and useful  technology from foreign countries to update the present  enterprises at home.    Meanwhile, the country will spare no effort in exporting  technology abroad, the vice-premier said.    Oliver Axster, president of LES International, was present  at  the meeting in Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the State Council  and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

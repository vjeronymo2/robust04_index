			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Unit trust sales hit a record NET SALES of unit trusts in April reached their highest level since the stock market crash of October 1987, the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds reported yesterday. Gross sales in April were Pounds 1,592.9m while repurchases from investors were Pounds 637.8m. The net sales figure was thus Pounds 955.1m. Funds under management were pushed to a record of Pounds 71.77bn. Interest rate falls since the UK left the exchange rate mechanism have undoubtedly helped the industry, as returns on equity products now closely match those available from building societies. Figures published last week showed that building societies also had a good month in April.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Unravelling computer spaghetti - A company which straightens out old programs CHANGING the calculations and conditions for insurance policies and the like may seem a minor matter to decision makers. But for the people who must incorporate the changes in the tangled spaghetti of company computer programmes, they can be a headache. However, a small company has been established to meet this need at the Mountjoy Research Centre in Durham. The Centre for Software Maintenance believes it is the only company of its kind in the world. Its managing director, David Walton, says big financial Organisations went into information technology early, buying mainframe computers in the 1960s and writing large volumes of software for them. As time passes, this software must be changed, possibly to do things for which it was not designed. These changes are called maintenance. The maintenance man has to understand the software, among the most complex structures ever built, to amend it without breaking it. He should then write notes to explain what he has done, but he may be wanted for another maintenance job. After many undocumented changes, the software can become incomprehensible and impossible to change. An investment of thousands of man-hours has reached the end of its useful life. Even without such a disaster, the maintenance work becomes very expensive. In the UK alone, says Walton, Pounds 2bn a year is spent on this. Four Durham University staff, with Keith Bennett, professor of computer science, as chairman, set up CSM in 1988 to do research into this computing problem, but it soon discovered it could save companies money quite simply by using existing techniques. 'This is a hype-driven industry,' says Walton. 'It tells people: This new thing will solve your problem. But a lot of issues are about management rather than technology.' Apparently small errors in programming can have devastating effects. One US airline's program to optimise passenger loading contained a 'greater than' instead of a 'less than' sign. As a result the airline's aeroplanes carried fewer passengers than its competitors'. Errors are especially critical when safety depends on good design and accurate programming, as in the London ambulance computer system. Walton says that a good programmer will spot only 30 per cent of his own errors, which means his work needs to be checked by someone else. 'It is hard to believe that people are not doing that.' To guard against errors, computer staff commonly spend a lot of time on testing, which is expensive and hard to do exhaustively. It is better to analyse what is going wrong and stop it happening again. CSM has a staff of 12. Its four shareholders at the university are active as consultants and Professor Bennett plays a leading part in strategy. A third of its work is consultancy, and running training seminars for software specialists. Two-thirds is creating computer tools for simplifying software, currently for a large computer systems manufacturer and a government organisation. These tools use mathematical research done at Oxford and Durham to show how simplified versions of software can do the same job as the old spaghetti. CSM is also adapting these tools to other purposes. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration requires companies to demonstrate that the software governing the amount of drug in a capsule meets specification. CSM will analyse the software to demonstrate what it is doing. In the year to March, CSM had a turnover of Pounds 400,000. 'We have grown quite rapidly, 45 per cent a year,' says Walton. CSM has had two SMART awards from the government for its development work. It has never had any bank borrowing. Walton says it is no good for a small business in the UK to be in hock to the banks. 'The only way to survive is to be very conservative.' Profit - 8 per cent last year - is put back in the business since 'what counts is long-term ability to do the job well.' Walton first went to CSM as a marketing consultant and became managing director last year. Before that he ran his own company making test equipment for computer software, worked in computer-aided engineering and spent some time as a full-time pastor at a church in Washington new town in the north east.

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Legislation pledge on computer evidence - Poll Tax LEGISLATION to end the uncertainty about the use of computer evidence in poll tax cases was promised yesterday by the government as an amendment to the Council Tax Bill. The move was immediately condemned by Labour as too slow, while some local authority associations warned of difficulties for councils over enforcing liability orders before the new law takes effect, probably early in March. Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, said the amendment would put beyond doubt councils' ability to present computer evidence in magistrates court applications for liability orders to cover enforcement of the poll tax, the business rate and the council tax. The Council Tax Bill is currently receiving detailed debate in the Lords. The government could not say yesterday when the amendment would be brought forward, but it will have to be during the next few weeks. The proposed change will not apply to the use of computer evidence in other cases. Ministers are still considering the more general question of hearsay evidence, but the decision to act on poll tax cases alone prompted speculation of continuing differences between the Department of the Environment and the Home Office. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said the government should have taken stronger action and made the change retrospective. He warned that the delay in clarifying the law would mean higher bills next year, because councils would be unable to enforce the poll tax until the change became law. The Environment Department said, however, that there was no case for compensating councils because even where they decided to suspend proceedings until after the change in the law, they would suffer only the loss of interest on their cashflow. The announcement came against a backdrop of heightened political wrangling about poll tax bills due to be sent out in March. Mr Gould, accusing ministers of being 'in a panic' about the bills, said he would not be surprised at some minor change to the poll tax in the Budget in order to delay distribution of bills until after the general election. Mr Heseltine promised last week that there would be no tax. Ministers have acknowledged that poll tax bills were likely to overshoot government predictions by up to Pounds 15, but reject Labour claims that the target poll tax figure of Pounds 257 - if councils spent according to government assessments of what they needed - would in practice end up closer to Pounds 300.</p>

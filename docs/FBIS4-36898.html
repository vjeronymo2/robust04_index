			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 Jun (MENA)--Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali  Akbar Velayati has said that his various meetings with Egyptian  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa dealt, in total frankness, with the  views of Iran and Egypt on many current issues and with ways to  build confidence between the two countries.    In a statement to AL-AHRAM, which the paper will publish  tomorrow, Wednesday, Velayati denied that his country has  assisted any terrorist group in Egypt or Algeria. He also  denied that Iran is holding Egyptian prisoners since the  Iraq-Iran war. All Egyptian prisoners were handed over to  Egypt, he said.    Velayati invited the foreign minister of the United Arab  Emirates [UAE] to visit Tehran to continue the peaceful dialogue  on the future of the three UAE islands. This dialogue stopped  about a year ago.    Velayati said: If there is a solution to this problem, then  it must be found through peaceful dialogue. But if one side  tries to get others involved in the situation or  internationalize the issue, then this side will lose more.    The Iranian foreign minister expressed his belief that the  security of the Gulf region starts with economic, political, and  security cooperation, but he admitted that the essence of this  idea has not been discussed.    Velayati said that Iran's spending on armaments, considering  the population, is less than that of any country in the region.  He said Iran spends only 4 percent of its budget on arms.</p>

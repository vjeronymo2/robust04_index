			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani in </F> Tehran on 22 April -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. [passage omitted]. We are coming through days, which  are the turning points of history. Once upon a time there was an  international community in the world. Then World War I started.  After World War II the major powers, which had faced the scourge  of war, set up the United Nations and the Security Council.  They told the world that the objective was to respect borders  and to stop one [country] violating another. How far have the  United Nations and the Security Council come today? What has  happened? What are human societies witnessing today?    The Security Council, which used to say it wanted to  maintain  world security, and the United Nations, which used to say it  wished to safeguard the rights of all mankind, have become  supporters of arrogant powers and a witness and observer in the  arena, where the innocent and defenseless people are rolled into  dust and blood. This is their fate today. It is lying that it  cannot do much. This is a lie and all members of mankind should  understand that it is lying. It is even withdrawing its forces  from Bosnia and such zones as Gorazde. It says it cannot do  anything. It is pleading that it is incapable. Whereas when it  faced the Iraq-Kuwait problem, it promptly condemned [Iraq] and  called on everyone to go to war. It asked for troops and money.  On the other hand we saw when a gang of criminal Serbs attacked  this city, it took the Security Council three months to condemn  the attack. The United Nations issued a feeble resolution on  the issue. And now whatever they say is nothing but slogans.  The only side telling the truth under this blue sky is Iran --  the Islamic Republic of Iran.    This fact is being proven across the world. We -- that is  the Iranian nation -- realized after the revolution that many  things are false, including the United Nations and the Security  Council. But there were many who believed that those are true  and correct. But what occurred in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in  Palestine and -- these days -- in the oppressed town of Gorazde,  was the coup de grace delivered to the hope of all the hopeful  people. It delivered the coup de grace to all those who hoped  -- though we were not among them. They realized that the United  Nations is a lie.    What sort of accounting is that? To gather Muslims in a  mosque and then set fire to the mosque! To rip open the stomach  of pregnant women just because they are carrying a Muslim child!  To make a bet on whether the fetus is a girl or a boy and then  laugh their heads off over the bet! What atrocities they  perpetrate!    The Russian president, Mr. Yeltsin, tells the Serbs to be  careful so that world sentiments are not moved against them!  Now, what do they do themselves? What assistance they give!  What green light does the East and West give them!    I say in all truth and earnestness, with what is going on  now  -- the crimes that are being committed -- the nations watch. We  do not watch. The beloved leader of the revolution, may God  grant him victory, with his precise political stances -- beside  his enthusiasm for science and religious jurisprudence, his  piety and truly befitting aspects -- has announced that the  armed forces must be prepared. The Islamic Republic of Iran has  not denied [the Bosnian Muslims] anything and will not deny them  anything. But those who perpetrate crimes and those who watch  those crimes will all be punished. One can see that coming.  [passage omitted]    We are living under conditions where a great many crimes are  being committed against humanity. And that is the way the  United Nations acts!    Muslims must think about forming an organization, a united  nations, a united nations that protects weak countries. Not  just Muslims -- all countries should free themselves of those  who do as they please using their power of veto with America in  their forefront. They commit so many crimes in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Gorazde, Palestine on the other hand, and  also in other parts. [passage omitted]</p>

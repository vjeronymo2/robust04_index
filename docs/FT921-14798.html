			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Mideast talks leave the corridor THE Middle East peace process took a decisive step forwards yesterday when Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian negotiators resolved a procedural deadlock that had until then blocked progress. Delegates reached a compromise on a 'twin-track' negotiations, settling a dispute over whether Israel should meet with separate Jordanian and Palestinian delegations or with a single joint delegation. At last month's first round of bilateral talks, delegation heads wrangled over this procedural point on a sofa in a State Department corridor, refusing even to enter the rooms set aside for them. Yesterday, however, a preliminary round of haggling led to a procedural compromise: Israel will discuss Palestinian issues with a sub-committee composed of nine Palestinians and two Jordanians, and Jordanian issues with another sub-committee composed of nine Jordanians and two Palestinians. 'Corridor diplomacy is ended,' said Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation. The arrangement is expected to allow discussions to begin on substantive issues, including the question of autonomy or self-government for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 'Well, they resolved something this morning because - and I use their term, not ours - they are off the couch,' added Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman. Israel also held separate bilateral talks with Syria yesterday, while a meeting with Lebanon was put off until today because the chief Lebanese delegate had influenza. The talks are likely to be short, however, because Israeli negotiators, who arrived in Washington last week, have warned that they plan to leave tomorrow night. The Arab delegations delayed their arrival in protest at Israel's decision to expel 12 Palestinians from the occupied territories, and only agreed to come after last week's strongly worded condemnation by the United Nations Security Council of the Israeli decision. Nevertheless, Washington observers point out that the peace process is at least still under way. None of the parties has moved to break off talks, and several countries have, in fact, begun to show signs of flexibility in their negotiating positions.</p>

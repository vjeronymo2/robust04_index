			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Economics Notebook: Criminal flexibility Mr Tony Blair, the Labour party leader, has pleased voters and academics alike by promising to be tough on crime, and on its labour market causes. His two-sided approach was well captured by the reference to an 'unemployed youngster' stealing a radio in last week's speech at the party conference. But experience in the US shows that the link between unemployment and crime should be handled with care. That there is a relationship between the two certainly fits with most people's basic intuitions. Time being the Devil's Hand Maiden, it 'stands to reason' that young people with nothing to do are more likely to commit crimes than those who spend their days at work. Some of the same bar-stool wisdom accounts for the abiding popularity of the 'lock 'em up' rhetoric more likely to feature at this week's Conservative party conference. Other things equal, it seems obvious that crime would fall, if only criminally inclined individuals were given less opportunity to commit crimes. The only difference is whether you think 24-hour supervision is the answer, or merely nine-to-five. Other things are not equal, of course. Most people recognise that a complex web of personal and cultural factors will determine whether a given individual is one of the small minority who would consider turning to crime. But these do not lend themselves to clear policy prescriptions. More prison sentences, or more jobs, tends to emerge as the basic choice. A report published last week by Leicester University's Centre for the Study of Public Order comes out firmly in favour of a focus on employment. The author, Professor John Bunyon, admits that the relationship between unemployment and crime is complex. Nevertheless, he believes it is 'undeniable' that the increase in long term youth unemployment is a principal cause of rising crime in the UK. As long as ministers refuse to accept this, he says, law and order policy will be condemned to 'just dealing with the symptoms of crime', not its underlying causes. The trouble is that, by focusing on employment alone, policymakers might make just the same mistake. A recent paper* on crime trends in the US, by Professor Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, finds that while labour market developments have played an important role in the country's crime problems, unemployment is only one piece of the puzzle. As in the UK, sending many more people to prison does not seem to have reduced crime. The US prison population soared during the 1980s. Since young men account for the majority of offenders, the effect on that chunk of the population has been staggering. For men aged between 18 and 34, some 11 per cent of the workforce was in prison or on parole in 1993. For black men in the same age group, the proportion is one third. As the author points out, one would expect this to have had some effect on the crime rate, if only by removing from society large numbers of proven criminals. And yet, as the chart shows, the trend-rise in recorded crimes, at best, stabilised over the period. 'The bottom line is that the propensity of the non-institutional population to commit crimes must have risen sharply in the 1980s.' Labour market trends can explain much of the increase. In essence, the returns to legal employment fell, relative to the returns to crime, for many young US males, just as the long term costs of getting caught - and landing in jail - grew considerably higher. Part of the decline in labour market opportunities for young men shows up in high unemployment. Like their counterparts in the UK, young people in the US suffer more unemployment than the rest of the population. Roughly 15 per cent of teenagers are out of work, compared with about 6 per cent of adults. Does this mean that rising crime can be traced to a shortage of jobs? Reviewing the evidence, Prof Freeman concludes that there is a positive relation between joblessness and crime. But, unlike the UK, there has not been a long term rise in US unemployment large enough to explain the exponential rise in crime. By and large, the job market problem which has helped raise crime in the US is not so much a lack of jobs, but a lack of good jobs. Young people in the US may be frequently jobless, but only a small part of youth unemployment is long term. Young people are eligible for very little state unemployment support, and tend to move in and out of different jobs over the course of a year. This kind of employment flexibility has long been a feature of the US job market. What has changed dramatically is the wages young workers are offered. Recent US Census Data shows that one half of 18 to 24 year-olds working full-time earned less than the official poverty line in 1992. About half of young offenders tend to have been employed at the time they were arrested. Crime can provide a supplement to low income for the employed and unemployed alike. In the long run, of course, crime rarely pays, especially now that the chances of being sent to prison are so much higher. Prof Freeman finds that a spell in prison has a large effect on offenders' future employment prospects. But as long as working pays so little, crime has considerable short-term attractions for young unskilled men, even if they have a job. In short, being tough on crime, and tough on unemployment, has not been enough. *Crime and the Job Market, (unpublished).</p>

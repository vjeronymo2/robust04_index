			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Trinity's scheme of arrangement is approved CREDITORS and policyholders of Trinity Insurance have overwhelmingly agreed a 'scheme of arrangement', averting the need for a fully fledged liquidation of the general insurer which collapsed last year with gross liabilities of Pounds 208m. The size of the vote in favour of the scheme was welcomed by Price Waterhouse, the company's provisional liquidators. PW said the level of support 'indicates the willingness of the insurance market to accept creative means of dealing with the future of insurance companies.' The scheme allows the directors to remain in charge of the company during its winding down under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner. 'The great majority of insurance companies that go under are liquidated. This is bad news for policyholders,' said Mr Paul Evans of PW. 'We believe this is a positive move forward.' Mr Evans said Price Waterhouse is hoping to be able to pay creditors between 60p and 70p in the pound. A liquidation would have delayed any pay-out for many years. In all, 1,142 of the company's creditors and policyholders -  who are owed Pounds 128.8m by Trinity -  voted in favour of the scheme. Among them were Trinity's biggest creditors -  the Inland Revenue, Barclays Bank and Market Building, the insurance consortium which owns the London Underwriting Centre. Only 13 creditors -  who are together owed Pounds 10.8m -  voted against. The scheme will not become effective until court approval has been obtained within the next four weeks. Trinity has 15,000 policyholders and creditors. The Trinity scheme is the first of several major schemes being prepared for London market companies. Price Waterhouse is provisional liquidator in three other cases -  Bryanston, Andrew Weir and Monument.</p>

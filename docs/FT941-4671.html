			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Arts: An efficient Swiss pianist - Recital A year ago, the young Swiss pianist Andreas Haefliger made his Wigmore Hall debut to great acclaim. When he etched a treble line, one remembered that his father Ernst has been a Bach tenor of fine, selflessly impassioned finesse; but Haefliger fils has genial virtues of his own - above all, a toughly refined lust for what his chosen instrument can be made to do, to express. On Tuesday his second Wigmore appearance confirmed all that, but without striking any new sparks. It was less exciting than his first time round. His best came at opposite ends of the evening. First, in Beethoven's A-flat Sonata op. 26 he pursued long, lyrical sense high and low, whilst doing full honour to the big contrasts between movements. That was a performance of lovely, controlled warmth. At the end Haefliger flung several Rakhmaninov preludes and etudes-tableaux at us with terrific energy and flair. That last splash made up for some faceless playing in mid-programme. Last year, this pianist expounded Schumann's Davidsbundlertanze with a rare, judicious boldness, turning boudoir subtleties into more vital stuff. This time the same composer's Kreisleriana fared less well. Though Haefliger delivered its almost incessant etude-figurations in great sweeps, a heart more candidly on the sleeve would have been welcome. Too much of the sequence sounded of a smooth, efficient muchness. As a whole Kreisleriana is super-charged, intricate and harried; we need warmer idylls when Schumann can suspend his virtuoso machinery in favour of lean, poignant effusions. It may be that Haefliger's cool-ish Kreisleriana, and his un-visionary Sixth Sonata of Skryabin - expert and tremulously decadent though it was - lost out simply through imperfect rapport with the instrument, or with the Wigmore acoustic. One felt him loyally suppressing his own piano-personality, when we would have liked to hear it plain. At least his Rakhmaninov group was extrovert and exhilarating, with rapid-fire chord-showers. Just before it, every one of Sofia Gubaidulina's 9 Pieces from 'Musical Toys' enjoyed an original half-jokey resonance of its own. A cartoon-picturesque episode here, a laconic moral there, a touch of grace somewhere else: genuinely creative, appealing fun, and not trivial at all.</p>

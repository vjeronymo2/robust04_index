			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Leading Article: New realism in Germany GERMANY has stepped back from the abyss. In a little over 24 hours following Monday's wage settlement, the spectre of damaging strikes in the engineering industry and renewed unrest in the public sector disappeared. The prospect of a year or more of industrial stability and falling inflation in the western Lander are good. But the threat of crisis has not been eradicated; the struggle over how to spread the burden of unification has only been prolonged. The sudden outbreak of peace in the engineering industry demonstrates how premature were the plethora of obituaries for Germany's consensus-seeking decision-making. The extent of the compromise, and the speed with which the building workers have fallen into line, demonstrates how much both unions and employers wanted to avoid a confrontation. Little wonder the west German political establishment has breathed a deep sigh of relief. The wage agreements, while high by German standards, do not spell danger for industrial competitiveness; and the fact that the unions appear to have accepted the need for wage restraint should be enough to remove the threat of higher interest rates. Yet the canker remains. Prospects in the west may have improved, but the plight of the eastern Lander continues to deteriorate. Output per head has collapsed, capital investment is depressingly low, and the official unemployment rate has risen to 15 per cent. Adding all the hidden unemployed on various schemes increases the proportion of the potential workforce without jobs to 40 per cent. What economic activity is occurring in the east remains largely dependent on transfers from west German taxpayers. Net transfers are expected to rise to 81 per cent of east German output this year. Wage conversion The root of Germany's economic and social problems is the pace at which wages in the east and west are converging. Parity in the engineering industry is timetabled for 1996. But east German productivity is only a third of west German levels. No wonder eastern industry is unprofitable and the pace of industrial privatisation so slow. These wage convergence deals should be rethought; but the ease with which skilled workers can migrate mean that wages will still converge faster than productivity. Unemployment in the east will stay high for some time. One way or another the west German government will have to subside eastern living standards. Inefficient industries Yet the government is currently impeding rather than speeding the transformation. The most inefficient industries should be allowed to close; but instead they receive the lion's share of subsidies from the Treuhand. Rather than paying people to do nothing, government should instead subsidise employment in the private sector. The subsidies should be temporary; but by closing the gap between east German wages and productivity, they would encourage the growth of private industry, rather than public idleness. Yet whether the transfers subsidise employment or unemployment, the flow will continue for years. The cost of these transfers was inevitably going to place great strains on the social consensus in the west. But these strains have been magnified by the unwillingness of the government to demand of the west German people the necessary sacrifices. The pain is not over. Despite last year's tax increases, public borrowing continues to grow at an unsustainable pace. The government's commitment not to increase taxes further already looks unrealistic. If it plans to stick to its pledge to bring borrowing under control, then government will have to cut spending. The candidates for cuts are numerous - subsidies in agriculture coal and steel, and local government spending. Government at federal and land level must specify where the axe will fall. The bravery of Mr Kohl's embrace of unification in 1990 has been matched by the poverty of his subsequent policy actions. But the events of the last few months should have taught him and his colleagues the error of their ways. It is time for Mr Kohl to come clean. If the coalition government fails to act decisively, there will be more confrontation and, quite possibly, a new government in 1994.</p>

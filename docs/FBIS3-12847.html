He added: The  Middle East is a sensitive region of the world, and maintaining  peace and tranquillity in this region can help in achieving  global peace and stability.    The first vice president referred to the developments in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Palestine--which have emotionally harmed  the Muslims--as bitter developments. He asked China, as a  country enjoying special status on the UN Security Council, to  play a more active role in confrontation with hegemonic policies  of the major powers.    Habibi described Iran-China ties in all fields of mutual  interest as extensive and added: In addition to good  socioeconomic relations, ground could be paved for further  expansion of mutual ties through cultural cooperation, exchange  of professors and students between the two countries, provision  of more suitable means for exchanging the experience gained by  craftsmen, and the exchange of scientific, technical, and  industrial experience between Chinese and Iranian experts.    At the meeting, the deputy prime minister and foreign  minister of China termed the panorama of future cooperation  between Iran and China as promising and added: Mutual  understanding based on mutual respect, noninterference in each  other's internal affairs, and support for global and regional  peace and stability, form some of the joint principles of the  two countries' foreign policy.    He described the existing possibilities for the expansion of  bilateral cooperation as extensive and desirable and said: Apart  from the two countries' political, economic, and commercial  relations, expansion of international cooperation is also  noteworthy.    The latest regional and international developments, as well  as the trend of cooperation between Tehran and Beijing were  reviewed during a meeting today between Qian Qichen, Chinese  deputy prime minister and foreign minister, and Mr. Velayati,  our country's foreign minister.    At the meeting, the Chinese deputy prime minister considered  the similar and close views of Tehran and Beijing on many  international and regional issues to be an effective factor in  bringing the two countries closer in their friendly relations.  He said: Tehran-Beijing relations are good, positive, and based  on mutual respect and peaceful coexistence.    The Chinese foreign minister praised Iran's independent  policy and Tehran's efforts in establishing peace and stability  in the region--especially in Afghanistan.    During the course of the meeting, Mr. Velayati also  described  Tehran-Beijing relations as deep-rooted and exemplary.    He said: China is capable of playing an important role in  the implementation of the underground project in Tehran.    Iran's foreign minister considered human rights to be a  weapon that is used by superpowers to interfere in the internal  affairs of other states. He said: The Islamic Republic of Iran  seriously and forthrightly opposes the exertion of any influence  that is aimed at dominating other states.</p>

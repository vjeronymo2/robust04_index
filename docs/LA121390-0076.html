			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> LINCOLN COMES CLOSE, BUT NO. 4 POWAY PULLS OUT 84-76 VICTORY  </P> <P> No one really gave Lincoln's boys' basketball team a chance when it played at  No. 4 Poway High School on Thursday night. The No. 5 Hornets had blown a  three-point lead with 36 seconds left in its last game against Mt. Miguel. It  had lost by 27 points to No. 10 Mt. Carmel earlier this season.  </P> <P> People were beginning to wonder about the five-time City Central League  champions.  </P> <P> Poway Coach Doug Wealch was wondering.  </P> <P> But after escaping with an 84-76 victory, Wealch wasn't wondering. He was a  believer. "Lincoln played out of their heads," he said.  </P> <P> Lincoln Coach Ron Loneski also believes. "I started four juniors and one  senior, Loneski said. "These kids are going to get better.  </P> <P> "If they play like they did tonight. . . ."  </P> <P> Loneski didn't finish the statement, but he didn't have to. He was more or less  in awe of his team's effort.  </P> <P> Junior Barry Randle scored 23 points and Lincoln went on a 14-4 run to pull to  within 75-74 with 2:46 left in the game before the Titans got some key rebounds  from Kirk Hipple and a clutch three-point basket by Bill Rarity to put the game  out of reach.  </P> <P> "If we want to play," Rarity said, "we can play with the best."  </P> <P> Lincoln, which was playing without starter Don Ballard (out with injuries  sustained in an auto accident), was whistled for 30 fouls and had three players  foul out. Poway was called for 19 fouls.  </P> <P> Poway made 28 of 40 free throws, Lincoln 17 of 28.  </P> <P> Poway (2-0) took a 63-55 lead into the fourth quarter -- the Titans led 42-33  at halftime -- but Lincoln took advantage of its quickness to once again wipe  out a Titan lead. At 75-74, Poway's Kyle Milling's basket increased the lead to  three, then Rarity, who finished with 20 points, banked a three-point basket  off the glass with 1:06 left to make it 80-76.  </P> <P> Milling added four more free throws in the final 33 seconds as Hipple, a  junior, kept pulling down rebounds for the Titans. Hipple finished with 10  rebounds despite playing about 16 minutes.  </P> <P> Lincoln outrebounded Poway 46-28.  </P> <P> Mark Wuchner had 19 points for Poway and Milling quietly added 14. He had eight  in the fourth quarter, six from the free-throw line.  </P> <P> Frank Garrett and Hipple scored nine apiece.  </P> <P> Randle was the only Hornet in double figures. John Akridge and Archie Robinson  scored nine apiece. Randle, Akridge and Dennis Washington fouled out. MARTIN  HENDERSON  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Machine tool sales rise Sales of machine tools in the UK in the three months to July rose 12.1 per cent from the previous quarter, according to Central Statistical Office figures, Andrew Baxter writes. Most of this year's steady rise in sales has been due to exports, but yesterday's figures show a strengthening home market. Total sales rose 14.1 per cent with exports up 17.5 per cent according to figures, which are seasonally adjusted and based on constant 1990 prices. On an unadjusted basis, at current prices, total sales rose 22.5 per cent from last year to a monthly average of Pounds 82.4m and UK sales rose 29.2 per cent. Total orders are down 23.2 per cent on last year at about Pounds 214m, but new orders are rising.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONALISTIC DREAMS OF UNITY IN MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> Prof. Augustus Richard Norton aptly summarizes the nationalist modern Arab  dreams of Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Hafez Assad of Syria, Ayatollah Khomeini  of Iran and Saddam Hussein of Iraq ("Grand Delusions," Opinion, Sept. 16).  Their dreams are quite similar and characterized by each striving to be the  leader of the new aggressive empire, and each has the destruction of Israel as  the central goal.  </P> <P> Since Hussein considers both East and West Palestine as an integral part of  "the Arab nation" centered in Baghdad, and since the Palestinians, including  the PLO, support his plans, it follows that the latest demand for a new  Palestinian state is specious. Such a demand is designed as a temporary state,  to weaken Israel sufficiently to make it possible to eliminate it.  </P> <P> One might ask, why should we care if the demand for another Palestinian state  is specious, if peace is promised in return for territory? The speciousness of  the demand for a Palestinian state concerns us because, contrary to promises,  it would not produce peace, but more wars. Weren't the borders of Lebanon,  Kuwait and Iran clearly recognized before being overtaken by Syria, and Iraq  respectively? Now that we clearly know that the demand for another Palestinian  state is a shameful sham, we can devote our time and effort to produce real  peace, by settling the Arab refugees in Arab lands, and motivating the  countries in the Middle East to stay independent on a live-and-let-live basis.  </P> <P> BERNARD I.

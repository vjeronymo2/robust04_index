			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BONN PLEDGES LIMIT ON SIZE OF UNITED GERMAN MILITARY  </P> <P> West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher removed one of the last  political obstacles to German reunification today by pledging to limit the  armed forces of a united Germany.  </P> <P> In a speech to the 23-nation Conventional Forces in Europe talks, Genscher  promised that his government will keep united German military strength to a  ceiling of 370,000 within three or four years.  </P> <P> The new ceilings, worked out during talks between West German Chancellor Helmut  Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in July, would cut by nearly  half the combined forces of East and West Germany.  </P> <P> "We Germans know that German unification must not be allowed to cause a shift  in the balance of power in Europe and to harm the security interests of any  country in Europe," Genscher told delegates to the CFE talks.  </P> <P> "The government of the Federal Republic of Germany reaffirms that peace alone  will emanate from German soil," he said.  </P> <P> The West German pledge, supported by East Germany, was a response to Soviet  concern about the military potential of Germany, which is set to unite Oct. 3.  </P> <P> Genscher urged the delegates from NATO and Warsaw Pact countries to intensify  efforts to overcome remaining obstacles and conclude a first-stage arms treaty  by early October.  </P></p>

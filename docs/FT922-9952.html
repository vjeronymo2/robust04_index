			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Repap Enterprises turns in loss REPAP Enterprises, a leading producer of coated papers in Canada and the US and kraft pulp in western Canada, reported a first-quarter loss of CDollars 44.6m (USDollars 37.3m) or 86 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 17.5m or 34 cents a year earlier. Both figures were struck after preferred dividends. Revenues were CDollars 278m against CDollars 274m. Shipments of pulp and coated papers were up 17 per cent and 16 per cent respectively in the first quarter, and Repap said firming prices made the outlook more hopeful for the second quarter and second half of 1992. It said an April increase of USDollars 40 a tonne for a bleached kraft pulp will improve cash flow in the second quarter while discounts on coated papers had stabilised.</p>

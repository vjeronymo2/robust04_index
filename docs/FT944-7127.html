			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: The Budget and you - Scheherazade Daneshkhu ponders what the chancellor has in store Life will become more expensive for most people from April because of tax increases already scheduled from the last Budget (see left). Some concessions have been given to the elderly, such as an increase in the married couple's allowance for those aged 65 and over and help with fuel bills - but there is room for more. What can savers and investors expect when Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, stands up on Tuesday? Can they expect a reprieve - or to be hit for more? Clarke has not held out much hope of tax cuts saying these would be premature but, with the next general election only two to three years away, he might try to engineer some kind of 'feel-good' factor. Some of the analysts' predictions are listed on the right. Clarke could decide to help the long-term unemployed and working parents, perhaps by lowering National Insurance contributions for companies giving work to the former, and tax relief on child-care costs for the latter.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TUESDAY'S NEWS The sugar coating  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Self assessment More legislation on tax self-assessment, scheduled for 1996-97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Income tax Lower 20 per cent band likely to be widened from first Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 3,500 or more  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Personal allowances Single person's allowance of Pounds 3,445, frozen for past two years, may be raised with inflation.

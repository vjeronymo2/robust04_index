			<p>BFN     [Text] In Lusaka, Zambia, the negotiators have reached an  agreement on the swearing-in of deputies of the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the National  Assembly. Tomorrow, the negotiating teams from the government  and UNITA will continue the peace talks. They will discuss the  extension of state administration throughout the national  territory. Our correspondent Alves Antonio reports:    Negotiators from the government and UNITA have knocked down  another obstacle. Tomorrow, they will hold discussions on the  extension of the central state administration throughout the  national territory. The representatives from the government and  UNITA concluded early this evening discussions on the  swearing-in of the deputies of Jonas Savimbi's organization in  the National Assembly. The agreement's formulation has not been  revealed and is at the present moment a great secret. All the  same, Angola Radio National will continue its efforts to obtain  more details on the agreement. It is already known, however,  that UNITA deputies presently in parliament will continue in  their posts, while the fate of those who abandoned the country  and consequently the parliament will depend on a decision from  the National Assembly itself.    Meanwhile, the negotiators from the government and UNITA  will  return to the Mulungushi Conference Center tomorrow to begin  discussions on the extension of the central state administration  throughout the national territory.    During the break today, the negotiators from the government  and UNITA attended a reception hosted by the Portuguese Embassy  in Lusaka on the occasion of Portugal's national day. The  representatives from the government and UNITA surprised each and  everyone present when they agreeably socialized as true  gentlemen and brothers. Let us hope it was not just aimed at  deceiving the public.</p>

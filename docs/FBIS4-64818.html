			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara (AA) -- President Suleyman Demirel has said  that public discussions on the extension of the chief of staff's  term in office are not beneficial for the country and added: I  want these discussions to end. I have the last word on the  issue. There is no need to conduct discussions that do not  involve me.    Demirel received a delegation of ANATOLIA Agency [AA]  administrators and representatives from other news agencies,  headed by AA Director General Ekrem Karaismailoglu, at the  Cankaya Mansion today.    Demirel replied to questions on the recent political and  economic developments. In reply to a question on discussions  regarding the extension of the term of office of General Gures,  the chief of the General Staff, Demirel said that the Turkish  Armed Forces should not be dragged into polemics through such  discussions. Demirel continued:    The Armed Forces should not be put in the position of  defending themselves, discussions should not be held on behalf  of the Armed Forces, and a situation that will put the Armed  Forces in such a position should not be created. I want these  discussions, which have been going on for a few days now, to  end. As the head of state, I am responsible for the chief of  staff's appointment.    I have not yet been submitted any proposals because the time  is not ripe. August is the month of appointments, and we have  another four months ahead. There is no need for discussions  four months in advance. Let the time come, and we shall  consider. What shall we consider when the time comes? We shall  consider the country's interests. What shall we consider? We  shall consider the legal aspects. If the legal requirements do  not lend themselves to an extension, these current discussions  will have been futile. If a new law is enacted, it is a  different matter. These discussions, however, are futile. The  issue will be considered at the appropriate time.    Demirel stated that there is no such thing as  irreplaceability in the Armed Forces. Recalling that the  request to extend the terms of the GATA [Gulhane Academy of  Military Medicine] commanders was rejected at the Supreme  Military Council meeting held in March, Demirel added:    The Armed Forces are the apple of our country's eye. The  stronger they are, the better off we are. The strength of the  Armed Forces rests on the fact that they do not depend on the  irreplaceability of individuals. An institution whose officers  have not become irreplaceable, an institution where new  appointments can be made and the newcomers can perform their  duties with efficiency is a strong institution. This was the  reason for the decision made at the council's March meeting. As  to the decision to be made when the time comes in August, it  will be made in line with Turkey's interests.    Demirel stated that the inclination of the Armed Forces is  in  line with the council's decision. Demirel said: Let these  discussions end. I have the last word on the issue. There is  no need to conduct discussions that do not involve me. Let us  close this matter. All issues can be discussed in Turkey. I,  however, am not convinced that futile discussions are beneficial  for the country.</p>

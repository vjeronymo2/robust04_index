			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD OKS KEY BUDGET CUTS  </P> <P> Cuts in a computer literacy program, "combat pay" for inner-city administrators  and staff cars were approved Wednesday by the Los Angeles Board of Education,  which faces at least $44 million in budget reductions in order to pay for  employee raises.  </P> <P> The board voted to reduce by 50% the district's share of a computer literacy  program, which saves $404,000 next year. It also agreed to take away  district-paid cars from 41 administrators, including division heads and  assistant and associate superintendents, which had cost $124,701.  </P> <P> Another reduction will affect administrators in inner-city areas. The board  voted to reduce by 25% the salary differential those administrators receive  because of the location of their schools, commonly called "combat pay." The  savings will amount to $350,000 a year.  </P> <P> "These cuts are extremely painful for the people making them," said board  member Julie Korenstein. "We leave each day feeling cut to the bone  personally."  </P> <P> Most of the $42 million in cuts approved so far have been supported by  Korenstein, Jackie Goldberg, Warren Furutani and board President Roberta  Weintraub, the four board members who voted in favor of a 24%, three-year  salary increase teachers won after a strike in May.  </P> <P> Alan Gershman, Leticia Quezada and Rita Walters have opposed most of the cuts.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has changed its methodology in accordance with the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision. The Department will add to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the merchandise sold in the United States at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. The Department will also adjust the USP tax adjustments and the amount of tax included in FMV. These adjustments will deduct the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment that are the result of expenses that are included in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and are included in the United States merchandise price used to calculate the USP tax adjustment and that are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments to the amount of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign market sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the bases for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the amount of tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the United States merchandise containing more expenses than the price of the foreign market merchandise. The Department's policy to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Zenith Electronics Corp. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made to mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included in FMV.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 760 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustments to the USP tax adjustment and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Daewoo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In calculating FMV, we used home market price, as defined in section 773(a) of the Act. Home market price was based on a packed, delivered price to unrelated purchasers in the home market. In accordance with section 353.45 of the Department's regulations, the Department has excluded sales to related parties because the respondent has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claim that sales to related parties were at arm's-length. The Department made adjustments, where applicable, for inland freight, discounts, rebates, and for differences in packing material, packing labor, and credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also made an adjustment to FMV for imputed consumption taxes in accordance with the aforementioned  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, where similar home market sales were used due to the absence of an identical sale, we made a difference-in-merchandise adjustment. The Department based the difference-in-merchandise adjustment on differences in steel pipe materials cost between U.S. and home market merchandise (see the Department's preliminary analysis memo dated December 29, 1993). When there were no contemporaneous such or similar sales, we based FMV on constructed value. Constructed value data for specific models was provided by Benkan at the request of the Department. Benkan did not provide constructed value information for two models as requested by the Department. For these preliminary results the Department has applied to applicable sales of these two models an antidumping duty margin of 8.05967 percent which is the weighted average margin for sales of SSPFs by Benkan for this review. The Department will request for the final results of this review that Benkan provide constructed value data for these two models.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

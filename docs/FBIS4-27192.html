			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Police Tuesday [31 May]  started raiding a right-wing organization's office and some  other locations in connection with Monday's gunshot fired near  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, police said.    Police are searching the Shinjuku office of the right-wing  group "Shokonjuku" on suspicion of violating the law to control  the possession of firearms and swords.    Hosokawa escaped unhurt when Masakatsu Nozoe, a one-time  Shokonjuku member, fired a gun toward the ceiling close to the  former premier at the Keio Plaza Hotel in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward.    Nozoe, 52, was arrested immediately after the attack.</p>

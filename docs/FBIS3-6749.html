The protesters handed over to the U.S. forces side a letter  of protest addressed to the U.S. Administration, shouting "Away  with the U.S. Forces" and "A permanent stop to the `Team Spirit'  war exercises".    In the letter written in the name of the Pusan and South  Kyongsang Provincial Federation of General Student Councils the  students strongly demanded that the United States stop putting  pressure upon South Korea to liberalize import, including the  rice market opening pressure, and abandon the planned deployment  of Patriot missiles in South Korea and dismantle the U.S.  military bases.    That day the Kim Yong-sam group arrested all the  participants  in the sit-in.    According to a radio report from Seoul, more than one  thousand students under the Eastern Seoul District Federation of  General Student Councils including those of Hanyang and Konkuk  Universities held a rally at Hanyang University on the afternoon  of March 18 and bitterly condemned the Kim Yong-sam group's  criminal act in illegally submitting to the United States a plan  on the implementation of farm produce market opening.    The students branded the criminal act of the Kim Yong-sam  "regime" in presenting beforehand the "final implementation plan  on the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations" to the United  States in mid-February in secrecy as an "obvious act of  pro-American flunkeyist treachery".    They called for an all-people struggle against a  "parliamentary ratification of the bill" on farm produce market  opening.    Then they burnt a stars and stripes and staged a  demonstration, shouting "We oppose the Uruguay Round" and  "Yankee, go home".</p>

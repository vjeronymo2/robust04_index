			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / As sure as eggs is steady, grain goes up: FT reporters investigate who will bear the brunt of the price effects of devaluation in five sectors that affect the retail prices index. Will it be retailers, consumers, UK manufacturers or suppliers abroad? ASK WHO is bearing the impact of devaluation in the food sector and the industry won't give you a clear answer. But while most supermarket chains are stressing, in public at least, their determination to keep prices down, many food manufacturers are making gloomy noises. The evidence so far suggests that prices are being kept down. Between September and January, the government's retail food price index rose 1.34 per cent, slightly more than the 1.1 per cent rise in the RPI. But if leading manufacturers have been taking the impact of higher prices on their margins, they warn that will not do so for much longer. Northern Foods, Marks and Spencer's biggest supplier, plans increases of up to 8 per cent by April to compensate for devaluation, while United Biscuits has announced rises of 5 per cent. As a net importer of food to the tune of Pounds 6.8bn last year, Britain is highly exposed to international price shifts. Sharply higher raw materials costs have forced many manufacturers to revise their budgets. But other factors are at work that could keep down the average supermarket bill. Plentiful production is helping to hold down prices of fresh produce including salads, potatoes and other vegetables. The Meat and Livestock Commission says that the retail price of pork, in surplus throughout Europe, has fallen slightly since September. Manufacturers and retailers are unsure how far they dare pass on higher costs at a time of weak demand. The recession has made many consumers economise by cutting out luxuries and 'trading down' to less expensive products. The steepest cost increases so far have been for commodities such as beef, sugar and cereals which are subject to Common Agricultural Policy support schemes. Since September these products - both home-produced and imported - have been hit by a 22 per cent devaluation of the green pound, the currency used in EC farm trade. The speed at which these increases have shown up on supermarket shelves varies widely, depending on the competitive structure of individual market sectors and the strength of the producers in them. In sugar, Tate &amp; Lyle and British Sugar - which share a UK market monopoly - have had little difficulty pushing through sharp rises. Poultry producers have offset a 13 per cent rise in feed prices from devaluation by raising chicken prices by about 6 per cent. But the price of eggs, in a production glut, has barely budged, while excess capacity and cut-throat competition have so far prevented the big bakers from recouping higher grain costs by raising the retail price of bread. But eventually someone will have to bear the higher costs. Although neither retailers nor suppliers will divulge details of price negotiations, both sides say they are exceptionally tough. Industry sources say dominant suppliers with strong brands are securing trade price increases in line with their higher costs. But retailers sometimes insist they hand back part of the gains in special offers and price promotions. The leading supermarkets have a double incentive to fight to preserve market share - they've invested heavily in new superstores, and are under growing threat from fast-expanding discount chains such as Kwik Save and Aldi. Faced with these pressures, many suppliers are seeking to absorb higher costs through increased efficiency. UK food manufacturers' productivity improved about 5 per cent last year, and several plan further restructuring. They are also benefiting from lower packaging prices, due to weaker demand throughout Europe.</p>

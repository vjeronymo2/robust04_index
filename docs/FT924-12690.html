			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Brussels wants economy top of summit agenda THE worsening European economic situation should be 'at the core' of EC leaders' talks at December's Edinburgh summit, Mr Henning Christophersen, financial affairs commissioner, said yesterday. His comments to journalists, during a meeting of EC finance ministers, reflect growing Commission frustration at governments' apparent failure to tackle the real economic issues. 'Most people are now worried, not only about the situation in the UK, but about the situation in the Community as a whole,' said Mr Christophersen. He added that growth forecasts for the EC, which he will publish in the next few weeks, were 'not very encouraging, to put it mildly'. Finance ministers did not tackle the outcome of last Friday's Birmingham summit in any detail. Instead, they have asked central bank governors and senior central bank and treasury officials sitting as the EC monetary committee (which meets in Berlin this weekend) to look into the reasons for recent turmoil on the money markets. Mr Horst Koehler, state secretary at the German finance ministry, emphasised that the committee meeting had been planned for some time, and that a realignment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism was out of the question. Mr Christophersen said it was up to finance ministers to find some way of stimulating the real economy. 'If they can't, they don't deserve to be finance ministers,' he added. Finance ministers yesterday concentrated on the 'Delors II' plans for the EC budget, in particular the practical application of the 'cohesion fund' for bringing poorer countries' economies into line with the wealthier EC members. At the moment only Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece meet the main criterion for funding: per capita gross national product below 90 per cent of the EC average. Ministers appeared yesterday to exclude adding other countries before 1997, taking some of the heat out of rumours that Britain might shortly become eligible. Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister, said: 'The cohesion fund is reserved for the four countries which had per capita gross national product of less than 90 per cent at the Maastricht and Lisbon (summits)  - that is clear. Their names are well known.' According to some EC diplomats, Britain is pressing for flexibility on which countries are eligible for access to the cohesion fund. 'Any British sounding may be more designed to secure their rebate (worth some Pounds 2bn last year),' said one national official yesterday.</p>

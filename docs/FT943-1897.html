			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Japan sees economy shrink 0.4% The weakness of Japan's economic recovery was underlined yesterday by figures showing a drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter. GDP contracted by 0.4 per cent in the April-to-June period compared with the previous quarter, according to a preliminary estimate by the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA). But the figures have become erratic, producing seven consecutive alternate increases and declines. The more reliable six-month trend shows that the economy grew by 0.4 per cent between the second half of 1993 and the first half of 1994. Even this figure was well below expectation. Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, the vice minister of the agency, said the quarterly setback 'reflected the period's economic conditions, which were broadly sluggish with some bright spots'. The Bank of Japan said the figure would not lead the bank to change its judgment that the economy was still 'headed for recovery'. The data showed the economy retreated on all fronts in the second quarter. Private consumption, regarded as central to recovery, fell by 0.7 per cent. In the first six months of the year it was 1.4 per cent higher than in the previous six months, a figure that still suggests only gentle growth. Capital expenditure fell by 2.5 per cent in the quarter, as companies continued to deal with over-accumulation of capital in the late 1980s. But the largest contribution to the fall in output came from the external account. Exports rose by 1.4 per cent in the quarter, and imports by 3.8 per cent. Net exports fell by an unprecedented 86.5 per cent on the year, suggesting the sharp rise in the yen may have started to reduce the trade surplus in the second quarter. Most economists argued that growth was likely to have resumed in the current quarter, as a result of the boost to consumption from the warm summer and an increase in exports. Mr Dick Beason, chief economist at James Capel Pacific in Tokyo, said: 'The figures are discouraging. But improvements in the third and fourth quarters should help to keep GDP growth for the year at around 0.8 per cent.' Mr Richard Werner, chief economist at Jardine Fleming, warned of another year of disappointing growth. 'The recovery is still very weak and shows only faint signs of improving in the immediate future,' he said.</p>

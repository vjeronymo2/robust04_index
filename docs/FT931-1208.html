			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bankers come to rescue of kiwifruit harvest MONTHS OF concern over the future of the New Zealand kiwifruit industry ended this week when a banking syndicate agreed to finance this year's harvest only three weeks before picking was due to start. The agreement gave a reprieve to the Kiwifruit Marketing Board, which has a monopoly to supply the fruit to all international markets apart from Australia. Its monopolistic position has been under attack by a group called Integrated Kiwifruit Services, which consists of several big companies, linked to overseas fruit groups such as Chiquita Brands. The Kiwifruit Marketing Board, which was formed in 1988, got into serious financial difficulties last year because of the severe downturn in prices in Europe. It was unable to pay orchard owners progress payments, and has debts of about NZDollars 80m (Pounds 28m). IKS made a bid to buy half the New Zealand crop at a time when the board was still negotiating to raise money from the banks to finance packing and give a return to growers. With some growers indicating support for the independent company, the banks, led by the National Bank, a subsidiary of Lloyds Bank, appeared to show caution and the negotiations dragged on. They finally came to an agreement on Wednesday. The financial agreement sees the banks extend their financing of the existing debt for three years. In addition there is an advance of NZDollars 80m to help the board pay packing companies, other costs and allow it to pay growers NZDollars 4 a tray in a series of instalments during the season. This will be subject to market returns after debt repayments. Market returns after that will be split 50:50 between growers and the banks. Mr John Palmer, the chairman of NZKMB, said that in spite of the agreement it was certain that some growers would not survive because of their own high levels of debt. They had told the board that they needed a minimum NZDollars 4.50 a tray. The intervention of the IKS group, whose main spokesman was former Labour finance minister Sir Roger Douglas, caused deep divisions in the industry. Most of the companies involved in the group had handled the kiwifruit export crop before the board was set up at the wish of growers. They unsuccessfully lobbied the minister of agriculture, Mr John Falloon, to end the board's monopoly, and say they are now contemplating legal action to achieve that end. Independent kiwifruit consultants said that although the IKS appeared to be offering more money to growers to win their support, their basic offers were similar, with the board adopting a much more cautious view on likely returns this season. Fruitgrowers' Federation president Mr Paul Heywood, who supports the board, said that its offer to pay growers Dollars 4 a tray was realistic. It meant they could get on with the business of picking and packing this season's crop and was a commercial deal based on reality. However IKS's Mr Murray Davies said the deal was a disaster for growers, whose interests had been sacrificed to serve the interests of bankers. It left them without enough money to prepare for the 1994 crop, he added.</p>

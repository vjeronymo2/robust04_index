			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Tietmeyer warns on EU integration: Bundesbank chief stokes fires of row over 'variable geometry' Union Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, has joined the heated debate over the pace and means of European integration with a warning against the dangers of exclusive clubs at the heart of the process. While arguing strongly for a multi-speed, concentric-circle formation, he said the question had to be addressed of whether this might divide Europe rather than bring it together. 'Indeed, this danger could arise if countries ready to move into a circle closer to the centre were to be refused access,' Mr Tietmeyer wrote in the latest issue of Europa-Archiv, a foreign affairs magazine. 'No circle should regard itself as a closed society.' Mr Tietmeyer limited his list of candidates for circle membership to an unspecified, closely knit group prepared to deepen their bonds quickly, other European Union members, participants in the European Economic Area and associated states from central and eastern Europe. Claiming a single-speed programme would slow progress to that of the lowest common denominator and severely hamper future monetary and political union, he suggested several speeds could reconcile potential conflicts between efforts to widen European union and to deepen it. 'The fear that widening means integration comes to a standstill is based on the idea that each country must take each step at the same time. The slowest will then set the pace,' Mr Tietmeyer said. 'But the logic of this argument will be broken if the multi-speed model is adopted.' Although he avoided the minefield uncovered last week when leading lights of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union named Germany, France and Benelux as the core members of a 'variable geometry' community, his intervention is likely to intensify a row from which Mr Kohl has tried to distance himself. Mr Wolfgang Schauble, second only to Mr Kohl in the CDU hierarchy, and a leading proponent of the party's contentious 'discussion paper' which started the storm, yesterday repeated that if the pace was dictated by the speed of the 'slowest ship in the convoy', union would never come about. A strong core built round France and Germany was necessary, he wrote in the popular Bild newspaper. Mr Tietmeyer's comments coincided with fresh signs of confusion in the German government over the policy document from the Christian Democrats, the dominant partner in the Bonn coalition. Mr Jurgen Chrobog, political director of the German foreign office, told a meeting on Monday of senior EU officials that the paper was not official government policy. His unusually strong statement was made at a regular gathering of political directors in Brussels. It was intended to reinforce efforts by Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, to distance himself from the CDU paper. Meanwhile Spain's prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, who is abroad, is to seek an early meeting in Bonn with Chancellor Kohl, according to Spanish press reports. This reflects both Mr Gonzalez's real fear that a two-tier Europe could be high on a Franco-German agenda when the Maastricht treaty is reviewed in 1996 and his self-appointed role as spokesman for the poorer EU partners. The Spanish premier has consistently argued that a two-track integration would derail the principle of political and economic union as envisaged by Maastricht. In order to deflect precisely the sort of policies put forward by the CDU paper, Mr Gonzalez over the years has championed issues such as European citizenship and cohesion funds for the weaker EU economies. Meanwhile, the issue has forged an unusual degree of unity between members of the Italian government and opposition. Mr Antonio Martino, the foreign minister, and Mr Piero Fassino in charge of foreign policy in the main opposition grouping, the former Communist party of the Democratic Left, agreed that EU membership was in the national interest and where possible a bipartisan approach should be adopted to ensure Italy's position was properly defended. For the first time in public Mr Martino voiced a widely held Italian view that the CDU proposals were announced last week with essentially electoral considerations in mind. But even if this was the case, Mr Martino said the idea of Italy in the second league was wholly unacceptable. In Dublin yesterday, Mr Bertie Ahern, Irish finance minister, said: 'It would be a matter of grave concern if there were to be a tearaway group. Do people want to rewrite the criteria which have been accepted and voted on by the entire European Union? Either you fulfil those criteria of you don't. Ireland does.' The Irish government fought - and lost - a five-month battle against devaluation in 1992 and 1993 precisely to keep Ireland's currency aligned to the hard currencies within the exchange rate mechanism on track for early incorporation into monetary union. In Portugal the governing Social Democrats of Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, appear to have been embarrassed by the CDU, with which they have been trying to forge strong ties. No one from the prime minister's office or the foreign ministry was prepared to comment on the proposals yesterday.</p>

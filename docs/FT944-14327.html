			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / IoD attacks green paper on disability Tax relief for employers would do more to help disabled people than extending their rights, the Institute of Directors says today. In a report it says the high cost of adapting buildings is the main barrier to increased job prospects. If costs were cut, employers would be encouraged to take on disabled staff. The report is in response to the government's disability green paper, published in July, which the IoD claims is 'fundamentally flawed'.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: BTR surges Turnover in international conglomerate BTR rose to 22m, making it the third most active trade of the day, on a combination of switching between the ordinary shares and the warrants, and a broker's recommendation. The shares climbed 19 to 390p, with Salomon Brothers said to have carried out much of the switching during the session. Sentiment was further boosted by a recommendation from Smith New Court. Analysts at Smith said: 'The stock has underperformed, it has become cheaply rated, the company is well run, it is a diverse international, and looks like a good opportunity to us.' The recommendation from Smith followed a similar move from UBS at the end of last week. Suggestions in the market that broker Colin Stewart, a well known bear of the stock, had turned more positive were denied. The fall-out from J. Sainsbury's trading statement at the end of last week settled on the supermarket sector's suppliers and saw both Unigate and the paper and packaging group Bowater suffer. There is a belief that suppliers, particularly those who provide 'own-label' products, will come under pressure from the supermarket chain following its statement that margins were being squeezed by the actions of cut-price retailers. Bowater was further affected by a sell note from agency broker James Capel. The shares fell 15 to 487p, while Unigate slipped 6 1/2 to 386p. Sainsbury lost a further 9 to 384p. Wellcome shares tumbled 13 to 662p as the company confirmed Sunday newspaper reports that sales of its Aids drug Retrovir had fallen by about 25 per cent following reaction to a study into the effectiveness of the drug on some HIV patients. Christian Salvesen, the business and food services group, dropped 62 to 314p, making it the day's biggest retreat, after the company issued a profits warning saying this year's profits would be below last year's Pounds 74.8m. Conglomerate Trafalgar House gained 5 at 109p in strong volume of 13m shares after announcing a 91.5 per cent take-up of its Pounds 355m convertible preference rights issue. The group said the rump of the issue is to be auctioned at a minimum tender price of 100p a share. The strong market trend helped English China Clays recover from an earlier retreat that followed cautious comments from Hoare Govett. The shares closed 3 ahead at 505p. Airports operator BAA was in demand ahead of third-quarter figures due today and the shares put on 31 at 1081p on volume of 1.1m. Oil major BP benefited from encouraging research from two securities houses. Following publication of a review of the sector last week, Lehman Brothers upgraded its recommendation to 'outperform' from 'underperform'. The house argues that investors are taking a more long term view on stock valuation and, reaching out to 1998, BP offers stronger dividend growth than its UK rival Shell Transport. Meanwhile, NatWest Securities published a hefty overview which concluded that BP will produce average annual earnings growth of 24 per cent over the next five years. BP shares rose 11 1/2 to 378 1/2 p, while Shell gained 9 at 734p. BT made good progress as Hoare Govett turned a trading buyer of the stock. The fully-paid shares put on 7 at 474 1/2 p in turnover of 4.5m, with dealers attributing some of the rise to weekend media reports of the company's cable video plans. Eleswhere, Vodafone firmed 3 1/2 to 585 1/2 p ahead of new subscriber figures due today. Stores stocks were a big beneficiary of the new account, with rises being seen across a wide spectrum. Among the majors, Marks and Spencer climbed 7 1/2 to 444p, Kingfisher 11 to 639p, Boots 9 1/2 to 552 1/2 p and GUS 16 to 604p. Dixons slipped 2 to 215p as a weekend press report highlighted continued worries over extended warranties. Regional retailer Upton and Southern edged up to 4 1/2 p on talk of an imminent deal. Positive comments accompanying fourth-quarter figures from Xerox Corporation in the US helped Rank Organisation shares rise 24 to a record 1098p. The two companies' joint venture, Rank Xerox, contributes around half of the UK group's pre-tax profits. The buying pressure seen on Friday in Forte, following meetings in the City, continued and the shares added 4 at 269 1/2 p. Analysts said that Forte was confident of a successful outcome to its bid for the Ciga hotel group in Italy within the next two weeks. The day's biggest volume was recorded in British Steel, which saw 36m shares traded as overseas buying continued in the stock. The shares improved 4 to 143p. Engineering group Vickers eased 6 to 178p after suggestions that BMW may buy its Rolls-Royce Motor Car subsidiary appeared to be dashed by BMW's decision to buy Rover. The Rover deal cheered the motor distributors and Lex Service jumped 20 to 549p, while Lookers moved 19 ahead to 259p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tom Minney] </F>   [Text] Namibians who served with Koevoet [crowbar --  counterinsurgency group] and the South West African Territorial  Force [SWAFT] can return to Namibia from South Africa. At a  recent meeting of Cabinet it was resolved they can come home  "through normal channels".    The same welcome is not extended to any who are not  Namibians  and they "will not be allowed to return" according to a Cabinet  announcement yesterday.    Last month, Namibia's representative in Pretoria Joshua  Hoebeb said he had been approached by representatives of 550  former Koevoet members, who wanted to come home with 1,100  dependents. They were apparently fearful about their future in  the new South Africa and the issue was urgent as they were due  to be evicted from their settlement at a disused mine in  northern Transvaal at the end of last month.    The Cabinet decision could also open the door to some 5,000  former Bushmen soldiers who were taken by the SA Defence Force  to a camp at Schmidsdrift, northwest of Kimberly. These are  reportedly unhappy and keen to return.    Former Koevoet members in other parts of South Africa may  also want to come back. Callers to radio chat shows have asked  where the returnees would settle and how they would support  themselves if their only skills are fighting, including against  civilians. The Cabinet decision makes it clear that only those  who can prove they are Namibians will be able to return.    Yesterday's announcement reads: "All ex-Koevoet/SWAFT  members who are stranded there are advised to contact the  Namibian Embassy in Pretoria for registration before  repatriation."    Many other nationalities including Angolans and Zambians  fought alongside the Namibians and South Africans in the SA-led  armies. Most of them will have been issued with SWA [South-West  Africa] identity documents or SA passports, but some may be  genuine Namibians and find it difficult to produce their birth  certificates and other documentation necessary to prove this.    Cabinet says "it is absolutely vital that all those involved  give correct information to the registration officials."    Most of those now in South Africa travelled there around the  time of independence, or were taken by the former SA Defence  Force. They did not trust promises they would not be victimised  under Namibia's national reconciliation policy.    Only now do they see that overall former soldiers of both  Swapo [South-West African People's Organisation] and its former  enemies are in the Namibia Defence Force and some have been  helped with resettlement and other projects.    Meanwhile they are concerned about their future as aliens  under an African National Congress, especially as Koevoet was  sometimes accused of 'third force' activities in South Africa's  townships in recent years.</p>

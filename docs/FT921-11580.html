			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Maastricht treaty text ready for signature EC governments yesterday received the final version of the Maastricht treaty on European union for signature next week, after vain Dutch and Irish attempts to alter aspects of the controversial social policy protocol agreed by Britain's 11 partners. Negotiated at last month's Maastricht summit, the 'treaty on union' is likely to be signed on February 7 in Maastricht at a meeting of foreign and finance ministers. The past month, spent in cleaning up the text for signature, has produced a treaty whose substance is virtually identical to that agreed by EC leaders on December 11. But it has also revealed some Dutch and Irish nervousness about the social protocol, designed to bypass the UK government's rooted objection to passing more EC labour rules by majority verdict. First, the Dutch tried to write into the 11-country protocol some of the compromises they floated during the Maastricht summit when they were still trying to get Mr John Major, the British prime minister, on board. These changes would have slightly curbed the scope for social policy action by the 11 countries. Second, the Irish sought to rectify a quirk in the protocol's voting weights which will make it harder to assemble a blocking minority among the 11. Dublin privately shared a few of the UK government's reservations about EC social policy. With unanimity required for any amendment, it was enough for Belgium and Italy to object to the Dutch and Irish suggestions. Curiously, Britain's partners all seem ready to put their pens to their social protocol without first settling some of the wider legal questions it gives rise to. But Mr David Williamson, the Commission's secretary general, said this week that any laws passed under the 11-country protocol would be standard EC law, and would have to be accepted by countries joining the EC.</p>

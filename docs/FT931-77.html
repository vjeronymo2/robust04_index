			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Citic Australia to buy Japanese retailer stake CITIC Australia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Beijing's most important investment vehicle, the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, plans to buy 10 per cent of Yaohan International, the Japanese retailer, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. Citic Australia is acquiring the stake from Mr Kazuo Wada, Yaohan's chairman and largest shareholder, who built the company into a large international retail chain. Yaohan owns stores across Asia, America and Europe, and recently opened one in Beijing. Citic Australia is emerging as an aggressive investor internationally. The Chinese parent company was founded in 1979 to promote the country's business links with the outside world. It was headed by Mr Rong Yiren, who was appointed China's vice-president at the weekend.</p>

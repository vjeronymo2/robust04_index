			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Profitability declines worldwide Profitability of coal companies worldwide has declined sharply in the past decade and the industry appears to be entering a period of stagnation or decline, according to a report by Sheffield Energy &amp; Resources Information Services. The return on average coal assets among 39 companies tracked by Seris fell from 10.4 per cent in 1985 to 6.1 per cent in 1992. The authors also note that the 63 companies in their coal export survey registered a small decline in export volumes during 1991-92. The top 10 world coal companies ranked by profit margin include six whose operations are mainly in the western states of the US. RTZ of the UK has recently bought into this highly profitable sector, the report notes. Whereas the rate of return for eight companies whose operations are mainly in the eastern US is consistently higher than the global rate, the opposisite is the case for the 10 companies based mainly in the centre and east of the US. The report notes a restructuring in the world industry, the most extreme example of which has been seen in the UK in the last 18 months with the closure of more than 33 of 50 pits. A similar process has been occuring in Japan, France and Belgium and in the coal and lignite mines of eastern Europe. In the US, restructuring has concentrated mroe on takeover and merger activity.

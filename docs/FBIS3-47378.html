Leetooraj Chandramun, president of the Mauritius Communist  Party, said the Korean people have brought about great changes  with the chuche idea and the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance.    Visiting Korea again some 20 years past, he said he never  imagined that such great changes as he saw today could take  place there. "I was really surprised at the great reality beyond  imagination, at the high-rise buildings standing in a row,  magnificent grand monuments, modern factories and rural  villages," he said.    He stressed it is the unbreakable strength of the Korean  people armed with the chuche idea and their revolutionary spirit  of self- reliance that have enabled them to make such great  achievements under the conditions of national division and in  face of ever-more malevolent moves of the imperialists to  isolate and stifle socialism.    Genaro Ledesma Izquieta, chairman of the People's Front of  Workers, Peasants and Students of Peru, after visiting the  Three- Revolution Exhibition, said the Korean people are making  everything needed by their own efforts on the basis of the  independent national economy.    P.C. Sharma, chairman of the International Study Centre for  the Chuche-Oriented Mass Media in Nepal, had this to say:    The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance is an indomitable  faith of the Korean people hardened through a long-drawnout  struggle.    They manufactured lorries, tractors and machine tools by  highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance in  the difficult postwar period when everything was destroyed.    The West Sea Barrage, the May Day Stadium and other amazing  world's level magnificent grand monumental edifices have been  created by the Korean people themselves.    It can be said that the Korean people's history of creation  and construction is a history of self-reliance.    The chairman of the February Revolutionary Party of Paraguay  said that as they have an unshakable revolutionary spirit of  believing in their own strength and living by their own efforts,  the Korean people are vigorously advancing without the slightest  vacillation in the present complicated international situation.</p>

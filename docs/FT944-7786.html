			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Chinese roads paved with gold: A look at a market that western carmakers are eager to enter, in spite of the risks It was an invitation the world's carmakers could hardly refuse. When China's Ministry for Machinery Building asked for ideas for a 'people's car' to be submitted in conjunction with a small-car exhibition in Beijing, most large international car manufacturers obliged. As a representative of General Motors, which was displaying its Opel/Vauxhall Corsa among other models in Beijing, said: 'When they say jump  -people jump.' China, which last year produced 234,000 cars from its own plants, currently has fewer than 2m cars in use, of which fewer than 5 per cent are privately owned. The ministry's 'Strategic Development Research Team of China's Family Car' forecasts a steep rise to 22m by 2010. It predicts that by the year 2010, China will be producing 3.5m cars a year, two-thirds sold privately. It is this prospect of an ever-widening circle of car owners in the world's most populous country that is proving such a magnet. China's urban population alone is 300m, which compares to continental Europe and exceeds that of the US. 'Who can ignore an opportunity in a market that could be the world's largest in 20 years?' asked Mr Toshiaki Yasuda, Nissan's chief representative in China. Under a new car industry policy unveiled earlier this year, China plans to raise production by 2000 to between 1m and 1.5m, based on output from 'three or four' large conglomerates that will be developed over the next few years. This production would account for 90 per cent of demand from the Chinese market by 2000-2003. The foreign participation being sought by the government will help to rationalise a motor industry that is highly fragmented. 'Consolidation is badly needed, if the sector is to benefit from economies of scale,' according to a recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit. 'The government's blueprint is to accelerate the natural process of rationalisation in the industry over the next few years, in order to create a few large and strong producers.' China has set its sights on mass-producing a 'people's car' designed specifically for the Chinese market. The question for Beijing - no less than for foreign carmakers - is whether existing models that have been tried and tested would fit China's requirements best, or whether a completely new car is required. At last week's motor show for small cars in Beijing, most of the world's leading producers displayed cars from their existing ranges: Ford showed its Fiesta, General Motors the Corsa, Nissan the Micra, Toyota the Tercel and PSA Peugeot Citroen the Citroen ZX, which is already being produced in China. But it was the concept cars, specially designed for the Chinese market, that captured most attention (see below). These included Porsche's C88 prototype, a 1.1 litre five-seater that hogged the limelight, the Mercedes-Benz FCC (Family Car China), and Mitsubishi's X-concept study derived from its Chariot/Space Wagon small multipurpose vehicle. At stake is the right to build a low-cost, fuel-efficient car for the standard Chinese family, that could have sales running into the millions and would provide a solid platform for growth in a market with enormous growth potential. With market growth sluggish in Europe and North America, the world's leading carmakers are fighting to establish a presence in the world's emerging markets. According to Mr Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford, the world's second largest vehicle maker, about 80 per cent of the world's population live outside the traditional automotive markets of west Europe, North America and Japan, but the number of cars and trucks sold in these regions represents only about 8 per cent of the world's total. The motor industry believes that the Asia/Pacific region holds the brightest prospects, with sales in Asia (excluding Japan) expected to triple during the next 15 years. Japanese carmakers already have a stranglehold on most of Asia with as much as 90 per cent of car markets such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. In China, however, the Japanese producers have been held at bay, and it is the European industry that has taken the early lead - its one success story in the region. Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, was a pioneer among western carmakers in entering China, having signed its first joint venture in 1984. It claims that by 2000 it will have a capacity to produce 660,000 cars and 830,000 engines a year - 300,000 cars a year at Shanghai Volkswagen and 360,000 a year at FAW-Volkswagen, its joint venture with First Automobile Works in north-east China. VW claims that it has made 'huge strides' in developing the supplier industry in China. Local content at the Shanghai plant now exceeds 80 per cent, and it estimates that about 40 joint venture contracts and approximately 100 production and knowhow licences have been agreed between foreign - predominantly German - suppliers and local Chinese partners. An additional 30 joint ventures are under negotiation. 'With our commitments in China, we are pursuing a strategic objective of capturing a long-term leading market position in the region,' said Mr Martin Posth, VW director for Asia/Pacific. 'China is envisaged as the main production site with smaller satellite operations elsewhere in Asia.' Ford is setting up a series of components joint ventures in China in the hope that this will open the way for it to begin assembling vehicles in the near future. 'We are eager to establish vehicle assembly projects in China at the earliest opportunity,' said Mr Frank Macher, Ford vice-president and general manager of its automotive components division. Chinese officials responsible for deciding which foreign manufacturer will build the family car expect a decision by 1996, but are not committing themselves as to whether one or more carmakers will be chosen. Mr Zhang Xiaoyu, director of the Department of Automotive Industry in the Ministry of Machinery Building, said that China would be guided in its decisions by which of the companies 'provided the best terms for us'. Mr Zhang said one issue that would influence the Chinese decision would be whether the applicants' proposals complied with automotive policy, including technology transfer and the development of the local components industry. Foreign car producers say that even if a decision is made on the family car proposal by 1996, production would not start before 1998-99 at the earliest. This timetable suggests that China will have difficulty meeting its production target of at least 1m cars by 2000. The prospect of participating in the birth of a Chinese small car has appeared too daunting for some companies in the world motor industry. BMW, for example, considered participation through Rover, the UK carmaker it acquired early this year, but held back. 'We have investigated it but we think one would lose a lot of money,' said Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the BMW management board. 'Whoever does this people's car project will not be successful financially.' Mr Posth of VW acknowledges that two contradictory arguments confront all industrial investors. The first says: 'You will certainly lose at the start, if not in the long run as well. The initial phase will last much longer than you ever thought it would. 'It will take far longer than you ever imagined to learn the rules in China. You will be constantly hindered by your Chinese partner from doing the right thing - they profess to know everything better, even though they had invited you because of your technical superiority and managerial knowhow . . . And where are those billions of consumers?' On the other hand, said Mr Posth, 'by not being in China, you are perhaps missing out on the chance of a lifetime. If your competitors are investing in China and exporting from there, they will be able to beat you wherever they like anywhere in the world. 'It may or may not be the end of the Deng Xiaoping era . . . but then where can you invest without incurring some sort of risk? And don't forget what people said in the 1950s about getting involved in Japan.' The stampede by the world's carmakers into Beijing last week suggests that few are prepared to be absent, however great the risks.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- CHINA'S AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY: SHIFTING UP A GEAR  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         1990   1991   1992  1994*  1996*  1998*  2000*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Growth in  registrations (%)      21.2   98.7   32.8    8.6   19.8   15.9   11.1 Cars in use ('000)     1,150  1,225  1,500  1,850  2,500  3,400  4,450 Growth of cars  in use (%)              8.5    6.5   22.4   10.4   17.6   15.3   12.7 Cars in use per  100 of population      0.10   0.11   0.13   0.15   0.20   0.27   0.34 Production ('000)         38     67    147    315    575    825  1,100  --------------------------------------------------------------------- * Forecasts  --------------------------------------------------------------------- AUTO INDUSTRY FORECASTS ('000)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sales                   1994   1995   1996   1997   1998   1999  2000* Passenger cars           380    480    575    690    800    900  1,000 Commercial vehicles      880    980  1,100  1,200  1,280  1,400  1,500 Total                  1,260  1,460  1,675  1,890  2,080  2,300  2,500  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Production              1994   1995   1996   1997   1998   1999  2000* Passenger cars           315    455    575    705    825    945  1,100 Commercial vehicles      850    950  1,100  1,200  1,275  1,400  1,500 Total                  1,165  1,405  1,675  1,905  2,100  2,345  2,600  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: EIU  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

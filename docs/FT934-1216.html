			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Narrow win likely for Serb Socialists The ruling Socialist party of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic yesterday claimed victory in parliamentary elections although final results are not expected until tomorrow. Their claimed victory is wafer-thin and the last votes could still determine whether Mr Milosevic will keep his grip on power and his ability to sideline the divided opposition. Based on the party's count of 55 per cent of the vote, the Socialists said they would win between 124 and 128 of the 250 seats in parliament, enabling Mr Milosevic to form another Socialist government. 'The Socialist party of Serbia has achieved an overwhelming victory,' claimed Mr Ivica Dacic, the party spokesman. 'We will have either an absolute or relative majority.' But opposition leaders immediately denied these claims, based on their own count of Sunday's ballot. Mr Zoran Djindjic, head of the centrist Democratic party, said: 'It seems impossible for them to get an absolute majority. No party will be able to form a government alone.' According to partial results, the Democrats and the biggest opposition bloc, Depos, headed by Mr Vuk Draskovic, were set to win about one-third of the seats in the Serbian assembly. The opposition has failed to join forces, but political leaders privately indicated that they could now unite. Their scope for manoeuvre has been raised by the relatively strong performance of Mr Vojislav Seselj, an ultra-nationalist MP and former ally of Mr Milosevic, despite a smear campaign waged against him. Mr Milosevic called early elections in October when Mr Seselj threatened to bring down the Socialist government. But the ballot seems to have rehabilitated him as an opposition figure and indicated popular support for his attacks on corruption in official circles. His targets included Mr Milosevic and Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, a Belgrade Mafia boss turned paramilitary commander whose name, like that of Mr Seselj, appears on US lists of suspected war criminals. Voters were not enticed by Arkan's nationalistic campaign. But the low vote for this symbol of Serbian paramilitary violence does not signal a rejection of the idea of Greater Serbia. All candidates, including the democratic opposition, expressed similar views on the national question. The Socialists were attacked for profiting from the economic chaos, induced partly by UN sanctions, after nearly three years of war. But opposition leaders remained silent on the violent partition of Bosnia which led to the imposition of UN sanctions. If Mr Milosevic fails to win an absolute majority his image as the invincible leader of all Serbs would suffer. This would force him to devote his attention to an increasingly unstable Serbia rather than on expanding its borders. The UN General Assembly last night appealed to the Security Council to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia, a step long proposed by the US, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York. The resolution - a recommendation which the Council is free to ignore - was adopted as Bosnia agreed to drop charges that Britain, by supporting the embargo, violated the Genocide Convention.</p>

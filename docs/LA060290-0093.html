			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PLEA ENTERED IN CASE OF ABANDONED BABY  </P> <P> A 22-year-old woman accused of leaving her 10-month-old baby on the side of the  road pleaded innocent Friday to felony charges of child endangerment and  abandonment.  </P> <P> Lori Carlson of Santa Ana faces a maximum sentence of nine years in state  prison if convicted of the crimes.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Thomas J. Hutchins set bail at $25,000, denying a request by  Carlson's lawyer that she be released on her own recognizance.  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Susan Olson said Carlson is distraught over what has  happened and hopes to regain custody of the baby, Brittany, and her 3-year-old  daughter Alicia.  </P> <P> "She was just pushed beyond her limit by not receiving support for the children  from either of the fathers," Olson said.  </P> <P> The children were placed in the custody of Carlson's parents during a Superior  Court hearing earlier on Friday.  </P> <P> According to authorities, Carlson and the baby's father, Wayne M. Jefferds, 30,  of Corona, began arguing at the Oxnard Lodge Motel Tuesday evening over  financial support for Brittany.  </P> <P> Jefferds left, and Carlson put both children in her car and followed him south  on the Pacific Coast Highway, police said.  </P> <P> Carlson then pulled over, set the baby about three feet from the road and sped  away, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela M. Henke-Dobroth said.  </P> <P> A witness driving behind Carlson stopped and picked up the baby.  </P> <P> A preliminary hearing for Carlson was scheduled for June 14.  </P></p>

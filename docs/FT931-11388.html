			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / World Trade News: US tough on public contracts - Washington determined to create 'level playing field' YEARS AFTER 'level playing field' became a cliche in Washington trade circles, the US now has an administration which says it is determined to create one. In the second potentially explosive trade issue tackled by the Clinton administration in as many weeks, hard on the heels of dumping duties provisionally levied on steel exports, the fledgling Clinton team took only 11 days in office to announce sanctions against 'certain discriminatory procurement practices' maintained by the EC. 'We do not want to close our procurement market, but must insist our major trading partners show an equivalent commitment to open and non-discriminatory procurement policies,' Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said. During the election campaign, President Clinton, who has been forced to backtrack on various promises, said he would open markets and enforce US trade laws. He seems intent on keeping to these commitments. Mr Kantor, who was the president's campaign chairman, shares them. Fresh in his mind is the anger of US voters facing uncertain economic conditions and joblessness. 'The days when we could afford to subordinate our economic interests to foreign policy or defence concerns are long past,' Mr Kantor told the Senate finance committee. 'As President Clinton has noted time and again, our national security is directly related to our economic viability here at home. We will not be guided by the assumption that other nations share our commitment to free trade and open markets when the real-world evidence is otherwise.' The government procurement dispute with the EC dates back to 1990 when the Community first announced its utilities directive, planned to come into force in January. Under US trade law the administration must thoroughly review global procurement practices every year. In February 1992 the administration determined that the EC discriminated against the US in its utilities directive. President Bush said he would institute sanctions against the EC to take effect by January 1993, subject to EC implementation of the utilities directive. The Clinton administration was not forced to act immediately. US law gives the president the authority to modify or suspend sanctions if in the national interest. Mrs Carla Hills, former US trade representative, usually took full advantage of the law's flexibility in the hope of reaching settlement. But Mr Kantor apparently decided more talking would not produce agreement. US officials recognise that the directive has many 'aspects' which improve US market access, but consider it unacceptable that restrictions remain. Clinton officials, who overwhelmingly approved the action, believe the US was already late in moving and was even ill-prepared to do so. The US trade representative had no sanctions list prepared nor even an accurate estimate of the costs of the retaliation. The retaliation will only hit products not covered by Gatt's procurement code: telecommunications, airports, waterways and services. Mr Kantor has ordered a study of 'the desirability and feasibility of withdrawing from the Gatt government procurement code,' letting the US broaden sanctions against the EC with the cost as high as Dollars 500m. US foreign procurement curbs fall on some sectors, mostly defence but also mass transit, affecting the EC. US states also have Buy American provisions. The US has been willing to negotiate on these and governors of over half the states agreed to scrap their curbs and join the Gatt code. '(The EC) wanted to have some procedural guarantees applied to private telecommunications companies,' a US official said. 'We might feel more sympathetic if they had come up with examples of discrimination.' Mr Steve Cooney of the National Association of Manufacturers said the sanctions were no 'protectionist break from the past'. The White House was committed to increasing exports; it knew better than to count on the home market alone for job growth.</p>

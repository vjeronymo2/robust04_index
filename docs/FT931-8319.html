			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Kirin Brewery sees profits fall despite sales rise KIRIN BREWERY, Japan's largest food and beverage company, reported a rise in 1992 sales thanks mainly to its premium beer, Ichiban Shibori, but posted a fall in non-consolidated profits. Pre-tax profits fell 4.3 per cent to Y82.7bn (Dollars 689m), despite a 3.8 per cent rise in sales to Y1,366.1bn. Kirin said sales of its core businesses, including beer and pharmaceuticals, showed a firm increase. After-tax profits improved by 2.2 per cent to Y37.5bn. Kirin's balance on financial items fell by Y8.8bn, due to a decline in interest income and a Y900bn loss on its stock holdings. However, a 3.4 per cent rise in beer sales to Y1,328bn and a 84.5 per cent jump in pharmaceutical sales to Y18.6bn contributed to the overall sales rise. Kirin said it would be introducing a new brand called Nippon Blend. Japan's brewers face increasing pressure to produce a number of new brews each year and are now seeing competition from imported brands. This year, Kirin expects pre-tax profits to rise 0.3 per cent to Y83bn on a 3.2 per cent rise in sales to Y1,410bn. The brewer warns that increased losses on financial items would depress profits. Annual capital spending is expected to rise 15.2 per cent to Y98bn.</p>

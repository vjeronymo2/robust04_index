			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Material packs green punch Jiffy Packaging, a UK company, has launched a paper packaging material as an environmentally acceptable alternative to plastic bubble wrapping. Its Flextra product is a roll of paper with thousands of tiny slits, which takes up less storage room than conventional packaging materials. When it is stretched it becomes a three-dimensional honeycomb of hexagon-shaped holes, giving it cushioning properties. Its ability to expand to 10 times its height and by 20 per cent in area makes it suitable for filling voids, corners and gaps. The manufacturers believe that the paper is an environmental advance on previous products because it is made from recycled fibres, is reusable, bio-degradable and can be recycled.

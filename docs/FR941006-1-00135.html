			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA tentatively concludes that the objectives of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulation regarding the packaging and labeling of iron-containing products will be best met if the agency requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed warnings appear on the immediate container. In case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the strip packaging or individual unit-dose packages are removed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the box in which they are sold to the consumer, or in case a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strip of unit-dose packages is transferred by a pharmacist to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vial, each unit-dose package, or strip of unit dose packages,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would bear the warning that FDA considers essential to the safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of these products. The warning would remind adults not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remove the iron-containing products from the unit-dose package. In addition, it would ensure that each time an adult takes one of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these products, he or she is reminded of the danger that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product poses to children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, if the warning accompanies each tablet or group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of tablets, an adult who finds a child eating the product will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> know to call for help immediately and will know, when asked by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health care professional, that the ingested tablets contain iron.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA is not proposing specific requirements for the graphics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., type size, bold type) of the warning statement but is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to require that the label warning appear prominently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and conspicuously on the immediate container of the product and on the principal display panel of the retail package, so that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers are given adequate notice of the information contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the warning. These proposed requirements for the warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement are consistent with the requirement FDA established for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein products. FDA tentatively concludes that they will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively achieve, through placement rather than graphical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, the objective sought by the AG petition of reaching  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers who have no knowledge of iron's hazards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If FDA adopts the regulations that it is proposing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers will have the flexibility, as requested in the NDMA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition, to design their own label and warning notice formats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is requesting comments on the most efficient way to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that warnings on the immediate container will accompany  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every tablet until the time it is used. Suggestions about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placement and design of unit-dose packaging that can best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate the required warnings are invited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA also specifically solicits comments on whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general requirement that the label warning appear prominently and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conspicuously on the label is adequate. Should the agency more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explicitly define in its regulation the level of prominence and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conspicuousness that it expects? If so, what should the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require? The agency notes, for example, that in a final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that required a new warning on Reye syndrome for aspirin, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically stated that the requirement of ``prominence'' in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations meant that manufacturers of aspirin and aspirin-containing drug products had to use an attention-getting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement, such as ``see new warning'' on the label for at least 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year (53 FR 21633, 21635, June 9, 1988). Similarly, in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule on nutrition labeling that FDA adopted in response to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, FDA specified a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of format elements to ensure that the nutrition facts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label would be readily observable and comprehensible (see 58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2079, January 6, 1993). FDA requests comments on whether, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that the warning statement will have its intended effect,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency should specify more completely how the warning should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be presented on iron-containing products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Proposed Labeling Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Having tentatively concluded that label warning statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be required on iron-containing products, and having  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated the information that the warning statement should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include, FDA is proposing to amend its regulations by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adding new &sect;101.17(e) for foods, and new &sect;310.55 for drugs, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require label warning statements for iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products offered in solid oral dosage form. As noted above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under these proposed regulations, the warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement that must be used will depend upon how the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is packaged. For products that are packaged in unit-dose packaging (e.g., blister packs) the agency is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the following warning:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> WARNING_Keep away from children. Keep in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original package until each use. Contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron, which can harm or cause death to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child. If a child accidentally swallows this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product, call a doctor or poison control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> center immediately. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this proposal, this warning statement will be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all iron-containing products packaged in unit-dose packaging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, it would be required to appear: (1) On the labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of products containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are subject to the proposed requirement for unit-dose packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described below (see section III.B. of this document); and (2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the labeling of products that contain less than 30 mg iron per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dosage unit but that are packaged voluntarily in unit-dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For products that contain less than 30 mg iron per dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit and that are packaged in any form of packaging other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit-dose packaging, e.g., containers with child-resistant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closures, the agency is proposing to require the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> WARNING_Close tightly and keep away from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children. Contains iron, which can harm or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause death to a child. If a child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidentally swallows this product, call a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> doctor or poison control center immediately. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Siemens The 5 per cent fall in Siemens' shares yesterday is nothing compared to the rough treatment given to Alcatel-Alsthom following its profits warning on Wednesday. Yet Siemens now stands 9 per cent below the peak reached at the turn of the year, which underlines how far stock market valuations have run ahead of earnings prospects. There are bright spots in yesterday's statement, such as the prediction that semiconductors will return to profit by 1995 and the promise of reduced losses at Siemens Nixdorf this year. The snag is that loss elimination will be offset by declining profits elsewhere. Like Alcatel-Alsthom, one of Siemens' most profitable divisions is starting to suffer as European governments cut spending on telecommunications. That squeeze on new orders and margins is worst on Siemens' home turf. Income from its large investment portfolio, which helped maintain profits in 1992-93, is also in decline. While the impact of lower interest rates and bond yields is impossible to predict, though, there are signs that dwindling investment income is spurring management to tackle the operational problems. The promise of 10,000 job cuts this year - around 2.5 per cent of the workforce - is a step in that direction. More of the same would help support the shares at the lower level now established. The lingering danger for shareholders is that Siemens feels obliged to spread the pain and cut its dividend as well. Since the pay-out was last raised in 1990, and then only by 50 pfennigs, a cut at this stage would be especially cruel.</p>

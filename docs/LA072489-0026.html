			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> JURORS CLEAR S.F. OFFICERS  </P> <P> A grand jury in San Francisco has cleared four police officers of criminal  wrongdoing in the removal of a file in the case of an officer accused of  hitting farm labor leader Dolores Huerta. "We are of the opinion that there is  not sufficient evidence to lodge criminal charges against anyone," the grand  jury said in a statement to the San Francisco Police Commission. But the panel  also voiced concerns about the way police handled their investigation in the  Huerta case and said the removal of the memo undermined the public's "already  shaky confidence" in the department. Police Chief Frank Jordan said he is  satisfied with the grand jury's findings. The grand jury had been looking into  allegations that Deputy Chief John Jordan, the chief's brother, and three other  officers withheld evidence in the Huerta case. Huerta, a leader of the United  Farm Workers, suffered broken ribs and a ruptured spleen when a police officer  allegedly hit her with a night stick at a demonstration protesting the presence  of then-Vice President George Bush at a fund-raiser. The grand jury, while  saying no laws were broken, recommended punishment for officers who  deliberately removed the memo. The Police Commission is the only agency that  can decide whether to discipline the officers.  </P></p>

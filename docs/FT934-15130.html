			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: AlliedSignal in venture with BASF ALLIEDSIGNAL, the US high technology group, and BASF's North American arm have agreed to combine their nylon carpet fibre and textile nylon businesses into an equally-owned joint venture. The businesses which will form the venture had combined 1992 sales of Dollars 1bn. The venture will include fibre manufacturing sites, research facilities and sales officers. AlliedSignal, which has enjoyed impressive earnings growth since the arrival of a new chairman in 1991, said the venture would enhance its earnings and cash flow. Mr Frederic Posses, president of AlliedSignal Engineered Materials, said: 'Our customers will benefit from manufacturing efficiencies and other cost savings.' BASF, one of Germany's big three chemicals companies, generates Dollars 5bn of sales in North America through its BASF Corporation subsidiary. The joint venture would create a more cost-effective producer which would be large enough to compete in the global man-made fibre market place, the group said yesterday. Like other European chemicals companies, BASF is suffering from recession in European chemicals markets. Its problems have been exacerbated by the strength of the D-Mark. Group net profits fell by 57 per cent in the first half of the year to DM199m (Dollars 124m). The latest move fits with its policy of forging strategic alliances in fields where it believes that it does not have the critical mass to compete on its own. AlliedSignal, based in Morris Township, New Jersey, expects the venture to be a more cost effective producer of nylon fibre, providing fibre customers with more choice and better value. Fibres are part of AlliedSignal's engineered materials operations, the smallest of the company's three main segments with 1992 sales of Dollars 2.6bn or about 22 per cent of the company's total 1992 sales. The engineered materials business produces chemicals, catalysts, laminate systems, performance materials, plastics and amorphous metals. Mr Howard Rubel, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said the joint venture 'has synergies written all over it. This will allow them to rationalise costs and provide a counter-balance to some of the growing threats in fibres markets'. AlliedSignal's fibres business is facing growing competition from polyester and polyolefin fibres which often can be used interchangeably with nylon fibres.</p>

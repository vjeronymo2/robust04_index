The paper says its information has been confirmed by the  head  of Skodaexport's General Director's Office, Zdenek Sima, and  Czech Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lucie Pilipova. The Iranian  authorities imprisoned Vladislav Tyl for several days before  releasing him. Now back in Prague, he declined to comment on  his imprisonment.    Tyl was imprisoned just after a delegation left the country  from the Skoda heavy engineering works based in Plzen, west  Bohemia, which had been creating business contacts in Tehran.    Skoda Plzen Director General Lubomir Soudek told MLADA  FRONTA  DNES that he did not find out about Tyl's imprisonment until  last week, and that he did not know the cause of his arrest.    Sima said that although the Iranians apologized to Tyl after  releasing him, they did not explain why they had detained him.  Sima does not know exactly who detained Tyl. "I do not know  whether it was the secret service, counter-intelligence, or the  criminal police. I don't think even Tyl knows," he said.</p>

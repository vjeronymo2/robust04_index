			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS  </P> <P> Distributed Logic Corp.: The Anaheim-based computer products company reported a  loss of $1.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1990, contrasted with a  loss of $376,933 for the comparable period last year. Revenue for the three  months ended Jan. 31 declined 15% to $10.3 million from $12.1 million. The  company said the loss resulted from a combination of factors, including lower  revenues from U.S. operations, delays in deliveries to a major customer and  costs related to a recent staff reduction.  </P></p>

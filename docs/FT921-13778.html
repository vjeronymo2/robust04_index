			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Construction Contracts: Flood alleviation scheme MJ GLEESON GROUP's Scottish construction division starts 1992 with the award of two contracts together worth Pounds 4.7m. In Glasgow, Gleeson is to undertake the Pounds 3m construction of a 3.5 kilometres relief sewer between Giffnock and Broomley involving some 800 metres of tunnelling. For Strathclyde Regional Council, the scheme is expected to alleviate flooding from the River Cart. In Edinburgh, Gleeson will extend the Mackenzie Building in historic Old Assembly Close at a cost of Pounds 1.7m to provide more space for the Faculty of Advocates. Both projects are expected to commence towards the end of January and they are both scheduled for completion in 1993.</p>

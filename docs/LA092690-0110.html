			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: DAVID KIRKPATRICK NAMED PARAMOUNT CO-PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Paramount Pictures confirmed Tuesday that David Kirkpatrick will become the  next co-president of its motion picture group, replacing Sidney Ganis.  </P> <P> The change, which ends weeks of speculation about the future of the two  executives, is effective immediately.  </P> <P> Ganis will become an independent producer with a long-term agreement at  Paramount. In a prepared statement, Ganis -- who spent most of his career  marketing movies -- called production "a longtime commitment of mine" and said  Paramount is the "best home base for the kinds of films I look forward to  making."  </P> <P> Kirkpatrick, who joined Paramount from Disney in July, will report directly to  studio Chairman Frank Mancuso. Barry London, the co-president responsible for  marketing and distribution, will remain in his position, studio officials said.  </P> <P> Ganis had been president of the motion picture group, overseeing feature film  production, since November, 1988.

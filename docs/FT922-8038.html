			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Scottish hospitals seek trust status ABOUT 16 hospital units or groups have notified the Scottish Office of their interest in obtaining trust status since the general election on April 9. One unit has submitted a formal application. The idea of obtaining trust hospital status was originally much slower to gather momentum in Scotland than in England. There are 56 hospital units in Scotland, of which two became trusts on April 1, with a third poised to become a trust on April 1 next year. If all the hospital units that have applied or expressed interest were granted trust status, a third of Scotland's hospital units would have opted out. The Scottish Office said yesterday: 'The expressions of interest just keep tumbling in.' Hospital units have until June 30 to make formal applications for trust status starting next April. The move towards trust status is being viewed with quiet satisfaction by the government and with consternation by health service unions and Labour politicians. Last year Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, came under strong pressure from opposition parties and unions to refuse the three opt-out applications that had then been submitted. The application by the Foresterhill hospital unit in Aberdeen became a big issue in the nearby Kincardine and Deeside by-election last November, which the Tories lost disastrously. Princess Margaret Rose hospital in Edinburgh is the first of the new crop to submit an application.</p>

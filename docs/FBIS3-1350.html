Widespread  rumors have exacerbated worries and fear among the people. In  the northern areas of the capital, gunfire continues to be  heard, with the inhabitants departing in the hundreds to other  areas of the capital or to Zaire.    A government communique that has just reached us deals with  a  few rumors in particular: A rumor particularly harmful for  peace and national reconciliation in Burundi has reached the  national and international press community. The prime minister  categorically denies the allegations detailed by this rumor and  states the following: There was no coup attempt during the  night of 22 to 23 March 1994. The Presidential Palace and the  government headquarters are enjoying the usual protection of the  security forces. The president of the republic and the prime  minister are at work as usual, as witnessed by the U.S. deputy  under secretary of state, Mrs. (Prudence) [word indistinct]; the  UN secretary general's special representative, Mr. Ahmed Ould  Abdallah; and the ambassador of Cote d'Ivoire in Bonn, Mr.  Simeon Ake, who heads the UN international commission in charge  of investigating the events that have occurred since 21 October  1993. All these officials were received today officially at the  government headquarters. There are not government members on  the run abroad, and no definitive figures for losses have yet  been established after Monday's [21 March] clashes in the  northern areas of the capital between security forces and rebels  armed with assault rifles, grenades and heavy weapons.

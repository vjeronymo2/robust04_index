			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Yerevan, 9 Jun -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev, in the Caucasus region on a working visit, has  described the vote held on [the budget] on Wednesday by the  Russian State Duma as sad.    This budget, in his words, can only guarantee the payment of  the wages and salaries of military servicemen and civilians  employed by the military establishment. He expressed hope that  the Army would get some extrabudgetary funding. If we do not  get additional extra budgetary funds, then there can be no talk  of ordering new equipment or arms, Pavel Grachev said.    He also said that problems would arise with the funding of  scientific research and design work. This budget will have a  negative effect on the future of Russia's armed forces, Pavel  Grachev said.</p>

He said the Security Council should issue a "very firm  warning" to convince Pyongyang to allow inspectors from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to carry out the  necessary inspections.    The IAEA Board of Governors decided Monday to refer the  North  Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council.    Speculation has increased that the Council might decide on  punitive action against North Korea, suspected of developing  nuclear weapons.</p>

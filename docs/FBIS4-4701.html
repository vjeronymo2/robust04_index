			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, April 5 (AFP) -- Thailand helped Pol  Pot, the leader of the notorious Khmer Rouge, to flee a recent  government offensive on the radical faction's resource rich  headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia, co-premier Prince  Norodom Ranariddh said Tuesday.    "Thailand will not be happy with us but we have pictures to  prove (it)," the prince told reporters during a break in the  second session of parliament.    "I can show you a picture of Pol Pot, his house being  attacked, and Pol Pot escaping with cars and a convoy of trucks  driving on a tarmac road inside Thai territory," the prince said.    The prince was adamant that the shadowy guerrilla leader --  who was responsible for the Khmer Rouge's 1975 to 1979 reign of  terror during which some one million Cambodians died of illness,  starvation or execution -- escaped through Thai territory.    "It was not inside Cambodia. Cambodia does not have such  good  smooth roads in that region," he said.    He did not specify how the photos were obtained.    Government forces seized the rebel headquarters and the  surrounding resource rich region March 19.    The Khmer Rouge financed their guerrilla organisation by  selling logging and mining concessions to primarily Thai  business consortiums, many of which are believed to be  controlled by or have links with the Thai military.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report: "Chamber Chairmen Get Invited to </F> Security Council. President Takes on Two Unwhacked Guys To  Replace Two Who Have Been"]    [Text] Security Council personnel completed the  preparation of materials yesterday for a session that is  supposed to discuss the situation in the zone of the  Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict and the question of the Cossacks.  It has been tentatively set for 6 April. This session is likely  to be special because informed sources inside the Council do not  rule out that the chairmen of both Federal Council chambers will  be invited to attend it for the first time.    For the time being two seats remain vacant in the Security  Council which are intended, under the law "On Security," for a  vice president and first deputy Supreme Soviet chairman. It is  the vacant seats that Boris Yeltsin obviously had in mind when  he told Vladimir Shumeyko that the chairmen of the parliament  chambers could take part in the Council sessions.  Interestingly, the president had so far felt no urgent need to  fill the vacancies in this body. More, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY has  come to learn, its sessions have never before decided on any  question by voting: the views of today's Council members always  coincided with that of the president.    The president, nevertheless is prepared to expand the circle  of like-minded people by bringing in representatives of the  legislative authority. Observers believe this is not just a  tribute to political decency, but is also a demonstrative  gesture by the president confirming his readiness for  cooperation with deputies. The snag is in which way the speakers  become Council members. If the president brings them in by his  edict, that would reduce their status to that of federal  ministers and they would only have the right of consultative  voice. The deputies would hardly like it.    The only alternative is to alter the law "On Security" by  striking from the list of permanent members the no longer  existing state positions and adding new ones. During the  debates, the names of Aleksandr Rutskoy and Yuriy Voronin would  surely surface, which would inevitably bring back memories of  last fall. This has already been the case with the president's  draft decree on amnesty. It is even not ruled out that as a  result, the deputies would after all set up their own commission  to probe into last October's events, with all the ensuing  consequences.    In the meantime, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY has come to learn, it  has also been recognized as expedient, in the draft agreement on  national accord, to include the parliament heads in the Security  Council. It also recommends that representatives of  parliamentary committees be drawn into the work of the Council's  interdepartmental commissions. For the time being, according to  KOMMERSANT-DAILY's lights, Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin  will be invited to the first session of the Council as guests of  honor with no right to vote.</p>

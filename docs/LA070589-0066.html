			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The British government refused to extend blasphemy laws for Muslims who want to  bring author Salman Rushdie to trial for allegedly blaspheming Islam. Home  Office Minister John Patten told leading British Muslims that extending the  laws could damage relations between different religions. But the Muslim leaders  vowed to continue their campaign to bring Rushdie to court. Demonstrations in  Britain followed the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's denunciation of Rushdie's  novel, "The Satanic Verses," in February.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] During the past month, Dutch Marines have undergone  all kinds of training in unfamiliar terrain. The exercises that  were held in the jungle of Suriname came to an end last Thursday  [16 June]. The Dutch and Surinamese participants have dubbed it  a success. But Marion Riedewald says the exercises were,  however, not incident free as one Surinamese corporal is  reported to have drowned during the training.    [Begin recording] [Riedewald] Twenty-eight year old Corporal  Lief Sanchez drowned last Monday [13 June] during the  transportation of food to the troops being trained in the jungle  in Saramacca District. Participants observed one minute's  silence in remembrance of Corporal Sanchez at a presentation of  certificates last Thursday.    The training was conducted by 10 Surinamese warfare  instructors, who got their training in Brazil. It was the first  time in 27 years that Surinamese and Dutch soldiers trained  together. The exercises are the result the renewed relationship  between the Surinamese and Dutch Army after the installation of  Colonel (R.T. Houre) as chief commander of the Surinamese Army.  The purpose of the exercises was to get the Dutch Marines some  knowledge of the Surinamese jungle. Captain Tim Van der Leyle,  who was leading the Dutch group, shared his experience with us:    [Begin recording] [Van der Leyle] We had a very heavy rains,  so the terrain was very difficult, and also logistic support was  difficult because of the weather and the terrain. We have had  several people who, because of injuries, had to go out of the  terrain for a certain period, but after their recovery we put  them back into training.    [Riedewald] Forty-four Dutch Marines, based in the  Netherlands Antilles, took part in the exercises, which were  conducted for a month in the Surinamese jungle. [end recording]</p>

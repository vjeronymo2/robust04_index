			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Five frontrunners for Hogg's No 10 job Mr Andrew Tyrie, a former adviser to Mr John Major and Lord Lawson during their terms as chancellor, and Mr Nicholas True, deputy head of the Downing Street Policy Unit, are emerging as strong candidates to succeed Mrs Sarah Hogg as head of the unit. Other contenders include Mr Michael Fallon, the former Conservative MP for Darlington, who lost his seat at the last general election, Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel Investment Management, the UK's largest pension fund, and Mr Danny Finkelstein, head of the Social Market Foundation. Following a Queen's Speech which was widely seen as lacklustre, Conservative officials believe the replacement for Mrs Hogg - who announced this week that she would be leaving the job - will play a vital role in generating new ideas in the run-up to the next election. Mr Major's choice for the job, which involves planning the prime minister's broad political strategy, will send an important signal about the direction government policy should take. Mr Tyrie, a shrewd and abrasive figure on the centre-right of the party, is senior economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr True is one of the prime minister's principal speech-writers. Senior Tories categorise him as a 'safe pair of hands', though some have blamed him for the ill-fated 'back-to-basics' policy. Mr Fallon, a committed supporter of the free market, would be a popular choice among rightwing MPs, who argue that the policy unit must give the government clear political direction. However, he wishes to fight a seat at the next general election, which would be incompatible with the policy unit post under Whitehall rules. Instead, Mr Fallon might be more suited to the post of head of the Conservative Research Department if, as expected, Mr Andrew Lansley quits the position later this year. Mr Ross Goobey, who was a Treasury adviser to Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, is the most heavyweight of the contenders. But there are doubts about whether he would quit his lucrative job to join Downing Street. Mr Finkelstein has been instrumental in the development of a number of rightwing policies in recent years. His biggest handicaps are his youth  - he is in his early thirties - and his past as a former parliamentary candidate for the Social Democratic party. However, he has developed the Social Market Foundation into one of the more impressive and influential think-tanks in Whitehall, producing a stream of policy reports that have influenced government policy. 'He has all the intellectual credentials, and would provide some much-needed rigour,' said one Tory official.</p>

General Part </H5>   1. This Statute defines the procedure for state registration  and reregistration of subjects of entrepreneurial activity,  regardless of their organizational forms and forms of ownership,  with the exception of certain types of subjects of  entrepreneurship (banks, mass information media, stock  exchanges, and others) for which legislative enactments of  Ukraine have established special rules of state registration.    2. State registration of subjects of entrepreneurial  activity  is done at the executive committee of the city or urban rayon  soviet of people's deputies or in the rayon or urban rayon  administration of the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol at their  location (place of residence).    3. The location of a subject of entrepreneurial activity  which is a legal entity is considered the location (siting) of  its permanent management organ (governing board, board of  directors, and others).    The place of residence of a citizen-entrepreneur is the  permanent place of residence registered following established  procedures.  <H5>  II. State Registration of Subjects of Entrepreneurial </H5> Activity    4. For state registration of a subject of entrepreneurial  activity which is a legal entity, the owner (or owners) or the  person (petitioner) authorized by him (or them) submits the  following to the state registration organ:    a) the charter documents:    the decision of the owner of the property or the organ  authorized by him to create the subject of entrepreneurial  activity. If there are two or more owners or organs authorized  by them, the charter agreement is this document;    the charter (if this is necessary for the organizational  form of the subject of entrepreneurship being created);    b) the registration card;    c) the document certifying payment of the registration fee.    In the event a private enterprise is registered, the owner's  decision is not submitted.    If the owner (or one of the owners) of the subject of  entrepreneurial activity is a legal entity, a notarized copy of  the certificate of state registration of this legal entity is  submitted in addition.    A foreign legal entity submits the document certifying its  registration in the country of location (an excerpt from the  trade, bank, or judicial register, and others). This document  must be notarized at the place it was issued, translated into  the Ukrainian language, and legalized at a Ukrainian consular  institution, unless otherwise envisioned by international  treaties in which Ukraine takes part. This document may also be  certified at the embassy of the corresponding state in Ukraine  and legalized at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.    In the event physical persons are the owners of the subject  of entrepreneurial activity, their signatures on the charter  documents must be notarized.    5. The originals of the charter documents are submitted to  conduct the registration.    Charter documents must not contain provisions which  contradict existing legislation.    The petitioner bears responsibility for the charter  documents' conformance with existing legislation.    6. The charter documents are compiled in the official or  other language in accordance with Article 11 of the UkSSR Law  "On Languages in the Ukrainian SSR" and are signed by the  petitioner, perforated, and numbered.    7. A citizen who has the intention of conducting  entrepreneurial activity without creating a legal entity (the  petitioner) submits the registration card and the document  certifying payment of the registration fee to the state  registration organ and also submits a document certifying his  identity.    8. The registration card is filled out in three copies (in  addition to the identification code) and signed by the  petitioner. The completed registration card is at the same time  the petition for state registration.    The state registration organ when necessary offers the  petitioner help in filling out the card. The petitioner is  responsible for making sure the information on the registration  card is correct.    9. The state registration organ does not have the right to  demand other documents from the petitioner and documents filled  out according to requirements different from those defined in  this Statute or that the charter documents be reconciled with  the organs of state executive power or other organs.    10. The state registration organ records the date the  documents are received.    When all documents indicated in points 4 and 7 of this  Statute are received, within five working days the state  registration organ is obliged to conduct the state registration  of the subject of entrepreneurial activity and issue the  petitioner a certificate as shown in the model in the appendix.    11. The number of the state registration certificate of the  subject of entrepreneurial activity must correspond to the  identification code by which this subject is included in the  State Register of Reporting Statistical Units.    The certificate of state registration is the only document  which gives the subject of entrepreneurial activity the right to  open current, foreign currency, and other accounts in banking  institutions and to produce seals and stamps.    The number of the state registration certificate of the  subject of entrepreneurial activity must be shown on the seals  and stamps.    12. Within 10 days from the day of state registration of the  subject of entrepreneurial activity, the state registration  organ is obliged to submit one copy of the registration card to  the appropriate state tax inspection office and one to the state  statistics organ.    13. Branches (divisions) and offices created by a subject of  entrepreneurial activity do not require state registration. The  subject of entrepreneurial activity informs the state  registration organ of the creation of these subdivisions by  inserting the corresponding information on his registration card.    14. The state registration organ keeps a record of the  subjects of entrepreneurial activity starting from the date of  registration or the date of appeal to the state registration  organ at the new location in accordance with Point 23 of this  Statute.  <H5>  III. Reregistration of Subjects of Entrepreneurial Activity </H5>   15. Reregistration of subjects of entrepreneurial activity  is  handled in the manner established for their registration.    16. Reregistration is done if the name of the subject of  entrepreneurial activity is changed;    if the form of ownership is changed;    \ if the organizational form of the subject of  entrepreneurial activity is changed.    17. In the event the owner (or owners) of the subject of  entrepreneurial activity is changed, assuming this did not  result in the form of ownership changing, reregistration does  not take place.  <H5>  IV. Making Changes (or Additions) to the Charter Documents </H5>   18. Changes (or additions) to the charter documents are made  official by individual appendices to it or by putting them in a  new edition while complying with the requirements defined by  points 4-6 of this Statute.    19. In the event changes (or additions) related to a change  in the name, form of ownership, or organizational form of the  subject of entrepreneurial activity are made, it is reregistered  following procedures envisioned by this Statute.    20. In the event changes (or additions) which do not require  reregistration of the subject of entrepreneurial activity but  involve the need to make changes (or additions) to the  registration card are made to the charter documents, within 10  days from the day the decision is made to make these changes (or  additions), the petitioner must submit one copy, notarized  following established procedures, of each of the copies of the  documents in which these changes (or additions) are shown to the  state registration organ and enter them on his registration card.    If these changes (or additions) are significant in scope,  the  petitioner fills out a new registration card blank in three  copies after putting his identification code by which the  subject of entrepreneurial activity is included in the State  Register of Reporting Statistical Units on it. Only the  information on which the changes (or additions) were made is  cited on the new blank. The petitioner crosses out the outdated  information on the registration card filled out before and  affixes his signature.    Within 10 days of the day these documents are received, the  state registration organ in writing informs the appropriate  state tax inspection office and the state statistics organ of  the changes (or additions) made.  <H5>  V. A Change in the Location (or Place of Residence) by the </H5> Subject of Entrepreneurial Activity    21. When the location (or place of residence) is changed,  within 7 days of the day this change is made, the subject of  entrepreneurial activity must do the following:    in writing inform the state registration organ of the new  location (or place of residence). Failing to fulfill this  requirement within the time period indicated is grounds for the  state registration organ to go to court or arbitration court and  ask for cancellation of the state registration;    make the corresponding changes in his registration card;    submit a certificate of state registration for making  these changes.    22. The state registration organ does the following:    makes changes in the certificate of state registration of  the subject of entrepreneurial activity in which the date the  change was made and his new location (or place of residence) are  indicated. The information inserted is signed by the authorized  official and made official with the seal;    within 10 days of the day notification of the change in  location (or place of residence) of the subject of  entrepreneurial activity is received informs the appropriate tax  inspection office and the state statistics organ of this in  writing.    23.

Within 30 days from the day the location (or place of  residence) changes, the subject of entrepreneurial activity is  obliged to appeal to the state registration organ at the new  location (or place of residence) to be put on their rolls.    Within 10 days, the state registration organ at the new  location (or place of residence) of the subject of  entrepreneurial activity informs the appropriate state tax  inspection office and state statistics organ in writing of the  acceptance of this subject of entrepreneurship on the rolls and  his new location (or place of residence).  <H5>  VI.

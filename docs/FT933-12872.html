			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Ministers threaten global acid rain target AN international compromise on acid rain targets could be jeopardised by the government's desire to protect demand for British coal. A cabinet committee meeting last week agreed, after considerable inter-departmental wrangling, that Britain would negotiate at a meeting next month in Geneva for a cut of only 70 per cent in sul-phur emissions from power stations - less than previously indicated. Other countries, including Germany and Norway, will back tougher targets of cuts up to 90 per cent for the new protocol for the European Commission for Europe, which includes most European countries, the US and Canada. An agreement is likely to be included in the EC Large Combustion Plant Directive, which applies to power stations. Britain's resistance to the toughest targets stems from the Department of Trade and Industry's concern that power generators would then want to burn more imported coal, which has a lower sulphur content than British coal, or to increase the proportion of electricity generated from gas. The Department of the Environment is concerned that this goes against years of improved sulphur controls and will again earn Britain the tag 'dirty man of Europe'. Tighter targets, though, will have to be accepted. The government's consultation paper on sustainable development, launched yesterday, said that new technology 'should have dealt with the main sources of acid rain in the next 10 to 20 years' but that 'a few sensitive, upland areas' would still be 'at risk'. A senior DoE official said that by publishing the paper 'we are opening up a large number of issues although we know that some of them are cans of worms politically'. The paper warns that economic growth and road traffic will make it difficult to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions, implicated in global warming, after the year 2000. The UK committed itself at the Rio Earth Summit last year to bringing emissions back to 1990 levels in the year 2000. The government seeks responses to the paper by September 30.

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major reaffirms government's commitment to reducing basic rate of income tax MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday reaffirmed the government's commitment to reducing the basic rate of income tax to 20 pence, Ivor Owen writes. The prime minister said it was proposed to extend the current 20p rate band as 'rapidly and as prudently' as possible. To Labour cheers, Mr Elliot Morley, MP for Glanford and Scunthorpe, claimed that for most people total taxation was now far higher than when the last Labour government left office in 1979. He said the action taken in the Budget to extend value added tax to domestic fuel would have a crippling effect on many people with small occupational pensions which took them just above the income support level. The prime minister retored that if Mr Morley was really concerned about the tax burden he should dissociate himself from the demands for increased public expenditure repeatedly made from the Labour benches.</p>

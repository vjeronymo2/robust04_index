			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major aims to bolster peace-keeping role - United Nations INITIATIVES to strengthen the peace-keeping mission of the United Nations are to be launched by Mr John Major, the prime minister, while Britain holds the chairmanship of the Security Council. He told the Commons yesterday that President Bush of the US, President Mitterrand of France and President Yeltsin of Russia would be among the heads of state and heads of government attending the Security Council meeting in New York later this month. Mr Major also underlined the support for Britain's aim of improving the procedures for securing compliance with the nuclear arms non-proliferation treaty. Condemning Labour suggestions that the timing of the meeting had been influenced by electoral considerations, Mr Peter Thurnham (C Bolton North-east) insisted that the current 'international instability' justified the prime minister's action. He said an earlier comment by Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, that Mr Major was 'grubbing around for a photo opportunity' was insulting. Mr Robin Squire (C Hornchurch) said the prospect of a dictatorship or irresponsible country acquiring any of the 27,000 nuclear weapons previously controlled by the Soviet Union was 'terrifying'.</p>

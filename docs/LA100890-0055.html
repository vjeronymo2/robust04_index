			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> COAST HIGHWAY WIDENING BEGINS  </P> <P> Slower traffic and more congestion will accompany a three-month road-widening  project now under way on Pacific Coast Highway between Golden West Street and  Beach Boulevard, city officials said.  </P> <P> The $1.5-million project, which began Oct. 1, will widen the highway from two  to three lanes in each direction.  </P> <P> However, engineering manager Jack Miller said, the project will consume 526  parking spaces that must be replaced before the new lanes can be installed.  </P> <P> The city plans to build a 300-space parking lot on the ocean side of Pacific  Coast Highway between 11th and Golden West streets. Miller said the city also  wants to construct a 226-space lot north of the Huntington Beach Municipal  Pier.  </P> <P> The road-widening project, paid for with county Unified Transportation Trust  funds, will also repair the deteriorating asphalt surface on the 2-mile section  of road.  </P> <P> Traffic engineers said drivers should seek alternative routes through the area  between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. JON NALICK  </P></p>

"An extraordinarily useful meeting," commented Martino who  was at his debut with the sixteen NATO nations and added that  the final shape of the agreement, which could be signed before  the Group of Seven summit in Naples, provides a "happy wedding"  between the two requirements.    According to Martino, Russia had to be accorded great-power  status, even after the Soviet Union's disintegration, for  domestic and international reasons. At the same time, the East  and Central European countries had to be reassured that they  would be left in "subordination to a hegemony."    Since the debate on Russian relations with NATO began as the  Cold War faded into the past, the need to accord Russia  great-power status has been a constant in Italian foreign  policy, not only because it is a nuclear power, but because of  the contribution it can make in terms of political stability.    The Partnership for Peace has already been signed by another  20 East European and ex-Soviet states. To reassure them, the  NATO foreign ministers said the pact would enter specific  accords with Moscow only as regards issues not covered by the  partnership. These include nuclear non-proliferation and  cooperation against terrorism.    Martino, who confirmed the continuity of the Italian  commitment to NATO, said that another problem would be to watch  out for Russian attempts to water down the alliance's "identity"  to the benefit of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe, with the idea of "somehow legitimising the latter's  right to interfere in NATO's decisions." Martino also urged the  European nations to make a greater contribution to NATO and to  take on greater responsibilities within it.    He also told reporters that the situation in Rwanda was  "extremely complex." He added that something had to be done to  halt the tragedy, also voicing hope in the success of UN  attempts to send in a contingent of 5,500 men from African  countries under a decision taken last night.    As far as Italy is concerned, he said, there would be no  "hasty decisions not linked to the UN or the countries  involved." He added that the Italian government will decide  next Tuesday [14 June] on whom it intends to support as the  successor to Jacques Delors as European Commission president.    According to Martino, the government will also be deciding  on  the candidates Italy will be proposing for the other major  international organisations, from the European Union to NATO,  the Western European Union, and the OECD. To date, the only  official Italian candidate is ex-Foreign Trade Minister Renato  Ruggiero to head the World Trade Organisation, which will  replace GATT.    Martino said Italy plans to propose a packet of names,  deciding in which cases to advance Italian candidatures and when  the candidates of other countries will be backed. [passage  omitted]    According to NATO's deputy secretary-general, Sergio  Balanzino, however, today's agreement confirms that NATO and  Russia have now truly begun on the task of building a new  security system in Europe.    At today's talks, the NATO diplomatic chiefs also agreed to  keep a closer watch on growing instability in the Mediterranean  region, studying eventual moves that may prove necessary.    (Interviewed on a Fininvest news and chat show in Rome,  Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi noted that a constant  in Italian policy had been to insist on Russia's presence at the  Naples summit and in the Partnership for Peace.)    (He also said the Italian position had been to insist on a  more important role for Russia in the partnership than the four  Central and East European countries that have already joined and  are seeking EU membership.)    ("We'll receive greater consideration internationally, if we  resolve our problems of public finance, criminality and  corruption," he added.)    In a bilateral meeting, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe'  told Martino that the section of the Naples summit involving  Russian President Boris Yeltsin would be an appropriate  framework for seeking new impetus for a solution of the Bosnian  crisis at the highest level. Official sources said that Martino  and Juppe' agreed on the need for a more effective negotiating  mechanism if a political solution was to be found. [passage  omitted]</p>

The drug being studied  is a recombinant form of gp120, which is an exact copy, made through  biotechnology, of a major protein on the surface of the virus that causes AIDS.  "This study is the beginning of what could be a very long process, with an  outcome that is uncertain," said Arthur J. Ammann, Genentech's director of  clinical research.  </P></p>

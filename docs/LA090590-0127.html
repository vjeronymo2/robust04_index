			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFC LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, BUT WILL IT BE SUPER?;  </P> <P> PREVIEW: BENGALS AND OILERS, WITH HIGH-TECH OFFENSES, HAVE BEST CHANCE TO  OVERCOME SIX SUPER BOWL LOSSES IN A ROW.  </P> <P> In each of the past six years, the American Football Conference has resembled  an express train moving smoothly through the countryside toward the end of the  line, where it spectacularly derails.  </P> <P> AFC teams have played the NFC on even terms each season since 1984, winning  their share of the annual interconference series. Then each time, their  champions have gotten untracked on the last afternoon, losing six consecutive  Super Bowls.  </P> <P> "Nobody can really explain it," Cincinnati Bengal Coach Sam Wyche said the  other day, reviewing the AFC's record slump. "But I can't see it going on much  longer."  </P> <P> Wyche's team, in fact, could reverse the momentum. The Bengals and Houston  Oilers seem to be the best in their conference, and one or the other can be  expected to represent the AFC in Super Bowl XXV, Jan. 27 in Tampa.  </P> <P> Both are modern offensive teams. The Bengals play football the San Francisco  49er way -- with a major new component, Wyche's no-huddle approach -- and the  Oilers have converted to the run-and-shoot formation, which makes use of four  wide receivers at all times.  </P> <P> But they converted only a few weeks ago. The run and shoot is a radical  departure from conventional football, and the Oilers may need a season of  seasoning. The Bengals don't.  </P> <P> Their time-proven offense took Wyche to the Super Bowl only 18 months ago, and  that day, Cincinnati quarterback Boomer Esiason led Joe Montana's team until  the last minute, when Montana, ending a 20-16 rouser, did what he usually does.  </P> <P> This year, Cincinnati's problem is the potency of its own division, the AFC's  strongest.  </P> <P> The Bengals are looking for big trouble from all three of their Central  Division rivals -- the Pittsburgh Steelers, Houston Oilers and Cleveland  Browns.  </P> <P> They also expect trouble from the evenly matched top four in the AFC West: the  Raiders, Kansas City Chiefs, Denver Broncos and San Diego Chargers.  </P> <P> These are the AFC's big eight -- of whom only five can make the 1990 playoffs  along with an Eastern entry, the New York Jets or Buffalo Bills.  </P> <P> Under a revised playoff system, three wild-card teams from each conference will  compete with the six division winners, starting Jan. 5-6.  </P> <P> Most coaches expect Denver to be one of the AFC's six. The Broncos are a more  solid group than they seemed in Super Bowl XXIV, where Montana led the 49ers to  a 55-10 victory.  </P> <P> That was the third of four jolts that Denver Coach Dan Reeves has taken in the  past four years. His recent heart attack followed three Super Bowl losses.  </P> <P> "Bouncing back is what life is all about," he said last week.  </P> <P> He's right about that, although this season, it will be either Cincinnati or  Houston.  </P> <P> The AFC top 10:  </P> <P> 1) CINCINNATI BENGALS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Boomer Esiason  </P> <P> Coach: Sam Wyche (51-47)  </P> <P> The Bengals and 49ers are both led by Bill Walsh-trained coaches, Wyche and  George Seifert, and their modern offenses are similar. A possibly decisive  difference is that the 49ers spend heavily for talent. In contrast, one of  Cincinnati's best two linemen, Max Montoya, went to the Raiders in the kind of  Plan B exodus that San Francisco avoids by outbidding everyone else. Nor have  the Bengals replaced injured back Ickey Woods. They can still win with Wyche's  no-huddle offense.  </P> <P> 2) HOUSTON OILERS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Warren Moon  </P> <P> Coach: Jack Pardee (first year)  </P> <P> Their opponents describe this team's talent as the best that ever lined up in  the run-and-shoot formation, which Pardee previously brought to two other  Houston winners: the United States Football League's Gamblers and the Southwest  Conference's Cougars. The Oilers' unsurpassed blocking starts with Bruce  Matthews, the receiving with Drew Hill and Ernest Givins. A defensive  specialist, Pardee will address the problems on that side. The question is how  fast they can adjust to a strange new offense.  </P> <P> 3) DENVER BRONCOS  </P> <P> Quarterback: John Elway  </P> <P> Coach: Dan Reeves (91-55-1)  </P> <P> Their Super Bowl wipeout last winter is still held against the Broncos by the  same people who seem to forget that in Montana's three-game playoff parade, the  49ers rolled over the Vikings and Rams the same way. Last year, when the  Broncos' ancient weaknesses evaporated with a new defense and runner, Bobby  Humphrey, they were 6-0 over the AFC in oxygen-thin Mile High Stadium. Nobody  in the NFL comes close to matching Denver's home-field edge.  </P> <P> 4) PITTSBURGH STEELERS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Bubby Brister  </P> <P> Coach: Chuck Noll (193-140-1)  </P> <P> Having survived the winning '70s and slumping '80s, Noll hits the '90s with a  good, young offense and improving defensive personnel. His Merrill Hoge-Tim  Worley backfield became the NFL's best last year, and new coordinator Joe  Walton will help the offense. The two questions: Is Brister an NFL comer? Can  the defense hold the edge it got last year with coordinator Rod Rust, the new  coach at New England? The defensive standout is cornerback Rod Woodson.  </P> <P> 5) SAN DIEGO CHARGERS  </P> <P> QB: Mark Vlasic, Billy Joe Tolliver  </P> <P> Coach: Dan Henning (6-10)  </P> <P> With either youngster pitching for San Diego, the question is whether the  Broncos, Chargers, Raiders or Chiefs will break out of the pack in a year when  Denver has the only established quarterback. At most other positions, San Diego  could be slightly ahead with runner Marion Butts, receiver Anthony Miller,  linebacker Billy Ray Smith and the depth stored by former General Manager Steve  Ortmayer and the incumbent, Bobby Beathard.  </P> <P> 6) RAIDERS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Jay Schroeder  </P> <P> Coach: Art Shell (7-5)  </P> <P> See paragraph above for a more exact placing of the Raiders, who, in various  media surveys, have been ranked from first to last in their division -- and who  have been mentioned by others for both the Super Bowl and the AFC cellar. They  seem clearly stronger defensively and in the offensive line, and they have the  fastest receivers in football. All they want from Schroeder is occasional  accuracy on their favorite missile, the long, long pass to one of those  receivers.  </P> <P> 7) KANSAS CITY CHIEFS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Steve DeBerg  </P> <P> Coach: Marty Schottenheimer  </P> <P> (8-7-1)  </P> <P> If for once DeBerg could play like Bernie Kosar or Jim Kelly, the Chiefs would  jump to the head of the class in the AFC and even worry the NFC in the Super  Bowl. They're sound enough elsewhere. They have a few receivers and a big  running back, Christian Okoye, and at linebacker they line up an MVP-type in  Derrick Thomas who would make any defense look good. When they have all their  players, their secondary is among the finest. But it's really all up to DeBerg.  </P> <P> 8) CLEVELAND BROWNS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Bernie Kosar  </P> <P> Coach: Bud Carson (10-7-1)  </P> <P> Carson was 58 last year when they finally gave him an NFL team, and he won a  division title. Then the Browns beat Buffalo in the playoffs before losing the  AFC title game again in Denver. Although their quarterback ranks with the NFL's  best, the Browns may otherwise be a touch short in talent. Still, some people  say they'll win again with running backs Eric Metcalf and Kevin Mack, and with  Clay Matthews and Michael Dean Perry on defense.  </P> <P> 9) BUFFALO BILLS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Jim Kelly  </P> <P> Coach: Marv Levy (31-26)  </P> <P> In a slumping division, this team hasn't taken charge as surely as its fans  thought it would with its intellectual coach, belligerent quarterback, diligent  general manager, Bill Polian, and its assortment of defensive stars -- Bruce  Smith, Shane Conlan, Cornelius Bennett and others. They say in Buffalo that  Kelly's talent has been diluted by abrasive relationships with teammates, but  there's probably nothing wrong with the Bills that more consistency wouldn't  cure.  </P> <P> 10) NEW YORK JETS  </P> <P> QB: Ken O'Brien, Tony Eason  </P> <P> Coach: Bruce Coslet (first year)  </P> <P> A new general manager, Dick Steinberg, has brought in a new coach from the Bill  Walsh school. And although the Jets in a rebuilding year might be over their  heads in other divisions, they can make a run for it in the East if either  passer is up to it. Some NFL club executives are predicting that in time,  Steinberg and the AFC's other new general managers -- Beathard and Kansas  City's Carl Peterson among them -- will end the NFC's Super Bowl dominance.  </P> <P> THE OTHERS  </P> <P> </P> <P> WEST  </P> <P> After Denver, San Diego, the Raiders and Kansas City line up one through four,  there is only one place left for the Seattle Seahawks. It is improbable,  though, that they'll actually finish fifth. Their coach, Chuck Knox, has a way  of hanging tough against any odds, and his defense will improve when he gets in  his first draft pick, flashy lineman Cortez Kennedy.  </P> <P> In Knox's offensive backfield, John L. Williams has the look of a run-and-shoot  triple threat -- runner-receiver-blocker -- which is one reason the Seahawks  may be in that formation more extensively than they now expect.  </P> <P> Top to bottom, the AFC West has been called a strong division that would be one  of the NFL's strongest if it had more quarterbacks of proven worth. The Elway  contribution can be measured in one statistic: Of the AFC's 14 teams, the  Broncos alone played in three 1980s Super Bowls.  </P> <P> Many scouts reason that the Chiefs and Chargers are set at most positions and,  with Carl Peterson and Bobby Beathard rounding up talent, both soon may stand  with the NFL's leaders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CENTRAL  </P> <P> In this division last year, in one of the NFL's closest races of all time,  Cleveland finished 9-6-1, Houston 9-7, Pittsburgh 9-7 and Cincinnati 8-8. It  will come as no surprise to most in the AFC Central if the standings are the  same this year -- or if they're just the reverse, with the Browns a half-game  behind the others.  </P> <P> Few NFL teams match the quality of the Cincinnati nucleus: blocker Anthony  Munoz, receiver Eddie Brown, tight end Rodney Holman, runner James Brooks,  passer Boomer Esiason, nose tackle Tim Krumrie and safety David Fulcher.  </P> <P> Cleveland quarterback Bernie Kosar will have a fourth offensive coordinator in  four years, Jim Shofner.  </P> <P> The primary AFC Central question is how much Warren Moon will shake things up  in Houston's run and shoot, and the mystery team is Pittsburgh, which, to many  AFC critics, seems to be on the way up again. But Pittsburgh's Brister is the  least experienced quarterback in a division with three giants, Moon, Esiason  and Kosar.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EAST  </P> <P> Some of the NFL's most famous winners have come out of the franchises in this  division -- the Jets with Joe Namath, the Dolphins with Bob Griese and Dan  Marino, the Colts with John Unitas and Eric Dickerson, the Bills with O.J.  Simpson, and, most recently, a New England Super Bowl team.  </P> <P> But to many in the AFC East, their division is in disarray -- although the  Bills could still come back this year, and the Jets could come up.  </P> <P> In Miami, Dan Marino keeps asking to be traded. Maybe he's saying something  more. At 29, he's still the world's best passer. The question is whether Coach  Don Shula, 60, has enough help besides receiver Mark Clayton and cornerback Tim  McKyer.  </P> <P> When the Colts drafted Jeff George last spring, they disclosed that they had  the NFL's next great quarterback -- but he won't prove it this year. With Eric  Dickerson out, Coach Ron Meyer has been left with not much but a linebacker,  Duane Bickett, who can't run the ball or pass it.  </P> <P> The Patriots are stocked with above-average players, none of them at  quarterback. Though well-coached by rookie Rod Rust, 61, they are unlikely to  overtake anyone except Indianapolis.  </P></p>

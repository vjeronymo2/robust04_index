This brings the  number of detainees who have confessed to participating in the  crime to five, including a monk. A search is under way for six  fugitive suspects, including the official in charge of the  operation, who escaped to the occupied border zone.    AL-SAFIR adds that the detainees confessed to receiving  their  orders from two officers in the Mosad, the Israeli intelligence  service. Investigations continue to determine how much the  organizations to which the detainees belong know about the  operation. According to AL-SAFIR, the official in charge of the  operation is Pierre 'Ayn, a demolition expert who worked as an  aide to a former Lebanese Forces official and who escaped to the  occupied border zone along with two of his assistants.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Arts: Malvern Festival The Malvern hills threatened to ring with unaccustomed music at the weekend, as thousands of hippies gathered for an impromptu festival. This is the home of Edward Elgar and the uninvited visitors had taken over the very area where the great English composer conceived some of his finest music. By coincidence it was also the central weekend of the official Malvern Festival. As one might expect, Elgar is traditionally the presiding spirit in the hall at Great Malvern which bears his name. This year, however, the festival programme has featured Robert Simpson as Composer in Residence. Four of his works received premieres, funded entirely by the festival after other sources failed to come up with finance: a symphony, a string quartet and concertos for flute and cello. Simpson has always been concerned with the renewal of classical forms and these four pieces have imposed on them his usual rigour of form. The Eleventh Symphony is lighter than its immediate predecessors. Simpson has written for a chamber orchestra and made a conscious effort to keep the textures transparent. The symphony lasts half an hour. It is in two movements, the first slow and moody like Shostakovich, the second playful at first, then forcefully dramatic. The teasing final pay-off, in which the brooding music is swept aside with a flick of the wrist, recalls the end of the Fourth Symphony of Beethoven. The symphony was written for the conductor, Matthew Taylor, towards whom the composer was generous with his praise, but the City of London Sinfonia performed as if it had yet to get the technical difficulties under its belt. On Sunday, the orchestra returned to give the first performance of the Flute Concerto, now conducted by Richard Hickox and with Susan Milan the eloquent soloist. Of the two premieres which I heard, this was the more attractive. The flute writing is delightful, delicately balanced between decoration and substance; the structure is novel. From a fanciful scherzo-like opening, the concerto slowly winds down until it metamorphoses into an intimate quintet, producing a thought-provoking ending as the music turns ever more pensively in upon itself. The loss made on mounting the premieres means the festival will be returning to more traditional fare next year. Elgar is the likely focus of attention - bands of roving hippies notwithstanding.</p>

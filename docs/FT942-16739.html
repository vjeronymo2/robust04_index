			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Suter returns to acquisition list with bid for Wilkes Suter, the industrial conglomerate chaired by Mr David Abell, yesterday ended its year-long pursuit of James Wilkes by making a recommended offer for the Sheffield engineering group which has strong automotive interests. Suter had built up a 29.5 per cent stake in its quarry and is offering Pounds 23.4m for the rest. It would assume debt of Pounds 17m. The offer is of one new Suter share plus 165p in cash for every two Wilkes shares - valuing each Wilkes share at 180p, with a cash alternative of 175p. Suter's shares closed 1p lower at 195p, while Wilkes rose 17p to 177p. A recommendation from the Wilkes board was the preferred option for Mr Abell, who has recently been trying to live down Suter's reputation for taking small stakes in companies and not necessarily making a bid. Suter's purchase of the Wilkes stake in March last year was its first move since the publication of a DTI report on share dealings by Suter and Mr Abell in the mid- 1980s. The report found no evidence that these and other parties acted in concert, but criticised Mr Abell and questioned the timing of his private share purchases. Mr Abell, who was cleared of insider dealing by the DTI, was strongly critical of the report's findings, but would not have relished a hostile bid battle for Wilkes, in which these issues would inevitably have been raked over again. Suter has paid an average of 100p per share for its existing stake in Wilkes. The Sheffield group's shares had collapsed from a high of 190p in 1992 - the year it fought off a hostile Pounds 35m bid from Petrocon - to 48p last January after interim losses. Although Mr Abell has offered the Wilkes board a price per share near this year's high of 182p, he denied that Suter had overpaid. Analysts believe the deal could be earnings-enhancing from day one, given Suter's scope to reduce costs. Mr Doug Rogers, Wilkes's chairman, would join the board of Suter as a non-executive director, but Mr Arthur Watt, Wilkes's chief executive, would leave after assisting with the integration. Wilkes yesterday said that it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m in 1993, compared with a loss of Pounds 7.05m. Sales were flat at Pounds 40.4m (Pounds 41.3m). Earnings per share of 5.3p compared with a loss of 36.9p last time. No final dividend was recommended, because of the offer.</p>

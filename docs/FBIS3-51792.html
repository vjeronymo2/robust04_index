			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 23 Jan (AFP) -- The TENDENCIAS  ECONOMICAS Y FANANCIERAS [ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL TENDENCIES]  (TEF) bulletin said today that the political strategies to face  the "Chiapas syndrome" (the emergence of guerrillas) "have  already changed, at least partially, the economic outlook, and  it would not be wise for investors to downplay or categorically  deny the changes that have occurred in 1994."    The "weekly report for company management," published by the  Expansion publishing company, pointed out that the government  has established a strategy toward pacification which stresses  reforms and dialogue." But the report warned about signs that  "the government has not yet decided on a unified line of action  and the skirmishes among political groups linked with the  Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI, official) and the  government are reason for concern." In that framework, which was  created by the emergence of the Zapatist National Liberation  Army (EZLN) on 1 January in the southern State of Chiapas, TEF  indicated that "for now the financial outlook seems stable and  optimistic, but that unknown events in the near future might  change this stability."    TEF specialists noted that current "financial analyses are  underestimating the weight that political events are going to  have on the economy during 1994." They pointed out that if the  political strategy had "efficient and relatively speedy  results," the government would have "a wide margin to maneuver  to preserve economic reform and prevent 1994 economic policy  objectives from being altered." They added that the economic  objectives include overcoming inflation, encouraging a  "microeconomic" revolution, and reactivating the economy in  accordance with healthy public finances, stable exchange, and an  orthodox monetary policy. They warned that "to change the  economic policy in response to the Chiapas conflict would be  suicidal: to throw overboard all that has been achieved,  running the very high risk of causing political instability."    TEF analysts also believe that it is possible for Mexico to  close 1994 with a 6.5-percent inflation rate, 1.5 percent over  official estimates, and with a 2.5-percent growth in GNP, that  is half a point below the official figures.    According to TEF, there are skirmishes among "groups close"  to PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio because of  the importance that Manuel Camacho, the commissioner for peace  and reconciliation in Chiapas who was one of Colosio's rivals  for the PRI nomination, now has. TEF added that there is "clear  evidence of conflict in government circles between 'doves'  (conciliators) and 'hawks' (intransigents), not only regarding  the Chiapas conflict, but regarding whether or not there should  be an opening in the political system. Which line will prevail  and at what expense?"    The publication said that "it seems possible that, even if  its definitive solution takes a while, the Chiapas conflict  remains isolated in the national scenery and that an `epidemic'  which might spread to other poor areas of the country is not  likely. However, this possibility will be very costly and it  will influence -- we do not know to what extent -- the political  strategy of Salinas' successor."    President Salinas appointed Colosio as the PRI candidate,  but  according to analysts, following the emergence of the  guerrillas, Colosio "has begun to `appear' as a weak candidate,  and the skirmishes and pressures among PRI members are  undeniable."</p>

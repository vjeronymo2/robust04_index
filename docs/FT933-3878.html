			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Shame about the high prices JAPANESE consumers will from next month be able to compare officially vetted import cost prices with astronomically high retail prices, writes William Dawkins. The move is part of the new government's drive to encourage consumers' interests in a country traditionally run with reference to producers' lobby groups. It is among a series of measures under preparation for inclusion in an economic stimulus package later this month, to lean on companies to pass on the benefits of the yen's strength to consumers. Finance ministry officials say they will soon publish monthly lists of average importers' cost prices of 20 basic goods, such as meat, fruit and whisky. The aim is to shame distributors into dropping prices when consumers learn of the huge profit margins usually added to imported goods by layers of middlemen.</p>

The morning news bulletins were broadcast, and then all  central channels went off the air. Until the issue is settled,  the oblast's Yaroslavia company and City Television, which have  no debts, will be the only companies to broadcast without  restrictions.    "The central and the Petersburg companies owe us more than  200 million rubles, and this causes us problems in paying for  electricity and spare parts". This is how Boris Belyayev,  deputy head of the Yaroslavl Radio and Television Broadcasting  Center commented on its participation in the action. He  acknowledged that "this action is not the best measure to take,  but it is a serious warning that attention must be paid to the  critical situation in which communications workers are finding  themselves."</p>

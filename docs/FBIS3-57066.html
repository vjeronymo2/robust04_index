The report that follows was  filed by Jonas Kernigis of the Lithuanian service of Radio  Vilnius.    [Kernigis] The Czech defense minister was met at Vilnius  airport by his Lithuanian counterpart, Linas Linkevicius, and  other top-ranking military officials of the Ministry of Defense  of the Republic of Lithuania.    The defense ministers of the two states had an exchange of  opinion on bilateral cooperation between the Czech Republic and  Lithuania. According to the Czech defense minister, Antonin  Baudys, his country can sell Lithuania arms, if Lithuania  expresses such a wish. Mr. Antonin Baudys said that the  situation in Europe was complicated, following the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, and owing to the unending  military conflict in the Balkans. The war actions in the  Balkans make NATO be cautious about admitting post-communist  states to the organization. The Czech minister of defense, Mr.  Antonin Baudys:    [Begin Baudys recording in Czech, fading to English  translation] The government of the Czech Republic considered the  issue of NATO membership all through the year 1993. Therefore  the American Partnership for Peace initiative did not surprise  us. We realised that this is the maximum that can be achieved  in Europe. We were the first to approve the project. We  understand that NATO must treat Russia as an economic and  military partner. [end recording]    [Announcer] According to the Czech minister of defense, the  Visegrad states, namely Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and  Hungary, as well as other East European states, seek NATO  membership, striving to ground [as heard] that cooperation on a  democratic state system and market economy. The Czech Republic  also speaks up for the preservation of the existing state  borders in Europe, and against the formation of any new military  blocs on the continent. According to the Czech defense  minister, the U.S. Partnership for Peace project makes it  possible to put into practice the potential of East and Central  European states, without doing harm to the peculiar interests of  a given country.    According to the Czech minister of defense, Antonin Baudys,  it was accentuated during the visit of the American President  that the Partnership for Peace initiative did not only mean  cooperation in the military sphere:    [Begin Baudys recording] The words uttered by the U.S.  President during the visit to the Czech Republic witnessed that  the United States will support European states by way of  economic programs and investment. A draft of such cooperation  has already been worked out and it will soon be submitted to the  Czech Government. [end recording]    [Announcer] According to the Czech defense minister, each  East European state must draw up its individual program of  participation in the Partnership for Peace project. Lithuanian  minister of national defense, Linas Linkevicius, told Radio  Vilnius that new links of partnership with the Czech Republic  were going to be established.    [Begin Linkevicius recording] Five groups of Lithuanian  officers will go to the Czech Republic to gain experience there.  At present, deputy minister of defense and the commander of the  Air Force are having a course in that country, too. We expect  Czech assistance in the sphere of armament development.  Cooperation between the two states is concrete and fruitful,  and that is most important. [end recording]    [Announcer] The defense minister of the Czech Republic will  stay in Lithuania until Wednesday. The official visit of the  Czech minister envisages meetings with Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas and chairman of parliament, Ceslovas  Jursenas. He will also visit units of the Lithuanian Army in  Vilnius, Kaunas and Siauliai.</p>

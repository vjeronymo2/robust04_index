			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLAIMS WORKER GETS 6 YEARS FOR STEALING $496,000  </P> <P> A medical claims processor who diverted $496,000 to his own use to win back his  estranged wife was sentenced Monday in Los Angeles federal court to six years  in prison and ordered to undergo psychological counseling.  </P> <P> Robert Harrelson, 26, who aroused the suspicion of fellow Cigna Corp. employees  when he showed up for the company softball team's practice driving a new BMW  car, said he had begun funneling the money into a secret bank account to lure  back his wife's affections and then could not stop.  </P> <P> Ironically, it was a phone call from Harrelson's wife after his disappearance  last August that sent authorities to Honolulu, where the claims processor led  U.S. Postal Service inspectors on a chase through city streets before  surrendering.  </P> <P> "The wife turned the defendant in of her own volition. She was scared of him,"  Assistant U.S. Atty. David Katz said.  </P> <P> Harrelson had claimed to be a member of the 1984 Spanish Olympic basketball  team when he first went to work at Cigna's Northridge claims center in early  1988.  </P> <P> Soon, however, he began processing claims to a fictitious company he had set up  with a post office box address. The fraudulent claims eventually totaled more  than $453,000 and another $43,000 in checks were taken from the Cigna mail  room, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wife Took Everything  </P> <P> Within a few months, Harrelson bought a BMW, a Cadillac Eldorado and a Honda  Accord, $2,400 worth of jewelry, $35,000 in paintings and made a down payment  on a new house in Chatsworth, the government said.  </P> <P> Once he started diverting the money, defense attorney Alan Lanspaugh said, "It  became almost like an addiction. He kept punching out those checks, because it  was so easy."  </P> <P> Lanspaugh said that although Harrelson fled to Hawaii, he was planning to turn  himself in once he sold the BMW to raise money to hire a lawyer. The attorney  denied that Harrelson's wife had ever been afraid of his client, but said she  has since admitted that she made her original statements to postal inspectors  because she feared criminal liability herself.  </P> <P> But Katz said Harrelson's wife has also said he was planning not to turn  himself in, but to adopt a new identity, go to work for another insurance  company and launch the same scheme again.  </P> <P> "He's not willing to work hard to get the finer things in life," the prosecutor  said. "He wants to live a life that is way beyond his means and ability. . . .  And he does it as a thief and a crook."  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer granted Harrelson's request to undergo  psychological counseling while in custody and also ordered him to pay $345,977  in restitution to Cigna Corp.  </P></p>

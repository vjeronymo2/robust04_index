			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents ITAR-TASS Dmitriy Gorokhov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Excerpt] Geneva, 15 May -- The first reaction from the  Bosnian sides to the results of the ministerial meeting between  Russia, the USA and five countries of the European Union  indicates that it will be possible to move towards a settlement  on the basis of the adopted document. This was announced to  journalists in Geneva on Saturday night by Andrey Kozyrev,  Russian Federation foreign minister.    "I must say that the reaction was not bad from both the Serb  and the Muslim leadership," he noted. "We had contacts with  Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, during which it became  clear that there is a considerable opportunity to work towards a  settlement on the basis of the adopted document. I think that  the Serbian side is also sending out signals that it is willing  to begin negotiations without any preconditions, which is very  important."    Nevertheless, the minister believes that considerable effort  will be needed to bring the two sides closer. [passage omitted]</p>

"As finance minister, I cannot take responsibility for  compiling the national budget." These were the words of  complaint that an infuriated Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii  made to Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who had  hinted at separating the issue of a consumption tax increase  from an income tax cut, after Fujii marched into the Prime  Minister's Office on the morning of the same day. Such remarks  are rather unusual at a time when the process of drafting the  budget is in its final stages. Fujii expressed his strong  determination that he "is prepared to resign" if a consumption  tax hike were to be shelved. After registering his complaint  with Takemura, Fujii held a news conference and said: "It is the  basic policy of the government to treat them (tax cut and tax  hike) as a single package. I would like the ruling coalition  party representatives to finalize opinions within their parties  within this framework."    While the gloomy atmosphere of a possible Diet dissolution  and subsequent general elections made a remarkable turnaround  with the passage of the political reform bills, Takemura had  made his earlier remarks at a time when the Finance Ministry  felt that "hopes have revived concerning the possibility of a  consumption tax increase" (as stated by a senior Finance  Ministry official). Thus, the ministry all the more hopes to  put the brakes on the idea of shelving a consumption tax hike  from becoming widespread. Senior officials of the Finance  Ministry's Tax Bureau have visited such places as the Diet  Members' Office Building in an earnest effort to try to persuade  politicians to support the ministry's idea to have the amount of  the consumption tax hike and the date of its implementation  expressly stated in the tax bills.    One senior Finance Ministry official said: "It is all or  nothing regarding the consumption tax hike. Either it will be  written in the law or not." The ruling coalition parties have  maintained that "it would be satisfactory to spend one to two  years coming up with a final decision." The official's  understanding is that if the ministry agreed to this coalition  plan to carry over debate on a consumption tax hike to the next  Diet session, "it would in fact be equivalent to having given up  on securing a source of revenue."    After attending a meeting of the Council on Economic Issues  held on the evening of the same day, Fujii told reporters, "The  government has confirmed that it will treat income tax cuts and  a consumption tax hike as a single package." He thus stressed  that no changes have been made to the original plans. When  asked whether the amount of the consumption tax increase and the  date of its implementation would also be decided in the same  package, Fujii smiled and said, "They will be treated as a  single package."</p>

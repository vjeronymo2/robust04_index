Khasapopoulos: "Turkish Trap on NATO </F> Commands"]    [Excerpts] A maneuver by Ankara is creating a crisis in our  relations with NATO, creating at this time unpredictable  political and military repercussions.    The issue of establishing the commands has caused tension in  Greek relations with NATO, following a well-planned Turkish  trap, which everyone involved (that is, the new armed forces  leadership, but also the minister of national defense) is now  attempting to defuse through various initiatives.    The situation that was created is quite difficult for the  Greek Government, since the initiative at this time belongs  exclusively to Turkey, which, in a spectacular and sudden policy  change, has refused to accept the establishment of commands in  Greece, to which it had initially agreed. Greece has already  committed its first mistake: during the last meeting of the  Alliance's defense ministers, it did not bring up the issue of  the commands' establishment, acting on the advice of NATO  Secretary General Woerner.    Why Greece listened to Mr Woerner's request and failed to  bring up the issue of the commands at the defense ministers'  meeting, when our minister left Athens for Brussels with the  intention of tabling this vital issue on a priority basis has  not yet been explained. What is certain is that, with the  Turkish veto on the establishment of the Greek commands and the  Greek veto on the establishment of all commands (including those  in Italy), new tension has emerged in Greece-NATO relations.  [passage omitted]    Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis is now preparing to  give battle to keep the commands in Greece and to avoid the  Turkish traps set almost daily at alliance headquarters. Such a  trap already exists, with Italy as the main actor.    The Italians never understood why they suddenly lost the  commands because of Greco-Turkish differences, given that the  outcome of the Greek veto was the operational blockage of all  five commands located in various areas of Italy. With the  encouragement of the Turks and of higher NATO officials, the  Italians are already pressuring the Greek Government to lift the  veto on Italy and maintain it only against Turkey.    At first glance, such a move by the Greek Government seems  natural, since there are no military differences between Italy  and Greece. However, is this really so? Athens knows very well  (as affirmed by political sources) that by lifting the veto on  the establishment of all the commands of NATO's southern flank,  it loses its most important bargaining chip, as well as the only  issue that would enable it to exert pressure to achieve the  conditions it hopes for to reinforce its defenses.</p>

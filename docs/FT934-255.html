			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Italian government cash rescues Rai The Italian government yesterday approved an emergency L700bn (Pounds 282m) financial package to prevent the state-run broadcasting corporation, the Rai, from bankruptcy proceedings. The package has been the subject of intense negotiations between the government, political parties and Rai management. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, agreed to provide the aid only after being given evidence of a major reorganisation at the Rai and cuts of L370bn next year. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate who controls more than 85 per cent of Italian commercial television and who nurtures political ambitions, attacked the government rescue of rival channels. 'This is the final blow at the end of the year: a government which regards its task as complete decides to allocate some L500bn of public money to the coffers of the Rai.' The Rai is expected to have accumulated losses of L560bn at the end of this year, with a further L750bn expected in 1994. Management has been unable to fund the usual extra month's Christmas pay. The measures are primarily a book-keeping exercise. The government has allowed a L300bn increase in the value of the Rai's fixed assets. It has also accepted the conversion into equity of L360bn owed to the treasury. At the same time the government is allowing a 5 per cent increase in the annual licence fee from L148,000 to L156,000. The fee has been unchanged for five years. Also the proportion of the licence fee going directly to the Rai has been increased from 84 per cent to 91 per cent. A final boost to the broadcaster's finances will come from a reduction in the annual concession fee paid to the state. This will be cut from L165bn to below L40bn, more in line with that paid by commercial networks. The Rai is owned by Iri, the state holding company, but the debt conversion means that the treasury's deposit guarantee institute will become a shareholder. The government has insisted on a sixth board member to represent this stake, giving it a direct say in management. Traditionally, the Rai has been answerable to the leaders of the main political parties who agreed a carve-up of influence so that the broadcaster's first and main channel was controlled by the Christian Democrats, the second by the Socialists and the third by the Communists, now the Party of the Democratic Left. The outgoing parliament could still sabotage the package. In the past six months new management has sought to end this political control, budgets have been trimmed, some 800 jobs have been cut and star entertainers have been asked to take salary cuts of up to 20 per cent. A further 900 jobs are expected to go next year. Magistrates have also been called in to investigate corruption in the construction of a new headquarters and suppliers' contracts. The broader issue of the future of state-run television is unlikely to be addressed until after the next general election. But Mr Berlusconi's political ambitions and the way he obtained his commercial networks from a now discredited Christian Democrat and Socialist dominated government will bring the question of television services into sharp relief.</p>

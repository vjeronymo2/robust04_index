			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (1): An image of respectability - The key to Guernsey's economic success must be in the expansion of the financial services industry and a tough supervisory regime / Introduction A BRIEF stroll through the cobbled streets of St Peter Port, the capital, will soon tell you what the dominant industry of Guernsey is. The clue lies in the discreet brass nameplates on the handsome granite office buildings. After a series of successful trading ventures starting with the lucrative privateering of the 18th and 19th centuries, then granite-quarrying, horticulture and tourism, Guernsey now derives more than half its revenue from financial services. Changes in economic circumstances are nothing new for the tiny island off the coast of Normandy, but the past two decades have seen a particularly dramatic change. More than 300 banks, insurance and investment houses have been attracted to St Peter Port. The reasons lie in the island's constitutional position and political stability, its tax structure, and its firm but flexible regulatory system. The Bailiwick of Guernsey, which also includes the islands of Alderney and Sark, occupies with neighbouring Jersey a unique constitutional position. It is not part of the UK and it is not a sovereign state or colony. The British government is responsible for its foreign relations and defence, but it has its own legislature and judiciary and runs its own economy free from interference from either the UK or the European Community. Hence - with income and corporate taxes at low levels and no inheritance, capital gains or value added taxes - its attraction as an offshore financial centre. Guernsey authorities are sensitive to the claim that the island deliberately set out to become a tax haven. They point out that personal and corporate taxes were set at 20 per cent in 1960 because of a cautious and prudent budgetary policy, whereas offshore finance business did not come to the island on any scale until the early 1970s. One reason for the fast growth since then is the image of respectability that Guernsey has carefully cultivated, in contrast to some offshore centres. These days, offshore centres need to be squeaky-clean, whereas at one time the whole point of tax havens was that they were free of regulation. Centres such as Guernsey now boast the same scale of financial supervision and regulation as mainland jurisdictions. And in Guernsey, they also boast that local regulators once rejected an application from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. However, Guernsey has retained flexibility in its informal supervisory system. Its authorities prefer to negotiate individually rather than set firm rates of taxation that must be met. Offshore insurers, for example, have the choice of paying full tax, reduced tax, or being exempt, thus making Guernsey an attractive location for captives. Mr John Roper, director-general of the island's Financial Services Commission, and a former member of the Bank of England's supervisory department, believes the answer to a successful offshore operation is to exclude the villains in the first place. He says: 'Our protection is a portfolio of well-supervised and well-run banks. We are as anxious as anyone to make sure that one bad apple does not harm our good business reputation.' Guernsey regulators also argue that because they are slightly detached from the political and civil service framework, banks and firms are more likely to approach them for informal advice. However, there is a possible conflict of interest for offshore regulators in Guernsey and elsewhere. They are there to protect the probity and reputation of the island, but they are also expected to promote the narrow business interests of the local community. Another difficulty Guernsey is aware of is its lack of a distinct identity. As one of the Channel Islands, it is often confused with, or lumped together with, Jersey, its bigger and higher-profile neighbour. There is a debate about whether Guernsey should seek to differentiate itself more, possibly through intensive marketing. There is also an awareness that offshore financial business may no longer gravitate towards Guernsey or any other centre quite so easily in future. The growth of specialist EC financial centres such as Luxembourg and Dublin has served to focus attention on the need constantly to expand and improve services. The tricky dilemma for Guernsey now is how to prevent the economy becoming unbalanced by the strength of financial services. A central aspect of the budgetary debate in the States - the island's parliament  - has been whether this sector should be attracted in even greater volume in order to lift tax revenues, or whether support should go into other sectors of the economy to create a better balance. The earning power and tax revenue from finance is way above anything that can be achieved from other sectors, but there are strong political objections to the increased immigration and environmental pressures that could be generated. There is already a very strict limit on the number of homes that can be occupied by incomers and new housing developments are being limited to a specific area in order to protect the island's rural attractions. Attempts have been made to attract light industry, but shortages of land and labour - and remoteness from raw materials and customers - has limited manufacturing to 6 per cent of exports despite successes in a few niche markets. The judgment has been made to let industry and horticulture find their own levels without any support. Agriculture, particularly the growing of tomatoes, has fallen substantially in value in recent years, although Guernsey remains an important source of cut flowers for the British market. Tourism, the other traditionally important sector, is also heavily dependent on the UK economy, and has seen a steep fall in visitors and spending totals. Costs have been kept down by the use of foreign labour, however, and the hope is that the sector will start to grow as the UK comes out of recession. A key section of Guernsey's economic and financial report last year, outlining future economic development, concluded that the island was 'bound to remain heavily reliant on a healthy financial services sector and buoyant visitor economy, each of which is dependent on the other's success.' It added: 'Quite simply, the economy is likely to remain relatively static over the next five years unless there is a degree of stimulus injected into one or both of these industries.' The key to Guernsey's economic success must be in the expansion of the financial services industry, supported by a tough supervisory regime. But without a healthy tourist industry the island's infrastructure, especially the frequent air and sea links that the brass-plated firms need, could not be maintained.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures ran into some heavy selling following the announcement of higher UK interest rates, but staged a good rally later when trading volume died down. At the close the September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, which expires at the end of the week, stood at 3,112, a discount of 16 to the underlying cash market, with the fair value premium adjusted to around 3 points to allow for the rise in interest rates on carrying costs. The selling came mostly from the locals, or independent, traders, with one source hitting the contract hard. In the hectic period following the Bank of England's announcement, the contract dropped to a low of 3,101, only to recover strongly and reach a high for the day of 3,140 in mid-afternoon. Trading volume of just under 18,000 September contracts was high but not by any means dramatic, and included a significant proportion of roll-over deals into the December contract. Traders believe that most of these deals have now been completed, opening the way for a smooth expiry operation on Friday. Volume in traded options increased to 42,477 contracts, from under 41,000 on Friday, but the Footsie option saw reduced activity of 12,872 lots. Among individual stock options, Hanson was the most active with 2,647 dealt.</p>

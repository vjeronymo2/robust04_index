			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Signs of a split in Bosnian presidency BOSNIAN President Alija Izetbegovic is coming under pressure, not only from the European Community but also from other members of the joint Bosnian presidency to adopt a less hostile attitude to the latest proposals for the country's political framework. Arriving in Zagreb last night with Mr Haris Silajdzic, his foreign minister, the president went straight for talks with the collective Bosnian presidency, which includes Serbs and Croats as well as Moslems. Earlier in the evening, the presidency had met in his absence, as signs emerged of a split which could threaten his position as leader. The presidency was reported to be trying to decide whether the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government should join negotiations with Serbs and Croats on dividing Bosnia along ethnic lines. Before flying from Copenhagen yesterday, Mr Izetbegovic was ambivalent about whether he would take part in future Geneva peace negotiations. He spoke of the need to consult his government and parliament, adding: 'But we shall never participate in negotiations which are a cover for further territorial aims of the Serbs.' Now that the international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, have conceded that the original Vance-Owen plan is defunct and that other, if less desirable, avenues must be pursued, Mr Izetbegovic is seen by a growing number of western diplomats as the main obstacle to progress. His political demise would not be felt as a tragedy in western capitals. After last week's meeting in Geneva of the presidents of Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia and Bosnia, under the chairmanship of the mediators, separate talks were held by the mediators with members of Bosnia's collective presidency. At these talks, Mr Izetbegovic's colleagues adopted a more open attitude than their leader to proposals for creation of three ethnic mini-states within a loose confederal framework, which are due to be presented in detail by Serbia and Croatia in Geneva tomorrow, according to western diplomats. The extent of the split in the Bosnian presidency was underlined yesterday by Mr Fikret Abdic, generally regarded as a moderate Moslem and potential leadership challenger, who said no plans should be rejected outright. He was quoted by Croatian radio as saying: 'Not one idea of the future arrangements for Bosnia should be rejected.' Lord Owen, while still insisting that the Bosnian Serbs must withdraw from some territory they have occupied, has stressed that the situation on the ground must be taken into consideration in any peace settlement. However, he hopes to save some essential elements of the Vance-Owen plan, such as demilitarisation of Bosnia, creation of a pluralistic democracy through free elections and the guarantee of human rights. Most EC foreign ministers have stressed that any peace settlement must be approved by all the parties involved, and that Bosnia must remain a separate sovereign state.</p>

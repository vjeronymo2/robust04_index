Customs, intelligence, and police have conducted  various successful raids across the country and seized huge  quantities of narcotics, including heroin and charas, during the  last one month.    In the biggest-ever haul in Lahore today, city police seized  about 1.5 tonnes of morphine powder and arrested three drug  couriers. The smuggling attempt was foiled last night in the  Bund Road area. The material was being smuggled on a truck  loaded with 497 drums; 50 of them were filled with morphine  powder. The city policy chief said the three alleged drug  couriers -- namely Haji Nisar Khan, Akhtar Khan, and Javed Khan  -- were arrested while raids are being conducted to arrest  Mahmud Butt and Mujadded Butt.    The recent antinarcotics drive is the result of the present  government's resolve to eradicate the menace from its roots.  The government has set the year 2000 as the target for complete  eradication. It is one of the eight points given by the  Pakistan People's Party in its election manifesto. A Narcotics  Control Board and the Ministry of Law are working on a draft law  which will enable the law enforcing agencies to act more  effectively. Besides other measures, the government also plans  to enhance its mass awareness campaigns.    Fifty tonnes of charas was seized recently when  antinarcotics  agencies and Pakistan Customs jointly carried out an operation  at Makran coast. In the NWFP [North-West Frontier Province], 20  kg of heroin was seized recently when it was being smuggled from  the tribal area to Peshawar for down-country dispatch. In  another raid, 12 kg of heroin was seized at Azadi Chowk post;  three persons were arrested. A large quantity of heroin and  charas was also seized at different places in Balochistan.</p>

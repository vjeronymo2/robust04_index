			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Called to book over equity accounting - Oceana faces review of its accounts over treatment of Etam profits THE FINANCIAL Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounting standards watchdog, is to review the annual report of Oceana, the South African-controlled investment company, following complaints about treatment of profits derived from Etam, the fashion retailer for which it bid unsuccessfully last year. Etam wrote to the panel in May this year following a public announcement by Oceana that it would be using equity accounting on its shareholding rather than simply including the income from Etam dividends. The complaint has been criticised by Oceana, and is seen by some as part of the continued bitterness displayed by Etam directors over the bid launched in June last year, which raised Oceana's shareholding from 24 per cent to 34.4 per cent. But it also raises wider questions over the use by companies of equity accounting, which is supposed to be permitted only where a shareholder exerts 'significant influence' over the company in which it has a holding. Etam argues that Oceana has no such power, with no board members or co-operation agreements. All it can do it block special resolutions which require a 75 per cent majority at the annual general meeting. The rules for equity accounting allow Oceana to include in its own profits the proportion of Etam's profits that its stake represents. In other words, it can include include 34.4 per cent of Etam's profits of Pounds 7.1m for the year to February 1. According to estimates prepared by accountants Robson Rhodes, advisers to Etam, that would raise Oceana's profits for the year by Pounds 2.56m to Pounds 3.45m, compared with Pounds 2.76m if it simply took the dividend income of Pounds 1.47m on its stake as an investment. However, Oceana yesterday dismissed the estimates and other objections. Mr Michael Lewis, a director, said the company's accounts - which are to be distributed to shareholders this Wednesday - fully disclosed the effects of equity accounting, which he said had the full support of its professional advisers and presented 'a more conservative set of results'. He said the accounts would show that profits would have been Pounds 580,000 less if it had not used equity accounting. They would also show goodwill written off on the Etam share purchases of Pounds 17m and unrealised gains of Pounds 9.8m on the acquisition - figures which could have been used to increase the size of the company's net assets. He said that as the largest shareholder he also believed Oceana did have a significant influence on Etam. 'We feel quite strongly that Etam's opinion is not relevant to the preparation of Oceana's accounts,' said Mr Lewis. 'We really question Etam's motives. The issue does not contribute to their business. They should concentrate on where the company is going.' But Mr Keith Miles, Etam's finance director, said: 'It's a bit rich after Oceana attacked our strategy. It infers that our excellent results were something to do with their policies.' The Financial Reporting Review Panel - one member of which is Mr John Roques, senior partner of Touche Ross, Oceana's auditor - has told Etam that it will examine Oceana's accounts once they are published. In practice, it is unlikely to reprimand a company which appears to be complying with existing regulations. But there are other examples of controversy over the influence of a failed bidder and whether they should be entitled to use equity accounting, including Lilley, the Scottish construction company which bid for Tilbury, a rival construction group, in 1989. As a result, it comes as no surprise that the Accounting Standards Board has pledged to review equity accounting later this year.</p>

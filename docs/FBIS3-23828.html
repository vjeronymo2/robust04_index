			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Aspin: "The Ministry of Finance Has </F> Reduced the Size of the Bond Issue"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Ministry of Finance had  to reduce the size of the latest state short-term bond issue  dramatically. According to an official report the Central Bank  released yesterday on the new, 10th state short-term bond issue,  the amount will be 100 billion rubles, or 30 billion less than  the previous issue. Therefore, for the first time in the history  of the short-term bond market, the Ministry of Finance has had  to reduce the amount of the bond issue to below the amount of  the previous issue. Besides this, yesterday's Central Bank  report limited the portion of the total issue available to  foreign investors.    The failure of the January primary state short-term bond  auction, when the Ministry of Finance was able to float only  three-fourths of the projected amount of the latest "portion" of  the domestic debt, forced the country's main financial agency to  take a more cautious approach in deciding the size of the  anniversary bond issue, the 10th. For the first time in the  history of the short-term bond market, the Ministry of Finance  had to reduce the amount of the latest issue to below the  previous figure, and the reduction was equivalent to 23 percent  of the originally announced amount, which is extraordinary in  itself.    Exports from KOMMERSANT-DAILY believe that the insubstantial  results of the January auction were not the only reason for the  Ministry of Finance's reduction of the bond issue. After taking  a look at the results of the Central Bank's regular surveys of  financial dealers, the organizers of the state short-term bond  market apparently decided that the Ministry of Finance had lost  the trust of many investors after the winter changes in the  government and the probable dramatic adjustments of the reform  policy. It is significant that the projected changes in the  policy of economic reform were supposed to have been approved or  rejected by the Council of Ministers at a meeting scheduled long  ago for 17 February. Judging by the dynamics of key interest  rates (particularly the current yield on Ministry of Finance  short-term bonds and foreign securities), the market was clearly  preparing for the worst. This means that next week the dealers  are more likely to conduct operations in the foreign currency  market than to invest in the Ministry of Finance's ruble bonds.  If large dealers act on these intentions, it will be extremely  difficult for the Ministry of Finance to float a debt of even  100 billion rubles on 15 February, the date of the primary  auction of the 10th issue of state short-term bonds.   <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-021-56A>           Changes in Size of Short-Term </FIG>          Experts from KOMMERSANT-DAILY believe that the slightest  hint  of any possible destabilization of the foreign currency market  this week will discourage participation in the primary auction  on 15 February because it will be inadvisable from the  standpoint of short-term speculative profits. In this case, the  Ministry of Finance probably can expect insufficient demand for  the bonds, and this will immediately reduce the liquidity of the  secondary bond market.    Besides this, yesterday's Central Bank press release set a  limit of 10 percent of the total issue (10 billion rubles) for  foreign investors. The Central Bank's technical move to regulate  the market aroused the interest of the KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts:  This is the first time that objective figures can be used as a  basis to estimate the demand for short-term state bonds among  foreign investors, because approximate estimates of the foreign  interest in these bonds have been impossible up to this time.</p>

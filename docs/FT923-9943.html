			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Court broadens scope to sue press AN APPEAL Court decision in favour of a former maid at Buckingham Palace opened the way yesterday for actions against newspapers by people who cannot afford to sue for libel. The court gave Miss Linda Joyce, a former Royal maid, the right to sue Today newspaper for malicious falsehood, rather than libel, over an article that accused her of stealing intimate letters belonging to the Princess Royal. The judges said it was 'as plain as a pikestaff' that Miss Joyce had been libelled, but said she could not afford to sue at her own expense. While legal aid was not available for defamation cases, it could be obtained for an action for malicious falsehood. Mr Mark Stephens, her solicitor, said: 'The court has remedied a great social injustice. It has finally recognised that poor people should have the right to clear their names if newspapers recklessly lie about them.' Miss Joyce of Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, who is now unemployed, had been told it would cost Pounds 40,000 to commence libel proceedings. Palace maids earn about Pounds 5,000 a year. The court said it did not expect to see people who had been defamed 'queueing up to issue writs for malicious falsehood' in future. It is more difficult to prove malicious falsehood than libel. Plaintiffs cannot recover damages for loss of reputation but only for proven financial loss or the real likelihood of financial loss. They must establish both that a statement was false and that it was published with malice or with reckless indifference to its truth or falsity. The court rejected Today's argument that Miss Joyce's action should be struck out as an abuse of process. The newspaper argued that allowing her to proceed by way of malicious falsehood denied it the defences available in libel actions and the 'absolute right' to have the issue tried by a jury. Sir Frank Rogers, chairman of the Newspaper Publishers Association, yesterday said the ruling was 'potentially very dangerous for newspapers'. Mr David Newell, deputy director of the Newspaper Society, which represents local and regional newspapers, called for a comprehensive review of media law.</p>

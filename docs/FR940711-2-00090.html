These programs will develop, implement, and evaluate multi-faceted, injury prevention and/or surveillance programs to reduce the incidence of injuries and deaths in the following areas: bicycle-related head injuries, fire-related burn injuries, motor vehicle injuries, firearm-related injuries, violence against women, and alcohol-related injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives described in ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority areas of Violent and Abusive Behavior and Unintentional Injuries.

Specifically, State public health agencies may submit applications to develop programs in EACH OR ANY of six areas:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Prevention of bicycle-related head injuries through increased usage of bicycle helmets;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Prevention of fire-related burns through increased installation and utilization of smoke detectors;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Prevention of motor vehicle injuries through increased usage of occupant protection, including seat belts, child safety seats, and air bags;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Identification of firearm-related injuries;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Identification and prevention of violence against women; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Identification and prevention of alcohol-related injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs in any of these six areas will develop, implement, and evaluate targeted activities designed to accurately measure and reduce morbidity, mortality, severity, disability, and costs associated with injuries. This funding will allow the applicant to establish or strengthen a lead capacity for prevention and control of the targeted injury (e.g., bicycle-related head injuries). It is expected that any program developed will function as a component of the public health agency's injury control program, will coordinate related activities both within the agency and within the jurisdiction, and will mobilize, seek input from, and utilize broad coalitions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

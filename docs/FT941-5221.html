			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Anti-smoking aids on NHS urged Anti-smoking aids should be available on National Health Service prescriptions and some of the money raised by tobacco tax should be used for community-based health education, the Policy Studies Institute argues in a report published today. The independent think-tank argues for a link between tobacco control strategy and family welfare policy. It says the government's policy of raising tobacco tax at twice the rate of inflation is likely to reduce cigarette consumption among the majority but has no effect on those least able to afford to smoke. Smoking is greatest among the most disadvantaged families, the report says. Nearly three-quarters of council tenants receiving means-tested benefits smoke, spending Pounds 16 a week - or Pounds 1 in every Pounds 7 of their net disposable income.</p>

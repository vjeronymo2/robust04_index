			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scottish water privatisation plan rejected THE OUTRIGHT privatisation of the Scottish water industry has been rejected by the government, at least until after the next general election. But ministers remain keen for private capital to be injected into the sector by franchising, competitive tendering for services and possibly allowing management to buy a stake in the industry. With a white paper on the future of Scottish water expected within a month, ministers are grappling with how to ensure - in the absence of an outright sale - that as little as possible of the extensive capital spending the industry requires in the next decade will come from public funds and hence count towards the public sector borrowing requirement. An estimated Pounds 5bn in capital spending is needed in the next 15 years, half to improve water quality and half for the maintenance and replacement of infrastructure. One favoured option is for a handful of publicly owned water authorities to be set up under the administration of a soon-to-be-created network of 25 to 35 unitary authorities. Under this model, private contractors could be encouraged to get involved in financing large-scale capital projects through the offer of long-term franchises to provide services such as sewage treatment and water purification to the authorities. With about Pounds 240m a year already earmarked by the Scottish Office for capital spending over the next three years, ministers would have scope to offer public money for such projects, possibly on a joint-venture basis. The Treasury would be anxious for private investors in such cases to take responsibility for commercial risks such as cost overruns, enabling public liabilities to be fixed. This blueprint would have the further advantage of restructuring the industry in such a way that would allow it to build up a financial track record, easing the path to a possible sale after the next general election. Scottish water is currently owned and administered by regional councils, with the result that 100 per cent of the industry's liabilities must come out of the public purse. A bill covering the reorganisation of both the local authorities and the water industry is expected to be introduced in the next parliamentary session beginning in November.</p>

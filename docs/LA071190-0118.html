			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> DOING FAIR: The county fair (B3) opens today at noon for a 12-day run, and  officials are expecting last year's $1.7-million revenue record to fall. . . .  But the fair board's richest income sources have nothing to do with the fair.  Last year the board netted $4 million from its horse race meeting at Los  Alamitos and $3.2 million from swap meets.

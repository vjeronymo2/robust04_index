			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japanese banks put off facing up to bad loans JAPANESE banks will avoid confronting their bad loan problems in accounts to be released for the year ended March, in spite of a Bank of Japan recommendation that they should be more open about their loan losses. Leading banks are still determined to give the impression that each institution's bad loan burden is much the same, and even the trust banks, particularly hard hit by bad property loans, plan to report net profits for the year to March. The seven trust banks are expected to report, on average, a halving of net profits. The most vulnerable, Nippon Trust Bank, will announce a net profit of around Y2bn (Dollars 17.9m), compared to Y2.3bn in the previous period, banking sources said. Sanwa Bank and Mitsubishi Bank are expected to report net profits of more than Y60bn, down from Y102bn previously and Y84bn in 1990-91. Sumitomo Bank is likely to have a net profit of Y14bn, compared to Y109.8bn, after having written off Y100bn of exposure to Itoman, the dissolved trading house and speculator. The trust banks said yesterday they would be able to cover stock appraisal losses with increased business profits. But some banks would almost certainly be forced to report a loss without a favourable change in accounting regulations allowed late last year by the ministry of finance. In previous years, trust banks have only been allowed to report interest already received on loans from their trust account, but this year, they can report delayed payments from troubled clients as interest earned, as long as the payment is not more than six months overdue. Ms Alicia Ogawa, of Salomon Brothers, estimates that 40 per cent of the banks' trust account loans were made to property and financial companies, many of which have been badly bruised by stock and property market collapses. Ms Ogawa said: 'It is clear that Japanese banks, unlike American banks, are going to take a long-term approach to dealing with their problems. It is very difficult to tell one bank from another because you can't really see how exposed they are.' Officially, the leading 21 Japanese banks had Y12,300bn in property-related non-performing loans at the end of September, and an estimated Y14,000bn to Y15,000bn at the end of March. However, the banks' actual exposure is unofficially estimated at Y30,000bn, as the official figure does not include affiliates' problem loans or the impact of interest rate cuts, sometimes to zero, for troubled clients.</p>

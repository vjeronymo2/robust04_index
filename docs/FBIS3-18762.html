According to the minister, the Belgian Army has reached the  limit of its possibilities. It may well be that UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali has great admiration for the work done by  the Belgian UN troops in Somalia, Rwanda, Croatia, and Bosnia,  but other countries also must be approached for once, said the  minister.    The minister was reacting to a report in the British SUNDAY  TIMES claiming that, once again, Belgium will be asked to  contribute together with Great Britain, France, and Sweden,  another 5,000 UN troops for Bosnia. That is roughly half the  figure requested by General Michael Rose, UN commander in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. He believes these extra troops are  necessary to maintain the cease-fires in Sarajevo and central  Bosnia in the long term. Following fierce debates within the  British Government, London said it would be prepared to send an  additional 1,200 troops to Bosnia to reinforce the 2,500 British  troops already there. However, London wants British soldiers to  be accompanied by UN troops sent by other Western countries.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Christel Tardif: "European Certification of the </F> Airbus A321"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION  MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] Nine months after its first flight, the elongated  version of the A320 equipped with V2500 engines is ready for its  first delivery to Lufthansa, scheduled for 27 January.    The two A321 flight prototypes equipped with V2500 reactors  supplied by International Aero Engines (IAE) had accumulated 605  flight hours on 17 December 1993, when the aircraft was approved  by the European certification authority (JAA). This paved the  way for a first delivery to Lufthansa, the German airlines, next  27 January.    The other two flight prototypes, equipped with CFM56-5B  engines, already total 400 flight hours and are still being  tested in Toulouse. This second A321 version should be approved  by the JAA some time next March. JAA approval should occur  simultaneously with that of U.S. certification authorities  (FAA), for versions equipped with either engine.    Alitalia, who bought 40 A321 equipped with CFM engines  should  receive its first aircraft immediately after this certification,  late in March.    The A321 is the elongated version of the A320, which means  that it has a longer fuselage, as well as modified flaps and  more powerful thrust engines (133.4 kilonewtons [kN] for the  V2530-A5 engine, and 137.9 kN for the CFM56-5B2 engine, i.e.  respectively 30,000 and 31,200 lbs of thrust). It also includes  modifications enabling it to carry 185 passengers (or a maximum  takeoff payload of 83 tons or 183,000 lbs) over up to 4,250 km  (2,300 nautical miles) and at a cruising speed of up to Mach  0.82, while benefiting from the experience of an aircraft that  has been in service since 1988.    The Airbus Industrie backlog of orders includes 153 A321  ordered so far by 11 clients. Deutsche Airbus, which makes them,  has already assembled eight aircraft (including the four  prototypes).  <H5>  Production Authorization </H5>   Simultaneously with the certification of the A321 IAE  version, Airbus Industrie was just authorized to produce this  entire aircraft line by French and German certification  authorities (the DGAC [General Directorate of Civil Aviation]  and the LBA [Germany's equivalent of the FAA]). This  authorization will enable the consortium to complete on its own  the compliance statement procedures for each unit produced in  Toulouse or Hamburg. This obligation must be fulfilled before  the certification authorities of the country of origin (in this  case France and Germany) will issue the aircraft airworthiness  certificate required for delivery. Until now, these procedures  were completed by Bureau Veritas, a body approved by the DGAC.</p>

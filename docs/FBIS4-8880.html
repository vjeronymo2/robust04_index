			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Djordje Gajdosevic] </F>   [Text] [Begin recording] [Gajdosevic] An agreement on  separation and creation of a buffer zone between the republic of  Serbian Krajina [RSK] and Croatia in the part of the territory  controlled by the Slavonija-Baranja Corps has been signed on the  premises of UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in Nemetin today.  The UNPROFOR representatives have established that heavy arms  had been withdrawn to the appropriate distance and that there  were no obstacles to the functioning of the agreement signed in  Zagreb.    [Dusan Loncar, general in the Serbian army of the Krajina]  In a military and tactical sense, by withdrawing to a distance  of 1.5 km in some places, we have primarily safeguarded the  safety of our residents, so that nobody within the reach of the  infantry arms would be endangered, which does not mean that a  sort of demobilization is starting now. On the contrary. The  basic stance of all officers and members of the  Slavonija-Baranja Corps is that we must continue strengthening  our combat readiness.    [Gajdosevic] The UNPROFOR representatives did not hide their  satisfaction over the signing of the agreement, emphasizing that  their task is not over yet.    [Vim Van Dyke, commander of Sector East, in English with  superimposed translation] UNPROFOR in the Sector East is ready  to help the sides in the implementation of the agreement.    [Gajdosevic] The representatives of the Serbian army of the  republic of Serbian Krajina emphasized that the village of  Mirkovici is mostly under the control of the army of the  republic of Serbian Krajina.    [Vojislav Stojkovic, colonel in the Serbian Army of Krajina]  One of the most difficult and most controversial points in the  zone of responsibility of the Slavonija-Baranja Corps was  precisely Mirkovici. I think that through these talks we have  succeeded to resolve this issue and, therefore, the separating  line will not be such as drawn in Annex D of the cease-fire  agreement, signed in Zagreb on 29 March, but will be  considerably more favorable for the residents of Mirkovci.    [Gajdosevic] The Serbian village of Karadzicevo has ended up  in the so-called security zone. However, it is emphasized here  that the Serbian people will be safe. Beside UNPROFOR, 75 of  our policemen will take care of them, while the army of the  republic of Serbian Krajina will be 1 km away. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: M&amp;G share scheme criticism unjustified Sir, The M&amp;G Group's proposal for renewing its executive share option scheme has attracted a certain amount of interest and ill-informed comment from some quarters because it does not conform in one respect to the joint guidelines of the National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of British Insurers. We are firmly of the view that performance benchmarks for the exercise of options may not be in the best interests of shareholders. In fact, the guidelines themselves acknowledge the difficulties of prescribing a measurement of performance and have sidestepped the issue by passing responsibility to the remuneration committees of public companies. M&amp;G has always been a strong supporter of employee share schemes as they provide a powerful motivation for management. We like the identity of interests between executives and their shareholders which options particularly provide and we like to see executives' interest in option shares held long-term. Furthermore, we like to see options dribbled out in relatively small amounts over a period of years. Not only do we consider that the application of guidelines is inappropriate for the management of our own business, but we feel that they are misguided in respect of a broad range of British companies. M&amp;G has substantial investments in a large number of medium and small companies in a wide range of industries. We believe it is impracticable to introduce fair benchmarks for these companies in all their different circumstances at a time when the process of establishing the role and responsibility of remuneration committees is in its early stages. Remuneration committees should focus on the effectiveness of the executive directors and on their individual contributions. Options and, indeed, their packages should be reviewed in this light. Our main concerns regarding benchmarks are: 1. There is a danger they could influence management to act in their own short-term interests rather than in the long-term interests of the company. They could, therefore, lead to a conflict of interest. 2. We would argue that, just because a company has, over a given period, performed below some performance yardstick, this is no guarantee that management has not worked hard and, indeed, performed well in the circumstances. In periods of recession manufacturing companies in particular will find it difficult to meet many benchmarks. The recent recession, which has had a very severe impact on the financial performance of many well-managed companies, illustrates this point vividly. 3. Benchmarks may tend to encourage executives to exercise their options earlier for fear of being locked out at a later date. We would much prefer and, indeed, encourage management to retain their interests in their company for as long as possible. 4. It is extremely difficult to arrive at a satisfactory benchmark. A benchmark tied to earnings would seem to be most inappropriate and we have all seen how earnings per share can be manipulated through changes in accounting procedures. Benchmarks tied to relative performance against the index or sub-section of the index are again full of difficulties. 5. There is a real danger that some companies, in their search for benchmarks, will choose guidelines that are too demanding and which will result in unwise corporate strategies being pursued, for example Burton. At M&amp;G we are proud to have played a leading role in the development of good corporate governance over the past 30 years and we shall continue to speak out with an independent voice on what we consider to be in the best interests of British industry. There is no such thing as a perfect share option scheme but we believe that benchmarks will create more problems than they solve. The NAPF, in its effort to eliminate unearned reward in a few cases, is in serious danger of throwing the baby out with the bath water.

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Sid urged to apply for share deals sans frontieres FRENCH farce yesterday took to the City of London to make the serious point that British punters could profit as France privatises up to FFr360bn (Pounds 42bn) worth of state-owned companies - thanks to European Community rules. A woman dressed up as a French onion seller handed out leaflets offering this advice to commuters hurrying to work along Threadneedle Street. The stunt was encouraging retail investors to exploit the European Community's regulations which outlaw discrimination of any kind against the nationals of one member state who apply for shares in the privatisations of other member states. This makes Sid eligible to apply for shares in an estimated Pounds 17bn of companies due to be privatised in EC countries this year. Of this total the French programme is one of the biggest and most attractive. The leaflets were offering 'free advice' to UK nationals interested in buying shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, due to be privatised this month. The government is committed to transferring at least 21 companies to the private sector over the next five years. The French economy ministry confirmed that retail investors who are EC nationals are eligible to apply for shares in the tranche of equity available to private investors. Applicants must have bank accounts in France. Under UK law the Rhone-Poulenc securities may only be offered for sale to professional investors, although private investors are not prevented from taking the initiative to apply through a bank or broker in France. The stunt may rebound on its instigator, Mr Roger Trotman, a chartered accountant and the sole trader behind Sutton-based Gloucester Trotman. Last night the Institute of Chartered Accountants was studying his 'investment advert': 'We are looking at it from a regulatory point of view,' a spokesman said. Mr Trotman, who has formed a link with a French stockbroker to ensure clients experience a smooth transaction, said he was not offering to sell shares: 'I am simply offering a basic background of the details of the offer and who to contact to take it further.' This service was free but anyone who chose to use the French broker would face administration charges, he said.</p>

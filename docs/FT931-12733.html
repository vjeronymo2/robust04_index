			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Geneva talks risk being victim THE international consensus so laboriously built up on the former Yugoslavia, and which has invested the Geneva peace talks with the required weight and authority, risks being one of the many victims of the renewed Serbo-Croat fighting in the enclave of Krajina. All the main powers have so far backed the diplomatic negotiations on Bosnia-Hercegovina, chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, as the best way to reach a settlement, but the past few days have revealed cracks in the common front. The Croat offensive to reclaim some former territory occupied by the Serbs in the 1991 war has simultaneously deprived the Geneva talks of their momentum, led countries such as France and Britain, with peace-keeping forces in Croatia and Bosnia, to re-examine their role, and reawakened old alliances like those between Russia and Serbia. Confusion has been compounded by the agonising reappraisal of US policy towards the former Yugoslavia, and Bosnia in particular, by President Bill Clinton's new administration. If, as widely reported, Washington is leaning towards lifting the embargo on arms deliveries to the Bosnian Moslems, currently applied against all the warring factions in Bosnia, such a step has become more controversial following the Croatian attack in Krajina. Traditionally sensitive about what it has always seen as the western powers' bias against the Serbs, Russia has become more outspoken in its demands for a more even-handed approach. Moscow's warning that it might ask for UN sanctions against Croatia shows how the wind is blowing. The least that can be said is that Russia will oppose a selective lifting of the arms embargo which would favour the Bosnian Moslems in their civil war against the Bosnian Serbs, as long as punitive action was not taken by the international community against the Croats. Mr Vance is doing his utmost to persuade the new US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, that the lifting of the arms embargo, let alone direct military intervention, would be a recipe for disaster and lead to worse fighting. Not even the two powers which have contributed most to the UN protection force in Croatia and Bosnia, France and Britain, are entirely on the same wavelength. Both governments have said their forces (5,000 French and 2,400 British) are there only in a peacekeeping role. But the loss of several soldiers' lives has led both governments to send naval task forces, including aircraft carriers, to the Adriatic. The French government has come under pressure from public opinion to reconsider its opposition to military intervention in Bosnia, following the killing of 11 French soldiers since the UN started operations there. By contrast, British public opinion appears to favour withdrawal of British forces from Bosnia, following the death of one British soldier. The co-chairmen of the Geneva conference believe the Croatian and Serbian leaders will still try to limit the fighting. But their mediation efforts will have to show results rapidly if the peace process is not to collapse.</p>

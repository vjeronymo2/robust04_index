			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / World Trade News: China seeks end to barter with Russia China and Russia will hold a round of high-level trade talks this week, with Beijing hoping to phase out barter trade in favour of cash exchanges, the official China Daily said yesterday, Reuter reports from Beijing. The Sino-Russian Joint Commission on Economic, Trade and Technical Co-operation meeting, which begins today will be co-chaired by Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin. The three-day talks occur as Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin prepares for his first state visit to Beijing from May 26 to 29. The China Daily quoted foreign trade officials as saying that one of the primary goals of this commission meeting would be to stress Beijing's desire to see barter trade gradually phased out along the border in favour of cash. While up to 35 per cent of Sino-Russian trade is now conducted on a cash basis, the rest involves the physical transfer of barter goods. 'Two-way trade should mainly be done through cash exchanges,' Mr Geng Xuncai, deputy director general of the European department at the trade ministry told the China Daily. 'Both sides should push their large companies to the forefront of trade and investment activities,' he said. 'In so doing, the potential for further growth of two-way trade can be tapped.' Sino-Russian trade was valued at about Dollars 7.7bn last year, an increase of 31 per cent over 1992, according to official figures. The joint commission meeting will also discuss broadening technical co-operation, with China eager to tap Russian expertise in such fields as aviation, space technology, the chemical industry and machine building.</p>

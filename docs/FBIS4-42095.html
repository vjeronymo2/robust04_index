			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "American `U-Turn' on Bosnia"] </F>   [Text] Severely taken to task in the debate dominating the  European election campaign, the French Government and the  president have found a powerful ally in Bill Clinton, who  recently took a stand against the lifting of the embargo on  Bosnian arms sales. For the first time, the U.S. President has  publicly come out against the view held by Congress, the media,  and the American people. Just like the French and British  authorities, on Wednesday, 25 May, he stood up to this "very  simplistic idea."    At the same time, in Paris, Francois Mitterrand was once  again explaining to the government the reasons why he is opposed  to any lifting of the embargo -- in substance, because he does  not want to exacerbate the war. At the same time, too, on the  banks of Lake Annecy, new negotiations started to try and  persuade Muslims, Serbs, and Croats to accept a territorial  compromise and put an end to the conflict.    In reality, leaving aside the media-oriented or political  ambitions of the various participants in the debate in France, a  real race is under way in which morality is taking something of  a back seat. This is a race between obtaining a political  settlement, by its nature unfair, for the partitioning of  Bosnia, or aggravating the conflict. If the negotiators,  currently in Talloires and due to move to Geneva on 13 June, do  manage to impose a settlement on the three parties, then the  issue of the embargo will naturally no longer arise.    If, on the other hand, the major powers again fail, then it  is well-known that Paris and London will start to pull out their  blue helmets and thus trigger an acceleration of violence on the  ground. In this event, political leaders could no longer  continue to avoid the issue: Can we prevent an victimized party  whom we no longer protect from defending itself against an  overarmed aggressor?    Nevertheless, this question must be framed correctly. A UN  Security Council decision (which at the moment looks unlikely)  to lift the arms embargo would apply to the whole of Bosnia, and  thus to all the belligerents. It goes without saying that this  will not have the effect of restoring the "balance" between the  forces present.    Although the U.S. President's U-turn is quite spectacular,  we  may still wonder if it will in fact have any effect on the  ground, and whether Bill Clinton's position disclosed on  Wednesday will put an end to the suspicions (to use a euphemism)  that Washington is supplying arms to the Muslims. As for the  negotiations, the Muslims, as the main victims of the conflict,  do not appear to have many illusions about their chances of  obtaining a viable territorial agreement. This is clear from  the initial rumblings from the Talloires meeting and from the  fact that they have put increased military pressure on the Serbs  in the north of the country.</p>

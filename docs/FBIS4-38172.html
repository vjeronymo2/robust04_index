			<p>BFN     [Text] A general commercial strike was announced in  Jericho today, and most of the city's stores remained closed.  The strike was called to protest the continued incarceration of  Palestinians in Israeli prisons. The Jericho strike is the  first since the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] handed over the area  to the Palestinian police.    Also today, Jericho was re-opened to tourists.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Technology: The games and how to play them The stranger's face was familiar. It was Peko-chan, a popular character who has advertised sweets for Fujiya, a confectionery maker, for as long as most Japanese people can remember. 'Hello,' Peko-chan said. 'Glad to meet you.' 'Glad to meet you too,' the monster-like character we had chosen to represent us on screen said. 'Where are you right now?' 'I'm at home,' Peko-chan replied 'Where are you?' 'We're in Akihabara,' we replied. 'In Fujitsu's showroom.' We had met Peko-chan at the Oracle Fountain, a popular meeting place in Habitat, a virtual world of the computer screen where humans meet behind digital masks to socialise anonymously. Habitat is accessible through a multimedia network Nifty-Serve, operated by a subsidiary of Fujitsu. The virtual society boasts an active community on computer with a population of 9,000 at the latest count, many of whom have come to know each other well, but only on screen. The idea of creating a virtual society came from the studio of George Lucas, the US film director of Star Wars fame, but was licensed and marketed for the first time by Fujitsu. The goings on at Habitat, a society whose citizens can assume whatever sex, name, history or personality they want and where nobody has to disclose his true self, have offered such a revealing illustration of human behaviour that many behavioural scientists have joined the community for their studies, says Takashi Ochiai, general manager of Fujitsu's personal services division in Tokyo. Everyone who becomes a citizen in the Habitat community gets an avatar, or computer figure, which is either male or female, as well as several hundred tokens as spending money. The avatar's head is interchangeable and heads can be purchased in vending machines throughout the community. His pockets are large enough to store several heads. If a citizen of Habitat wants to assume several personalities he can do so simply by keeping a stock of heads in his pocket and pulling out a different head whenever he wants to become someone else. In the initial stages of Habitat, the heads presented one of the biggest social problems. Unscrupulous characters would run away with other people's heads left briefly on the road as they were changing them. More happily, several Habitat citizens have been married on screen, though so far only one couple has been united in real life. Residents' tax for Habitat citizens is Y300 (Pounds 1.90) a month and communications costs are modest at a little over Y10 a minute. But the attractions of life in Habitat, which offers 400 locations for inhabitants to roam, are such that enthusiasts can spend hours and several tens of thousands of yen living in this virtual world. Peko-chan, a citizen of Habitat for the past four years, told us that he comes to Habitat, or logs on to the system through his computer, every day for about one to five hours at a time. 'I usually come at night,' Peko-chan says. 'I like to talk to people in Habitat, because I can express myself better,' he explains. Peko-chan has met several people through Habitat. He has met some of his Habitat friends outside the computer world and chats regularly with them on the telephone. 'My phone bills are my biggest problem,' he says. Chiaki Sonoyama has been invited to the country home of Senshu Sakuragi, the head of a famous family which has been carrying on the tradition of Japanese dance. But before Chiaki arrives at the Sakuragi home, Yosen, the eldest of the three Sakuragi children and heir apparent, is poisoned and dies. A writer of mystery novels herself, Chiaki sets out to try to solve the puzzle of who murdered Yosen and why. Like the popular American computer game, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, the player of this multimedia game must choose his own clues and follow his own instincts to solve the mystery murder. The drama takes different twists and turns depending on the player's judgment about what may have happened. What is appealing to a Japanese audience is that 'The Murder at Kurama' uses live video footage, with popular stars playing the parts and filmed settings, including scenes of the ancient capital Kyoto, where the drama unfolds. In order to add depth and motivate players to try different options, the producers of the game have provided different conclusions depending on how the game is played. As with this mystery, live video footage is increasingly being used in advanced video games. Matsushita's 3DO Real boasts clear moving video images that are made possible with the use of a 32-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computing (Risc) chip, and two especially powerful semiconductor chips that have been incorporated into the machine to process the graphics. Compared with semiconductor chips in conventional games machines, 'the difference is similar to that between having a tunnel dug by three normal people and having it dug out by three body-builders,' explains Kenichi Tsumura at Matsushita. 'The power that 3DO Real has to make pictures is about 50 times as great as normal games machines.' Unfortunately, crisp video graphics are difficult to attain in full motion so the effect is somewhat jarred pictures when characters are in action. But Tsumura notes that this will be improved when Matsushita brings out an adaptor to bring the full-motion video up to the MPEG-I standard.</p>

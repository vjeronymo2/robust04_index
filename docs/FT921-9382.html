			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Fears for future of ITV's schedule ITV faces a serious threat to its Pounds 540m-a-year programme schedule that could lead to the bankruptcy of some companies, a senior ITV executive warned yesterday, Raymond Snoddy writes. Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and managing director of London Weekend Television, based his fears on the recession and the high levels of bids for new franchises. He said some of the high bidders had assumed the recession would end last year and had forecast a 10 per cent increase in advertising this year. He added: 'The choice might well be to bankrupt some companies or reduce the spending on the schedule.' Both would be a real threat to programme quality.</p>

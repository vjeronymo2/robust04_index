			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Crowded commuters unmoved by scheme COMMUTERS ON Britain's worst railway line were yesterday unimpressed at joining the chartering classes. Those on the crowded 16.40 London Fenchurch Street to Stanford-le-Hope in Essex wanted a good service, not discounts on overcrowded, unreliable trains. The line from London to Shoeburyness via Southend has been given the lowest targets to meet under the passenger's charter - targets it met last year. As the 16:40 rattled through south Essex, commuters were reading leaflets about the charter. Few seemed impressed, although one said: 'At least they're trying to do something.' Miss Maria Wickenden, a telecommunications supervisor from Stanford-le-Hope, was lucky enough to get a seat. She said the line's reputation for timekeeping was so bad that some employers will not hire people who commute on it. Yesterday morning had been typical - the 7.01 to London was cancelled and the next train was late. She arrived in London at 8.50 - 20 minutes late. The cancellation cost her Pounds 5.30 because she could not use her weekly discount ticket. Mr Terry Tubby, a self-employed roofer from Aveley, Essex, said: 'The charter has been set up to help them, not us. It's easier than sorting out the real problems that ordinary working people face every day. They don't know what it's like, those nobs in their chauffeur-driven cars. 'At the moment the service is not too bad. The only problem is there are no seats. There's nothing in the charter about that.' The 16.40 pulled in to Stanford-le-Hope on time.</p>

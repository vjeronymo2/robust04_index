			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Five-fold surge in profit at Nokia Nokia, Europe's biggest manufacturer of mobile telephones, yesterday announced a near five-fold increase in profits in the first eight months of the year as its spectacular growth continued. The Finnish group reported pre-tax profits during the period of FM2.29bn (Dollars 494.9m), up from FM466m at the same stage last year. Net sales rose to FM18.2bn from FM14.1bn, but Nokia said this represented a 40 per cent increase in turnover when exchange rates and restructuring were taken into account. The result, driven by fast-growing demand for Nokia's telecommunications network equipment and its mobile handsets, was ahead of most expectations. Mr Jorma Ollila, chief executive, said the outlook for the rest of the year was also favourable. Nokia's ordinary shares jumped 5 per cent on the Helsinki stock exchange to close at FM632 after starting the day at FM600. Sales of mobile telephones surged 64 per cent, underscoring Nokia's position as the world's second largest manufacturer of mobiles after Motorola of the US. The mobile division's sales reached FM5.03bn in the first eight months, compared with FM3.68bn in the same period last year. Turnover in the telecommunications division, meanwhile, jumped by more than 50 per cent to FM4.22bn from FM2.74bn. Nokia said growth was strongest in Europe - mainly in Germany and the UK - and in the Asia-Pacific region. Mr Ollila said he anticipated the world market for mobile telephones would continue to show volume growth of between 50 and 80 per cent for at least the next two years. 'We are concerned that strong growth like that can have its problems - the organisation can become very stretched. But we are not taking every contract; we are very careful that we can deliver what we have promised,' he said. Since taking over at Nokia two years ago, Mr Ollila has focused the group, once a sprawling industrial conglomerate, on telecommunications. A problem continues to be its lossmaking consumer and industrial electronics division, which saw sales fall in the period to FM4.1bn and which returned a further loss. (Nokia does not give details of divisional profits in interim results.) Mr Ollila said the division should return to profit in the last four months. He intended to keep it within the group, partly to help Nokia explore opportunities in multimedia products. However, Nokia announced it was considering floating off most of its 80 per cent holding in Nokia Tyres on the Helsinki stock exchange. The company is also 20 per cent-owned by SP Tyres UK, part of the Sumitomo Group. It had net sales in 1993 of FM862m. Nokia said it would invest FM310m in expanding production facilities in Finland.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Incomprehensible and unfair tax proposals Sir, More than 400 pages of tax legislation have just been published affecting almost all businesses in the UK. While it would hypocritical of me to complain about the necessity for most businesses to seek professional guidance, I must point out that on any grounds the new tax law is over-complex and even the professionals cannot understand it. I can give two examples. The transitional proposals in Schedule 18 on the new system of taxing more than 3m self-employed people are incomprehensible and inexplicable. They are also glaringly unfair. Similarly, the treatment of foreign exchange and other financial instruments, which affect a large number of companies trading outside the UK, is very difficult to present clearly to a businessman. This is bad enough. But there were matters announced in the Budget that are deregulatory. One was the firm commitment to relax audit requirements for some limited companies. This repeal, which might decrease the workload, has no draft legislation as yet. The Department of Trade and Industry advises that a further consultative document will be issued shortly. Our clients are unable to understand why their companies pay more taxes immediately but cannot benefit from audit relaxation from December 31 1993. Another regulatory matter was to move the National Insurance base into alignment with the Pay-As-You-Earn tax base. This is being dealt with by further consultation and legislation which, if anything, widens the divide with no clear time stated. Am only I disillusioned at how the government has ignored the need for fair legislation, simply expressed?

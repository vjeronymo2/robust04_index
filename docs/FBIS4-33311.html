			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Honduran-flagged  ships were found carrying fuel to Haiti, thus violating the  embargo the UN Security Council imposed on that country,  authorities admitted today. Carlos Sosa Coello, chairman of the  Chairman of the National Drug Interdiction Committee, told  NOTIMEX "there are Honduran ships that illegally smuggle Chinese  citizens into the United States and others transport fuel to  Haiti."    Sosa Coello charged that ships registered in Honduras were  also detected in international waters carrying drugs. The  Honduran National Congress is getting ready to discuss the  existing Merchant Marine Law, through which a government leases  its flag to foreign businessman who request it. The military  controls the merchant marine, and the civilian government  receives no income from the registering of foreign ships.    The military does not provide or report on the amounts of  money they earn for leasing the national flag, but sources at  the Congress said the business could yield close to $40 million  a year. "We have an open registry of merchant vessels in  Honduras, from which every one profits except the treasury,"  Sosa Coello indicated.    Nelman Sabillon, secretary of the Maritime Commission of the  Foreign Ministry, said that since 1993 ships flying the Honduran  flag have violated the then "partial" agreement to put a  blockade on Haiti.    The U.S. Coast Guard Service informed the Honduran  Government  that in 1993 it intercepted Honduran-flag vessels carrying fuel  to Haiti. Bilateral agreements allow the United States to  intercept and come aboard Honduran vessels and aircraft in  international waters within the efforts the two countries are  making to fight drug trafficking. Sabillon also disclosed that  the previous month Japanese authorities filed a complaint  against the Honduran-flag vessel Montana for carrying 60 Chinese  nationals who were trying to enter the United States. Honduras  has to deal with complaints from the United States, Japan,  Canada, and France that Honduran-flag vessels are fishing  illegally in their territorial waters to the detriment of their  fishing resources, the Foreign Ministry official indicated.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Rail charter hits funding problem BRITISH RAIL and the Department of Transport are this week likely to run into criticisms that the long-delayed Passenger's Charter, due out on Wednesday, has turned into a damp squib. Earlier intentions of giving passengers an expanded system of compensation for late and cancelled trains have foundered because neither BR nor the government is prepared to fund it. Total compensation for late and cancelled trains is unlikely to exceed the Pounds 6.5m in cash, travel vouchers and season-ticket extensions handed out last year. The main effect of the charter will be that BR's arbitrary and semi-secret system of compensation will be restructured and publicised so that people will know whether they are eligible for refunds. BR has argued that without government funding an enhanced compensation scheme could be financed only by higher fares or cuts in railway investment. The Treasury, however, was not prepared to underwrite it. Instead, a watered-down scheme will come into effect from May. The main points in the modified scheme are: Compensation arrangements for people making individual train journeys (as distinct from commuters) will be virtually unchanged. If a train is cancelled or delayed unreasonably passengers will not receive compensation automatically, but will be invited to submit claims if they miss appointments or incur costs. A self-financing 'insurance' scheme will be introduced, with business passengers in mind. By paying a reservation fee in advance, travellers will be entitled to an automatic refund of probably a third of their fare if their train is cancelled or badly delayed. Commuters will receive extensions to their season tickets for days on which there is no effective service because of snow, industrial action or other factors. Commuters on poorly performing Network SouthEast routes will face lower annual fare increases than commuters on recently modernised lines. Each Network SouthEast route will be given its own target for punctuality and reliability. If performance falls short of this, commuters with season tickets will be given a discount on renewal. A similar scheme will apply for Regional Railways commuters, but the performance target will be set for the sector as a whole. The RMT railworkers' union dismissed the charter as 'a political gimmick'. It said that the solution to poor services was to give BR the financial resources to improve quality.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Loyalist Ceasefire: Business chiefs and politicians welcome move The Confederation of British Industry in Ulster and business leaders in the province welcomed yesterday's loyalist ceasefire announcement. Mr Nigel Smyth, director of the CBI in the province, said: 'We have to welcome any statement that reflects people's will to stop violence, and hope it is permanent.' Mr Denis Galway, senior vice-president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the ceasefire would contribute to business confidence, tourist development and international investment. Mr Frank Caddy, chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade, said city traders were looking forward to attracting more leading high street names. The atmosphere in Belfast city centre had changed since the IRA called its ceasefire and he expected it to get even better. 'The pace has slowed down, people are stopping and looking, not rushing in to buy and get out,' he said. Mr John Hume, leader of the SDLP, welcomed the announcement as 'a very good day for the people of Northern Ireland, a day which they deserve. Let us now put the past behind us and work together to build a future we can all be proud of.' Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the Ulster Unionist party, welcomed the move and said it was clear that the loyalist paramilitaries had been listening to his party leader Mr James Molyneaux when he said that there had been no sell-out to republicans and no shift in the government attitude to the future constitutional position of the province. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP, said there would have to be an election before the fringe loyalist political parties and Sinn Fein could be invited to political talks. He said: 'We are dealing here with very small political parties and we are dealing with the question of whether they do in fact have an electoral mandate. In another way Sinn Fein have the same problem.' The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, welcomed 'the fact that people are not going to continue murdering'. But he totally rejected any suggestion of talks involving former paramilitaries on either side. 'There's nobody can get to the negotiating table because they've used a gun and murdered people,' he said. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, welcomed the loyalist ceasefire and urged Mr Major to 'stop fumbling with this peace process' and to accelerate the government's response.</p>

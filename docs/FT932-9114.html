			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Company insolvencies continue to fall COMPANY INSOLVENCIES in England and Wales fell in the first three months of this year for the second quarter in succession, figures from British Chambers of Commerce showed yesterday. Seasonally adjusted company compulsory liquidations and creditors' voluntary liquidations were 5,705 for the first quarter of 1993 compared with 6,029 in the last quarter of last year and 5,796 in the first quarter of last year. But the proportion of company insolvencies to total businesses has not declined and remains at its highest recorded level. It stood at 2.6 per cent of active trading companies and 2.2 per cent of all companies for the first quarter of 1993, the third successive quarter at those levels. 'The specious reaction is that this is a great relief and will relieve the pressure of bad debts on other businesses,' said Ms Fiona Johnson from the British chambers. 'We were surprised that the failure rate is not higher.' 'But if you look a little deeper, the proportion of active trading businesses remains high,' she said. 'The figure is still unacceptably high.' The chambers said the figures nonetheless provided some evidence that the economic tide is turning, and provide support for business and employee and consumer confidence. Total company insolvencies were 24,334 for the 12 months to the end of March 1993. The figures come from records at Companies House and the Department of Trade and Industry's Insolvency Ser-vice. Seasonally adjusted individual insolvencies continued to rise. They were 10,233 for the first quarter of the year compared with 9,795 in the final quarter of 1992 and 8,773 in the first quarter of last year. The absolute decline in company failures corresponds with figures in the last few months on receivership and administration appointments compiled by accountants Touche Ross from the official London and Edinburgh Gazettes. Traditionally it takes 18 months from the beginning of economic recovery before corporate failures decline as companies seek new working capital from their bankers. The decline in the figures may indicate a more res-ponsive attitude from the banks. The figures also echo figures released last week from the Lord Chancellor's Office for winding-up petitions. They showed 4,608 petitions for the first quarter of this year, down 3.5 per cent on the first quarter last year.</p>

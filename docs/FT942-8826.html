			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Chinese PM attacks US over dissidents: Deadline near for Clinton decision on trade status Prime Minister Li Peng of China has maintained Beijing's tough stance on human rights, accusing the US of giving undue weight to the views of a 'tiny number' of dissident Chinese. Mr Li told Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, former US national security security adviser, that China resented interference in its internal affairs and would not yield to outside pressures. 'Foreign statesmen will surely make mistakes,' he said, 'if they base their understanding of China merely on the words or views of a tiny number of Chinese to the exclusion of the interests and wishes of all other Chinese people.' The Chinese official was speaking just weeks before a deadline for President Bill Clinton to decide whether to extend China's 'most favoured nation' trading status in the US. The administration last year called for 'overall, significant improvement' in Beijing's human rights behaviour as a pre-condition for renewal of China's privileged trade access to the US market. Mr Brzezinski, who was in charge of the 1978 negotiations leading to establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing, was reported to be carrying a message to the Chinese leadership urging further concessions on human rights before the 3 June MFN deadline. Pressures are building on Mr Clinton from human rights groups and the US Congress to impose penalties on China. But Mr Clinton has indicated that he favours MFN renewal. China, meanwhile, continues to exert pressure on its dissident community with further detentions and little sign that its most prominent political prisoner, Mr Wei Jingsheng, is about to be released. Mr Wei, who served 14 years of a 15-year sentence for counter-revolutionary actions before his release last year, was detained in April and accused of 'new crimes'. His family fears that Mr Wei may be facing another long jail sentence. China yesterday briefly detained leading student dissident Mr Wang Dan after he met a US television reporting team. He was released by Beijing police after being held for an hour. Mr Wang was taken from his home after meeting reporters from the American NBC television network. His residence is under constant surveillance by Beijing's public security. China, in its continuing game of 'cat and mouse' with the Clinton administration over MFN, has recently released two high-profile dissidents on health grounds. They were Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, two of the so-called 'black hands' behind the 1989 pro-democracy protests. These releases were seen as gestures to placate US human rights concerns.</p>

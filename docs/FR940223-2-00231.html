Background.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The DOT Research and Special Programs Administration, Office of Hazardous Materials Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (OHMS), currently carries out a national safety program to protect against the risks to life,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health, property, and the environment inherent in the transportation of hazardous materials by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water, air, highway and railroad. OHMS plans, implements, and manages hazardous materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory, enforcement, and outreach programs, and administers a user fee funded grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program to States and Indian tribes for planning and training for hazardous materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number and type of entities regulated by OHMS have increased dramatically since 1990,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA) was amended. Prior to 1990, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> office had jurisdiction over approximately 40,000 hazardous materials shippers and carriers. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the future, the inclusion of intrastate shippers and carriers will bring an additional 110,000 newly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated shippers and carriers mandated by the HMTA amendment under the Hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Materials Regulations (HMR).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain shippers and carriers are required to register with the Department and pay an annual fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Hazardous Materials Registration Program, which began in September 1992, funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency preparedness grants to States and Indian tribes for training and preparing to respond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to hazardous materials emergencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HMTA Grant Program was presented to Congress in 1990 during the legislative process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reauthorizing the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1974. Grant funds were first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed in Fiscal Year 1993. The HMTA grant program is carefully crafted to build upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing programs and relationships. It has increased the emphasis on improving the capability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of communities to plan for the full range of transportation related hazardous materials risks they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> face.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Forty-seven States are participating in the HMTA grant program_an overwhelming first year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response. Fifty-eight grants, totaling approximately $8.4 million, were given to States, Tribes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Territories in the first grant budget period. 180,000 emergency responders will be trained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with HMTA grant funds in the first year of the program; 81% of these responders are either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paid or volunteer firefighters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing grant process begins with each participating State's Governor determining which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency within the State receives the HMTA grant. The selected agency distributes funds in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with HMTA grant rules and required certifications, ensuring the assistance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided to intended recipients. The grant distribution system allows each State's Governor to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make decisions on funding based on local factors, and allows DOT to leverage resources,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereby operating the HMTA grant program efficiently. The HMTA grant distribution system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is lean, and gives exceptionally responsive service to State grantees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. National Service Corps.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the OHMS's ``Hazardous Materials Transportation Emergency Preparedness Assistance''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program, national service funding will be used to employ national service participants as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistants to the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee (LEPC), and State Emergency Management Agency levels. This Program will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reinforce the Nation's Hazardous Materials Transportation Emergency Response/State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emergency Response structure, one of the objectives of the existing HMTA grant program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Local SERC/LEPC/emergency management national service participants may serve as assistants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to prepare local emergency plans, perform hazardous materials commodity flow studies, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinate exercise of plans. These jobs, requiring little previous experience, could be learned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mainly through on-the-job training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Use of national service funds to increase the effectiveness of the nationally recognized HMTA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant program would not only help the nation and localities, but also give national service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants experience in, and access to, an industry which is experiencing growth. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, a reaction in part to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bhopal, India tragedy, created SERCs and LEPCs to plan for emergency response, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feedback and coordination from broadly based local groups; many responsibilities were levied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on states and localities with little funding. This program can provide assistance not previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available. Similarly, state emergency management agencies need assistance with hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials planning and training grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that national service participants be involved as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A day in the life of a national service participant might include assignment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an LEPC. For this participant the day might include working under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LEPC chairperson's supervision to gather data at the state police inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point for a commodity flow study. The participant might use the data while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interacting with LEPC members at an evening meeting. As a result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the LEPC might modify their emergency plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. At other times the participant might distribute material safety data sheets to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public, conduct community outreach meetings, or receive notification of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous materials release and provide support for the SERC/LEPC or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community. At a state emergency information center, the participant might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist the watch officer in preparing and distributing the daily situation report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Daily activities provide on-the-job training. For example, data may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated heavy transport of gasoline indicating the need for training in response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to tanker incidents. The participant learns from experience the interaction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between data, planning, and training. The participant might also be mentored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the members of the LEPC, the response community, or the trucking industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this way, the public good is served and the participant receives valuable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.5.2&blank;Goals and Priorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed program meets all criteria for funding under the President's National Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program; it improves public safety and health, guards the environment, and educates program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants. The program addresses national service priorities while at the same time provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an opportunity for public service and giving participants training that may enable them to gain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment later. It specifically addresses the following national priorities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

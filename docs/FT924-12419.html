			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Jenner Fenton takes 27.5% of Dutch broker JENNER Fenton Slade, the specialist marine and energy insurance and reinsurance broker, has acquired a 27.5 per cent stake in Kroller, the Dutch broker. The stake is valued at about Pounds 1m. Jenner Fenton is co-operating with local Dutch investors in the deal. Halder Bank, a merchant bank, will own a 25 per cent stake and Bluemers, an insurance agency, a further 30 per cent. Kroller's existing management will hold the remaining shares. The purchase, originally agreed in August, was completed last week. Jenner Fenton, whose existing overseas operations are concentrated in Houston, Texas, hopes its involvement in Kroller will increase its opportunities in Europe.</p>

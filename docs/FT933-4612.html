			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings Ever since the failure of its bid for Racal, Williams has been bereft of direction. A low share rating has curbed its acquisitive inclinations and the company seemed in any case uncertain of its ability to clinch a large deal at the right price. Instead it has kept its head down in the hope of raising its rating with a spot of organic growth. Yesterday's interim figures were not good enough to meet this aim. Underlying cash flow has improved, but operating profits were up less then 8 per cent and gearing is 58 per cent. Now Williams aims to improve its image further by focusing on building and consumer products, and fire and safety. The implication is that its two other divisions - electronics, which is heavily dependent on the German car industry, and engineering, which suffers from the erratic flow of defence orders - could be sold. It would be rash to expect any quick developments, but such disposals could eventually create leeway for a large acquisition which would not have to be financed by expensive equity. The question is whether this would be an appropriate course. Williams has cleaned up its accounts. It has no reason to make a special virtue of this, though, and the absence of provisions on its new bolt-on acquisitions simply underlines how remote are the old buccaneering days. If it really wants to restore its rating, it also needs to demonstrate that it can use the economic recovery to generate sufficient cash to reduce gearing. That will take time. At least patience is rewarded by a yield approaching 5 per cent.</p>

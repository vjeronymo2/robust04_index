			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Racal/Chubb Racal is an example of constructive divorce in action. Over the past five years, Racal shareholders have done well by spinning off Chubb and Vodafone. The three companies now have a combined market capitalisation of Pounds 6bn: before the process started Racal was worth only Pounds 1.55bn. When the Pounds 400m injection from the sale of the first 20 per cent of Vodafone is included, the value of the companies has trebled since 1988, while the FT-A All-Share index is only up by 55 per cent. Since the Chubb demerger was announced, the FT-SE mid 250 index has risen by 47 per cent while Racal and Chubb are up by 61 per cent. The outperformance is equivalent to a rise in the old-style Racal shares from 65p to 75p, which is approximately what the company's advisers suggested would be the impact of demerger. Williams must now wish it had increased its bid. Much of the overall rise in value has come from Vodafone's extraordinarily profitable cellular phone business. It is hard to know what would have happened without a split, but the experience must give Securicor pause over its stake in Cellnet. US interest in Vodafone certainly increased when it became a purely cellular operation. Vodafone's management has since concentrated on expansion, and Chubb's on cost-cutting. Ironically, both demergers were defensive responses to predators - as is ICI's split. That, however, is hardly liberating a Vodafone-style boom business, so ICI's shareholders must hope that management can pare away at costs to release more limited value.</p>

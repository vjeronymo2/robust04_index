			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Enterprise Oil One of the almost unalloyed winners from sterling's devaluation on Black Wednesday was the UK independent oil sector. With so many sterling costs and oil priced in dollars, the benefits drop straight to the bottom line. That has been reflected in the performance of the shares; the sector has risen by some 15 per cent. But Enterprise Oil is up by over 50 per cent despite the weakening dollar oil price. Such rises are apt to make shareholders light-headed. When measured against its net assets, Enterprise Oil begins to look expensive. Besides, there are a few disadvantages to lower sterling. Many independents like Enterprise are now exploring outside the UK and are having to pay in dollars for exploration equipment. Some, perhaps most notably Lasmo, also have a high proportion of their debt in dollars, so that interest charges and redemption costs will rise. And most of the independents' assets are in the North Sea, so the companies such as Enterprise incur a high marginal UK tax charge on the additional revenues. These problems may only be a temporary drag on Enterprise Oil's progress. As the company's reserves come on stream, output will double in the next two years. The company already has a strong balance sheet, and cash will start to flow into Enterprise as output rises. Its management has proved capable and has found oil at enviably low cost. The black spot is a decline in new fields coming on stream after 1996. It will be interesting to see if the chief executive, Mr Graham Hearne, can find the oil to maintain his winning streak.</p>

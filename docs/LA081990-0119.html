			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAND FIASCO -- COUNCIL IS AT FAULT  </P> <P> I am shocked at the article reporting on the "reversal" of Planning  Commissioner Thomas Moody on Laguna Niguel's loss of 96 acres of public land  ("Planner Reverses Self on Public's Lost 96 Acres," Aug. 8).  </P> <P> All previous plans for the development of Laguna Niguel, including the Salt  Creek Corridor Regional Plan and the Avco Plan, provided for the wetlands on  Taylor Woodrow's tract to remain open.  </P> <P> Taylor Woodrow has destroyed the Salt Creek Wetlands, which was to provide  benefit to all citizens of Orange County, and replaced these precious wetlands  with private pools for the exclusive use of condo owners and residents of their  tract.  </P> <P> The destruction of Salt Creek Wetlands is not for the betterment of Laguna  Niguel as quoted by Commissioner Moody. Taylor Woodrow provided a residential  product to maximize their profits at the expense of the general populace.  </P> <P> They also did not adhere to procedures that call for the filing of an  environmental impact report when destroying wetlands such as these.  </P> <P> ARTHUR PADGETT  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

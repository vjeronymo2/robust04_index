Assistant  U.S. Atty. Stephen Preisser confirmed the probe at Eglin Federal Prison Camp  but would give no details. The allegations came to light when an ex-inmate  pleaded guilty to paying a $50 bribe to an Air Force staff sergeant who  supervised prisoners while they were on work duty at Eglin Air Force Base,  where the camp is located.  </P></p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (5): Speed and diversity - Portugal races to catch up Portugal is power hungry. Electricity consumption has risen at more than twice the average European Union rate over the past decade as a result of strong economic growth. Demand is forecast to increase significantly faster than in most western European countries - at an annual rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent to the end of the century and by 1.5 to 2 per cent a year from 2000 to 2020. The electricity sector is being radically restructured in an effort to satisfy this growing demand in the most cost-effective way possible for a country with few energy resources of its own. The overriding aims of reform are to reduce Portugal's heavy dependence on imported oil by altering the energy mix and to improve efficiency through liberalisation and privatisation. 'Restructuring is aimed at introducing flexibility, rationality and competition into the power section to provide consumers with lower prices and better services,' says Mr Joaquim Silva Correia, chairman of Electricidade de Portugal (EDP), the state-owned power producer and distributor. Electricity prices for industrial consumers in Portugal have been reduced by 31 per cent in real terms since 1987 but remain the third highest in the EU. Portugal's energy imports, of which oil accounts for more than 90 per cent, cost Es330.9bn in 1993, representing 8.9 per cent of total imports and 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product. This marks an improvement from a decade ago when energy imports were the equivalent of 10.5 per cent of GDP. But Portugal's reliance on imported oil is still so strong that a fluctuation of one dollar in the price of a barrel has far-reaching effects on the economy. Oil accounts for more than 70 per cent of primary energy consumption and domestic resources, mainly hydroelectric power and biomass, only 12 per cent. Diversification away from oil is being focused on natural gas and coal. Portugal, the only EU country without a natural gas supply, is due to lift 2,500m cubic metres a year from 1996 from the planned Maghreb-Europe pipeline. Officials forecast natural gas will account for 5-7 per cent of primary energy use by 2000, subsequently climbing towards the EU average of 14 per cent if it remains more competitive than coal. Coal is forecast to grow to 20 per cent of primary energy use from a current 16 per cent. Portugal plans to expand its existing power generating capacity of 7,200MW to 8,800MW by 2000. A natural gas-fired plant will account for 900MW of new capacity, a coal-fired plant for 300MW, hydroelectric plants for 350MW and wind-powered generation for 50MW. Liberalisation of the electricity sector began tentatively in 1988 with legislation permitting small-scale private production in the form of mini-hydro plants. Until then power production had been an EDP monopoly. The scheme proved a runaway success and EDP was flooded with applications to build. Officials now estimate the potential of mini-hydro production could exceed 250MW by the year 2000. Portugal took its first step towards large scale private production in 1991 when a consortium led by Siemens of Germany won a contract to build and operate a 900MW natural gas-fired power plant near Oporto in northern Portugal. The plant is due to come on line in 1997. In December 1993, EDP sold two 300MW coal-fired units at Pego, 130kms northeast of Lisbon, to a group led by National Power of the UK. The first unit began production in March 1993, the second is due to start in October 1995. Two further 300MW units may eventually be added. The sector will make a further leap towards liberalisation in July when EDP is to be unbundled into 10 separate companies. This will be followed by the partial privatisation of power production and distribution. New companies will be created to manage power production and the high-tension transmission network. Distribution will be split among four regional companies. Five service companies will also be formed. A holding company will coordinate operations and strategy. The new production company, Companhia Portuguesa de Producao de Electricidade (CPPE), will take over all EDP's power plants, which are estimated to represent about half the company's net assets of Es2,247bn. Between 20 and 25 per cent of CPPE's capital is to be privatised by mid-1995. Further tranches may subsequently be sold but the state will retain a majority holding. The regional distribution companies will also privatise a minority of their capital over the medium term. But liberalisation will not go as far as the UK model. An independent planning body is to be set up to determine policy on the building of new power plants. 'Portugal is too small and too dependent on hydroelectric production, which varies according to rainfall, to allow the market to decide what plants are built,' says Mr Silva Correia. One of the new body's first decisions will be whether the first large power plant to be built in the 21st century should be fired by coal or natural gas. A second independent body will be created to oversee prices and competition. One of its main tasks will be to ensure that Rede Electrica Nacional (REN), the new company that is to manage the national grid, buys from producers strictly on a basis of lowest price first. Initially, all power producers will have binding power purchase agreements with REN. But over the medium term other producers will be allowed to produce directly for independent customers, paying for use of the national grid if required. Regional distributors will be permitted to purchase up to 15 per cent of their supply from such producers. 'Our aim is to make a gradual transition from a vertically-integrated sector to a more liberalised framework and to transfer the efficiency gains to consumers in the form of lower tariffs,' says Mr Silva Correia. 'But the special characteristics of Portugal mean that we cannot go as far as countries such as Britain on the road to a free-market.'</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire-Tyne Tees deal with Thames Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Tele-vision has proposed a programming-making alliance with Thames Television, the independent production company now owned by Pearson, the media and entertainment group which owns the Financial Times. YTT would like to make programmes with Thames for sale to international markets. The Leeds-based ITV company, which yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.6m (profit Pounds 3.6m) for the six months to March 31, is also linking up with large advertisers to make programmes. A new drama series, The Wanderer, which was 80 per cent financed by Procter &amp; Gamble and was turned down by the ITV network centre has instead been sold to Sky Television. Increasing programme production, particularly for new markets outside the ITV network, is one of the strategies being pursued by Mr Ward Thomas, YTT's chairman. At the same time he is trying to increase the company's share of ITV advertising. Last year its reached a low of just below 10 per cent. By cutting costs the ITV company, which paid a total in licence payments up from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 30.4m to the Independent Television Commission, lifted operating profits from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 24.7m. Mr Thomas said that the advertising deal problems were now a matter of history. Settlements had now been made in full with all advertisers and the company now had an ungeared balance sheet. Analysts were now looking at pre-tax profits of between Pounds 5m to Pounds 7m for the full year. Mr Thomas said he 'looked forward with confidence to a measured and improving share of the total advertising cake and a consequential improvement in revenue through the rest of the year'. Turnover fell from Pounds 126m last time to Pounds 107.7m as advertising revenue dropped by Pounds 20m. Some of the leeway was made up by significant job losses. Staff costs fell from Pounds 22.9m to Pounds 17.8m. Losses per share were 6.1p (3.3p earnings). The company is declaring a nominal interim dividend of 0.1p (3.3p). The shares closed yesterday down 7p at 312p.</p>

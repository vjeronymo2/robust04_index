			<p>BFN     [Text] Huhhot, April 30 (XINHUA) -- Construction of the  Inner Mongolian chemical fertilizer plant, a major national  project for the Eighth State Five-Year Plan (1991-95), has been  proceeding smoothly.    So far, construction of the living quarters, auxiliary  public  facilities and production workshops has been completed. In  addition, the main production installations, including the urea  grain formation tower and the high-pressure boiler, are under  construction.    The construction of the plant began on December 20, 1991,  and  is expected to be completed at the end of 1995. With the total  investment reaching 2.4 billion yuan (277 million U.S. dollars),  the plant is designed to produce annually 300,000 tons of  synthetic ammonia and 520,000 tons of urea. The plant is  expected to start trial production in 1996.</p>

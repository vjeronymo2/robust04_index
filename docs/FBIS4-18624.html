			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Audiovisual Industry </F> Threatened by `Super 301' -- European Commission Considers Using  Taxes To Support the Audiovisual Sector"]    [Text] Pressed by the Hollywood lobby, Washington is  seriously threatening the Twelve with reprisals if they continue  to protect their audiovisual production.    Europe succeeded in not making a commitment on the  audiovisual sector within the GATT agreement reached on 15  December 1993. In so doing, it stressed the idea that cultural  creations are not products just like any others. Ever since  then, however, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has  ceaselessly reiterated that the cultural exception was, for the  United States, the "greatest disappointment in the Uruguay  Round."    The annual report on "obstacles to trade," which was  published last Thursday [31 March] in Washington, took up that  issue at length again, listing the existence of broadcasting  quotas for television and taxes on video cassettes and cinema  tickets, which are deemed to discriminate against U.S.  producers. The producers in question are particularly concerned  by the 40-percent quota of French songs that France intends to  impose from 1996 onward on the airwaves covered by its 1,700  radio stations -- a step that would result in a 30-percent  reduction in the amount of U.S. music broadcast.    The report also pinpoints Italy for the tax reductions  awarded to cinemas showing nationally produced films, and Spain,  which requires that anybody seeking to distribute non-European  dubbed films within its borders must secure authorization to do  so. This requirement is costing U.S. companies "more than $15  million per year."    Mickey Kantor has pointed out that he would not hesitate to  resort to the so-called Super 301 clause (which enables  President Clinton to impose sanctions on any country suspected  of unfair trade practices and which refuses to open up its  market more to U.S. products) in an attempt to preserve the  dominance on European screens by the major Hollywood studios.    According to Washington, the fact that the audiovisual  sector  has escaped from its obligation to open up markets as enshrined  in the 15 December GATT agreement gives them every freedom to  resort to exerting bilateral pressure.    On the other hand, this argument is firmly rejected by GATT  Spokesman David Woods. He believes the audiovisual sector is  actually covered by the agreement, namely by the procedures  provided for resolving conflicts. Consequently, according to  this line of reasoning, if the United States wants to take  action against the European Union (EU) in this sector, it will  have to respect the rules laid down by GATT or the World Trade  Organization (WTO), which will replace GATT in 1995.  <H5>  Eurotaxes? </H5>   Meanwhile, the Commission says it is "ready," with the EU  member states, "to consider introducing a system of indirect  taxes to support the European audiovisual industry." In its  white paper on the EU audiovisual policy, which it will probably  adopt on Wednesday, the Commission believes these indirect taxes  (levied on the prices of cinema tickets, advertising revenue,  and video rental charges) already imposed by some member states  could be extended to apply throughout the EU.</p>

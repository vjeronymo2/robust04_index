			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Tecs set for bigger industrial policy role The 82 training and enterprise councils in England and Wales are likely to become the leading institutions in regional industrial policy after approval for Kent Tec to take over the economic development activities of Kent County Council. The primary jobs of Tecs is to run the two main government training schemes  -Youth Training and Employment Training for adults - but many of the business executives on Tec boards are more interested in the mission to raise the overall quality of business in their areas. According to Mr Peter Ashby, a leading Tec consultant, the Kent takeover is likely to promote a wave of similar moves, although in some areas Tecs might merge with chambers of commerce. The chairman of Kent Tec is Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel and a businessman with close links to government. He was recently made head of the Treasury's private finance working group, set up to promote private-sector investment in infrastructure projects. The Kent merger is consequently almost certain to have official endorsement. That means the government is taking the more permissive stance on institutional links that Tec leaders have urged. The Kent merger is also significant because it comes three weeks after the government announced the establishment of Integrated Regional Offices, bringing together at regional level such government departments as trade and industry, transport, environment and employment. IROs are responsible for urban regeneration budgets, and Tec-local authority mergers will be in a strong position to bid for large parts of them. The establishment of IROs is also a response to the Tec complaint that government speaks in too many conflicting voices, especially at regional level.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEHIND THE WHEEL: ACCORD TOPS ITSELF FOR 1990  </P> <P> Old trivia: In 1972, the 15,007,034th Volkswagen bug was built, and the marque  overtook Ford's Model T as the best-selling car in automotive history. The  crass might note that a Tin Lizzie was about the only thing a Beetle could  overtake.  </P> <P> New minutiae: Ford is battling back. Since 1980, the company has sold 7.2  million Escorts, and currently this somewhat unpoetic vehicle is the world's  most popular car.  </P> <P> Yet in second place and quietly closing -- with Volkswagen sadly lolling in the  back seat awaiting some future automotive Armageddon -- comes the Honda Accord.  </P> <P> It was introduced in 1976. More than 5 million Accords have rolled worldwide  since then. And its annual sales in the United States are wheel-to-wheel with  Ford's Escort.  </P> <P> "Quite frankly, I can't think of any other car that has had it together like  the Accord has had it together, for the number of years it has," said Gerald  Bengtson, vice president of marketing for American Honda Motor Co. of Gardena.  He was talking of the harmony of Accord.  </P> <P> "Other people have had problems (in the first year) and then did things to  improve their cars," Bengtson continued. "But no one has really put the  complete package out there from Day 1 and continued to improve upon it."  </P> <P> A result of that, he added, was an initial corps of satisfied owners that has  become a legion loyal to one generation of Accords after the other.  </P> <P> The net result is the 1990 Honda Accord.  </P> <P> It not only follows but also tops its own tough act as the most refined amalgam  of pleasing function and mechanical achievement -- and transportation as  trustworthy as that 15,007,034th Volkswagen.  </P> <P> Owen Edwards, author of "Elegant Solutions," which addresses objects of  affection and the affection of objects, touches this precise nerve in noting  our daily need for things to be "admirable and intelligent, generous and sound,  functional and spiritual."  </P> <P> Edwards could easily situate the Honda Accord alongside his selection of  graceful functionaries: the dollar bill, Pears soap, the Talon zipper, the  Zippo lighter, Oreo cookies, espadrilles, Clincher softballs and the Buck  folding knife.  </P> <P> The Accord is a car of great styling because it is simplicity born of the  gentle nondescript of previous generations. Nothing schmancy. Nice lines and  flares and rake of glass. Just nice.  </P> <P> Yet . . . underneath, clearly sniffing for the sport coupe driver who presumes  to own every entrance ramp and interesting corner between you and Century City,  is a virile engine producing a capable 130 horsepower. That's quite enough to  bring smoke and alley cat wails from the front tires but sedate enough to  suggest total respectability if called to school meetings and teacher-parent  admonitions are suspected.  </P> <P> Accord prices for six models range from $12,000 to $17,000, and in this decade  of the $1 panhandle, that's close to giveaway.  </P> <P> Yet . . . the sticker price on the majority of Accords includes such  pleasantries as variable assist power steering, air conditioning, a  medium-quality stereo system, cruise control and power windows, locks and side  mirrors.  </P> <P> Would that this list of attachments and mechanical advantages was impeccable.  </P> <P> But despite the rapid transition of air bags and anti-lock brake systems from  luxury options to standard equipment on many cars, the wonderful Accord comes  with neither small wonder.  </P> <P> Instead, its brakes are an antiquated disc-drum setup, and the federal  government's 1990 passive-restraint requirements are met by irritating,  motorized shoulder straps that seduce even the responsible into forgetting the  seat belt.  </P> <P> Bengtson says it is not oversight, just a matter of cost.  </P> <P> A driver-side air bag and anti-lock brakes on the Accord, he estimated, would  cost $1,500. That might be considered small change to anyone thumbing out  $50,000 for a Mercedes -- but it represents a 10% price hike to Honda buyers.  </P> <P> Rather than impose that premium ("a grand here or there on a $12,000 car will  make or break a deal"), Bengtson said, Honda is examining ways of reducing  production costs to find price room "so we can include these features (air bags  and anti-lock brakes) in future models."  </P> <P> "It is not going to be this year, and it may not be in total next year. But it  could be by 1992," he said.  </P> <P> The new Accord is longer, lower and wider than last year's sibling. The extra  length allows a sportier slope to the windshield and rear window. The  additional length and width combined with Honda's multiple-link suspension  system and rigid unibody construction also flattens the ride and the  discomforts of dip, roll and watching your Ray-Bans slide the length of the  dashboard on their lenses.  </P> <P> Speaking of lenses . . . since carbide lamps first parted the dark, headlight  glass has always focused and directed the night vision of automobiles. In this  year's Honda Accord, the lenses are no more than clear covers because segmented  reflectors concentrate and control the light.  </P> <P> The system allows more efficient, lower profile lights to blend permanently  with frontal lines rather than shattering them with great, staring pop-up  headlights.  </P> <P> There's a further example of Honda's technological talent in the installation  of twin engine shafts, mounted parallel to the crankshaft, that counter-rotate  to cancel the inertial forces, that is, vibration created by the movement of  the pistons and connecting rods.  </P> <P> Add a five-speed (four-speed automatics are available throughout the series)  that's already in the Gearbox Hall of Fame for smoothness and heft, and you  have a decorum of drive train that is quantum leaps ahead of any car in  Accord's class.  </P> <P> Now round out the mechanical package with an efficient, albeit elderly braking  system, and nifty, highly communicative steering. This combination of engine,  transmission and steering will tame inefficiencies among the unknowing and, for  the willing driver, will refresh precision and skills faster than the sight of  a CHP cruiser.  </P> <P> The same sedate efficiency of the Accord's exterior is carried into its cabin,  where the control layout is familiar and seats (particularly the fronts with  adjustable lumbar support) are so comfortable that they are barely noticed.  </P> <P> It is roomier, particularly in the rear half, than last year's model and wears  more glass. Vision is omnidirectional. The decor is unobtrusive fabrics, vinyls  and plastics with only one horror -- a veneer of velour that makes door panels  appear to be upholstered in kiwi fruit.  </P> <P> The overall pleasure, however, is the abundance owners will receive for the  relatively small amount they have to pay.  </P> <P> As a matter of fact, the Accord EX offers only one factory option -- for anyone  willing to splurge $80 on floor mats.  </P> <P> 1990 HONDA ACCORD EX  </P> <P> COST :  </P> <P> Base: $16,595.  </P> <P> As tested: $16,675.  </P> <P> ENGINE :  </P> <P> Four cylinders, 16 valves, 2.2 liters, developing 130 horsepower.  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE :  </P> <P> 0-60 m.p.h., as tested, 9.8 seconds.  </P> <P> Top speed, manufacturer's estimate, 125 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Fuel economy, city-highway average, 24 m.p.g.  </P> <P> CURB WEIGHT :  </P> <P> 2,989 pounds.  </P> <P> REBATE PROGRAM :  </P> <P> None.THE GOOD :  </P> <P> Refined, high performance beyond requirements of most owners.  </P> <P> Loyalty, reliability and fun factors of a pedigreed German shepherd.  </P> <P> Enormous value.  </P> <P> THE BAD :  </P> <P> No antilock brakes.  </P> <P> No air bags.THE UGLY :  </P> <P> Fake velour interior trim.  </P></p>

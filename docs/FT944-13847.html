			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Call to delay new Forth road bridge The government was urged yesterday to postpone for five years a decision on building a second Forth road bridge. Instead, said Lothian Regional Council, it should raise tolls on the existing road bridge to finance transport improvements which might make a second bridge unnecessary. The council, which covers the area on the south side of the Firth of Forth, was replying to feasibility studies published by the Scottish Office that present a strong case for a second Forth road bridge. The government is expected to announce before the end of the year that it wants to go ahead with the project, which would be financed by the private sector.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Nova drops plan to split gas operations NOVA CORP has dropped plans to split its natural gas transmission and petrochemicals operations into separate entities. Mr Edward Newall, chairman, said Nova's international equity issue had raised more than CDollars 300m (USDollars 254.2m) and will put the company's balance-sheet 'in superb shape'. There is no pressure to sell assets now, he added, denying reports that Nova might sell its Ontario ethylene plant to Imperial Oil. The company now expects to be profitable throughout 1992 following last year's CDollars 675m special restructuring charge that wiped out profits. Mr Newall said petrochemical prices had hit rock bottom, and Nova's petrochemical operations would break even in 1992 after financial charges and meeting CDollars 100m in capital outlays. Nova has slowed its gas pipeline expansion programme as Canadian gas producers have reduced demands for pipeline capacity.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hongkong Land disappoints market with 9.6% advance Hongkong Land, the Jardine Matheson group's property investment arm, yesterday reported a 9.6 per cent rise in after-tax profits, to USDollars 181.9m for the first six months of the year. The figure compares with USDollars 165.9m in the first half of 1993. Following the lead set by Dairy Farm, Jardine's retail business, both Hongkong Land and sister company Mandarin Oriental, the hotel group, accompanied their results with the date of their exit from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Both will de-list on March 31, three months after Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic. All five departing Jardine companies are constituent stocks on the Hang Seng Index. Hongkong Land's results were on the low side of market expectations. Earnings per share rose 9.6 per cent to 6.95 US cents from 6.34 US cents, while the dividend improved 11 per cent to 3.50 US cents from 3.15 US cents. Profits were boosted by a significant jump in office rents. Hongkong Land is the colony's biggest commercial landlord, and its portfolio is virtually fully let. However, Hong Kong analysts were disappointed by the modest contribution from Trafalgar House, in which the group holds a 25.6 per cent stake. Crosby Securities put the Trafalgar House contribution at USDollars 7.6m, sharply below its forecasts. The group continues to seek additional property investment opportunities in China and elsewhere in Asia. Its 63,000 sq ft office block in Hanoi, Vietnam, is scheduled for completion late next year. Hongkong Land has diversified into the infrastructure sector by taking the biggest single stake in the Tsing Yi consortium to build Container Terminal 9 - a project now fraught with political overtones as Beijing, upon whose approval the project is dependent, seeks to eject Jardine Matheson. Yesterday's results statement noted that 'commencement of the project remains dependent upon agreement between the British and Chinese governments'.</p>

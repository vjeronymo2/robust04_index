			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Abu-Isbir from Ba'labakk] </F>   [Excerpts] New information has emerged regarding the  Israeli act of piracy represented by the abduction of al-Hajj  Mustafa al- Dirani, one of the leaders of the Believers  Resistance, from his home in Qasr Naba. The Israelis jammed the  telecommunications networks in the area during the operation.  An agent guided the two helicopters to their landing place on  the al-Furzul-Niha hills at night. The Israeli soldiers doped  Mustafa al-Dirani's family members so that they couldn't move or  resist. Needle marks were found on their hands, legs, and necks.    Traces of blood were found a few meters from al-Dirani's  house. It is believed an Israeli soldier was wounded during an  exchange of fire. Israel has admitted that one Israeli officer  was hurt during the operation. The Israelis opened fire from  weapons equipped with silencers. The Israeli military jeeps  stopped at a place called Wadi Shararah outside Qasr Naba.    The first to open fire on the Israeli force was  'Abd-al-Karim  al-Dirani (brother of captive Mustafa), who used a hunting rifle  to fire on the Israeli soldiers. The Israelis used infrared  night vision equipment.    The telephone line at al-Dirani's house was out of order for  three days. The Israelis appear to have known about this  because they did not cut the line.    Marks left by an axe were seen on a wooden door and there  were three bullet marks on the outside wall of the second floor  of the house. It seems the Israelis fired on the house to cover  their withdrawal.    The israelis left behind a door-opening device, cassettes,  al-Dirani's worry beads, and bandages, which, it seems, they  dropped in the confusion after fire was opened on them.    Al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani returned to his house in Qasr Naba  on the evening of Friday [20 May] to spend the 'Id al-Adha  holiday with his family, relatives, and friends. This proves  that his house was under surveillance by agents. Thus the  circle of suspicion might narrow, possibly leading to the  identification of the participants in the operation. [passage  omitted covered in previously filed material]    Former Hizballah Secretary General Subhi al-Tufayli held a  news conference at which he accused the Lebanese authorities of  having prior knowledge of the operation and contributing to the  handover of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani to Israel. He said: The  state is held responsible because it is responsible for the  people's security and because it storms houses, arrests people,  and sets up gallows.    He declared that the state, which cannot protect its  citizens  from the Zionist enemy, who came by helicopters and stayed five  hours on the ground, has no right to knock on doors and storm  citizens' homes. It has no right to say it is responsible for  the country's security.    He called on citizens to use weapons against anyone who  knocks on their door and storms their home, regardless of his  alleged identity or uniform, because we are facing a situation  in which we cannot differentiate between the Zionist enemy and  others. Every citizen must defend himself.    Al-Tufayil said the Israeli operation was within the  framework of the negotiations and part of the security  normalization process between Lebanon and the Zionist entity.    He said the issue of Israeli pilot Ron Arad is a riddle  [uhjiyyah]. He pointed out: According to my confirmed  information, Iran has no connection with this issue. And  Hizballah--of which I was secretary general--has no connection  with this issue. I have heard that the other parties that might  be holding the pilot have denied any connection with or  knowledge of the issue. If the denial is correct, as is the  case with Hizballah and Iran, the chances are that the Israeli  pilot has died or was killed. Based on this premise, the issue  is now a riddle.    Zakariya Hamzah, also known as Abu-Yahya, one of the leaders  of the Believers Resistance, said: We have an account to settle  with Israel. As Abu-'Ali al-Dirani was taken, he will return.  Our concern now is to search for the threads that led the  Israelis to brother Mustafa al-Dirani. We will cooperate to  confront the ferocious Israeli enemy. After the assassination  of 'Abbas al- Musawi, the quality operations against Israel  increased. After the abduction of Abu-'Ali, we will confront  Israel with quality operations. This is our style. We have an  account outstanding with the Jews, outstanding since the time of  Khaybar. The biggest account we will settle will be with the  agents of the enemy. [passage omitted]</p>

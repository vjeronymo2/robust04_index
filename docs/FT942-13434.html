			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / VW and Mercedes enter van alliance Volkswagen, Europe's biggest vehicle maker, is to license technology from Mercedes-Benz for the development of a new range of light commercial vehicles. The licensing deal is the first significant collaboration between two of Europe's biggest vehicle makers, demonstrating Mercedes-Benz's new readiness to develop alliances with other producers. Under the deal, VW is to use Mercedes-Benz technology to develop a successor for its ageing Volkswagen LT range of heavy vans. The agreement, which represents an important consolidation of forces in the European van sector, ends VW's search for a partner, which included talks with Renault of France. Mercedes-Benz, automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz and the world's leading commercial vehicle maker, is planning to launch its new van range (in the 2.5-4.6 tonnes gross weight class) in Europe next year to replace the T1 series. The VW version is likely to follow a year later. The licensing deal is likely to cut Mercedes-Benz's development costs by around a third, while Volkswagen has lacked the sales volumes to justify the development of a new heavy van range alone. The production of Volkswagen LT commercial and passenger vehicles totalled only 14,309 last year. Mercedes-Benz produced more than 50,000 T1 vans in Europe last year. It is planning to expand capacity at its Dusseldorf plant. Mercedes-Benz has also finalised a joint venture with Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive (Telco) of India, one of the world's leading makers of commercial vehicles, for the assembly of Mercedes-Benz cars in India. The joint venture will build up to 20,000 E-Class executive cars a year, plus about 50,000 engines at a new plant near Poona. Telco will take a 49 per cent stake, and Mercedes-Benz will have management control. The two groups plan to invest around DM250m (Pounds 100m). Mercedes in bus group talks, Page 23</p>

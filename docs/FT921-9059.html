			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Thais shelve AMX fighter deal THE Royal Thai Air Force has shelved plans to buy 38 Italian-Brazilian AMX fighter aircraft in a package worth about Dollars 750m (Pounds 414m) including training, support and maintenance, in the face of the Thai government's unwillingness to fund the purchase, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. 'There is no money to buy the fleet,' General Pow Sarasin, deputy prime minister, said after the air force withdrew a request for government financing of the deal over 10 years. Thailand would have been the first foreign buyer of the jet, which is manufactured by Alenia of Italy and Embraer of Brazil.</p>

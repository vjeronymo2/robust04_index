			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (6): Crucial component - Exports COLOMBO'S attempt to increase and diversify exports is a crucial component of its ambitions to join the league of newly industrialised nations. Since it took tentative steps towards economic liberalisation in 1977, the aim has been to move away from the traditional mainstays of tea, coconut and rubber towards development driven by value-added exports. Much has already been achieved. By 1991 industrial goods accounted for about 60 per cent of export earnings, compared with only 33 per cent in 1980. That figure is expected to rise to 65 per cent this year. The range of value-added goods has also grown. Over the past six years, the catalogue of export items has risen from 60 to about 400, according to government officials. In addition to textiles, exports include chemicals, petroleum products, leather and plastic items, agro-industrial goods, as well as cut gems and diamonds. There is still plenty to be done, particularly if Sri Lanka is to wean itself from an over-reliance on the textile industry which still accounts for half of manufactured exports. First, it will need to attract more foreign capital, a requirement that has led Colombo to accelerate its programme of investment liberalisation. To that end President Ranasinghe Premadasa has, in effect, declared the entire island a free trade zone, offering investment incentives to virtually all newcomers. With the exception of strategic industries - such as weapons manufacture - companies setting up export-led businesses will automatically benefit from a package of incentives including tax holidays, access to foreign exchange, duty-free import of equipment and repatriation of profits. Such benefits were previously restricted to companies established under the auspices of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC) which runs Sri Lanka's free trade zones, of which there are now three. The GCEC, set up in 1978 to 'spearhead export-led development', marked what Mr Frank Weeraratne, deputy director-general of the commission, calls a 'watershed' in economic policy. The commission's task was to promote foreign investment, boost exports, provide employment and facilitate a transfer of technology. All were to be achieved by shifting the economy from its 'restrictive, highly-regulated system'. Under the latest reforms, GCEC authority has been extended to cover island-wide export-led investments. The GCEC - shortly to be renamed the Board of Investment - will act as a 'one-stop shop' for investors, cutting out bureaucratic delays and wooing foreign capital, says Mr Weeraratne. The extension of incentives is in part a response to the disappointing level of foreign investment which, until last year had not risen above Dollars 40m annually, mainly from other Asian countries. The latest World Bank country report says these levels of foreign investment should be compared with competitors such as Thailand and Malaysia which, in 1989, attracted inflows of Dollars 1.7bn and Dollars 1.8bn respectively. The finance ministry is not unduly alarmed by such comparisons. 'East Asian investors are traditionally quite wary,' says one senior official. 'Investment was quite slow to begin with in Thailand and Indonesia as well. But, now we have succeeded in establishing macroeconomic stability and, to a reasonable extent, political stability, we are confident that inflows will improve.' In addition to broadening the incentives available, the scope of projects qualifying for benefits is also being enlarged. Infrastructure, tourism, provincial development and 'flagship' companies - with an investment of more than Dollars 50m - are among those qualifying. The legacy of bureaucracy, however, may be hard to shake off and the GCEC needs to prove itself capable of acting swiftly and efficiently. New incentives are coming in so rapidly that there have been complaints that the GCEC has been applying them inconsistently. Mr K. Gunaratnam, chairman of the Export Development Board, admits: 'We can be inconsistent in the treatment of foreign investors.' Mr Gunaratnam says there is also a public relations battle to be won. Investors must be convinced that the civil war is regional and presents no barrier to conducting business on the rest of the island. The country's advantages, such as a well-educated, 'reasonably cheap' labour force as well as its strategic position, should be stressed, he says. Mr Weeraratne at the GCEC believes the battle is already being won and speaks of a 'phenomenal increase in investment'. The figures have yet to bear out such unbridled optimism, but foreign interest has undoubtedly been provoked. The number of GCEC-approved projects has begun to climb, reaching 507 by June 1992. Manufactured exports are outstripping growth in other areas. The value of industrial exports rose from SLRs41.5bn in 1990 to SLRs 50.7bn in 1991 and is expected to reach SLRs66bn this year. Most encouraging of all are signs that foreign inflows are beginning to rise. Donors estimate that direct investment was Dollars 50m last year (against Dollars 32m in 1990) and will rise to between Dollars 70m and Dollars 120m in 1992. Given current trends, donors say it is realistic to expect annual inflows of Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m by mid-decade. An end to civil conflict, as in so many areas of the island's economic development, could spur even faster growth.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS OK FUNDS TO COMPLETE PRISON  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has authorized the expenditure of  an additional $2.7 million to complete work at a 2,800-inmate prison near  Castaic, which fell a year behind schedule because of toilets that would not  flush and security doors that would not open.  </P> <P> In addition, the supervisors authorized $298,000 for additional construction  management services, $189,000 for more construction staff and $67,000 for  inspection of the facility's electronic control system.  </P> <P> The maximum-security prison on the grounds of the Peter J. Pitchess Honor  Rancho was originally budgeted for $131 million. Authorities had hoped the  high-tech jail would ease the county's inmate overcrowding last spring, but it  will not be completed until at least mid-February.  </P></p>

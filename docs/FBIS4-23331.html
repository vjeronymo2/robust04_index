			<p>BFN     [Text] President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano admitted  yesterday that the decision to change the Preferential Trade  Area [PTA] organization to the Southern African Economic  Community [Comesa] was a forced step. Chissano said this soon  after registering as a voter at the Josina Machel School in  Maputo.    "We think it was a forced step," he told MEDIAFAX. "We need  other forms of relationship before we can have a true Comesa.  We shall do all we can however to realize Comesa's objective."    Despite the hustle and bustle, we were able to ask President  Chissano three [as published] questions.    [MEDIAFAX] What do you expect from the World Economic Forum  scheduled for next week in Cape Town?    [Chissano] "I expect the participants to compare views to  discover the world's main concerns with regard to economic  development and cooperation in southern Africa, after the end of  apartheid."    [MEDIAFAX] Is there any other thing you consider important?    [Chissano] "Yes. There is a need to convey a message that  will convince the international community and businessmen that  there is peace in southern Africa and we all intend to establish  a harmonious development."    [MEDIAFAX] What additional short term regional integration  steps can be taken?    [Chissano] "I see a greater utilization of the South African  potentialities in assisting the development of other countries.  I also see increasing trade and exchange of technology between  the countries of the region and South Africa. In the past there  was activity, but it could not be exploited to the maximum  because of apartheid."    [MEDIAFAX] Do you accept the zero option and the elimination  of customs duty at regional borders?    [Chissano] "This is an issue that must be carefully studied  because there are already three organizations in the region --  the Southern African Development Community, the PTA, and the  Customs Union -- each one with its own rules. The situation  must be studied so that no one is put at a disadvantage. In  Mozambique, we advocate gradual steps to consolidate economic  unity".</p>

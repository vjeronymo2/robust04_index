			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC]  tonight reveals the contents of UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's letter to President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish  Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, inviting them to proximity talks on  the confidence-building measures. The letter was handed to the  two sides today.    In his letter, Butrus-Ghali calls on Kliridhis and Denktas  to  participate in intense proximity talks in late February to work  out an agreement on a limited number of significant points  regarding ways to implement the measures concerning Varosha and  the Nicosia Airport.    The letter mentions that Joe Clark, the UN secretary  general's special representative in Cyprus, will come to Cyprus  during the preliminary phase of the talks and Gustave Feissel,  the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in  Cyprus, will then take over. The letter adds that Feissel will  meet Kliridhis and Denktas on Monday [7 February] to determine  the crucial points.    Correspondent Kostandinos Yenaris reports on the letter:    [Yenaris] The UN secretary general's letter was handed to  the  two sides today in Nicosia, but the contents were not  publicized. CyBC reveals, however, the full text of the letter,  in which the UN secretary general says he is satisfied because  the two sides accepted the confidence-building measures package  as is. Butrus-Ghali stresses the significance of working out  ways to implement the measures within two months at the most, so  as to utilize fully the positive atmosphere that will be created  when the talks begin.    In order to reach an agreement, Butrus-Ghali calls on both  sides to approach the talks in a constructive spirit, bearing in  mind the following four points: First, neither side should try  to secure a political advantage from the talks or demand that  the other make political concessions. Second, both sides should  respect fully the confidence-building measures as described in  the UN secretary general's report. Third, an agreement should  be fully implemented as soon as it is reached with no delays or  interventions from either side. Fourth, the goal of the  measures is to facilitate swift progress toward an overall  Cyprus solution, not substitute for it.    Based on these four points, the UN secretary general calls  on  both sides to begin intense negotiations with his  representatives in Nicosia in late February to reach an  agreement on a limited number of points regarding ways to  implement the confidence-building measures. The letter adds  that Clark will come to Cyprus for the beginning of the talks,  which will continue with Feissel's participation. Feissel will  hold talks with the two sides to determine these crucial points.  [passage omitted]    [Announcer] According to CyBC information, despite  assurances  by Feissel and Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special  coordinator on the Cyprus issue, that something like this will  not happen, the Greek Cypriot side expects that during Feissel's  contacts the Turkish Cypriot side will again attempt to raise  the issue of redefining the part of Varosha that will be placed  under UN control. Denktas will insist on not including the  northern part of the fenced-off area, replacing it with area of  equivalent size in the south. Our information is that in this  case, the Greek Cypriot side will not agree to even discuss the  issue.</p>

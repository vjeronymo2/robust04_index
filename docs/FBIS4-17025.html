			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- UNIAN has learned from reliable sources that  the Central Electoral Commission has ruled the holding of repeat  elections on 24 July in constituencies where the election was  invalid or neither of the candidates was elected. A recent  sitting of Ukraine's Supreme Council presidium proposed to hold  repeat elections to the Ukrainian Parliament at the same time as  the second round of local elections, that is, on 10 July.  However, the Central Electoral Commission has calculated that  this period would not be long enough for all the stages of  election envisaged by the electoral law: Nomination and  registration of candidates, election campaign, etc., of which it  has informed Ukraine's Supreme Council presidium in writing.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Russian </F> Federation Security Council, by Georgi Aleksandrov; place and  date not given: "In the Defense Industry It Is Illogical for  Each of Us To Invent the Bicycle Separately...."]    [Text] [Aleksandrov] Mr. Lobov, what were the dominant  issues in your talks with President Zhelyu Zhelev?    [Lobov] Most stress was placed on the joint documents we  have signed that create a Bulgarian-Russian Intergovernmental  Commission on Defense Industry Cooperation, the protocol on  cooperation in military equipment, and the problem of the new  transport link between Bulgaria and Russia. I gave Dr. Zhelev  an oral message from the Russian president that confirms all the  accords that the two leaders reached in 1992 during your  president's visit to Russia. In his message, Boris Nikolayevich  drew attention to the fact that, despite the well-known  difficulties in our bilateral economic relations arising from  the transition to a market economy, our mutual trade increased  by 20 percent in 1993. Because our transportation and  communications system had deteriorated and been interrupted,  which you know about (we now have to pass through eight borders  and customs posts between Sofia and Russia), the president and I  discussed our proposal to find an overall solution for this  problem by restoring the direct sea link between Varna and  Novorossiysk. Dr. Zhelev showed great interest in the  completion of this project.    [Aleksandrov] What problems did you discuss regarding  regional security? What are the prospects for expanding (not  only on paper) our mutually beneficial cooperation in military  production?    [Lobov] Yes, our visit is mainly in connection with security  and cooperation issues in the field of military defense  production. Bulgaria created its army on the basis of Russian  weapons and arms produced in its own military plants, mainly  under licenses granted by Russian enterprises. Of course, your  country has weapons even now that it produces itself, because it  has its own specialists, engineers, and designers. However, Dr.  Zhelev and I agreed that this cooperation in the military  industry field can be continued and further developed on a  mutually beneficial basis, insofar as our economic, financial,  and human resources permit. You yourself realize that it is  illogical for each of us to separately invest immense funds "to  reinvent the bicycle" when it, or at least parts of it, already  exists both in Bulgaria and in Russia. Accordingly, in view of  this fact we should think about how to draw mutual benefit from  it. There is no disagreement between us on this, that is, in  the defense industry we can successfully develop mutual  cooperation, and I hope to investigate the conditions for this  during our visit to Bulgaria.    [Aleksandrov] Mr. Lobov, what concerns you in the Black Sea  region? Bulgaria has signed the Partnership for Peace  initiative, but Russia has yet to sign it....    [Lobov] The problem is that the geopolitical situation has  changed in the Black Sea region and the Balkans. We have to  take these realities into account and consider them carefully,  because we must maintain Russia's defense at a dependable level.  This is why we want the Black Sea basin to remain a zone of  peace, not a region for developing conflicts, and I believe that  not only we Russians but also you people in Bulgaria have an  interest in this!</p>

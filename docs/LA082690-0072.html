			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USING THE U.N. TO SETTLE MIDEAST CRISIS  </P> <P> Why is it every time we have a crisis we are told to send our sons and  daughters in harm's way, and yet others are allowed to profit from it?  </P> <P> I am a stockholder in an oil company, but I do not want to make profit on  someone's blood.  </P> <P> A freeze should be put on everything until it's over; otherwise we are saying,  use our children for cannon fodder for profit. I agree with President Bush's  actions in the Persian Gulf, but not his follow-through.  </P> <P> BRUNO BIAVA  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Takuro Noguchi of the Shanghai Bureau; first paragraph </F> is an introduction]    [Text] It is said that Deng Xiaoping's 9 February TV  appearance has been videotaped in advance. What is he going to  say? Top government leaders seem to be in great fear now. And  in case no appearance is made, stock prices in Hong Kong would  fall drastically.    The night view from the rotating restaurant on the 41st  floor  of the New Jinjiang Hotel, a top-class hotel in central  Shanghai, is certainly excellent.    WEN WEI PO, the Chinese-affiliated Hong Kong paper,  published  an exclusive report in its 10 January issue on a visit to this  hotel by Deng Xiaoping, China's strongest man, on New Year's Day.    Chinese newspapers and TV have never reported such doings of  Deng. In this connection, I promptly took action to confirm  this report. While saying he was told to keep it secret, a  hotel employee said excitedly: "Yes, I did see him. They was  sitting near the window, enjoying both French cuisine and the  night view."    It has become an established custom for Deng to greet the  Spring Festival (the Lunar New Year which falls on 10 February  this year) in Shanghai for the past seven years.  <H5>  "For Further Emancipating the Mind" </H5>   Deng's appearance at the New Year's party televised on  Spring  Festival eve has become the only chance to confirm the health of  the key person who controls China, which has a population of 1.2  billion.    Moreover, his remarks in Shanghai, known as the "Shanghai  Talks," have become more influential than the Constitution.    Regarding his recent arrival in Shanghai, I have obtained  information, from "a source," that "he had arrived in Shanghai  10 December (last year)." In mid-December, there appeared in  the city a large board, 4 meters wide by 3 meters long, which  says: "Development Conforms Well to Reason -- Deng Xiaoping."    The board was put up on a major street about 500 meters from  the Xijiao Hotel, where Deng Xiaoping regularly stays. This  street leads to the Pudong Development Area, which is under  development based on the national policy and where Deng Xiaoping  has visited several times for inspections.    The Xijiao Hotel, located not far from the Shanghai Airport,  is usually available for foreigners. You will see hotel  buildings and restaurants here and there in a large area. When  I tried to enter this area by car, I was stopped by a policeman,  who said: "Under construction now. It is off limits until the  end of the Spring Festival."    In replying to my question as to whether Mr. Deng is staying  there, he smilingly said: "I cannot answer your question."  There is no mistake about his staying there.    A company clerk, who is 42 years old and belongs to the Red  Guards generation of the Great Cultural Revolution, said:  "During the Great Cultural Revolution, schools were closed and  the Chinese people tried to kill one another. We were fed up  with it. Thanks to Deng Xiaoping, our livelihood has become  better. I hope he will live long." As his remarks indicate,  Deng Xiaoping enjoys high appraisal among Shanghai citizens.    So far, Shanghai has paid taxes to the central government.  However, the city could do nothing about its basic investment in  improving its infrastructure. And it was Deng Xiaoping who gave  the go-ahead for the projects, which cost huge amounts of money  and based on the national program.    For Deng Xiaoping, Shanghai is filled with personal  memories.  He spends Spring Festival in Shanghai because it is warmer than  Beijing and also because he wants to pick out talented people  who are qualified to work in the central government.    Both state President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji,  who has been entrusted with the responsibility of managing  economic affairs, have obtained their rather unusual promotions  because of their administrative abilities while serving as  Shanghai mayor.    JIEFANG RIBAO, the municipal Communist Party committee  organ,  frontpaged an article entitled "For Further Emancipating the  Mind" in its 13 January issue. There is no mistake that this  article states principles based on a good understanding of  Deng's ideas.    The vice premier and others are making efforts to put the  brakes on the over-heated enthusiasm in economic activities.  What will become of their efforts after this year's "Shanghai  Talks" have been delivered?    Attention is now concentrated on the Spring Festival party  on  the evening of 9 February. To tell the truth, I have obtained  unconfirmed information that those scenes to be shown on TV  "have already been videotaped."    As for this party's location, it is a secret that has never  been announced in the past.    Reportedly, a visitor to a certain hotel in the city, but  not  the Xijiao Hotel, said he saw a lady who looks very much like  Xiao Rong, Deng Xiaoping's third daughter. Xiao Rong has acted  as sort of a "hearing aid" for her father, who has become hard  of hearing.    Construction work is now under way at this hotel for  remodeling the entrance and the construction is expected to be  completed before the Spring Festival. There is a great  possibility that the party will be held at this hotel.</p>

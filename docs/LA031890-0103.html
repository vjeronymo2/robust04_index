			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> TWO AVOCADO TREES THAT PRODUCE SUPERB FRUIT;  </P> <P> FRUIT: THE NEW GWEN IS ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR SMALL GARDENS, WHILE THE REED HAS  BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS.  </P> <P> Two little-known, but marvelous avocado trees for Southland yards, the Gwen and  the Reed, have one thing in common: They produce fruit of superb flavor and  quality.  </P> <P> The trees are quite different. The Gwen is small and well-suited to small  yards, while the Reed, although slender, may grow up to 35 feet and requires at  least a medium-sized yard.  </P> <P> The size and shape of the fruit from the two trees is also quite different. The  Gwen produces fruit about the size and shape of the typical Hass avocado, while  the Reed produces huge, rounded fruit weighing more than a pound.  </P> <P> Both varieties are not yet popular in the area, but a good choice for Southern  Californians.  </P> <P> The Gwen, with its small size, is more practical for most Southern California  yards. A fairly recent introduction, it was developed by Berthold O. Bergh of  UC Riverside. Although not yet well known, those who have planted it rave about  it.  </P> <P> The tree is only about one-third of the size of a typical avocado tree, yet it  produces huge quantities of fruit that have a magnificent rich, nutty flavor.  </P> <P> Most people consider the Hass (the leading commercial variety) to be the flavor  standard from which other avocados are judged. The Gwen produces fruit whose  flavor equals or exceeds that of the Hass -- perhaps because the Gwen is a  grandchild of the Hass.  </P> <P> The fruit resembles that of the Hass, with its thick, pebbly skin, but unlike  the Hass, the skin does not turn black when it ripens.  </P> <P> The Gwen tree naturally grows to about 15 feet in height, but it can be kept  even smaller because the tree has small limbs and is easy to prune.  </P> <P> Production is another attribute of the Gwen, it produces huge clusters of  fruit. Its total production is usually superior to other avocado varieties  whose trees are much larger. The Gwen bears fruit over a long period, usually  from April through September.  </P> <P> Since the Gwen avocado is fairly new, the trees can be difficult to locate.  </P> <P> Four nurseries usually stock the Gwen trees: Palos Verdes Begonia Farm in  Torrance, (213) 378-2228; Atkins Nursery in Fallbrook, (619) 728-1610; C.P.  Teague Nursery in Corona, (714) 735-2300, and Pacific Tree Farms in Chula Vista  (619) 422-2400.  </P> <P> A nursery can also order one from a wholesale grower such as La Verne Nursery  in San Dimas.  </P> <P> While the Gwen is new, the Reed has been around a long time. Indeed, there are  some magnificent old specimens in Riverside yards. The tall, slim trees are  excellent producers of softball-size fruit with an incredibly rich, buttery  flavor. It is probably the richest flavored avocado in existence.  </P> <P> Reeds take a longer time to bear than Gwen, but once established, the trees are  reliable producers. The harvest period for Reed generally runs from July to  September.  </P> <P> Reed trees can also be difficult to locate; try the sources for Gwen trees  listed above.  </P> <P> Both Gwen and Reed are fairly frost-sensitive. Check with your local nursery  about the climatic conditions in your particular area. If you live in the  colder sections of the Southland's inland valleys, you should select a more  frost-tolerant avocado variety.  </P> <P> An avocado tree needs a sunny planting site that drains well. If allowed to  stand in water, the tree will not survive. It should be kept moist, but never  soggy. Older, mature trees will get along on a less frequent watering schedule  than young trees. However, every fourth or fifth irrigation should be a deep  one to wash away accumulated salt in the soil.  </P> <P> In most Southern California soils the avocado tree will thrive with very little  fertilizer. A light application of an avocado fertilizer containing chelated  iron in the spring on a yearly basis will suffice. Always water thoroughly  after fertilizing.  </P> <P> The avocado tree requires very little pruning, other than for shape and size.  </P> <P> The fruit of the avocado is harvested when it is full-sized and mature, but  still hard. Green-skinned varieties such as the Gwen and Reed are usually  picked when the fruit loses its shine.  </P> <P> A few more tips in harvesting avocados, don't pull them from the tree by the  stem, but use clippers and cut them off as close to the fruit as possible.  </P> <P> Also, never leave the harvested fruit out in the sun because it sunburns  easily. Allow the fruit to ripen at room temperature; this usually takes about  a week.  </P> <P> Sidnam has written garden columns and features for The Times since 1975.  </P> <P> </P></p>

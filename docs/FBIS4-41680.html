			<p>BFN     [Text] A Chinese fishing boat was detained for illegally  fishing in Russian territorial waters on Sunday.    The arrest follows an operation codenamed Zaslon against  poaching and illegal border crossing, launched by the Far  Eastern Border District last Thursday.    The amount of fines imposed on Russian and foreign vessels  since the launching of the operation runs at Rbl 1 billion.  More than Rbl 230 million worth of smuggled goods were seized  and 38 people, most of them Chinese, were detained for illegal  border crossing.    Out of 36 Russian vessels inspected, one was impounded on  charges of trying to smuggle out a load of non-ferrous metal and  large diameter pipes.</p>

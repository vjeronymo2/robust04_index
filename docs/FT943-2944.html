			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Choreography of peace Dancing on eggs, the one to a quick-step the other to a slow, the prime ministers of Ireland and Britain may win an enduring peace in Ulster. Keep your fingers crossed. It is never prudent to assume that the murdering will end. Anything can happen between saying as much and the next day's news. Yet in the fortnight since the IRA announced a complete ceasefire some of the scepticism initially expressed in both London and unionist Belfast has begun to be replaced by hope that the 25 years of troubles really are ending. This was doubtless intimated by Sir Patrick Mayhew when he reported to the British cabinet yesterday. The dossiers prepared by officials for the Northern Ireland secretary will have reinforced the quiet optimism that he has quietly expressed since last December. He has always believed that the joint declaration of principle issued before Christmas by the two heads of government would draw the IRA into normal politics, and away from the 'armed struggle'. Assessments by the security service supported his view. The spooks have been vindicated by events, so far. Yet in the private political discussions that followed yesterday's formal meeting of the cabinet the assembled ministers endorsed the government's cool response to the ceasefire. They could do no less. Any echo of the embrace of Mr Gerry Adams by Irish and American politicians would be a disaster in London or parts of Ulster. The choreography that determines the movements of Mr Albert Reynolds could never be the same as that which directs Mr John Major. Both know this; each understands the other. It would not be surprising if the leader of Sinn Fein was aware of this complicated script. Perhaps he reads drafts on his visits to Dublin. It would be amazing if Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, was not in on the secret, briefed in Downing Street. Yet the pressure from Irish nationalists, and US politicians who freeload upon their cause, has been all one way. Mr Major is urged to make a 'gesture' towards Ulster's Republican community. Recognise that the ceasefire will endure, in spite of the IRA's refusal to call it permanent. Lift the prohibition on broadcasting the voices of members of Sinn Fein. Throw that card away at once. Confine the troops to barracks, as a prelude to bringing them home. Publish constitutional proposals that inject an Irish dimension into the affairs of the island's north-eastern provinces. Free the IRA prisoners . . . Stop right there. Public opinion will need much preconditioning for all of this, but most particularly if the government is to release some of the men responsible for IRA terrorist outrages. The government view is that these are not political prisoners, but criminals. Merely moving a few of them from mainland prisons back to Northern Ireland has already caused a political furore. It is true that comparable releases of ANC and PLO cadres were eventually agreed, but the IRA is not equivalent to those organisations, neither of which had open recourse to the ballot box. Anyhow, the British electorate is as yet unprepared. Most of the items on the above list of nationalist demands will, however, eventually be met - even prisoner paroles. Yet as Mr Reynolds clearly appreciates, to respond to any one of them with greater haste than mainstream unionist opinion could endure might blow the entire process apart. Even the broadcasting ban, which Sir Patrick knows is a nonsense, should be removed only when it is expedient to do so. This does not mean appeasing all unionists all the time. Mr Major's curt dismissal of Mr Ian Paisley last week was delightful to behold. The leader of the Democratic Unionists may be a hero to his electorate, but he is part of the problem. If there is a solution, it will be dictated by political tactics, some of them grubby. The Conservatives who attend next month's party conference in Bournemouth are overwhelmingly sympathetic to the unionists. Many resolutions to that effect, some of them casting doubt on the government's integrity, have been sifted at Tory headquarters. Any democratic politician would be advised to hold out for a few weeks while the IRA is repeatedly asked to append the word 'permanent' to its notification of an end to hostilities. Mr Major is not strongly placed to resist such a temptation. The argument about this troublesome word 'permanent' might disappear in December. By then the IRA armistice, if it holds, will have done so for the full three months envisaged in last year's Irish-British declaration. Before that, but perhaps after the Tory conference, it may pay to lift the broadcasting ban. Perhaps British army patrols in Catholic areas might be curtailed. The expressions of British anguish at the prospect of another US visa being granted to Mr Adams might be muted, at least if the president of Sinn Fein is not to meet President Bill Clinton. The latter piece of theatre might win a few Irish-American votes in the mid-term elections, but it would be the grubbiest political act of all. Mr Major is wise to dampen expectations of British government acquiescence in any such thing. Meanwhile a question pops up. Is there a trade-off between British support for Mr Clinton in Haiti and US agreement to go easy on rolling out the red carpet for Mr Adams? Nothing can easily be done about 'loyalist' terrorism, which still continues. This is the lethal work of several groups, none of them as disciplined as the IRA. The peace process depends on a cessation of activity by 'loyalist' murderers, although that is easier said than brought about. The greater the level of suspicion in unionist areas, the wider the seas in which these gangs can swim. This is not an argument for pandering to the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, but it does add to the case for moving at a pace unionist democrats can accept. Whatever his shortcomings in other areas, Mr Major has shown since he signed the joint declaration with Mr Reynolds that he understands the unionists, at least as much as Mr John Hume, who signed a preparatory article of faith with Mr Adams, understands the nationalists. The ungenerous will say that Mr Major is displaying cool leadership in Ulster because he has no choice. If he and Mr Reynolds achieve peace, history will be kinder than that.</p>

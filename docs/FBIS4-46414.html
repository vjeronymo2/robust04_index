			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah by Rif'at </F> Sayyid Ahmad in Beirut's Southern Suburb; date not given]    [Excerpts] Ahmad: The Arab and Islamic situation  is now experiencing changes and events, especially in light of  developments in the Arab-Zionist conflict. What is your general  assessment of this situation in light of these changes?    Fadlallah: [passage omitted] We notice that the  jihad operations carried out by Islamist Palestinians have  attracted much attention from U.S. officials to the extent that  they deal with 'Arafat based on his rejection of these  operations. They want 'Arafat's rejection to be expressed in  harsh words and strong denunciation, not just regret, when the  United States is satisfied with just expressing regret for all  massacres of Muslims committed by the Jews. [passage omitted]    Monitoring the future, we have to see economic matters in  their strategic perspective; whereas security-wise, we have to  view the future in light of the confrontation with the Islamic  inclination or the difficult conflicts involving native or  national movements that reality generates.    We also have to monitor the new plan America might work out  by encircling the Islamic Republic of Iran through a Middle East  steered by the American strategy that is open to other  strategies in the region.    Ahmad: Are we content with the role of bystander  or do you have a specific vision of this confrontation?    Fadlallah: We talk about monitoring because we are  trying to analyze reality and future prospects. But in the  meantime, we are not neutral regarding that reality. As  Islamists, we seek to revive the Islamic inclination by all  means possible. We have our own rational and diligent study  that measures reality against objectives to distort that  American-Israeli plan. As Islamists, we proceed on the basis of  integration with pan-Arabists, that is if they are determined to  free the Arab political, security, and economic aspects from the  American fist and if they have not already sunk in the dreams  America is trying to make them live by using words like  moderation and so on.    I believe that we have to relate with nationalists,  pan-Arabists, and even with the Marxists who adopt a creed  different from ours. [passage omitted]    Ahmad: A final word by Your Eminence to your  readers in Egypt.    Fadlallah: As I speak about the great Islamic  homeland in Egypt, I tell all our kinsfolk, brothers, and fellow  citizens that they should preserve Egypt as a strength for  Arabs, Muslims, and Africa and as a source of strength for  anyone who seeks freedom and justice.    We believe that the Egyptian nation is one of the best and  most honest, open and loving nations. We do not count on the  regime--any regime--to stand against this intelligence game but  believe that, with its Islamic awareness, Christian openness,  and originality, the Egyptian nation will foil this intelligence  game.    We want to say to the Egyptians--the regime and people--that  the regime will not benefit from this kind of bloodshed, neither  now nor in the future because the international ploy does not  want this nation to be stable. God has urged us to argue our  cases in an amicable way, to promote the cause of God with  wisdom and friendly advice, to act with goodness to turn our  enemies into friends, to be patient over our differences and  problems to know how to reconcile our differences and solve our  problems.    We are sad, very sad, about what is happening in Egypt and  do  not believe that the Islamists mean harm to Egypt or to its  people. Perhaps some people differ with them over certain  methods and concepts but we can only say that they are loyal to  the Egyptian people and the Islamic cause. We remind the  Egyptians of what Imam 'Ali said about the renegades and we do  not want to talk about the Islamists as renegades or talk about  the regime this way. We are not in the habit of characterizing  people but we seek the idea: "Do not fight the renegades for  their mistakes because anyone who seeks right and errs is not  like one who seeks and does what is wrong."    If you claim that the Islamists are wrong--indeed, some of  them use the wrong methods for rightful ends--try to initiate a  broad and the best kind of dialogue to caution them about what  is wrong if there is anything and in this case their Islamic  origins will lead them to retreat from the wrong if they are  convinced. Those who believe that the state's engagement in  dialogue means a loss of prestige for the state are mistaken,  because the state's prestige is commensurate with the protection  it offers to its people and its persuading them to integrate  with it.

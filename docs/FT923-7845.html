			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Warm weather woes for Johnson Cleaners WARM WEATHER and recession combined to depress interim profits at Johnson Group Cleaners, the dry cleaner and textile group, which reported a 4 per cent fall to Pounds 7.91m pre-tax. In a characteristically cautious statement, Mr Terry Greer, chairman, said he expected recessionary conditions in both the US and UK to continue 'for at least the remainder of this year'. Nevertheless, the interim dividend is maintained at 7p for the third consecutive year. Mr Greer added that one of the priorities during recession had been to protect the balance sheet. Controlled capital spending helped cut interest charges by 36 per cent to Pounds 999,000. Gearing was slightly lower than the 39 per cent recorded at the year-end. Dry cleaning in both the US and UK continued to be depressed, with a similar effect on margins. As a result profits in this division had declined rather more than sales. Textile rental, however, increased sales and profits in the first half. Mr Greer said the rate of growth in textile rental was still increasing, albeit more slowly. Losses in the US franchise division had depeened in the first six months. 'It has been harder than we thought it would be in the US,' said Mr Greer. 'There is still no sign of a let-up in recession.' Overall sales fell from Pounds 77.4m to Pounds 74.8m, while operating profits declined 10 per cent to Pounds 8.56m. The pre-tax return included a Pounds 349,000 (Pounds 271,000) surplus on property sales. Earnings per share, including the property surplus, fell from 25.42p to 24.95p. COMMENT For Terry Greer, the ideal summer's day is cold, cloudy and wet. Unfortunately the first half was warm and sunny. There are some things about which even Johnson's management can do nothing. In spite of the adverse climate, which hits Johnson as hard as recession according to Mr Greer, the company did well to keep the profits decline to a mere 4 per cent. The textile rentals division deserves much credit for squeezing business out of a market which has ravaged the likes of BET. It is not likely that Johnson will experience a sharper fall in the second half. Indeed, analysts expect the full year to be almost flat at Pounds 15.5m, compared with Pounds 16m. With a prospective multiple of about 12.5, Johnson could be one of the better shares in the sector to tuck away for the eventual upturn.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Letter: Extent of Uruguay Round boost to trade is underestimated Sir, Samuel Brittan's recent article, 'Trade and macroeconomics' (July 12), contained, as usual, a number of insights and arguments with which I am in complete agreement. Two points, however, warrant clarification. The article refers to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade estimate of 'a Dollars 200bn (Pounds 133bn) per annum increase in world trade from a successful conclusion of the whole Uruguay Round'. In fact, the figure comes from a study by Ian Goldin and Dominique van der Mensbrugghe released last year by the OECD Development Centre. Their figure of Dollars 195bn was quickly rounded to Dollars 200bn. Moreover, the figure is an estimate of the income gain (more goods and services produced from the same amount of resources) from a successful Uruguay Round, rather than an estimated increase in world trade. It is also arguably an underestimate. It takes into account only the increase in market access for merchandise trade expected to result from the Uruguay Round and not increased market access for services. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that the strengthening of the GATT rules and their extension into new areas will also give an important boost to world trade and income by increasing the predictability and stability of international trade rel-ations. Some readers may be puzzled by the cryptic nature of the sentence which, after noting that freer trade reallocates jobs more efficiently inside each country, adds 'but (it) does not directly destroy or create new jobs'. Technically, it is true that freer trade leads to 'fewer jobs than otherwise' in inefficient industries and 'more jobs than otherwise' in export-oriented industries. But it is also true that under a broad set of plausible circumstances, there will be an absolute increase in the number of export-related jobs. That is, freer trade will lead to a net gain in employment in the export sector as compared to the pre-liberalisation period. Moreover, these jobs are likely to be higher-paying ones. In the US, the typical manufacturing job in an export-oriented industry pays 17 per cent more than the economy-wide average, and there is no reason to assume that the situation is very different in western Europe. Freer trade creates new and better-paying jobs. Richard Blackhurst, director, economic research and analysis, GATT Secretariat, 154, rue de Lausanne, Geneva, Switzerland</p>

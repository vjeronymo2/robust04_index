			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Kwik Save acquires 42 Gateway stores KWIK SAVE, the discount food retailer, yesterday announced the Pounds 26.5m acquisition of 42 Gateway Foodmarkets from Isosceles, the group formed to buy-out the complete chain in a Pounds 2.1bn leveraged buy-out in 1989. The price paid for the shops, based in the north-east, is more than double their estimated net asset value of Pounds 12m. Mr Graeme Seabrook, chief executive, defended the premium on the grounds that it would have normally taken up to seven years to have bought so many new shops in communities where Kwik Save does not have a significant presence. He was also pleased to have 'taken out a competitor.' It marks the first sizeable acquisition since Kwik Save bought the Victor Value stores in February 1989. Isosceles had indicated last year that it would keep its Gateway stores in the north-east after a deal to sell 81 outlets to Wm Low for Pounds 212m fell through. However, Isosceles said yesterday that it had only wanted to keep the larger northern stores and was delighted to have sold the 'smaller, older ones' to Kwik Save. The acquisition brings the total number of Kwik Save shops to more than 700. Mr Seabrook said the company, which is opening one new store a week, was looking for more buying opportunities in the Midlands and south-east. A further Pounds 7m has been put aside for the year to install computer scanning and to convert 32 of the stores into Kwik Save outlets and 12 into the Lateshopper format. They will be absorbed into the network over the next two months. A Gallop opinion poll commissioned by the company showed that the shopper was most concerned by the location and the price of goods in stores. All of the acquired Gateway stores were trading profitably. Borrowings were used to fund the acquisition resulting in gearing in single figures. Goodwill is to be written off to revenue reserves.</p>

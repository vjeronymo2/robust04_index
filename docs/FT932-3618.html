			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Du Pont 'knew of Benlate defects' FLORIDA officials have subpoenaed officials at Du Pont, the leading US chemicals group, after concluding from company documents that Du Pont knew its Benlate fungicide had caused crop damage but failed to act. Du Pont suspended payments on Benlate-related suits in November, after extensive research, during which the company said it could not duplicate the effects attributed to Benlate. Florida crop growers allege the fungicide caused Dollars 1bn in crop damage through stunted growth, root damage, twisted and deformed leaves and poor yield. Although most lawsuits centre on crop damage, a few allege that Benlate caused birth defects. In a letter to Mr Bob Crawford, Florida's agriculture commissioner, Du Pont said: 'The issue is whether Benlate, at label rates and under conditions of ordinary commercial use, caused the plant damage reported by growers in Florida and elsewhere after March 1991. Based on all of our scientific testing, the answer is a resounding: No.' Florida officials allege that internal documents show incorrect labels on the product. Mr Edgar Woolard, Du Pont's chief executive, and other officials have been ordered to testify at the state Capitol in July in an effort by the Florida Department of Agriculture to prove that internal documents show the company knew the fungicide had caused problems.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Personal View: Maybe not even jam for east Europe Next Monday in Copenhagen, the EC Commission will propose to the European summit improvements in economic and political relations with central and eastern Europe. This is an attempt to deal with increased dissatisfaction with the European agreements concluded during the past 18 months with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Romania. The improvements include some rather minor acceleration in the trade liberalisation timetable, increased political co-operation, better aid procedures and, most importantly, a much stronger commitment to eventual EC membership. The weaknesses of the trade concessions, however, undermine both immediate export and growth prospects in central and eastern Europe and, in the longer term, the very objective of EC membership. Two categories of protection give particular cause for concern: trade in so-called sensitive products, notably agriculture, textiles and steel; and anti-dumping and safeguards clauses (known as contingent protection). Agriculture, textiles and steel are significant in EC trade with eastern Europe and current protectionist measures are long lasting. On agriculture, Common Agricultural Policy protection is broadly equivalent to 100 per cent tariffs and only very minor concessions are given. On textiles, multi-fibre arrangement quotas still in place will only begin to be dismantled once the Uruguay round is settled and there will be a special safeguard clause. Steel is protected by the general safeguard clause plus special safeguard clauses for the Balkan countries. The Commission proposed speeding up cuts in some EC duties and the rate at which reduced-levy quotas on farm goods are increased; changing some tariff quotas to tariff ceilings with discretionary tariffs; and relaxing rules of origin so goods from other eastern European associates and the European Free Trade Association countries count as local content. These are welcome, if minor, improvements, though at the Foreign Affairs Council on June 9 they were weakened further by the removal of the proposed shift from tariff quotas to ceilings and by putting aside relaxation of rules of origin for later consideration. I contend that the Commission and member states have not properly addressed the issues in eastern Europe. Trade is what is important. Liberalisation need not harm EC workers if accompanied by sensible compensation policies and will in fact benefit EC export industries. For the east Europeans the sensitive products already represent between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of exports to the EC. They are where short-term competitive advantage lies. The contingent protection provisions will stymie the export potential in new industries. Thus the Europe agreements help freeze the structure of industry. This is significant because neither aid nor private capital flows is likely to provide the foreign exchange necessary to fund foreign capital goods needed to re-tool industry. Only increased exports and domestic savings can do that. Significant liberalisation of eastern European trade in sensitive products should not cause notable damage to EC producers. Savings to EC consumers and taxpayers are enough to compensate for producers' losses. Evidence suggests that eastern European imports, including into the former Soviet Union, could expand fourfold to Ecu500bn by 2010. Trade restrictions now, though, will stop it happening. They will slow growth and hence delay and perhaps prevent accession to the EC - the only prize the Community seems willing to offer. What should be done? I would put forward five proposals. Increase levy-free quotas for agricultural goods. Liberalise textile quotas and reduce the timetable from five to three years. Make a commitment now to no new safeguard quotas on steel. Take advantage of the east Europeans' implementation of EC competition law by the mid-1990s and offer to suspend anti-dumping and safeguard clauses once that is done to the Commission's satisfaction. Finally, relax the rules of origin as proposed in the Commission paper. This agenda will offer immediate and long-lasting advantages to east European traders. It increases prospects for growth in eastern European countries and hence the probability that they will become major EC markets as well as EC members. Without such liberalisation there is a danger that EC membership will become an unattainable goal. The improved EC commitment to membership without significant liberalisation is a promise of jam tomorrow and possibly not even that.

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Avoiding a costly mistake - Planning your Pension HOW DO you find a personal pension which is free of high commissions? It is not always easy to distinguish between fees and commission. Many advisers receive a combination of both while an increasingly common practice is for fee chargers to accept 'integral fees' or 'fee compensation' from product providers in lieu of commission when a sale is made. Any outstanding commission is reinvested in your plan. This avoids the 17.5 per cent VAT you would be charged if you paid the adviser yourself but it has the disadvantage of linking the fee to the product sale. Moreover, if you opt for fee compensation to avoid VAT, make sure you know exactly what the adviser is getting. For example, if the charge includes a percentage of the fund, it begins to look more and more like commission and may cost you dear. Under a typical personal pension, if commission is paid up front, it is likely to account for 60 per cent of the first two year's contributions on a regular premium plan. There are several types of low or non-commission personal pensions, for example some of the self invested personal pensions (Sipps) examined earlier in this series. Non-commission plans: The term non-commission is used to describe products where there is no element of remuneration to the intermediary built in to the charging structure. Two prominent 'non-commission' offices, Equitable Life and London Life, do not sell through third parties but instead run direct sales forces whose salaries are in part performance-related, so these products, strictly speaking, are not commission free. Due to the domination of commission-based advisers, non-commission pensions have never really taken off and at present, unit-linked versions are only offered by Professional Life and Provident Life. However, Provident Life already operates a fee compensation system while Professional Life is considering this method of payment. To give an example of a non-commission charging structure, Professional Life's personal pension has an establishment fee of Pounds 2.50 per month for the first five years, an index-linked policy fee of Pounds 2 per month throughout the term of the contract, and an annual management charge. The latter starts at 0.75 per cent on the first Pounds 5,000 and reduces in stages to 0.25 per cent on the whole of the fund where this is more than Pounds 25,000. Unit trust plans: Only three unit trust groups offer a personal pension, namely Gartmore, Fidelity, and Rothschild Asset Management (RAM). Unit trust personal pensions offer a similar investment choice to life office unit-linked plans. Under a unit trust plan, premiums go into a feeder fund and then are directed to the funds of your choice. The main difference between unit trust and unit-linked plans is in the charging structure. Where life office charges can be difficult to decipher, unit trust group charges by law must be explicit. Where unit trust groups pay commission, this is normally around four to 5 per cent. In some cases, even this can be discounted. Gartmore, for example, has a 6 per cent bid / offer spread which includes 4 per cent commission. If the adviser forgoes the commission, this is discounted, leaving an initial charge of just 2 per cent. Gartmore's annual management charge is 1.5 per cent on most funds, reduced to 1.25 per cent on bond funds and 0.75 per cent on deposit funds. There are no other charges, no penalties for stopping and starting contributions and no switch fee. Minimum contributions are Pounds 2,000 for single premiums, Pounds 500 for additional single premiums and Pounds 100 per month for regular premiums. Gartmore has just over Pounds 4m under management on its personal pension plans. The Rothschild Asset Management (RAM) plan has a 5 per cent bid offer spread and 1 per cent annual management charge. There is no minimum premium level. As with Gartmore's plan, there are no extra charges for switching or for stopping and starting. RAM has Pounds 27.5m invested in its personal pension funds. Fidelity makes a one-off administration charge of 1.5 per cent on the first contribution. The bid / offer spread is 5.25 per cent, apart from the cash and the gilt and fixed interest funds, where there is no initial charge. Annual management charges range from 0.5 per cent on the cash fund to 1.5 per cent on the equity growth fund. The minimum initial premium is Pounds 1,000 for a single contribution or Pounds 100 per month. Fidelity has Pounds 30m under management on its personal pension plan. The choice of unit trust personal pensions is limited because most groups, including M &amp; G, Save &amp; Prosper and Mercury, provide unit-linked plans through their life arms. Midland Bank launched a successful unit trust personal pension but switched to a unit-linked product after a couple of years. Alex Weiland, managing director of pooled pensions at Gartmore, says: 'The majority of the unit trust groups prefer to use their life arms to launch unit-linked plans because this gives them greater flexibility in terms of charges. People should look carefully at the early termination penalties that apply if you need to transfer out of a unit-linked plan or terminate the plan early, perhaps because of redundancy. Moreover, life companies frequently use such devices as capital units or reduced allocations in the early years.' Under a typical unit-linked plan, the first two years' premiums are invested in capital or initial units. Capital units carry a higher annual charge than standard or 'accumulation' units. In most cases, this charge continues to be levied throughout the policy term. The other main method of charging under a unit-linked plan mentioned by Weiland is through reduced allocation rates. This means that only a percentage of your premiums actually reach your investment fund - the rest is swallowed up by the life office. A third catch with some unit-linked plans is double charging on in-house unit trusts. In other words, you pay the usual initial charge of around 5 per cent on the feeder fund and then the same charge is imposed a second time when the feeder fund directs your money to the underlying unit trust. Unit trust personal pension regulations prevent double charging. Investment Trusts: As yet, there are no investment trusts operating as personal pension providers. However, you can invest directly in investment trusts through a Sipp or indirectly through unit-linked plans. Skandia's personal pension offers access to the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust and to Fleming's managed fund of investment trusts. Equitable Life's pension also offers a link with a managed fund of investment trusts. Commission reinvested: Mainstream personal pensions can be available on a non-commission or low-commission basis. This is often arranged on a fee basis with the adviser but should not be confused with the execution-only services offered by some pension firms. Insurance companies will not negotiate non-commission terms directly with the public. One problem with commission reinvestment is that advisers are prevented from showing the impact of non-commission terms in their projection analyses. Ian McKenna, partner with independent advisers McKenna &amp; Co, said: 'The life offices have constructed this system with Lautro (the life office regulator) so as to make it virtually impossible for independent advisers to provide valid examples of the impact of enhanced terms on the final payout.' Jim Roberts, general manager of Professional Life, said: 'Thanks to the ridiculous standardised illustrations basis that Lautro / SIB force the market to operate under, all products look the same.' Roberts warned that, even where initial commission has been reinvested, the provider often leaves in place the early surrender and transfer penalties. It is worth checking this point with your adviser. You should also ask what will happen to renewal and incremental commission.</p>

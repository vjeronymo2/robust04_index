			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SELL-OUT IN CENTRAL AMERICA'  </P> <P> While reading Fred C. Ikle's column ("Sell-Out in Central America," Op-Ed Page,  Feb. 26), I was sadly reminded that although the Reagan Administration is now  thankfully out of office and its functionaries are now safely dissipated  throughout the country, its myths and myopic visions still linger.  </P> <P> Ikle laments the "unraveling" of eight years of U.S.-backed democracy-building  in Central America, citing "today's majority view in Congress" as the culprit  behind setbacks in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. But what he fails to  admit is that there was little in these countries to unravel in the first  place, since the Reagan Administration truly did nothing to promote democracy  in Central America.  </P> <P> Ikle's entire argument rests on one very flawed assumption, promoted throughout  Reagan's eight-year tenure -- namely, that "free" elections equate to  democracy. Was El Salvador nearly a true democracy because its peasants were  forced to vote in "free" elections? Was Guatemala becoming equally democratic  because its indigenous population was being relocated to re-education camps?  </P> <P> There can be no denying that the economy in Nicaragua is a shambles (due mostly  to Reagan's obsessive war against that small nation), and that the Sandinistas  have yet to solve this disastrous problem. And, admittedly, certain  restrictions on freedom of speech persist in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> However, there is also no denying the fact that the Sandinistas have not waged  a repressive war against the people of their nation, murdering hundreds of  suspected insurgents and dislocating thousands of peasants.  </P> <P> It infuriates me that people like Ikle expect Nicaragua to prove to the world  that it is moving toward democratic reform, while these same people would have  us complacently believe that El Salvador and Guatemala are burgeoning  democracies going awry, thanks to a Democratic Congress.  </P> <P> Nicaragua has a long road ahead if it is to acquire a buoyant democracy. But,  if the models of El Salvador and Guatemala are to serve as examples, it is  obvious that Reagan-style reforms are not the answer.  </P> <P> CARA SCHNEIDER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

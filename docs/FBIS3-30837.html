[Mazowiecki] "This disagreement, this impossibility to agree  some sort of joint stance, but one that is consistently  implemented, of course encourages agression, encourages the  perpetration of transgressions of human rights with impunity."    In Mazowiecki's view, the very threat of air strikes would  allow the war to be broken off. The leader of the Democratic  Union does not think that NATO will decide to use force.    [Mazowiecki] "We are constantly having to deal with the  situation whereby, if one thing is said in Brussels, the next  day [pauses].... If the ministers say one thing, the next day  the ambassadors of these same countries say something else,  ameliorating it, changing it. This is indeed worthy of  condemnation in this situation--the incapability of adopting a  joint stance."</p>

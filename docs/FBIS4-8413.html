			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 12 (AFP) -- Ukrainian  peacekeepers are to begin arriving in Bosnia on Monday [18  April] to be deployed in Gorazde, a UN spokesman said Tuesday  [12 April].    Fred Eckhard said the 550 troops will travel by different  means to Sarajevo and their arrivals will be staggered.    Some 220 will fly to Bosnia between April 18 and 21, while  330 will travel by train with military equipment, Eckhard said.    He did not say when they would leave Sarajevo for Gorazde  but  Colin Keating, who holds the rotating Security Council  presidency, said it would be as soon as possible.    Ukraine has already sent 710 peacekeepers to Bosnia and  Eckhard did not rule out the possibility that additional troops  could be deployed in Gorazde where there are already a dozen UN  military observers.    Keating indicated that as many as 1,000 could be sent.</p>

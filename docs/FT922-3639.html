			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Libya on IRA links Libya yesterday told a British official in Geneva about its links with the Provisional Irish Republican Army, Our Middle East Staff reports. Mr Edward Chaplin, the British charge d'affaires, said: 'I received some information, I'm transmitting it to London and we shall study it.' Mr Abdul-Atti al-Obeidi, a former Libyan foreign minister who is now ambassador to Tunisia, headed a four-man team at the meeting. He described the atmosphere as 'very friendly'. British officials said they were still sceptical of Libyan intentions and pointed out that Tripoli had not complied with a United Nations resolution demanding that it must hand over two men accused in the bombing of a PanAm airliner over Scotland in 1989.</p>

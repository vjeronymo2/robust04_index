			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / US gives extra Dollars 100m to Haiti The US is to provide Dollars 100m in new funds over the next fiscal year to finance Haiti's economic reconstruction now that President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has returned to power. The new money, part of an ambitious recovery plan announced yesterday, is in addition to the Dollars 100m already budgeted by the US for Haiti in the coming year. The State Department's Agency for International Development (Aid) has also indicated pledges of Dollars 350m from other donors including the World Bank, the Inter American Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. Haiti's donor needs in the first year are estimated at Dollars 555m of which Dollars 272.3m must be available in the first four months of Mr Aristide's new government. The US Treasury Department is co-ordinating a Dollars 83m debt relief plan for Haiti which will clear all arrears until the end of the year. Help with Haiti's balance of payments problems is also contemplated so that depleted inventories can be replenished and the cost of government can be covered until tax collection is sorted out.</p>

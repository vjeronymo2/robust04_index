			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: The best of Broadway - The New York theatre season IT HAS been a much better season for musicals than plays on Broadway, but there were a few bright spots among this season's openings. The best play on Broadway, according to the Tony Awards and also popular wisdom, is Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa. The original actors from the Abbey Theatre of Dublin departed in March, replaced by a mostly American cast, which, word has it, is doing an excellent job. Though flawed, August Wilson's Two Trains Running is certainly the best new American offering on Broadway this year, benefiting from excellent performances including that of a rising young star Larry Fishburne (Boys in the 'Hood), who won the production's only Tony, for best featured actor. Two Trains Running is the latest in Wilson's ongoing series of plays each devoted to a decade of the African-American experience. The play records a week in the life of the denizens of a Pittsburgh cafe in 1969. It is not an overtly political play, but Wilson addresses the era's politics obliquely in the characters' varying methods of coping - or not - with life in the white man's world. The cafe's owner, Memphis Lee, is determined to get his fair share from the city's plan to raze the area for an urban renewal project. His waitress, Risa, (Cynthia Martells) smolders with angry ideas that she can only communicate through her gait as she shuffles languorously around the cafe; she ain't speeding up for nobody. Sterling, (Fishburne), an ex-con, is trying to put his past behind him but can't find work. Hambone, a disturbed drifter, wants justice in the simplest way; forever focused on a ham a white man denied him as payment for a job, he can only say 'I'm gonna get me my ham]' until Sterling teaches him 'Black is beautiful'. The interest in Two Trains Running lies in in the elegance of Wilson's language, his skill in creating memorable characters who reveal themselves through lengthy monologue and symbolic gesture, and in the excellence of its artistic team. Wilson and Richards' fruitful collaboration has included the writer's last five plays; in Two Trains Running the connection between play and production is seamless. The performers are wonderful. Fishburne and Martells' chemistry is palpable, and not enough has been said about Al White's energetic performance as Memphis. Two Trains Running is short on plot and long on talking, and at three hours just plain long, but entering Wilson's world was aided by the predominantly black audience's enthusiastic, vocal response, which created a rare feeling of community. The title of Herb Gardner's Conversations with my Father is a misnomer; it is not about conversations with but rantings by Eddie, a Russian immigrant who changes the name of his bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side every time America's cultural wind shifts, all the time denying his family's Jewish heritage. Gardner is clearly trying to exorcise his father's demons with this autobiographical play, but Eddie/Papa Gardner ends up dominating Conversations with my Father in a way that the author seems unable to control - the world of the play is hopelessly skewed by the father's perspective. Conversations starts out in a familiar memory-play structure, with Gardner's onstage surrogate Charlie (Tony Shalhoub) giving a charming Yiddish-language lesson directly to the audience, but as soon as Eddie takes stage, Charlie retreats to the sidelines, watching helplessly as his father bullies his infant and adolescent selves and everyone else around him. Gardner also allows Eddie to relegate his wife Gusta to the kitchen, frustrating the audience who wants to better understand her relationship to the events of the play, and to enjoy more of Gordana Rashovich's wonderfully quirky performance. Hirsch, in his too-familiar curmudgeon mode, won the Best Actor Tony Award for his performance. Some people go to 12-step recovery programmes to deal with their dysfunction. Neil Simon writes plays that end up on Broadway. His latest offering, Jake's Women, is theatre of and for the age of therapy, a comedy-drama of mostly imagined interactions between a successful novelist and his deceased first wife, his dissatisfied second wife, his daughter, his shrink, his sister, and his girlfriend. This is tinker-toy Pirandello; Simon seems to be just now discovering theatre's capacity to question and reshape reality and memory that other playwrights have been investigating, much more effectively, for years. Simon's best plays, the Brighton Beach Memoirs trilogy and Lost in Yonkers, are full of the rich humour of real people in ridiculously human situations, but the characters in Jake's Women are too cliched and the situations too predictable to be funny, and his gag lines are a poor substitute - they fall flat. Alda, like Hirsch, plays himself, and audiences are flocking to spend a few hours with that lovable sweater-clad persona. Audiences will have to hurry to see the season's biggest star vehicles. Death and the Maiden's producers are not sure yet if they will keep Mike Nichols' production running after Glenn Close, Richard Dreyfuss and Gene Hackman leave in August. Let's hope it closes soon. More worthy of its hype is Gregory Mosher's revival of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, with screen actors Jessica Lange (Frances, Tootsie, Country) as Blanche Dubois and Alec Baldwin (The Marrying Man, The Hunt for Red October) as Stanley Kowalski, which is closing in August. It is not a great production, but serves the play well enough to let Williams' superb craftsmanship come through. What the production lacks is atmosphere - a good Streetcar should make you sweat, but nothing, save Alec Baldwin's gutsy performance, so much as raises the pulse. Baldwin doesn't banish Brando's memory (and who could?), but his portrayal is fresh and energetic, bringing a crude nobility to the role. In contrast, Lange makes her Broadway debut as if she were still playing for the camera; what she's doing is not all that bad, but is too quiet and too finely painted. Amy Madigan (Field of Dreams) as Stella is strangely mannered and her relationship with Stanley too lacking in passion, and Timothy Carhart (Thelma and Louise's would-be rapist) is far too dashing to play the lumpen Mitch.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Sport: An Olympian who is playing for more than a pile of gold - Olympics Keith Wheatley meets sports power-broker Craig Reedie SOMETHING strange is happening around Manchester. Craig Reedie, the new head of the British Olympic Association, has been repeatedly caught in full vocal and physical support of the odd notion that Britain, and this northern city in particular, should host the Olympic Games in 2000. He is well aware that such muscular advocacy is hardly the recent heritage of the BOA. 'I was always more committed to the Manchester bid than my predecessors,' says the chatty Scotsman who became chairman last autumn. His election was a signal to the sporting world that the BOA intended to punch its weight and cease being just a quadrennial umbrella for sporting toffs. Reedie has ended Britain's carping isolation from the International Olympic Committee's base in Lausanne. Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC's autocratic but effective head, no longer has cause to feel that Britain is a sniper's base for those who lament the involvement of the Olympics in big money and big business. 'One might not like everything about it but you're either on the train or off it, and I intend that Britain stays on it,' says Reedie, 58, a partner in a Renfrewshire pensions consultancy. He is a consummate sports politician, with a lifetime of international contacts garnered in the service of the international badminton federation (he was no mean competitor and as a golfer plays off a one handicap). Recently, the Princess Royal paid a private visit to Manchester in her capacity as BOA president and an active supporter of the 2000 bid. She is notoriously not the easiest of companions, but she was in chatty good humour as she bantered with Reedie on a coach ride through the various Manchester building sites that may become venues. The Princess is one of the 92 IOC members who will vote in Monaco on September 23 on the city to hold the millennium Games. Few know this quirky, independent and idiosyncratic electorate as well as the Princess and Reedie. Their joint analysis of what the IOC wants from a candidate city is proving invaluable to Manchester's indefatigable bid chairman Bob Scott. What, for example, is likely to be the extent of any moral opposition to the Beijing bid, currently seen as favourite to win? 'You can gauge the IOC's stance on human rights and moral nuance pretty accurately by the fact that over half of them attended the Asian Games in Beijing, less than a year after Tiananmen Square,' predicts Reedie. 'I just don't think it will be an issue.' If it isn't, that will notbe the fault of the other front-running candidate, Sydney. Phrases such as 'mopping up the blood of the massacred with the Olympic flag,' have been heard from the Australian bid chairman. 'It's a startling phrase but I wouldn't want you to hear it from my lips,' said Scott. Worries that the British bid would founder if it were seen as the Bob Scott roadshow - certainly a weakness of the 1996 bid - have been assuaged by the arrival of Reedie. The third member of the new 'Bob 'n' Craig 'n' John' triumvirate is even more powerful if only because he holds the nation's cheque book. Since mid-1992, John Major, the prime minister, has become a central player in the Manchester bid. Wednesday's Downing Street news conference announced a total of Pounds 75m towards stadia and infrastructure. This represents, according to the Department of the Environment's Jeff Jacobs 'by far the biggest single city urban regeneration package Britain has ever seen'. Major has done far more than simply order the Treasury to pay up. He visited the Barcelona Olympics, showing an unprecedented interest in sport for a British prime minister. Next month he goes to Lausanne to spend two days with Samaranch at whose court Major's name is spoken with increasing warmth. Samaranch, according to Reedie, has told intimates that a British government-backed bid is a serious play. Margaret Thatcher never more than tolerated Scott and his audacious plans. An even bigger coup would be to have the 'Bob 'n' Craig 'n' John' show make the final presentation to the IOC election meeting in September. No one is discounting the likelihood of that. After the magic of Barcelona and the oomph it gave to the entire Spanish-speaking world, it would be a brave Prime Minister who did not attempt to break the gloom of the recession by trying to bring the Olympic circus to Britain. This involvement of Downing Street could have even bigger and more tangible pay-offs for Reedie and British sport in general. The Olympic bid is an interesting long shot that may, or may not, come off. What is certain is the desperate need for structural reform within the grant-receiving bureaucracy of British sport. Hands up those who comprehend the different roles of the Sports Council (in all its regional and sub-national guises) and the Central Council for Physical Recreation, umbrella of the governing bodies. Their powers overlap and this has caused endless confusion, even among sports officials, and bitter battles. Reedie has long been impatient for change and he has now got his vehicle alongside the politician who could provide it. As a self-professed sports fanatic, Major's eyes will not glaze over when the subject comes up. 'We are the only independently funded body among the ones you're discussing and it can be an advantage when one gets into these sorts of debates about long-term structure,' says Reedie. In each Olympic cycle the BOA goes out and raises its own funds in a strong, businesslike way. It has bred a sturdy culture distinct from the hand-out dependent operations of the Sports Council and the CCPR. Of course, budgets of the size wielded by the Sports Council - approaching Pounds 200m a year - are quite different from the Pounds 5m or so the BOA spends in an Olympic year. Nevertheless, with the national lottery about to start disgorging huge sums for sport, Whitehall is known to be looking around for new role models.</p>

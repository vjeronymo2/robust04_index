			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Five House of  Representatives members of the main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) bolted the party and another five members  plan to quit the party, LDP sources said Friday.    The move came amid reports that former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe has decided to break away from the LDP, launch a  new party and vie to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa.    Michihiko Kano, Masahiko Kitagawa, Goji Sakamoto, Takao Sato  and Teruhiko Mashiko, members of a faction led by former Trade  Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, submitted letters of resignation to  the LDP leadership, party officials said.    Seiichi Ota, Shokei Arai, Koji Kakizawa, Taku Yamamoto and  Shizuo Sato also plan to quit the party, the party sources said.    Earlier in the day LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told a  news conference the LDP should maintain unity over the choice of  its candidate for the premiership.    "In any event, the best way for our party to return to power  is to pull together and remain united," Mori said.    Mori said he will closely monitor a meeting between LDP  President Yohei Kono and Watanabe on Friday afternoon.    Kono is expected to ask Watanabe not to run for the  premiership in order to avoid a major split of the LDP.    Kano told reporters his group will form a new party aimed at  bringing about a realignment of political parties. Kano's group  is expected to team up with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a  key party in the coalition. Ota and four others are members of  a suprafaction policy study group called "liberals," which has  urged Watanabe to run for the premiership.</p>

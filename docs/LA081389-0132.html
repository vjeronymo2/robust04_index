			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> At least 70,000 people waving nationalist flags and banners packed the central  square in Baku, the capital of Soviet Azerbaijan, to demand greater autonomy  and new parliamentary elections. The demonstration was organized by the  republic's fledgling Popular Front movement, which aims to promote economic and  political autonomy from Moscow. Many participants waved red, green and white  flags with a crescent and star, the national banner during Azerbaijan's time as  an independent republic from 1918 to 1920. Activists said their main demands  are for an end to Moscow's direct administration of the Azerbaijani territory  of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is also claimed by Armenia; more powers for the  Azerbaijani Parliament, and new elections to the national Parliament.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on  Havana radio and television in Spanish on 16 and 17 March.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 16 March reports that (Miguel  Marul), president of the Executive Committee of the People's  Government in the municipality of the Isle of Youth, has  departed for Italy, which maintains close relations with our  country and especially with the Isle of Youth. (Marul) said that  the objective of his trip is to establish cooperation agreements  and relations of friendship with Bologna and Capri.    Radio Reloj at 2034 GMT on 16 March reports that protocols  have been signed making sister cities of Matanzas and Leon,  Spain.    Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 16 March reports that a  group of 20 managers and experts from Canadian mining companies  has toured geologic and mining areas of Matanzas, Pinar del Rio,  Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Holguin, Camaguey, and Villa Clara  Provinces looking into investment potential. The tour falls  within the activities prior to the annual convention of Canadian  prospectors and was organized by the firm (Carib-Gold) and  Cuba's (Geominera S.A.). The president of (Carib-Gold) expressed  satisfaction with the results of the visit, as well as great  optimism, saying in English: "I think it is inevitable we will  have more business with Cuba." He added: "Up to now we have had  only smaller companies that are willing to take higher risks and  invest in Cuba, but I think that this trip is showing there is  now an interest from some of the major international mining  companies." Six Canadian mining companies are working in Cuba,  and another two will begin work in Villa Clara.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 17 March reports that the  Sergio  Perez Castillo fertilizer mixer plant in Holguin has been  70-percent repaired with the purpose of recovering the maximum  capacity of 500 tons daily. Current investments to recover  production in Holguin surpass 700,000 pesos.    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports from Camaguey that bad  road conditions in the country have prompted national and  provincial experts to exchange ideas and experience in the use  of alternative materials in repaving and repairing roads. It  reported that Cuba has 14,000 km of paved roads, not counting  urban and perimeter areas, and that because the distribution of  asphalt has been reduced since 1989, Cuban crude oil is being  used in the asphalt mixture, with solid experience obtained in  Matanzas and Villa Clara.    Radio Rebelde adds that Cuba received almost 250,000  tourists  last year as a result of Cubanacan operations. This represents  almost 40 percent of the foreign tourists visiting the country.  These operations have brought some $96 million to the country,  although financial contributions by other tourist companies,  such as civil aviation, have increased this figure to $700  million. Cubanacan's manager said that tourism activity in 1994  will surely meet Cuba's goal of 30,000 rooms to shelter 1  million tourists, who would leave $1 billion in the country.    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that Chinese  Ambassador  to Cuba Xu Yicong has delivered a donation of clothing and  school supplies for the municipalities of Arroyo Naranjo and  Playa. Pedro Chavez, president of the Havana Provincial  Assembly, and other local officials were present at the  ceremony. The Chinese ambassador said that this donation is a  contribution of the embassy personnel to the country's efforts  in these difficult times.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 17 March reports that the  breakdown of one of the generators of the Carlos Manuel de  Cespedes thermoelectric plant in Cienfuegos has caused blackouts  in the capital and other parts of the country, including some  circuits not usually affected because of the existence of food  processing plants or other establishments of priority  importance. Extreme efforts are being made in this plant to  restore the supply of electricity as soon as possible.    In the same newscast, Progreso reports that Sugar Industry  Minister Nelson Torres Perez has noted the importance of the  current stage for sugar production. Speaking on behalf of the  coordination and support group and of the commander in chief, he  stressed the crucial need to increase production and to defend  efficiency.    Progreso adds that workers of the petroleum drilling and  extraction company in the municipality of Cardenas in Matanzas  have promised to extract approximately 1 million tons of crude  oil this year. Engineer Marcos Aguilera, company director, said  they intend to produce 230,000 tons by the end of March, which  is 28,000 tons more than the current plan. Last year the company  produced 815,000 tons of crude, or 158,000 tons more than in  1992.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 17 March reports that workers  of  the 1 de Mayo Industrial Gas Plant in Havana are working hard to  put the generator back into operation with a greater capacity to  stabilize the production of oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and  compressed air. The main fractionating line of 550 cubic meters  daily broke down at the end of last year. While repairs are  under way, workers are performing complete maintenance on the  plant.    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that cane cutters from  the transport union in Havana Province have reached their  objective of cutting 1 million arrobas of cane in tribute to the  116th anniversary of the Baragua protest.</p>

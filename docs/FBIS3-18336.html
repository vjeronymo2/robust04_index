[Mattioli] A clear-skies policy over Bosnia has been in  force  for months and it has been violated hundreds of times, why has  NATO decided to react right now?    [Woerner] It has not been violated -- as you say -- hundreds  of times. This is the first violation by jets. We tolerated  violations of the policy by helicopters because from a military  point of view they were not significant. These were  jet-fighters and furthermore our pilots saw them bomb targets on  the ground.    [Mattioli] This was the first military engagement for a  military alliance that has existed for 45 years, how do you feel?    [Woerner] Of course it is always preferable to avoid using  force. In general we want to achieve our objectives without  using force. However, we cannot tolerate violations of UN  decisions using force, and so we went from words to actions. We  are determined and I believe we have given a basic lesson that  means that now everyone must take NATO seriously.    [Mattioli] Do you not fear that the war will be extended?    [Woerner] No, not at all, in fact it is more likely that the  opposite will happen. I believe that in the future the no-fly  zone will be respected.</p>

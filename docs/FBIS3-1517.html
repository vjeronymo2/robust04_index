			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   ANC To Escalate Mass Action in kwaZulu/Natal--Johannesburg  THE CITIZEN in English on 28 March in its page-6 editorial notes  that according to pollsters "there is no doubt that the ANC  [African National Congress] will win hands down -- and might  even get a two-thirds majority. Sadly, the ANC has become  arrogant and intolerant." ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa  has announced that the ANC would "escalate its rolling mass  action" in kwaZulu/Natal "until Chief Buthelezi guarantees free  political activity in the region. The danger that the low-key  civil war there could flare into a full-scale conflict does not  worry the ANC -- it is not going to give up its plan to topple  Chief Buthelezi and it will proceed whatever the consequences."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   State May Have To Consider State of Emergency -- Referring  to  the violence that erupted in the wake of the Zulu rally in  Johannesburg on 28 March, Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 29  March in a page-14 editorial says: "Any parties, or leaders  playing a political role -- as Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is  playing in this period -- have to ask themselves two questions  among others. First, will our planned action have the  effect of being provocative, and placing lives at risk? It  is no defence to say this was not the intention. Second, have  we ensured that none of our supporters is armed? Again, it is  not good enough to say one didn't know. If political leaders --  from whatever party -- are not prepared to honour these basic  responsibilities, then they invite inevitable illiberal censure:  the temporary prohibition of some or all high-risk  demonstrations." "A reversion to state of emergency politics  would inevitably open the door to political abuse, and it would  tragically mar the birth of the new South Africa. But if  politicians are so cynical as to actively explore the Bosnia  option, then it is a step that might have to be considered."    Only SADF Can Impose Free Political Activity in Natal -- A  second editorial on the same page believes that if all else  fails "one thing would stand between South Africa and a descent  into utter chaos -- the presence of an effective and apolitical  Defence Force." The South African Defense Force (SADF) has been  called on recently to restore order in Bophuthatswana, Ciskei,  and Lebowa. "The SADF could yet face its stiffest challenge in  kwaZulu. As matters there deteriorate, pressure is building up  for a deployment of troops. Both ANC secretary-general Cyril  Ramaphosa and the organisation's kwaZulu/Natal premiership  candidate, Jacob Zuma, have called on the TEC [Transitional  Executive Council] to send troops into the region. It is no  longer a far-fetched prospect, and nor is it one to relish. But  if free political activity has to be imposed, only the SADF can  do it."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Attempts To Overthrow Kwazulu To Have `Horrendous Costs' --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 29 March in a page-16  editorial also refers to the rally "called by traditional Zulu  leaders in support of their king."    "The Johannesburg chaos, it should be noted, was not  exceptional compared with the violence that has afflicted black  residential communities on the East and West Rand, and in many  parts of Natal, with the loss of thousands of lives. Strife of  this magnitude rarely comes to the city centres, so for those  not used to life in the townships it was particularly alarming."  The events in Johannesburg "are evidence that ANC attempts to  overthrow kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and  Buthelezi's apparent resistance to a political settlement which  may cost him his office, will have horrendous costs, possibly  more than the economy can afford. The election must go ahead.  But the chances of it being universally free and fair are  declining. And it is almost too late to halt the spiral."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Editorial Blames IFP for Johannesburg Rally Violence --  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 29 March in a page-8  editorial places the blame for the deaths linked to the protest  march in Johannesburg "squarely on the leadership of the Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP]. Nobody is fooled by people changing names  at the drop of a hat -- one minute they are IFP leaders and the  next they are `Zulus' protesting rather strenuously that they  are not speaking for the IFP." SOWETAN also believes the  violence "could only have been premeditated. First, there has  been war talk from the leadership of the IFP; then there was the  turning of a blind eye on the weapons that were displayed during  the march; and finally there was the glaring absence of marshals  to control the huge crowds."</p>

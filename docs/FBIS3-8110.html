"We share France's view that an agreement must be reached  with the Serbs," Granic said after a meeting with French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe. Croats will suggest "the Serbs join this  federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina on the same conditions which  have been accepted by the other two parties (Croats and  Moslems), and the negotiations which are going to start" in the  wake of the federation agreement signed Tuesday in Washington.    However Croatia would seek "the support of France and the  European Union to get back" land captured by Serbs in Croatia,  he said. "Of course we want to normalize relations with  Belgrade, but this can only be done with reintegration, through  peaceful means, of (Serb-) occupied territories in Croatia, as  is provided for in the plan signed in Washington."    Granic also said he "agreed the humanitarian situation  should  improve as quickly as possible" in Bosnia. Humanitarian convoys  must be allowed to travel unhindered through central Bosnia and  "all prisoners" of war should be freed.    Juppe for his part said France believed "there could be no  stable settlement unless the Serb community were associated"  with the federation agreement. He stressed the "situation on  the ground must improve" and noted the "air network" set up by  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations to  discourage renewed hostilities remained "in effect."    Juppe said a "global settlement" of the almost two-year-old  Bosnian conflict meant "active participation by the Americans,  Russians, and Europeans" and that the European Union "will  participate in the region's reconstruction" once peace has  returned.</p>

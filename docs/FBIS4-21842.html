			<p>BFN     [Text] PHNOM PENH, April 3 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge [KR]  guerrillas abducted an American woman with the Christian relief  organization Food for the Hungry International (FHI) last week  and have held her hostage for four days while demanding that the  aid group digs them wells, the FHI director here said Sunday.    Melissa Himes, 25, from California, was abducted with eight  Cambodian colleagues Thursday in southern Kampot province when  they went to try to retrieve their truck that had been stolen at  gunpoint from a work site near the Khmer Rouge zone, FHI country  director Alan Haslett said.    Five Cambodians were let go on Friday with the demand that  FHI agree to dig wells in their zone, he said. Himes and three  colleagues remained captive through the weekend, he said.    "They have not asked for any money. I think they want wells  put in specific villages," Haslett said. "They are holding our  truck as well."    The released Cambodians said they had been well-treated but  that they "had to pay for their dinner" with their captors, he  said.    FHI had sent a message agreeing to discuss ways to meet the  demand, but had not heard back yet from the Khmer Rouge, Haslett  said.    "We're a Christian organization and we're here to help  everyone" including people living under Khmer Rouge control,  Haslett said. "We would like to find ways to help them  (Cambodians) equally."    Himes has lived in Cambodia since January 1993, speaks the  Khmer language well and has a good relationship with Cambodians  living in the area, Haslett said.    Kampot, bordering the sea 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of  Phnom Penh, is traversed by a mountain range harboring the Khmer  Rouge guerrillas at the very end of the organization's supply  lines. Guerrilla sorties to steal food in government-controlled  valleys are common, and villagers are sometimes taken hostage in  exchange for rice or cows.    The Khmer Rouge stole a number of UN cars during the United  Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, which ended in late  1993, and several UN peacekeepers were held hostage during the  incidents. All were treated relatively well and later set free  after negotiations.    The Food for the Hungry International (FHI) project in  Kampot  focuses on improving rural water supplies and on agricultural  development. FHI is a Christian organization headquartered in  Geneva and operates in 16 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin  America.</p>

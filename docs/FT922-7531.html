			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / European Bonds: Bund's dethroning appears plausible THE European bond markets last week continued to flirt with what until recently was unthinkable: the overturning of the bund as the lynch-pin of European Community markets. The French franc's strong advance during the week was the main factor. From FFr3.3658 to the D-Mark on Monday, the currency strengthened to FFr3.3498 by Wednesday. Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said the franc would have to fall well below its ERM central rate (FFr3.3539) before any rate cut could be considered. By the end of the week, the franc had risen back above the central rate and a bout of profit-taking wiped some of the gains from French government bonds  -even as the latest consumer price figures for April were released, confirming France's good inflation record with a year-on-year rise of 3.1 per cent. By the end of the week, yields on French bonds had inched still closer to their German counterparts: the 10-year yield spread had narrowed to around 60 basis points, having fallen sharply from some 75 basis points at the start of the month. UK gilts, meanwhile, have followed a similar path - though both the UK and France are expected to hold back from cutting interest rates below German levels. Events in Germany in the coming days could determine whether the bund is finally to be dethroned. The pay dispute involving the IG Metall union still seemed yesterday to be on course towards outright confrontation and a strike ballot. By the end of the week, money supply data will begin to emerge for April. March brought M3 growth at 9.7 per cent, well outside the Bundesbank's target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent. April, according to many analysts, will be even worse, with M3 growth hitting as high as 10 per cent. The market does not expect the Bundesbank council on Thursday to raise interest rates - if only because to do so would encourage investors to put more cash into short-term deposits, thereby pushing M3 still higher.</p>

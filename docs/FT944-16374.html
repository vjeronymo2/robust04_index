			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: UAP shares slide in wake of results Shares in Union des Assurances de Paris, one of France's largest insurance group, fell yesterday after it posted figures indicating the impact of turbulent bond and equity markets on its assets had been worse than expected. UAP shares dropped FFr6.80 to FFr131.70 following publication of results late on Tuesday showing consolidated profits down 22 per cent to FFr853m (Dollars 161.2m) in the first six months of the year. Mr Jacques Friedman, UAP chairman, predicted that final 1994 results would show an improvement over 1993, 'but not to the extent of the objectives we had set ourselves in very different conditions a few months ago'. The group revealed yesterday that the market value of its insurance companies' investments was FFr625bn at the end of June, compared with FFr672bn at the end of last year. Unrealised capital gains fell to FFr45bn at the end of June from FFr81bn at the end of last year. Analysts attributed the drop largely to the performance of European bonds and equities. Though UAP believes that insurance market conditions are improving, it acknowledged that the deterioration of property as well as financial markets had a negative impact on its results. The group expects Banque Worms, the combined commercial, merchant and investment bank it controls, to break even in 1995 and make a profit the following year. The bank is estimated to have cost UAP FFr6bn since 1991 but many of the banks worst property loans have been transfered to insurance divisions. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO MOVE SHERIFF'S COPTER SQUAD MOVE FROM L.B. IS OPPOSED  </P> <P> The Pomona City Council has voted to oppose a plan by the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department to move its helicopter squadron from Long Beach Airport to  Brackett Field in La Verne.  </P> <P> The move to nearby La Verne would "jeopardize the safety, security, peace and  quiet of the residents of Pomona," the council declared Monday.  </P> <P> The department is considering moving its squadron to La Verne because of a rent  increase at Long Beach Airport.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Cmdr. Lee Baca said the move would require approval of the Los  Angeles County Board of Supervisors after public hearings.  </P> <P> He also said that the move is at least a year or two away and that the squadron  has operated without complaint from neighbors in Long Beach. "We don't fly 17  helicopters all at the same time," he said.  </P></p>

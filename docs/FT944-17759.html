			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Moody's upgrades Unibank's debt rating The senior long-term debt of Unibank, Denmark's second largest commercial bank, has been upgraded by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, to A1 from A2. Unibank suffered three years of substantial losses from 1990 to 1992 but returned to a net profit of DKr885m (Dollars 145.69m) in 1993. In the first half of this year it made DKr207m after loss provisions had been cut to DKr950m from DKr1.54bn a year earlier. The first-half performance was marred, however, by unrealised losses on the bond and share portfolio of DKr533m. Moody's noted an improvement over the past few years in asset quality, earnings and capital, as well as progress in reducing what the agency described as the bank's 'historically high expense base'. Unibank's recovery began when a new chief executive, Mr Thorleif Krarup, was brought in 1992 and immediately implemented a new round of cost-cutting measures.</p>

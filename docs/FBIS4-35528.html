			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'Ashrawi Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F> My Rejection of the Information Portfolio in the Authority is  in Line With My Previous Positions"]    [Excerpts] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi,  former spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to Washington  negotiations, has said that her refusal to assume the  information ministry portfolio offered to her recently was in  line with her previous position.    Replying to the numerous questions aroused by her  participation in the authority council's meetings without being  a member of it, 'Ashrawi told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: From the  outset I have chosen to lead the independent Palestinian  committee for human rights. It was my commitment, especially as  it is an agency working for the sake of achieving the  Palestinian people's public welfare.    'Ashrawi said that "what is more important than holding  posts  and assuming portfolios is to agree on a foundation and a  binding working program from which the National Authority  Council's work proceeds." That is what prompted her to  participate in its meetings and in drafting its program to  ensure that the principles and aims binding on the authority  council have been prepared and drafted by numerous people from  among the Palestinian people. [passage omitted]    Responding to a statement by a Palestinian oppositionist, in  which he said that in joining the authority council 'Ashrawi is  exercising oneupmanship over the opposition, she said: "It has  nothing to do with oneupmanship at all. I am not an  oppositionist. Nor am I part of the authority. I am just part  of society. And I believe that the language of oneupmanship  have gone and been overtaken by events." [passage omitted]</p>

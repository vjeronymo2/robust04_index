In an interview for Russia's newsmen, he said the leaders of  the republic are seeking peace and accord between the different  political forces, but national revival is hampered by the armed  opposition, which continues attempts from neighboring  Afghanistan to infiltrate deep inside the republic. And in that  connection, Imamali Rakhmanov assessed highly the actions of the  CIS collective peacekeeping forces stationed in Tajikistan.  They play an important role in stabilizing the situation on the  Tajik-Afghan border.</p>

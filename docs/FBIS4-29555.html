			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Impudent Move"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today  comments on the move of the Japanese authorities to be a  permanent member of the United Nations Security Council [UNSC],  which is becoming all the more unscrupulous.    Recalling that the Japanese delegate at a meeting of the  committee on the reform of the UN Security Council formally  declared the wish of Japan to be a permanent member, the analyst  says:    This is, indeed, a ridiculous and impudent act.    Japan has neither qualification nor confidence for a  permanent member of the UN Security Council.    Japan is, above all, an "enemy state" which has not honestly  repented of and liquidated her blood-stained past, though 50  years have passed since the end of the Second World War, but is  defending and trying to justify the war of aggression committed  by her.    The Japanese ruling quarters are working round the clock to  turn Japan into a military power and arm her with nuclear  weapons, with the tag of "enemy state" still attached to her.  Worse still, the Japanese authorities unhesitatingly commit  suppression of foreign citizens in Japan and their organizations  by mobilizing power. They have instituted the "law on  cooperation in UN peace-keeping operations" and is now hastening  the preparation of "emergency security legislative arrangements"  to open a broad road for aggression overseas.    The Japanese ruling quarters are loud-mouthed about  "international contribution". But they must clearly understand  that Japan still remains a target of accusation and denunciation  by the Asian people, far from enjoying their confidence, because  she is evading the liquidation of the past and stepping into the  old- fashioned shoes of aggression overseas.    They must not impudently eye the permanent membership of the  UN Security Council, but properly liquidate the past, first of  all, and renounce the scheme of overseas aggression.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Appointments: 'Making things happen' at Harry's Harry Ramsden, the Yorkshire-based fish and chip shop that claims to be the world's largest, has lured 31-year-old Russell Scott from Whitbread into the newly-created board post of operations director. Scott, who has one A-level in computer studies, has risen speedily through the retail trade since depressed economic conditions in the late 1970s put him off his initial career choice of engineering. His training began at McDonald's, where he was soon running the Marble Arch outlet. This stood him in good stead with John Barnes, Harry Ramsden's chairman, who reckons that the American hamburger company's grooming teaches young managers as much as the average class-ically-trained manager in a British company knows only by the time he is in his 50s. Other jobs included establishing Beefeater in Germany; acting as new concept director of Pizza Hut; and latterly, integrating Berni Inns into the Whitbread group. Barnes, a Londoner, who mostly steers away from opening new shops in the south east, with the exception of Heathrow airport, because 'customers are too fickle', explains that the recent growth of Harry's outlets domestically, coupled with ambitious international plans, dictate the need for an operations director. Contrasting the layers of bureaucracy in most large brewers with the style at Harry's - where the chairman seems happy to send his own faxes - Barnes says he can offer an individual the scope 'really to make things happen'. Scott joins a well-travelled group whose ambitions have not been dented by difficult trading conditions at home; the USM-listed company intends to go to Hong Kong with a joint venture franchise this summer where it will be relying heavily on the experience of its Yorkshire finance director - who just happens to speak fluent Mandarin.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei turns lower on arbitrage-related selling WHILE THE Nikkei average turned lower on arbitrage-related selling, sentiment remained positive on the strength of the yen and advances in overseas markets, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed 99.56 off at 18,508.53 after a day's high of 18,716.58 and low of 18,486.89. A rise in the futures market had moved equities higher in the morning. Volume totalled 400m shares, up from 394m. Dealers led the activity, with investment trusts and foreigners staying on the buy side. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 2.40 to 1,385.81, but advances remained ahead of declines at the close by 577 to 401, with 154 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.08 firmer at 1,106.74. Traders said most participants had become confident that 17,000 is now a firm support level for the Nikkei. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said domestic institutions were buying cautiously but not actively chasing the rally. 'Some institutions expect another buying opportunity at 17,000,' he added. A total of 24 issues reached new highs for the year, while three, including Sekisui Chemical, fell to new lows. Sekisui dropped Y36 to Y885 as investors, discouraged by the company's losses on securities investment, continued to sell the shares. Speculative stocks, which had been bought by dealers, fell on profit-taking. Meiji Milk Products receded Y29 to Y915 and Morinaga Milk Y8 to Y839. However, Okamoto, the condom maker, added Y30 at Y1,420 on continued dealer buying. Blue chip electricals, which had gained ground on bargain hunting, eased on light profit-taking by institutions. Sanyo Electric declined Y12 to Y481 and Toshiba Y2 to Y660. Housing-related issues rose on firm condominium sales figures for April, Haseko gaining Y20 to Y635 and Daikyo Y30 to Y1,180. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone recovered Y8,000 to Y646,000. Investors were encouraged by finance minister Mr Tsutomu Hata's comment that the government would consider measures to support the stock. The statement follows calls by Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, a business leader, for official support of NTT's share price. Foreign investors bought machinery issues. Toshiba Machine climbed Y37 to Y841 and Hitachi Seiki Y52 to Y600. In Osaka, the OSE average finished 72.67 higher at 21,286.41 in volume of 24.5m shares. Individuals sought low-priced laggards, and textile and machinery shares advanced.

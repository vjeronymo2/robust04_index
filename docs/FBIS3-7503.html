			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- A net liquidity surplus of  5.70 trillion yen is expected in the banking system in April,  the Bank of Japan [BOJ] said Tuesday [29 March]. The projected  surplus -- excluding government bond issuance -- stems from 6.90  trillion yen in net inflow of treasury funds against 1.20  trillion yen in net cash outflow, the central bank said.    The net surplus is down from 7.34 trillion yen posted last  April, with net cash outflow lower than a year-earlier 1.64  trillion yen but net fiscal inflow also down from 8.98 trillion  yen.    The outstanding cash balance is estimated to post a  year-on-year 4.5 percent growth at the end of April, maintaining  the recent uptrend in the 4 percent level, a bank official said.  The expected lower cash outflow is due to a technical factor,  the official said.    The net fiscal inflow includes 4.29 trillion yen in public  works, up from 3.29 trillion yen, and 1.51 trillion yen in bond  redemption, almost unchanged from 1.50 trillion yen.    The lower projection in fiscal inflow stems expected lower  inflow from special accounts, including government-backed  financial institutions.    The special account inflow is estimated at 830 billion yen,  down from 1.12 trillion yen, resulting chiefly from expected  smaller inflow from housing loans in reaction to the previous  year's sharp rise.</p>

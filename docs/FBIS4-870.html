			<p>BFN     [Text] Niamey, 18 Apr (AFP) -- Niger opposition party  supporters appeared disconcerted this morning after the arrest  of their main leaders. They hesitated between the desire to  fight back and the need to avoid plunging the country into  chaos. Apparent calm prevailed in the Niger capital where  streets, which are still strewn with broken glass, melted tires,  and charred tree trunks, testified to the degree of violence  that marked the demonstrations which resulted in one death and  24 injured on 16 April. In all, 87 people were arrested, among  them leaders of the three main opposition parties which had  called the previous day for a civil disobedience campaign to  protest the exclusion of their cadres from the management of the  country.    This morning, civil servants of all political leanings  reported normally to their administrative services. "This  country belongs to us. If it collapses, we will perish," a  government employee -- a well-known opposition activist --  stated. "Our leaders called on us to observe a peaceful civil  disobedience campaign but unfortunately we indulged in  violence," he regretted. "I support the opposition but not  violence. Should this violence continue, Niger will experience  the same situation as other countries," added one of his  colleagues, a supporter of the National Movement of the  Development Society [MNSD], the former single ruling party which  became the main opposition force after the country's first free  elections in February 1993. At the MNSD headquarters, however,  young activists, who were openly brandishing knives, were  already working out strategies: "Offensives must be increased  to speed up the fall of the regime," one of them shouted.    The two main parties within the ruling coalition -- the  Democratic and Social Convention [CDS] of President Mahamane  Ousmane and the Niger Party for Democracy and Socialism [PNDS]  of Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou -- yesterday evening  appealed to their activists "not to yield to the opposition's  provocations."    The most violent clashes took place on 16 April between  opposition activists and supporters of the ruling Alliance of  Forces of Change near Niamey stadium, where the ceremonies  commemorating the first anniversary of President Ousmane's  inauguration were being held. The CDS and PNDS have, in a joint  communique, "condemned the insurrectional situation and the  appeals for civil war" made by the opposition which is now  completely beheaded. Its three main leaders -- Mamadou Tanja of  the MNSD, Andre Salifou of the Union of Progressive Patriots and  Democrats, and Issoufou Assoumane of the Democratic Union of  Progressive Forces -- have been imprisoned.    No incidents were reported in the interior. The national  radio and television reported on the ceremonies organized in  many localities that are considered opposition strongholds but  where supporters and adversaries of the majority celebrated the  first anniversary of the advent of democracy in Niger "together  in a brotherly manner."</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Interest rate cut expected today EVIDENCE of only a subdued recovery in UK consumer spending since the general election is behind the decision by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to seek a cut in base rates. An announcement is expected today. Weekly sales returns collated privately by a group of about 30 large retailers are believed to have shown only a minor uplift since the April 9 election. The retailers account for total sales of Pounds 75bn a year, or one eighth of gross domestic product. Together with other indicators showing little movement in consumer sectors such as the housing market, the retailing data appear to have been persuasive. Mr Lamont and his advisers seem unlikely to wait for more detailed evidence about the economy before sanctioning a cut of up to half a point in base rates, held at 10.5 per cent since September. The opportunity for a cut in base rates has been opened by the strength of the pound since the election. It may be followed soon by reduced mortgage rates. That could help spur an uplift in consumer spending generally, which accounts for some two thirds of the economy. The figures from the retailing group  - organised by the British Retail Consortium and including Boots, Dixons, Burton and J. Sainsbury  - are not available publicly. A member of the group said they are sent each week to the Treasury to help it in its job of monitoring the economy. Figures for the two weeks around Easter would have been available to Mr Lamont in the middle of last week when he began to think seriously about cutting borrowing rates. This was signalled in the Bank of England's operations on money markets at the end of last week. Retailers in the project said the figures had shown little in the way of a recovery. 'There is no sign of a mini-boom,' said one retailing director. The companies in the scheme account for roughly half the sales of the retail sector. The weekly sales figures complement the monthly sales figures for retailing collected by the government's Central Statistical Office. Even though the CSO's system for collecting its data is better established, the figures are out of date by the time they are published; the CSO's figures for April will not be published until May 20. Outside retailing, the government has had better news about a likely recovery from the recession which began around mid-1990. But indications from business surveys about improved confidence among companies generally have not been enough to convince Mr Lamont that the opportunity to bring down rates should be spurned. In thin trading yesterday  - London markets were closed for a holiday - the pound was little changed against the D-Mark. It was quoted in Europe at DM2.9308, within about 2 pfennigs of its central rate in the ERM of DM2.95. In New York it closed at DM2.9305.

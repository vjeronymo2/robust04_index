			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling falls to 3-month low STERLING fell victim to heavy selling on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, as dealers grew increasingly nervous that the Bundesbank will raise interest rates at its council meeting on Thursday, writes James Blitz. The UK currency finished in London at DM2.8525, exactly two pfennigs down from Friday's close and nearly a pfennig below yesterday morning's opening. In later trading, it was down to a low of DM2.8489, a level last seen on April 8, at the height of worries over a possible Labour victory at the general election. At the end of the day, the pound was more firmly rooted at the bottom of the European Monetary System grid, with a 2.16 percentage points differential between it and the next weakest currency, the Italian lira. There was no hint from Germany yesterday as to whether the authorities will raise interest rates on Thursday or tighten the conditions under which banks can borrow money at the emergency Lombard rate. Traders, however, will not have been helped by a rise in call money rates in the German markets yesterday to 9.65-9.75 per cent, close to the Bundesbank's emergency funding rate of 9.75 per cent. Dealers said the increasing uncertainty about Britain's interest rate policy was also undermining the currency. Although the prime minister reiterated the chancellor's commitment to the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, the market is still unsure whether the authorities are prepared to stick to this policy, especially if it means raising rates again. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London, said: 'There is a mismatch between rhetoric and action. We have recently seen the Bank of Italy raise rates as a consequence of being in the ERM. The market wants to know whether the British are prepared to do the same.' The dollar was the other victim of the D-Mark yesterday, falling to DM1.4780 from a previous close of DM1.4955. Yesterday, analysts highlighted political uncertainty in the US as a factor behind the dollar's weakness, swayed by the opening of the Democratic party's convention in New York. There is also uncertainty about US economic indicators due out this week. Some analysts expect today's retail sales figures for June to be down 0.2 per cent, and tomorrow's industrial production figures to fall the same amount. The US unit further weakened in New York to end at DM1.4743. The yen closed stronger against the dollar, helped by news that Japan's trade surplus in the first half of 1992 had widened to Dollars 49.03bn. Dealers were also influenced by newspaper reports suggesting that the Bank of Japan is not about to cut interest rates.</p>

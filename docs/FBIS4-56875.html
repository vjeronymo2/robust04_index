			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The National Newscast"] </F>   A partial transportation sector strike in Caracas was  resolved this afternoon. [Words indistinct] once a meeting with  the top transportation and communications authorities. In the  country there is a climate of social unrest and dissatisfaction  resulting from the economic crisis, said Government Minister  Ramon Escovar Salom at the presidential building. He said that,  despite the partial transportation sector strike, there is calm  in the country.    [Begin Escovar recording] The people are fed up with the  interruption of normal life in Venezuelan cities. The people  want peace, calm, and work. They want to be able to work in  peace. Hence, all movements aimed at stopping normal activities  in the country are doomed to fail sooner or later. The people  repudiate these alterations of public order. And this will be  clearly demonstrated in a few days. The government enjoys the  nation's trust because strikes will not resolve the current  difficulties. These interruptions only aggravate the economic  crisis and prevent the country from concentrating its resources  to overcome the crisis. Those who can aggravate the crisis can  declare strikes but they are resisted by the country's majority.  This is what I have to say today. The reports I have received  is that the country is calm.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "`Partnership' Neither Demands nor Promises </F> Much"]    [Text] Finland now lacks but the final signatures before  taking on the obligations of something that NATO offered with  the description: Partnership for Peace. According to government  explanations, our purpose is "to primarily be a contributing  partner," particularly as regards the training of peacekeeping  troops. Our other spheres of interest are cooperation in rescue  missions and conservation of the environment.    In international relations a contributor typically also  expects to get something in return. It is likely that Finland's  aim is to gain more avenues for diplomatic contact. Partnership  opens the possibility of many different types of communication  and discussion, and these can be used to express one's own  opinions as well as to gain useful information. It is through  these means that Finns can be expected to become more familiar  with the customs and modes of thinking of the Western alliance.    Finland is not, on the other hand, seeking new "defense  solutions". The partnership treaty does not even make such a  thing possible, but the government is still doing the right  thing when it emphasises this fact. The original purpose of the  partnership was to offer some sort of replacement for East  European nations that, after they had separated from the Warsaw  Pact, were seeking, specifically, a new defense solution, to  wit: NATO membership. The partnership was NATO's novel way to  offer them a hand at the same time that the other hand was  keeping them at arm's length.    Part of the reason that the NATO countries wanted to  initiate  a partnership with neutral countries such as Finland and Sweden  is that then the treaties would not appear to merely be a polite  form of evasiveness toward East Europe. Russia was invited to  join for the opposite reason: so that the partnership would not  be seen as an attempt to isolate Russia and to bind its  neighbors into a foreign military alliance.    Up until now the effort to strike a balance has been only  half successful. Finland and Sweden have agreed to join. Russia,  which also agreed to join in time, has begun delaying the  procedure. In Moscow irritation with NATO has been strong at  times, particularly because of the events in the Balkans. Russia  also has its own thoughts on what kind of relationship it wants  with NATO. It feels that, in one way or another, any treaty must  underscore Russia's status as one of the world's great powers.    Originally the NATO offer had the attached condition that  the  rate and direction of developing collaboration can be determined  on a case-by-case basis. In this way NATO keeps its options open  while avoiding the peril that it would be required to deal with  its partners as a single, united entity. Even so, NATO will have  a tough time accepting Moscow's latest opinions. Were Russia to  gain a decidedly privileged status, the value of the partnership  for East European countries might be eroded.    From Finland's standpoint it is preferable that Russia would  also enter some form of a partnership treaty. This would  facilitate multifaceted communication throughout Europe.  Russia's decision is not actually a pivotal issue, however, for  significant security decisions are unaffected by the partnership  treaties. These will be dealt with in other forums.    Part of the intended contents, generally, is of secondary or  no interest to Finland. For example, Finland does not have to  separately prove to NATO that its Armed Forces are subject to  democratically chosen supervision. For Finland, the partnership  means one form of multifaceted cooperation. If if is correctly  implemented, it promises limited but real benefits.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Former member of the Democratic Left likely candidate for prime minister A member of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left is one of the likeliest candidates to be prime minister if the political leaders opt for a new government headed by a non-partisan figure, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Mr Giorgio Napolitano (right), leader of Italy's Chamber of Deputies, would not be chosen for his party affiliations but as representing the impartial position of leader of the lower house. A former communist has never before been so publicly canvassed as a future prime minister.</p>

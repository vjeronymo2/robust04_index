The  participants, who chanted slogans supporting Vladimir Meciar and  calling on Michal Kovac to resign, gathered in Slovak National  Uprising Square. Thinking that the president was holding talks  with the opposition on the forming of a new government, they  transferred to in front of the Primacialny Palace, which is  Kovac's residence.    According to Jozef Sitko, director of the Presidential  Office  press department, the republican leadership of the Movement for  a Demcratic Slovakia is holding a meeting in Spisska Nova Ves.  According to previous statements, President Michal Kovac  intended to ask the strongest group in the parliament, the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, to form a new cabinet. He  is likely to hold talks with the representatives of  parliamentary parties on Monday [14 March], when we can expect  bigger rallies in support of Vladimir Meciar.</p>

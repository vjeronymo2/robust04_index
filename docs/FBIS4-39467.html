			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Belikov: "Small Business in the Capital </F> Under the Guardianship of Moscow's Government"]    [Text] One quarter of all Russia's small enterprises are  now concentrated in Moscow, and in the coming 18 months the  local authorities intend to double their number. This is the  aim of the citywide comprehensive program for the development  and support of small business adopted by the capital's  government.    Officially, a small business is deemed to be one which  employs between 15 (trade, everyday services) and 200  (construction, industry) workers. It might appear as if these  mini production units and small firms have very few jobs to  offer, but there are tens of thousands of them in the city --  and this constitutes a sizable part of Moscow's economy and a  major factor of stability in the social climate.    The citywide program defines the priority spheres for small  business in Moscow: Namely, the production and sale of  foodstuffs and consumer goods, everyday services, health care,  city amenities and garbage clearance, the development of the  tourist sector, and services for visitors. In the first quarter  of this year 3.5 billion [rubles] of the city's money was spent  on supporting those who decided to take on these concerns. As  of next year, the subsidy will make up 0.5 percent of the entire  Moscow budget.    So where exactly will these considerable resources go? Over  the next 18 months in virtually all municipal districts it is  planned to set up 60 mini-bakeries, 35 new workshops for  repairing household appliances, 14 breweries, 10 small meat  processing plants, 6 timber processing plants, 6 knitwear  production units, 9 construction units, and 10 garbage  collection subdivisions. Apart from the city's money, resources  are also being attracted from public associations of  entrepreneurs. In return for assisting in setting up a small  business, their senior colleagues will be granted concessions in  payments for rented premises, power, heat, and water, and they  will be exempt from certain municipal taxes -- all according to  the "rules of the game" in a market economy.    A Moscow Fund for the Support of Small Business is being set  up -- its tasks are as follows: To train skilled personnel  (there is a dire shortage of competent accountants, economists,  and legal experts!); to create databases; and to publish the  information and analysis yearbook "Moscow Small Business." The  fund has also been tasked with organizing a specialized science  park [tekhnopark], possibly on the basis of the former  Exhibition of National Economic Achievements, to elaborate  promising projects which can then be realized by small  businesses.    A great help to existing and newly created entrepreneurial  structures is the Moscow Leasing Company, which acquires  technological equipment and then rents it out to small  enterprises in priority sectors and creates "turnkey" production  units that are ready to roll.</p>

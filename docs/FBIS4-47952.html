			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today  said that the top organs of the ruling party KANU [Kenya African  National Union] will soon meet to discuss the effect of the  structural adjustment programs on the common man. [passage  omitted] President Moi was speaking at Jomo Kenyatta  International Airport soon after arriving from a state visit to  the peoples' Republic of China. [passage omitted]    On the situation in Rwanda, President Moi said it is not  logical to send a peacekeeping force to that country at present  as the raging civil war continues. However he appealed to the  leaders in Rwanda to negotiate an end to the killings before  seeking such a force. He attributed the killings of thousands  of people in 1959, 1972, and those dying now to tribalism and  cautioned Kenyans to remain united to avoid such calamities.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / EC tackles legal hurdle to 19-nation trade zone: Community compromises on interpretation of laws EC MINISTERS moved yesterday to try to ease the legal logjam impeding final agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA), the 19-nation trading zone. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal, which is currently the EC president, said the Community had pushed members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) as far they could reasonably go in accepting the predominance of EC law, and that EC-Efta negotiators should aim for 'the best possible degree of legal homogeneity' in running the 19-state economic zone. A Portuguese official said this meant accepting 'less than 100 per cent' uniformity in the interpretation of common EEA laws. The action opens the way for detailed negotiations on the EEA to continue this month before a possible signing of the treaty in March. The shift in EC mood stems from a realisation that the EEA may only be shortlived, as most Efta countries have applied, or are about to apply, for full EC membership. Indeed, it is the current legal impasse in EEA negotiations which has highlighted to Efta the unsatisfactory nature of the EEA arrangement that puts them half in, half out of the Community. The heart of the present dispute is not over EEA laws themselves. The seven Efta states agreed to wholesale adoption of some 10,000 pages of existing EC single market legislation, forming the core of EEA rules. The Efta states will get the chance to influence future EC laws affecting the EEA, and to opt out if they do not like them. The key dispute is over future judicial interpretation of common EEA laws, as court judgments can significantly alter the impact of a law. A mixed EEA court of EC and Efta judges would have ensured uniform interpretation of laws. Or so it seemed, until last December when the Community's Court of Justice (ECJ) effectively struck down the joint-panel idea, claiming it jeopardised its own autonomy in determining what was, and what was not, EC law. Is either side, then, ready to accept the sway of foreign judges? The short answer is no. But, as essentially the weaker side in the negotiation, the Efta states have come up with a compromise: Competition cases involving EC companies or business turnover in the EC could all pass to the Commission in Brussels and the ECJ in Luxembourg for resolution. This is less of a concession than it seems, for two reasons. EC competition authorities already claim the right to rule on any anti-competitive practices or mergers with economic effects on the EC market. Efta states, too, trade less with each other than with the EC. Disputes over special provisions of the EEA which do not simply mirror EC legislation would be submitted to binding outside arbitration. One such special provision would allow the EC to 'rebalance' the EEA accord by, for instance, suspending all EEA transport provisions if Efta states decide not to adopt some Brussels rule on road transit. In such retaliation, Efta says it cannot allow the EC to be sole judge and jury in its own cause. The EC, it seems, can tolerate outsiders pronouncing on rules that are not also part of its own internal body of law. But this still leaves the problem of what happens when EC and Efta courts reach differing judgments on legislation. In its December opinion, the ECJ pointed out that such divergence was likely, as judges in the EC had to bear in mind that the goal of their Community was a fully-fledged political community, while those in Efta lived in a mere free-trade zone. But EC ministers took a more political tack yesterday. Provided Efta states could be committed to making their best endeavours to take ECJ rulings into account, they seemed ready to accept that some legal imperfection was a small price to pay for a common market extended to 380m people.</p>

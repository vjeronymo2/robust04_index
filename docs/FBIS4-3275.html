			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 19 (XINHUA) -- French and Russian  foreign ministers today reached a consensus in a telephone  conversation on promoting diplomatic process and coordinating  mediation efforts in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe and his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev  discussed the situation in Gorazde, eastern part of Bosnia.    Juppe urged Russia and the United States to consult with the  European Union and the United Nations as soon as possible so  that a common position on Bosnia will be worked out and the  peace talks be resumed.    He said Kozyrev was positive toward a French proposal on  renewed diplomatic efforts and its draft resolution to be  presented to UN Security Council.    The French draft calls for an immediate ceasefire in  Gorazde,  a withdrawal of Serb forces from the region and a deployment of  UN peacekeeping forces there.    The draft reportedly received the support of 11 countries at  the EU foreign ministerial meeting in Luxembourg on Monday.    Official sources in Paris said that as both the Russian  contact with the Serbs and the U.S. contact with the Muslims  failed to end the fighting in Gorazde, only a united mediation  effort could bring all the Bosnian warring factions back to the  negotiating table.    The spokesman quoted Kozyrev as saying that Russia will  continue to persuade the Serbs to accept the demand of the  international community.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOWDOWN ON MOMA  </P> <P> I saw the "High &amp; Low" exhibition on Oct. 13, and contrary to Knight's  declaration that the exhibit is a "flop," I thoroughly enjoyed it, as did the  huge crowd.  </P> <P> But, then, we only represent about 99% of the people. We are not educated or  sophisticated in art history or theory.  </P> <P> What a treat it was to see Warhol's Campbell Soup series, Lichtenstein's  vibrant "As I Opened Fire," Picasso's "Gertrude Stein" and Jenny Holzer's  dramatic LED signs and tiles.  </P> <P> I have been to the major museums around the world. Although I am not  artistically knowledgeable by Mr. Knight's definition, I know what I like, and  you know what? That's all that matters.  </P> <P> MARLENE G. STEIN  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

However, a Defense Force spokesman said yesterday that the  Defense Force knows nothing about the so-called Alpha base where  Zulu recruits are being trained by right-wing instructors in  bush warfare, field skills, weapons training, house evacuation,  and first aid.    Concerning the revelation that active members of the SADF  are  part of the corps of instructors at the Alpha base, the  spokesman said that it is unclear whether these members are part  of the Permanent Force or of the Citizen Force.    Mr. Leonard Veenendal, former "chief of staff" of the Order  of the Boer Nation and now a "commander" at the base, told  RAPPORT that some of the instructors are active members of the  Defense Force.    Concerning the revelation that extreme rightwingers and  Zulus  are active behind the scenes in putting the dissolved 32d  Battalion back on its feet, Army spokesman Colonel John Rolt  said that people who are no longer part of the Army can work for  whomever they wish.    The "new" 32d Battalion will supposedly be part of a  specialist unit of the Zulu and right-wing forces.    Military cooperation between the rightwingers and the Zulus  is part of the preparations for fighting the "bloody struggle"  between the ANC and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] in the  lead-up to the 27 April election.    The recruits are groups of Zulus who have been designated  for  this training by indunas [chiefs]. The training lasts seven  weeks.    The Zulus who are trained at the camps will also be  available  to patrol farms and "hunt and wipe out" APLA [Azania People's  Liberation Army] terrorists that are attacking farms.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Berlusconi faces clash with banker on sell-off A battle is looming between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier, and Mr Enrico Cuccia, the country's most powerful banker, over the ownership of Stet, the telecommunications monopoly, after it is privatised in the autumn. Mr Cuccia, honorary chairman of Mediobanca, the Milanese merchant bank, wants to form a syndicate of shareholders in conjunction with Pirelli, the tyres group, to effectively take control of Stet after the state's 53 per cent holding is sold. Mr Berlusconi is under pressure from other members of his government to block Mr Cuccia and ensure that Stet is sold to the widest possible range of private shareholders and investment institutions. However, research by the Financial Times shows that Mr Berlusconi faces a conflict of interest in deciding whether to do battle with Mediobanca because Mr Cuccia is in a position of great importance in the restructuring of Fininvest, Mr Berlusconi's business empire. Mediobanca has considerable influence through cross-shareholdings over three of Fininvest's five biggest bank creditors - Banca Commerciale Italiana, Credito Italiano and Banca di Roma - which between them have lent L1,300bn (Pounds 536m) to Mr Berlusconi's businesses. Fininvest's reorganisation - aimed at both cutting borrowings of about around L4,500bn and redistributing it among Fininvest's subsidiary companies - will go through only with their co-operation. Mr Romano Prodi, who re-cently announced his intention to resign from the chairmanship of IRI, the state holding company that controls Stet, said it was 'nave' to ask whether Mr Cuccia would try to use his role in respect of Mr Berlusconi's private interests to influence government policy. 'Of course he does,' he said. Mr Berlusconi has not responded to questions put by the Financial Times on Mediobanca's influence over Fininvest. However, last month he indicated he would try to prevent Mediobanca and its corporate allies from acquiring strategic stakes in privatised industries when the government said it would set a 5 per cent share-ownership ceiling for syndicates of related investors' shareholders in future privatisations. A banker close to Mr Cuccia said Mediobanca wanted to form a group of investors to buy a strategic stake in Stet and force management changes. 'Stet is very important for the industrial base of this country,' he said. 'I do not believe it will become more efficient if is owned by a diverse group.' An intricate web of influence, Page 17</p>

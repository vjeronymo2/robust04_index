			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Liffe in talks on link-up with Simex Liffe is exploring the potential for co-operation with the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, as part of its strategy of seeking links with exchanges outside the European time zone, writes Richard Lapper. The discussions with Simex concern non-Japanese products, with an initial focus on the euromark contract. Simex, the third largest centre for dollar/D-Mark business in the world and the largest in Asia, already uses the final settlement price of the Liffe euromark contract to settle its own euromark contract. Liffe is also in talks with the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange (Tiffe) on an arrangement to distribute a euroyen contract. It already has a separate arrangement with the Tokyo Stock Exchange for the Japanese government bond contract.</p>

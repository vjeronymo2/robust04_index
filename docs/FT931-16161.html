			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Dollar dangers THE US ECONOMY which President-elect Bill Clinton is about to inherit looks radically better than the one Mr George Bush was required to defend last autumn. Mr Clinton can afford a sigh of relief. But only a small sigh. Economic recovery does not mean that America's medium-term economic problems will go away. They mean, instead, that the medium-term will arrive faster than expected. The US recovery solves one dilemma for Mr Clinton. Proponents of an expansionary fiscal package now look dangerously out of date. Confidence has revived since November's election, economic growth has returned and memories of September's sickly dollar have been erased by its recent strong appreciation in European markets. Even a modest fiscal boost now looks risky, especially as the administration has at last admitted that the federal budget deficit will be much larger than previously thought. Yet a robust US recovery will quickly lead to deficit problems of a different sort. The revival in US consumer spending, alongside the deepening depressions in Europe and Japan, have already led to a deterioration in the US trade deficit. The short-term outlook does not suggest anything other than more of the same. There is little prospect of a revival in European consumer demand in the next six months while lower European interest rates, when they finally arrive, will push the dollar still higher against America's European competitors. The likely rise in the US bilateral trade deficit with Japan could turn out to be politically explosive for Mr Clinton. Japanese consumer demand for US imports is likely to remain subdued this year. While the US dollar has barely appreciated from its September low against the yen  - the soaring dollar is, in fact, a collapsing D-Mark - the economic fundamentals of competitiveness and trade performance have required a much larger yen appreciation against the dollar than has occurred in recent years. If Mr Clinton had appointed macroeconomists to senior posts in his administration, they would be explaining to him that America's unbalanced fiscal and monetary policies are largely to blame for the US's unbalanced trade performance. The danger is that his current economic advisers might substitute Japan-bashing protectionism for intellectual rigour. Yet what the US needs is co-operation with Japan, not confrontation. The best way to achieve a depreciation of the dollar against the yen is through complementary fiscal measures in Washington and Tokyo. A return to US budgetary health, combined with an offsetting reduction in Japan's budget surplus, should help to reduce US long-term interest rates and push up the value of the yen. Only then can Mr Clinton hope to sustain a healthy recovery, suppress his party's protectionist instincts and mollify the fifth of the US electorate who were persuaded by Mr Ross Perot's demands for austerity.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: James Crean James Crean, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, has sold three of its Irish-based distribution businesses to Allegro Holdings for Pounds 5.35m. The companies which have been sold are Tennant &amp; Ruttle Distribution, JC Distribution and David J Thompson &amp; Son. A further consideration is likely to be paid in respect of these companies' results for the period from January 1 until June 11 1993. The sale does not include the Tennant &amp; Ruttle property which is retained by Crean. This property is valued at between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2m. Sales of the three companies for 1992 were Pounds 28.8m and profits before tax and rationalisation costs came to Pounds 997,000. Net assets at the end of 1992 were Pounds 3.8m. Crean said the disposals were for 'strategic reasons'. It added that it had no plans to sell JCM, which distributes Mars confectionery products in Ireland on behalf of Masterfoods.</p>

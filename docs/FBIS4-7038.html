			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 25 April editorial: "The Korean People's </F> Army, Which Marches Under the Party's Leadership, Is Invincible"]    [Text] Today, we are meaningfully marking the 62d  anniversary of the heroic Korean People's Army [KPA] at a time  we are crushing vicious challenges from the imperialists and  reactionaries and vigorously accelerating the general onward  march movement of socialism of our own style on the strength of  powerful single-hearted unity around the party and the leader  [suryong].    On this day, all people across the country extend the  greatest honor to our Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il,  who leads the Army and people with boundless boldness,  steel-like will, and outstanding resourcefulness and, thus,  strongly defends the country's independence and national  dignity. They also extend warm congratulations to the heroic  People's Army officers and men who are defending the  fatherland's defense lines like an impregnable fortress.    The invincibility of the revolutionary cause of the working  class depends, to an important degree, on the invincibility of  the revolutionary armed forces which guarantee the fulfillment  of this cause with the force of arms. To people who aspire for  independence and are building socialism, nothing is more  honorable and prouder than having an powerful revolutionary army.    The bright future of the chuche revolutionary cause and our  fatherland's invincible might and high dignity are firmly  ensured militarily by the heroic KPA. The might of our People's  Army has not been further strengthened any other time than today  when it is marching under respected and beloved Supreme  Commander General Kim Chong-il. This is the great pride of our  people who are carrying out the revolution.    The respected and beloved leader and the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il are great in that they have raised our People's  Army into an invincible powerful army that can defeat any  aggression forces. This is also their great achievement.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song founded the Korean  People's Revolutionary Forces on 25 April in 1932, 62 years ago.  This was a historic event that gave birth to our party's  revolutionary armed forces, genuine chuche-type revolutionary  forces.    As a result of the founding of the Korean People's  Revolutionary Forces, our people's long-cherished desire to have  their own powerful armed forces was fulfilled brilliantly, and,  from that time, the proud history of the heroic KPA started.    Our revolutionary forces have walked along an honorable road  of struggle since declaring their birth throughout the world.  The over 60 years of the KPA's march were an honorable road  along which the KPA has won victory after victory while  overcoming numerous trials as dictated by the party and the  leader [suryong]. They were also brilliant annals in which it  has brought about immortal achievements for the fatherland and  the nation and the era and the revolution.    Our People's Army has always been able to honorably fulfill  its noble mission along a long road and has strengthened and  developed into a revolutionary invincible army. This was only  possible because there was the wise leadership of the respected  and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il.    Our Army could win the two wars against powerful enemies and  strongly defend the independence of the country and the nation  because it was led by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song.    All brilliant revolutionary feats on this land are filled  with the blood and sweat of our People's Army officers and men  who have devotedly fought for the fatherland's freedom and  independence, the people's happiness, and a victory in the  anti-imperialist cause of independence. The People's Army's  immortal achievements--that it honorably fulfilled its historic  mission for the era and the revolution and the fatherland and  the people by displaying boundless loyalty toward the party and  the leader [suryong], a spirit of sacrifice, and indomitable  patriotism--will be eternally brilliant with the proud history  of the Korean revolution.    Our revolutionary armed forces, which were founded under  the leadership of the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim  Il-song and have traversed the path to glorious victory, have  come to a new high level in their own development by upholding  the great iron-willed commander General Kim Chong-il [widaehan  kangchorui yongjang Kim Chong-il changgun] as the supreme  commander.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Comrade Kim  Chong-il has the indomitable will, mettle, distinguished  resourcefulness and tactics [yonggunsul] befitting the supreme  commander of the revolutionary armed forces. Herein lies the  guarantee for the endless consolidation and development of and  ever-victoriousness of our revolutionary armed forces.    The invincibility of the revolutionary armed forces depends  upon the greatness of the supreme commander who is leading them.  When they uphold the great supreme commander, the armed forces  can become (?matchless) strong ones.    Today, our revolutionary armed forces pride themselves upon  being the ever-victorious, invincible revolutionary armed forces  which can smash any formidable enemy [kuotton chonha taejokto  chobushilsuinnun]. This is totally because we are upholding the  iron-willed commander General Kim Chong-il as our revolutionary  armed forces' supreme commander who embodies the features of an  outstanding military strategist and distinguished commander  [yongjang] at the noblest level.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, equipped with both  literary and military accomplishments, has paid much attention  to the work to consolidate and develop the People's Army--the  core of the self-reliant national defense capabilities--with the  fate of the country and the people on his shoulders from the  early days on, thereby carrying out energetic activities and  making immortal achievements.    Without the dear comrade leader's outstanding wisdom [yeji]  and refined tactics, we cannot talk about our People's Army  being the ranks of loyalty which are fighting by dedicating  their lives to the party and the leader [suryong] and about its  having been consolidated and developed into a  one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary armed force which can smash  any enemy, nor can we think of the fact that we have come to  have a firm military guarantee on which the socialist cause of  chuche can be firmly defended from generation to generation.    The immortal achievements made by our supreme commander  General Kim Chong-il in the implementation of the cause of  building our revolutionary armed forces lie, above all, in the  fact that he has brightly illuminated the future path, which our  People's Army should traverse, by putting forth the most correct  and original military ideologies and theories.    To illuminate the correct path to the building of our  revolutionary armed forces and to the victory of the  revolutionary war by putting forth correct military ideologies  and theories is the primary mission of the commander [yongyang]  who is leading the armed forces. The greatness of the commander  lies right in the greatness of military ideologies and of  strategies and tactics.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has developed and  enriched the chuche-oriented military ideologies and theories,  which the great leader created, on a wholesale scale with his  matchless, outstanding military wisdom and with his activities  denying himself sleep and rest.    The military ideologies and theories put forth by our  supreme  commander General Kim Chong-il are, in a thoroughgoing manner,  the chuche-oriented military ideologies based on the  masses-centered philosophical principle; are the encyclopedic  theories encompassing all sectors and all fields of building the  armed forces; and are the most scientific and revolutionary  theories whose justness and invincible vitality have remarkably  been corroborated in the revolutionary practice of our era.    Herein lies a comprehesive compilation about the  theoretical,  practical matters arising from the building of the revolutionary  armed foces of our era, ranging from the mission of the  revolutionary armed forces of the working class, to the  principles and methods in building the armed forces, and to the  complete displaying of the might of the revolutionary armed  forces.    To have the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's outstanding  military ideologies and theories, which are consistent in terms  of their revolutionary and scientic nature, is the great fortune  of our people and People's Army.    As long as the chuche-oriented military ideologies and  theories illuminated by the dear comrade leader exist, our  revolutionary armed forces will reliably safeguard our socialist  cause, while firmly defending in an unflinching way their  revolutionary nature as the armed forces of the leader  [suryong], the party and the people under any circumstances.    Another immortal achievement of the iron-willed sagacious  supreme commander General Kim Chong-il accumulated along the  road of strengthening and developing our People's Army is having  strengthened and developed our revolutionary armed forces into a  matchlessly strong army fully prepared in political,  ideological, military, and technological aspects with his  outstanding and tested leadership.    The might of the revolutionary army is the political and  ideological might which can be most highly displayed when it is  combined with modern military technology. While ensuring  priority on the work of firmly preparing the People's Army in  political and ideological aspects, our comrade supreme commander  energetically led the work of strengthening its military and  technological aspects.    Due to the wise leadership of the supreme commander General  Kim Chong-il, our People's Army has been strengthened and  developed into a victorious army fully prepared in political and  ideological aspects as well as in military and technological  aspects.    Today, our People's Army's political and moral trait is  excellent. The entire Army is filled with loyalty toward the  party and the leader, and revolutionary military discipline is  being firmly maintained.    All the officers and men of the People's Army are highly  upholding the leadership of the comrade supreme commander with  revolutionary will of becoming bullets and bombshells to defend  the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander with their  lives, and are creating heroic feats and miracles in carrying  out their military duties.    There is no such an invincible army in this world like our  People's Army, which bears ardent loyalty and absolute worship  toward its supreme commander, and of which revolutionary  military discipline is thoroughly established so as to  unconditionally implement the supreme commander's order and  guidance without any ups and downs anytime under any  circumstances.    Our People's Army is fully prepared in military and  technological aspects. The People's Army is equipped with  modern weapons and combat technology equipment. All the  soldiers are skillfully handling their weapons and combat  technology equipment with deep military knowledge and  technology. It is a proud aspect of our People's Army to  display the mighty appearance of invincible revolutionary armed  forces possessing powerful offensive and defensive means, and  unique chuche-motivated war method.    Today, the might of our People's Army, which has been  strengthened and developed into a victorious army, gives faith  to our people and the world's revolutionary people. Our party  is able to persistently push forward with the struggle to  complete the chuche cause with firm determination because there  is the mighty People's Army. Our people are able to accelerate  the socialist construction with high spirit and strong  confidence in the fierce confrontation against the enemies  because they have the firm faith in the invincible might of the  People's Army.    In addition to strengthening the People's Army in various  ways, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, chairman of the DPRK  Defense Commission and supreme commander of the KPA, brilliantly  achieved the work of making all the people armored and  fortifying the entire country, thus firmly established an  all-people, all-country defensive system across the country, and  wisely led the work of building up a mighty, self-reliant  national defense industry. As a result, the entire country has  been literally turned into an impregnable fortress.    As long as we have our mighty, self-reliant national defense  power which has the matchless People's Army as the core, no  enemy can intrude our fatherland's security.    Another immortal achievement of our supreme commander  General  Kim Chong-il accumulated during the days of leading the cause of  military construction to brilliant victory is having further  consolidated the unity of ideology and will between the Army and  the people by thoroughly embodying the idea of the Army-people  unity.    How the Army and the people firmly unite in one mind and one  will is a decisive factor of the victory of revolution.    An army that does not receive support from the people  cannot sufficiently manifest its might even though it has  up-to-date equipment and will be defeated in every war.    In our country, the traditional virtue of Army-people unity  is wholly blossoming at a new high stage by highly upholding the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the benevolent father  [chaaeroun oboi] of our people and officers and men of the  People's Army, as the supreme commander. The officers and men  of our People's Army love the people whenever and wherever, are  devoting everything for the people's interest, and our people  are actively supporting and encouraging the People's Army both  materially and morally.    Our People's Army and people are verbally united together in  which they cannot be separated even it they wanted to, and there  is no power in this world that can break this great  single-hearted unity. We are able to easily defeat any powerful  enemy because of the single-hearted unity of the Army and people  impregnably united around the respected and beloved comrade  supreme commander.    Truly, General Kim Chong-il, the ever-victorious iron-willed  military commander, is an extraordinary military genius who  leads our revolutionary force toward brilliant victories and  glory. Through extraordinary wisdom and outstanding art of  commanding the Army, our comrade supreme commander has  brilliantly solved all problems arising in the construction of  the revolutionary armed force, and he resolutely smashed  [chitbusyoborisiotta] the enemies' challenge through our  peerless courage and iron-like will.    Even under the especially difficult condition in frustrating  the U.S. imperialists' maneuver of aggression and provocation  and in constructing socialism, the dear comrade leader provided  a peerless powerful army that can smash [ttaeryo pusilsuinnun]  any kind of enemy. Such achievement by the dear comrade leader  will eternally shed light along with the victorious advance of  the chuche cause.    While reflecting with deep sentiment upon the proud history  in which our revolutionary armed forces had walked, the officers  and men of our People's Army and all the people are feeling in  their hearts the extraordinary greatness of General Kim Chong-il  who is wholly embodying the trait and temperament of an  iron-like military commander, and are overflowing with the firm  determination to carry out the revolution to the end according  to the leadership of the comrade supreme commander.    Today we are faced with the heavy and honorary task of  further strengthening the revolutionary armed forces and to  achieve ahead of schedule the fatherland's independent  reunification and the ultimate victory in the chuche  revolutionary cause in accordance with the demand of the  prevailing situation.    Currently in our country, a tense situation is being created  in which we do not know when a war may break out at any time  because of the imperialists' vicious antisocialist and  antirepublic maneuvers. Reality demands that the might of our  People's Army must be all the more strengthened.    The People's Army is the core of the self-defensive national  defense capacity and a reliable defender of our party's cause.  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has firm faith in the  People's Army and is exerting efforts night and day to  strengthen and develop it so that the chuche revolutionary cause  can be completed to the end. We must all the more strengthen our  revolutionary armed force by brilliantly succeeding and  developing the immortal achievements in accumulating the cause  of military building by the respected and beloved comrade  supreme commander.    The comrade supreme commander's leadership is the life of  the  People's Army and a decisive element in the victory in military  building and military activities. All the officers and men of  the People's Army must highly uphold the comrade supreme  commander's leadership and must consistently adhere to the  party's line of modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea.    All the soldiers must firmly arm themselves with the great  General Kim Chong-il's ideology and theory of military building,  and assimilate loyalty toward the comrade supreme commander as  their faith, consciousness, morality, and life to further  strengthen the political and ideological might of the People's  Army. Along with this, the whole Army's revolutionary army  trait of fulfilling to the end the order and instruction of the  comrade supreme commander by going through fire and water must  be all the more firmly established, and all the soldiers must be  prepared to become a man of combative spirit of  one-a-match-for-100.    Highly manifesting the virtue of unity between officers and  men and unity between the party and society is an important  guarantee in strengthening the might of our People's Army.    [Text] Commanders of the People's Army should treasure and  love their soldiers, sharing their fate, joys, and sorrows, and  soldiers should respect and follow their commanders. All party  members in the People's Army should be a model in their military  life and properly help and lead members of the Socialist Working  Youth League in the Army. Members of the league should emulate  the model of party members and should become models in  implementing the party's army building ideology and policy.    Singehearted unity is the basic principle of our revolution  and is an ever-victorious banner. We have consistently advanced  our revolution with the might of singlehearted unity around the  party and the leader [suryong] while surmounting multilayered  barriers.    Our people and all officers and men of the People's Army  should firmly safeguard and defend the tradition of our proud  singlehearted unity and glorify it generation after generation.    All people and officers and men of the People's Army should  uphold the leadership of General Kim Chong-il, the respected and  beloved supreme commander, with the single mind of loyalty and  filial piety and with the faith in certain victory that as long  as General Kim Chong-il, the respected and beloved supreme  commander, is with us we will win without fail. Thus, all the  people and all the Army should firmly unite as one mind and  resolutely defend the party and the leader [suryong].    Unity between the Army and the people is the source of our  singlehearted unity. It is also a firm guarantee for the victory  of the revolutionary war.    The laudable tradition of the unity between the Army and the  people which is being enhanced in our society today is an  expression of their lofty mental world to share to the end  destiny with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il under any  difficult circumstances.    All the people and officers and men of the People's Army  should further bring our party's great ideology of unity between  the Army and the people into fuller bloom.    Soldiers of the People's Army should become genuine sons and  daughters who love the people and who fight for the people,  devoting their lives. The people should treasure and love  soldiers of the People's Army like blood brothers and should  actively help it.    Defending the socialist fatherland is a task by all of the  people.    As long as imperialism remains and as long as the reckless  war provocation maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and their  stooges continue we should not mitigate our alertness. All party  members and the working people should firmly arm themselves with  our party's chuche-oriented view on war and should firmly  establish in the whole society the ethos of attaching importance  to military affairs and learning military affairs fervently.  Thus, they should fully have political and ideological  preparations and military preparations, that is, material  preparations so as to cope with any unexpected situation.    National reunification is our people's supreme task that  should not be delayed even for a moment. Today, the South Korean  puppet clique is advancing toward the road of relying on outside  forces, not toward the road of national independence, while  turning away the desire for reunification of the nation. It is  attempting to stage a nuclear war exercise against our republic  in collusion with the U.S. imperialists. However, no matter what  a large-scale war exercise the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean puppet clique may try to stage and, thus, to drive  North-South relations to a dangerous phase they cannot block the  unanimous desire of the whole nation for reunification.    All of the people should sternly smash the antireunification  forces' maneuvers and should more vigorously fight to expedite  the day of national reunification.    The internal and external situation of our revolution is  still complicated and tense. However, we have nothing to fear.  Our revolutionary armed forces are the ones which have the habit  of being always victorious for some 60 long years. They are also  the ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces which uphold  General Kim Chong-il, the most famous general in the world, as  their supreme commander.    The future of our People's Army which is reliably defending  the chuche revolutionary cause under the leadership of the  respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who is the  most veteran and great leader of our times, and General Kim  Chong-il, the supreme commander, will await only brilliant  victory and glory.    Long live the 62d anniversary of the founding of the heroic  KPA.</p>

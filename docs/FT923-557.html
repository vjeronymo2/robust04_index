			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Yugoslav hyperinflation fear DEEPENING economic turmoil in Yugoslavia could catapult the inflation rate to 21,000 per cent this year. 'If inflation is not stopped now, by January there will be a dizzying price rise and panic buying, Latin American-style,' Mr Nebojsa Savic, a Belgrade University economics professor, told Politika, the main Serbian daily. Belgrade economists say the economic situation will deteriorate sharply. The economy's downward spiral, precipitated by 16 months of war and the severing of economic ties with the other former Yugoslav republics, was hastened by United Nations sanctions. Economics professor Ljubomir Madjar yesterday said Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - 'has entered the realm of hyperinflation'. He believed huge state spending coupled with reduced revenues would push inflation even higher. The truncated Yugoslavia is supporting a massive army and 485,000 refugees from Bosnia and Croatia. Industrial production has fallen by 30 per cent. Since sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed on May 31, at least 300,000 workers have been sent on compulsory holidays. Belgrade economists estimate that only a quarter of the 2.2m workforce will be employed by the end of the year. Amid deepening economic deprivation, Serbia's ruling Socialists appear determined to cling to power. The Serbian parliament last week voted to hold a referendum aimed at cancelling state-wide elections set for November. President Slobodan Milosevic is at loggerheads with Prime Minister Milan Panic, who has pledged to stop the war in Bosnia and democratise Serbia. Mr Milosevic is seen by the international community as the chief instigator of the war and mounting international outrage at Serbian 'ethnic cleansing' in Bosnia appears to have hardened his resolve to remain in power. Against this background of economic collapse and battles in neighbouring Bosnia, international mediators Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen visit Belgrade today to discuss 'ethnic cleansing' by Serb forces of Moslems in Bosnia and evidence of stepped-up air attacks. After visiting Banja Luka, a Serb stronghold in northern Bosnia, on Friday Lord Owen, the European Community envoy, said he and Mr Vance heard accounts of 'systematic shelling' of 3,000 to 4,000 Moslem refugees who were driven from Banja Luka south-east to Travnik. Fighting was reported throughout Bosnia yesterday. SRNA, the Bosnian Serb news agency, said 50 Serbs were killed in three days of fighting against Moslem forces in Milici, north-east of Sarajevo. It also said Serb forces seized control of Tjentiste, south-east of Sarajevo. Reuter adds from Islamabad: Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic arrived in Pakistan yesterday and called on the Moslem world to help his people. Islamabad last month gave Bosnia a Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.6m) credit line, a special grant of Dollars 10m and humanitarian assistance worth Dollars 400,000.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / A citizen's income could cut red tape All the main political parties in the UK are considering reforms to the tax and social security system. One idea they should revisit is the 'negative income tax', which converts benefits into a single net payment from the state, while taxpayers would pay their tax bill minus the benefits to which they were entitled. This is, in effect, a step towards a citizen's income, an entitlement to a basic level of income for everyone. Under such an arrangement, those with less than the guaranteed citizen's income from earnings or investments would receive the balance from the state. One of the strongest attractions of a single citizen's income is that it would replace the costly waste and human humiliation of the diverse and bureaucratic welfare arrangements currently in force. Basic income guarantees are tied to the citizenship of all rather than the special requirements of some. They dispense with complex assessments of needs, especially if they are tied to the income tax system. They remove the bureaucratic costs of collecting money from people in taxes only to pay sums back to them in benefits. The concept of 'negative income tax' is simpler than the reality. Defining the level of income entitlement raises big economic, political and social questions. And there are real difficulties over incentives to work or save when there is an unconditional entitlement to an income from the state. But when all is said and done, the case in favour of basic income guarantees for all citizens is still persuasive. Above all, a citizen's income could make bearable the greater labour market flexibility which is one answer to the vexing problems of long-term, structural unemployment. The levels of real wages and non-wage labour costs deter potential employers. Without them, hundreds of thousands of new jobs would emerge. But - and this is a big but - a 'jobs miracle' based on lower wage costs would have its price, as it has in the US. There, the price is called the working poor. For more than a decade, the real wages of more than half those employed in the US have been declining. The bottom 10 per cent, if not 20 per cent, have for some time been people who have a job but do not earn enough to sustain themselves decently, let alone to sustain a family. They are working, but they are so poor that they need help. I find the distinction between deserving and undeserving poor distasteful. But even those with fewer moral qualms would probably agree there is something wrong about hard-working people not earning enough to live on. Why then do we not start the implementation of the citizen's income idea with this category? This is, of course, what Professor James Meade proposed when he spoke of using a 'secure income' to offset 'the measures for the downward flexibility of rates of pay' designed 'to increase the demand for labour' (Liberty, Equality and Efficiency, Macmillan, 1993). One way of financing a citizen's income, Meade suggested, was 'the imposition of a special surcharge on the first slice of every citizen's income other than the basic income itself'. Contributions could be flat-rate or progressive; the latter would allow gradations of citizens' income support, or what is called a 'negative income tax'. There is by now sufficient literature on the implications of this idea to make it clear that it is viable. Beginning with those who actually earn a wage but do not earn enough would serve two purposes: it would help a new labour market develop while reducing the risk of the new American dilemma, the working poor. Problems remain, to be sure. Perhaps the most difficult one is who sets the level of basic income guarantees and on what grounds is it set? There is another way of putting the same question: how does one prevent the citizen's income from becoming a political football? In most European countries, the answer is fairly clear. An independent agency would be set up which is bound by certain rules. In Britain, with its tradition of parliamentary sovereignty, this is hardly likely. But perhaps restrictions could be imposed, in the required legislation, on the extent of the changes of the initial level allowed in any subsequent year. In any case, there is room for lateral thinking in future budgets which address themselves to the longer term rather than the next year, or even the next election.

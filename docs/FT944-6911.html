			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / EU to tackle blueprint for enlargement The German presidency of the European Union will today seek agreement on a blueprint for bringing the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe into the EU around the turn of the century. The document, running to more than 100 pages, will be discussed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. It lays out plans for the six aspirants from eastern Europe to bring their markets, trade regimes and laws, as well as foreign and judicial policies into line with the EU. But the paper stops short of giving a date for EU membership, and skirts the crucial question of how the Union intends to reform the Common Agricultural Policy - one of the most daunting barriers to eastern enlargement. Germany, which hands over the rotating presidency of the EU to France on January 1, views the document as the centrepiece of next month's European Union summit in Essen and the strategy to build a 'wider Europe'. But the summit outlook has been clouded by the apparent German decision not to invite the six central and east European leaders to Essen, and stalling among the Twelve over a more generous market access package. France, Spain and Portugal were said last week to be dragging feet over plans to reduce use of anti-dumping and safeguard clauses as the six associate EU members - Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania - adopt EU laws. Second, the European Commission has failed to live up to promises to produce a study on whether accumulation of EU rules of origin would stimulate trade with the central Europeans, according to a senior EU diplomat. Many experts believe that relaxing the EU's rules of origin would significantly expand trade. EU diplomats are confident, however, that Bulgaria and Romania will win the same accelerated market access package agreed with the Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and Slovaks. This would mean free access for industrial products from January 1 1995, with steel and textiles following in 1996 and 1997 respectively. The Czech Republic and Slovakia are also set to win an increase of 250,000 tonnes in their quotas for steel exports, following the collapse of the Commission's rescue plan for the steel industry. Some modified concession on farm exports will also be on the Essen agenda. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's failure to invite central and eastern European leaders to Essen is viewed in some quarters as an unnecessary snub; but German officials stressed that it was more important to reach a consensus on how to proceed with enlargement, 'binding in' France and the Mediterranean countries sensitive to the EU's balance of power tilting to the north and east. Separately, ministers are expected to approve a mandate for Brussels to negotiate EU association agreements with the three Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Zenith ends year with Dollars 97m loss Zenith Electronics, the struggling US television manufacturer, has reported a fourth-quarter operating loss of Dollars 5m, despite strong television sales. The total fourth-quarter loss, including a previously announced Dollars 31m restructuring charge, was Dollars 36m, or Dollars 1.04 a share, against a net loss of Dollars 20.3m, or 67 cents, in last year's fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter sales fell to Dollars 361m compared with Dollars 385m in the same quarter last year. Zenith recorded its fifth consecutive full-year loss, at Dollars 97m, or Dollars 3.01, against a loss of Dollars 105.9m, or Dollars 3.59, in 1992. The 1992 figures included restructuring charges of Dollars 48m and tax credits of Dollars 16m. Full-year sales were little changed from 1992, at Dollars 1.2bn. The 1993 losses came in the face of a record year for the US television industry, where more than 25m sets were sold. Zenith said dollar sales of colour televisions rose substantially in the fourth quarter. However, strong television sales were offset by declines in other core businesses, particularly picture tubes sold to other manufacturers. Zenith said it also had a Dollars 26m drop in fourth-quarter sales from its non-core businesses, which include magnetics and computer monitors. The company said it expected its latest restructuring to reduce operating costs by about Dollars 50m in 1994.</p>

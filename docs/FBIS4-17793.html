			<p>BFN     [Text] The Karabakh Defense Army's headquarters stated that  Baku had accepted the plan for attaining cease-fire in the zone  of the Karabakh conflict, proposed by Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev, because the Azerbaijani units were in disarray  all along the front, informed sources in Stepanakert told  INTERFAX.    The headquarters believe that Azerbaijan will make use of  the  cease-fire agreement for replenishing its forces and launching a  new large-scale offensive. However, the final say on the truce  is to be said by the Karabakh political leaders, whose official  position is to be announced within the next few hours.    Grachev's cease-fire plan, proposed during the talks in  Moscow with Azerbaijani parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev, was  supported by Azerbaijan.    On the same day, Grachev got in touch with Armenian  President  Levon Ter-Petrosian and, to quote the Armenian president's aid  Levon Zurabian, asked him to influence Karabakh.    Zurabian said that Armenia could not accept or reject the  reached agreement, because the conflict had to do with  Azerbaijan and Nagorny Karabakh, and that Armenia could only use  its influence. "The final decision must be taken by Nagorny  Karabakh," he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Abu Dhabi, 16 Jan (WAKH)--Lebanese Foreign Minister  Faris Buwayz has expressed pessimism over the prospects of the  Syrian-U.S. summit, due to convene in Geneva later today, for  Lebanon.    The newspaper AL-ITTIHAD, published here today, quoted the  Lebanese minister as saying that the security situation in  southern Lebanon, which is linked to regional considerations,  will be discussed during the summit. This could reflect  positively on the situation in southern Lebanon, and could  consequently push for a solution to that issue, he noted.    On the peace negotiations, the Lebanese minister said that  no  decision to resume the negotiations has thus far been made. As  for Lebanon's position on participation in the next round of  negotiations, it will be decided in light of the talks held in  Washington by the head of the Lebanese negotiating delegation,  and the outcome of the U.S.-Syrian summit, Buwayz maintained.    Buwayz affirmed that nothing has changed about the U.S.  assurances provided to Lebanon. He added that the U.S.  Administration has not marked any departure from these  assurances. He affirmed that there can be no solution or  progress on the Lebanese track of negotiations unless Israel  subscribes to complete withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese  territories.    The Lebanese foreign minister accused Israel of effecting a  military and political escalation whenever a new chapter in the  peace process is heralded.</p>

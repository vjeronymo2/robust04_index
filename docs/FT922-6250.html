			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Universities seek big state funds rise UNIVERSITY CHIEFS have told the government that direct state funding for universities needs to rise by more than a fifth - Pounds 400m - next year if the quality of teaching and research is to be maintained as student numbers rise. In a submission to Mr John Patten, education secretary, for the 1993-94 public expenditure round, the committee of vice-chancellors and principals points to the 9 per cent increase in university student numbers this year and projections of a similar increase next year. The committee is seeking an extra Pounds 450m in funding and believes universities can raise only Pounds 56m of it themselves. The largest item - Pounds 165m - is to fund a salary increase in real terms for existing academic staff 'to provide incentives for the radical and rapid changes in teaching methods and course design now needed'. The submission also includes Pounds 39m for new staff, Pounds 73m to improve the pay of non-academic staff and Pounds 150m - almost double the existing capital allocation to the Universities Funding Council - for 'essential' improvements to plant and facilities. The committee says: 'The key issue for universities in the 1990s is how to achieve further expansion in line with their own and government's plans without jeopardising the quality of their teaching and research.' It expresses particular concern about academic pay levels, which have fallen far behind the non-manual average in the past decade. The vice-chancellors urge the establishment of a pay review body for higher education similar to that accorded to school teachers, whose salary increases have far outstripped those for academics in the past two years. 'As the government brings other comparable groups into the scope of pay review bodies, it becomes progressively more difficult to explain to university staff why they should be excluded,' the vice-chancellors say. However, universities are unlikely to fare well in a tight public spending round because schools are the government's priority for education spending.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Letter: Subsidiarity the prime reason for voluntary ecology audits Sir, With reference to your article, 'Voluntary ecological audit scheme approved by EC' (March 24), it is subsidiarity which is the primary reason behind the European Community having agreed on voluntary ecological audits, rather than mandatory ones. Already present within the Treaty of Rome via Article 130r (4) (added to the treaty by Article 25 of the Single European Act and a rare application of subsidiarity in a legally binding instrument), the principle of subsidiarity implies a withdrawal of authority. When the Commission first drafted its 1990 proposals calling for mandatory eco-audits, it was under the impetus of the then environment commissioner, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, chided at the time by Jacques Delors for failing to respect subsidiarity. The Commission's president may thus be considered responsible for the agreement on voluntary eco-audits. As obscure as it may seem in practical terms, Mr John Major and Mr Douglas Hurd rightly understand and support the principle of subsidiarity. Indeed, British ratification of the Maastricht treaty, built on its letter and spirit, serves the interests of Britain.

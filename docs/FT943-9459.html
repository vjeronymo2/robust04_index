			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): An 'adult' double scoop Adult ice cream is the name given by analysts to the sub-sector of the ice cream market into which Ben &amp; Jerry's has launched in the UK. That X-certificate rating has nothing to do with the advertising of Haagen-Dazs, the leader in the field of take-home brands, but reflects the fact that adult ice cream is a luxury product sold at premium prices, and is usually considered beyond children's pockets. Purchasers are most likely to be 25-44-year-old ABC1s living in London and the south-east, although there are some indications that teenagers and children are starting to demand their share, too. The adult sector has been the main source of growth for the ice cream industry in recent years, and looks set to remain so, particularly if the current rate of product innovation can be maintained. Overall, consumers spent more than Pounds 850m on ice cream in 1993 - a 5 per cent increase on the previous year, and a 20 per cent growth during five years, according to the market research group Euromonitor*. Of that, the adult sector was worth Pounds 113m in 1993, an 11.3 per cent increase on the previous year. In 1989, premium products made up 7.5 per cent of retail sales; last year the proportion had grown to 13.2 per cent. Two main and distinct markets operate in ice cream sales: take-home, which accounts for almost 53 per cent, and wrapped 'impulse' buys which make up nearly 36 per cent. The balance is accounted for by 'scoop' sales from ice cream vans and stands. Both main markets have been revitalised by the adult products. Among wrapped impulse products, Mars was first in the field in 1989, with its ice cream chocolate bars - a smart move which, as Euromonitor observes, sidestepped a great deal of brand building. Competitors soon copied the trick. Unilever's Wall's held leading position in 1993 in the impulse sector with a 45 per cent share. Interest in these products crossed over into the take-home market, where a small premium sector, led by Loseley, was ripe for development. Haagen-Dazs, with its sensuous advertising and 'dedicated to pleasure' slogan burst on to the scene. The Grand Metropolitan-owned brand took the lead in the take-home market, as luxury products pushed aside economy tubs. Now Haagen-Dazs faces increased competition, particularly from Ben &amp; Jerry's, and the launch this year of Ranieri Wall's. Growth is set to continue, according to Euromonitor, predicting a rate of 10 per cent a year during the next five years. *Adult Ice Cream, Market Research GB, July issue. By subscription.

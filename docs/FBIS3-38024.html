He told an Interfax interviewer in Moscow on  Thursday that "it is possible to pardon those who have pleaded  guilty to a crime only after the court's verdict."    Politically, Sobchak believes, "this is a challenge and the  desire to make the president, government, and all democrats  accept what was done as an accomplished fact." "It's not merely  a political challenge but a desire to prepare a new show down of  strength," he remarked.    "The farce that has been continuing at the trial of the  State  of Emergency Committee Members and the attempt to let those who  have the blood of many people on their hands and who openly  called for an armed rebellion, get away with it, all this is  sad."    In Sobchak's words, the Duma "has so far been demonstrating  total impotence on the issues it ought to address according to  the Constitution." Although the country faces lots of problems,  although the taxation legislation, penal code, and other laws  need to be amended, deputies in the lower house of parliament  have never tried to debate a single bill.    "How much has been said and written about corruption, while  such a crime is unknown in Russia's penal code -- Sobchak said.  And since corruption is taken for granted, there is no one to  persecute for it. That's what the Duma should deal with."    In Sobchak's words, he has not been surprised by the  position  of the Liberal Democrats and Communists during the political  amnesty debates in parliament. "But the stand of many others,  Sergey Shakhray (the leader of the faction from the Russian  Unity and Concord Party) included, is staggering, he declared.  People calling themselves democrats stab democracy in the back."</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM COLLAPSE TO RESURRECTION  </P> <P> When Pope John Paul II visited Czechoslovakia last week, he came bearing not  only blessings but the vision of a new Europe.  </P> <P> As his spokesman, Dr. Joaquin Navarro-Valls, explained, "Europe is unique  because it is a continent with a shared Christian heritage. Since 1981, the  Holy Father has been talking about a common European home from the Urals to the  Atlantic. Now (the collapse of communism) makes it possible to put his idea  into practice."  </P> <P> To that end, the Pope announced that within the year he will call an  unprecedented synod of all Europe's bishops. One vital topic they will take up  is John Paul's worry that, having rid themselves of communism, Eastern Europe's  new democracies will replace it with the kind of "secularism, indifference,  hedonistic consumerism, practical materialism and formal atheism" he believes  disfigures Western society.  </P> <P> The people of the East did not throw off totalitarianism simply to stand in  Christian rather than Marxist bread lines. However, as communism's most  unyielding adversary, the church enjoys unprecedented moral authority  throughout most of Eastern Europe. How it chooses to wield it is a question of  the greatest moment. Between the World Wars, for example, the politics of most  of the region's countries were vexed by so-called people's parties. Their  programs -- unforeseen mutations of the Catholic Action movement -- were  nationalist, populist and, invariably, anti-Semitic. Their remnants have begun  to stir again, particularly in Hungary and Poland.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the church has an alternative model at hand in the highly  successful Christian Democratic parties of Western Europe. These parties --  founded in 1919 by Luigi Sturzo, an Italian priest and, later, fervent  anti-fascist -- are a successful synthesis of democratic politics and Catholic  social thought.  </P> <P> Their emphasis on the reciprocal rights and obligations of all social classes,  on the intrinsic evils of unjustified governmental centralization and their  acceptance of pluralism seem particularly suited to Eastern Europe's current  problems.  </P></p>

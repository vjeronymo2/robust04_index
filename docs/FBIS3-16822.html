In an interview on Lithuanian TV, Lithuanian Prosecutor  General Arturas Paulauskas said the searches are related to the  investigation of financial violations in the purchase of weapons  for the Lithuanian army. The investigation was started in  January.    Paulauskas declined to comment on the investigation but  promised to inform about the results of the Thursday searches  "in a matter of two days."    According to unofficial reports, the police arrested Vladas  Laurinavicius, president of the Kaunas-based association Selma,  which in 1992-1993 acted as a mediator in the purchase of  weapons for Lithuanian defense forces.    The investigation established that the Lithuanian Defense  Ministry paid unrealistic prices for automatic rifles, frigates  and helicopters sold by Selma. Besides, the payments were made  in cash, which is contrary to the law. Millions of then  Lithuanian provisional money, also called talonas, and Russian  rubles were paid personally to the association's president, who  has several previous convictions and spent 5 years in jail.    Selma also builds housing for Russian servicemen withdrawing  from the Baltic states.    Paulauskas said the unfavorable conditions for buying  weapons  at that time should be taken into account, but in his opinion,  the financial violations cannot be ignored. He said "the  investigation will establish whether (Defense Ministry)  officials had any selfish incentives."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Large-Scale War Gamble Planned by South Korean </F> Puppets"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam  traitorous clique Friday announced that a large-scale war  exercise called a "joint tactical exercise in the first half of  this year" would be staged by the puppet army, navy and air  forces from May 9 to 14, according to a radio report from Seoul.    The puppet clique plans to launch a three-dimensional  "operation" on the ground and in air and sea including combat  preparation exercise, chemical, biological and radioactive  exercise, movement of armed forces and equipment, take-off and  landing exercise on emergency runway, etc., and mobilize even  the "homeland defence reserve forces".    Bellicose elements of South Korea, in a bid to justify their  planned provocative war exercise, make an absurd pretext of  "coping with surprise attack by the enemy".    The large-scale war exercise aimed at perfecting the attack  posture of the puppet army, navy and air forces against the  North arouses a precaution of people because it will be staged  while stepping up preparations for a war against the North in  the wake of the U.S. defense secretary's trip to Seoul.    The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets should  ponder over the grave consequences arising from their criminal  act of leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to the  brink of war with repeated arms buildup and war exercises.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / All is ship-shape again at the Baltic PROTECTIVE sheeting is renewed over the south dome of the London headquarters of the Baltic Exchange, the world's largest shipping market, in preparation for today's reopening less than a year after it was wrecked by an IRA bomb, writes Charles Batchelor. Rebuilding the exchange's 1903 neo-classical trading floor will, however, take another two or three years. Traders, who have been working at the Lloyd's of London offices nearby, will return to the Baltic's St Mary's Axe headquarters, but they will work in the Queen's Room, an austere underground banqueting hall built in the 1950s. Unlike other 'open outcry' markets which have closed trading floors in the move to electronic dealing systems, the Baltic Exchange has kept its clubby atmosphere. Today's move comes as the exchange reappraises its future - the number of traders attending the daily market sessions has been falling, and most tanker contracts are now negotiated on screen. But the exchange still accounts for more than half the world's bulk cargo chartering business - buying and selling space in oil tankers and in 'dry cargo' vessels carrying commodities - and an even larger share of ship sale and purchase contracts.

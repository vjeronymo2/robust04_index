			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTON MAN'S BODY FOUND IN CAR AT BOTTOM OF RAVINE  </P> <P> A 30-year-old Acton man was found dead in his car at the bottom of a 60-foot  ravine Thursday after he apparently lost control during the recent storms and  went over the edge of Soledad Canyon Road, authorities said.  </P> <P> The body of Michael Vollman was found by his friend, Los Angeles County  Firefighter Paul Wenzel, who had been enlisted in the search by a woman friend  of Vollman's, county Fire Capt. Willard Sparks said.  </P> <P> Vollman's employer called the woman, whose identity was not immediately  available, when Vollman did not show up for work at an exotic animal ranch near  Lancaster on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Knowing it was uncharacteristic for Vollman to miss work without calling, the  woman called Wenzel and they drove to Soledad Canyon Road in Acton, stopping  every few hundred feet along the road Thursday, looking for Vollman's car.  </P> <P> After several hours, they spotted the car at the bottom of the ravine. The car  probably flipped over several times, Sparks said, adding that Vollman was not  wearing a seat belt.  </P> <P> "We wouldn't have found him for a long time," the fire captain said. "The car  was hard to see."  </P></p>

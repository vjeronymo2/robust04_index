			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Rover cuts dealer margins ROVER GROUP is cutting dealers' profit margins on its Rover 800 executive car range to 10 per cent from an average of 17 per cent, John Griffiths writes. The move provides Rover with a price increase while allowing retail prices for the range to remain unchanged. Rover said yesterday it had taken the action in consultation with, and with the support of, its dealer network. Dealers are to be eligible for 'development bonuses', equivalent to an extra 4 per cent profit margin, in order to help them secure fleet sales for 800 models. Rover increased prices for the rest of its cars by an average of 3.5 per cent in February. The 800 range was not included, because of uncertainty about how executive cars might be affected by the Budget last month.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bags of cocaine that washed up on the coasts of  Villa Clara, Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, and Guantanamo were  incinerated by Ministry of the Interior workers and troops in  the ovens of large industries of the country during 1993. We are  referring to drugs that international traffickers lost during  operations close to the territorial waters of Cuba. As on other  occasions, members of the National Antidrug Commission, the  Ministry of the Interior, and a representative of the Public  Prosecutor's Office performed the analysis and certified the  incineration of the 2.5 tons of cocaine that washed up on our  coasts. This act affirms that Cuba's policy of confronting the  actions of international drug trafficking remains unchanged.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bratislava, May 12 (CTK) -- There does exist an  agreement between the Hungarian minority and Jozef Moravcik's  anti-Slovak government, Eva Slavkovska from the Slovak National  Party (SNS) said calling the agreement an arrogant proclamation  of the minority's effort at self-rule in southern Slovakia. "I  am calling on all Slovaks to say a decisive `no' to turning the  Slovaks in southern Slovakia into a minority," Slavkovska, SNS  first deputy chairwoman, said. She also protested against "the  Hungarians' effort to make decisions" on who should hold public  administration posts. "Let them go vetting elsewhere, they will  not be doing this in Slovakia," she stressed.    The SNS is a former coalition government partner of Vladimir  Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). They claim  that the new government, appointed on April 16, has concluded a  secret agreement with the Hungarian parties trading government  support for concessions made to the ethnic minority. About  560,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia, making up about 11  per cent of the total population.    Peter Sokol, adviser to the SNS chairman, said that by its  deeds, the present government was running counter to its  proclamations that it was calming down the social situation in  the country. [passage omitted] Sokol said that "social peace is  the fundamental prerequisite of a successful economic  transformation in Slovakia." He said his party agreed with the  proposal that parties' election expenditures do not exceed 20  million crowns ($606,060). "Our expenditures have never gone  beyond five million," he added.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Britain and Vietnam have agreed secretly to force thousands of Vietnamese  refugees in Hong Kong to return home, British news reports said. The Guardian  newspaper said the agreement was confirmed by unidentified government officials  in London and in Hong Kong; however, neither the British Foreign Office nor  Hong Kong authorities would comment. The newspaper said those to be repatriated  have been classified as economic rather than political refugees and that more  than half the 50,000 in Hong Kong are likely to be sent back home. It said  repatriations may start in a week. The British Broadcasting Corp. said the  agreement has been kept secret to avoid provoking unrest among refugees in the  British colony.  </P></p>

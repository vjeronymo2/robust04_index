			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Albert Fisher in Pounds 29m agreed cash offer for Hunter Saphir ALBERT FISHER, the food processing and distribution group, yesterday made an agreed cash offer worth Pounds 29.3m for Hunter Saphir, the fresh produce, herbs and spice company which has seen its share price collapse since 1989. It is the first acquisition by Albert Fisher since Mr Stephen Walls replaced Mr Tony Millar as chairman in July. Mr Millar built Albert Fisher by acquisition into one of the stock market stars of the 1980s, but stepped down after a profits warning caused the share price to drop sharply. Mr Walls said Hunter Saphir's fresh produce business would make the enlarged group one of the leading suppliers to big retailers such as Tesco and Marks and Spencer. Hunter Saphir also had good links with growers in South Africa and Israel, whereas Albert Fisher had been too focused on South America and southern Europe. Mr Nicholas Saphir, chairman and chief executive of Hunter Saphir, will join the board as head of a combined European fresh produce division. Albert Fisher is likely to sell Hunter Saphir's new British Pepper and Spice factory in Northampton and is already aware of significant third-party interest in acquiring it. The factory was rebuilt after a fire in 1989, but has since suffered from a loss of customers and overcapacity. Hunter Saphir's shares, which have fallen from a peak of 173p in 1989, have also been hit by the group's unsuccessful foray into the popcorn market, which ended last week with its disposal at a loss of Butterkist, the toffee popcorn manufacturer. The offer is 42p for Hunter Saphir ordinary shares, which were suspended at 36p on Wednesday, and 100p for the preference shares. Albert Fisher's shares were unchanged at 69p. The purchaser will also assume about Pounds 10m of debt. The offer has already been irrevocably accepted by shareholders who control 34.1 per cent of Hunter Saphir's ordinary shares and 81.1 per cent of both the A and B classes of preference share. Those accepting include Berisford International, the commodities and property group, which owns 19.8 per cent of the ordinary shares and all of another class of preference shares. Schroders is acting for Albert Fisher, while Hunter Saphir is being advised by NM Rothschild.</p>

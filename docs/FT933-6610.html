			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Bonds: BT issue injects liquidity to Eurosterling's long end BRITISH Telecommunications yesterday returned to the international bond market after a three-year absence, and its Pounds 500m issue of 10-year Eurobonds injected badly-needed liquidity into the long end of the Eurosterling market. Corporate yield spreads have tightened substantially since the start of this year because demand for long-dated, non-government sterling paper has far outstripped supply. According to SG Warburg Securities' corporate unsecured index, the spread over gilts for maturities of 10 years or more has fallen from 153 basis points at the end of 1992 to around 90 basis points. As a result of the lack of supply, many of the sterling Eurobond issues launched earlier this year have become illiquid and are trading at a large premium to par. But the joint lead manager, SG Warburg, said that BT's bonds should keep their liquidity because of the large size of the issue. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 7 1/8 per cent, were priced to yield 18 basis points over the 8 per cent gilt due 2003. When they were freed to trade the spread tightened to 15 basis points. The all-in cost of the unswapped deal to the issuer was 23 basis points over gilts. Treasury officials at BT said the proceeds of the issue would be used for general corporate funding. BT, which repaid over Pounds 1bn of its debt last year to bring its gearing below 20 per cent, has Pounds 800m worth of scheduled repayments over the next two years. Meanwhile, syndicate managers are waiting for the World Bank to decide who will lead its next global dollar bond. The World Bank said that the winners of the mandate were likely to be announced early next week. The offering is expected to raise Dollars 1.25bn and have a maturity of 10 years. The World Bank said that discussions on the spread over US Treasuries had ranged from 10 to 17 basis points. Some syndicate managers expect the issue to be priced at a spread of 14 to 16 basis points. The Eurodollar sector was active across the yield curve, as more borrowers took advantage of the continued demand for dollar-denominated paper. At the short end, Finland's Dollars 250m offering of three-year Eurobonds offered further evidence that investors were looking more favourably on Scandinavian borrowers. The bonds were priced to yield 28 basis points over underlying US Treasuries. At the long end, Bellsouth Telecommunications raised Dollars 300m through an offering of 15-year Eurobonds which syndicate managers said was fairly priced at 50 basis points over the 5 3/4 per cent US Treasury due 2003.</p>

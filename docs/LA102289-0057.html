			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IDEAS OF ALHAMBRANS AND S. PASADENANS IN GRIDLOCK  </P> <P> Regarding South Pasadena's effort in stopping the completion of the Long Beach  Freeway, and the resulting traffic gridlock created in Alhambra, I have one  simple solution.  </P> <P> If South Pasadena residents are sincere in their desire to save their  "historical" homes, they can help us Alhambra residents if they voluntarily  stopped using our streets to reach their destination or to make connections to  other nearby freeways.  </P> <P> Imagine if several thousand South Pasadena residents voluntarily refrained from  traveling on Alhambra streets! Perhaps we (Alhambra residents) might regain  some sense of normalcy. I would like this idea to be presented to the South  Pasadena City Council as well as those groups who are fighting the freeway.  </P> <P> RICHARD M. NIETO  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

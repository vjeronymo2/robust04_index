			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Personal View: How to contain ITV's menacing octopus The government's push to enable independent television companies to become major international media players by relaxing ownership rules is in danger of wrecking its own policy of encouraging more domestic competition. It is hastily enacting legislation that may result in new competitors and small existing regional ITV companies going out of business altogether. The government seems prepared to leave the regulators - the Independent Television Commission and the Office of Fair Trading - to sort out the mess. It is not yet 12 months since the 40-year ITV airtime sales monopoly ended, when Channel 4 started selling its own airtime, and the first glimmer of competition was introduced. Yet before that market has even had a chance to develop, we have legislation going through Parliament this week which will allow Carlton to take over Central, and Granada to take over LWT - moves that have the potential to restrict, not encourage, competition. Concentration of ownership in principle is probably a good thing. A rationalisation of the antiquated and cumbersome ITV federal system is long overdue. But what the government has failed to recognise in this hasty revision of its new (and very recent) ownership rules is its devastating effect on the fragile and newly developing competition for domestic TV advertising. Ownership is one thing - selling airtime another. If Carlton is allowed to sell airtime for (as well as own) Central, and keep its resultant minority stakes in GMTV and Meridian, we may well have a potential world player, but the government will also have created a menacing octopus whose tentacles will strangle home competition. Similarly, Granada's hostile bid for LWT would put it in an equally dominant position, with minority stakes in GMTV plus Yorkshire and Tyne Tees, and a sales arrangement with Scottish Television. There you have it - a recipe for two huge potential players to dominate the scene, with the capacity to carve up the ITV production network between them, and the airtime sales market as well. Two players would have control and/or influence over a combined total of 70 per cent of Channel 3's revenue. Certainly Channel 4 will feel the pressure, but not as much as those Cinderella companies which have not been invited to the takeover ball, regional licensees such as Border, West Country, Anglia and new satellite and cable ventures. There is a simple solution to this cartel scenario which would in no way interfere with the government's global strategy for ITV. It lies in preserving the ITC's so-called 25 per cent rule. This regulation limits the size of ITV joint sales operations to 25 per cent each of ITV's total revenue. The ITC laid down this rule as recently as 1991 because it was concerned that the new competitors, such as Channel 4, had not become established. The major advertisers I have spoken to see only one consequence of relaxing the 25 per cent rule - arbitrary price rises by the big two ITV operators, Carlton/Central and Granada/LWT. As evidence I offer this response last week from one large advertising agency: 'We support the 25 per cent rule as it is, but we daren't say so publicly. We can't afford to risk the biggest ITV players taking it out on us.' The 25 per cent rule is up for review early next year. The ITC must not relax it. Competition has not developed as fast as it might have. Yes, Channel 4 is a great competitive success, but it holds less than 20 per cent of the television advertising market. There is no sign yet of a fifth national channel which would offer more competition. Growth of satellite advertising revenue has not taken off yet. ITV remains the biggest game in town with 75 per cent of revenue. Incidentally, the government might have avoided lumbering the ITC and the OFT with this problem if it had provided Carlton and Granada with the obvious bidding competitors - other UK media players. What stopped it from relaxing cross-media ownership rules at the same time? This would have allowed other global British media players such as Pearson, the Daily Telegraph group and Associated Newspapers to join the TV ownership club. Could it just be that the government was afraid that, if it relaxed these rules, its favoured player, Rupert Murdoch's News International, would have been first into the new members' book? Ah well, just another missed opportunity for the government to get its broadcasting policy on to its own, much-vaunted level playing field. Thank goodness for the ITC's 25 per cent rule - it is the last bastion of fair play. Now is the time for all good regulators to come to the aid of the market.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Uranium Discovered for First Time in </F> Southern Desert"]    [Text] In the southeastern desert's burning heat and biting  winter cold, young atomic scientists are continuing their  difficult road to open the first experimental mine in the Umm  Ara area 180 km southeast of Aswan, where Egypt's most promising  region for uranium ore is located.    They are confirming in practice the correctness of their  scientific study that contradicted the opinion of the foreign  company that surveyed the area for radioactivity in 1965 and  declared it "devoid" of radioactivity indicating the presence of  uranium ore.    Amid nature's harshness and despite difficult conditions,  they hope to build up a remote area that will change the facts  of the region and Egypt's future in years not very distant.    AKHIR SA'AH lived among them, observing the digging into the  rocks for the sake of the future. Here is the report.  <H5>  Far From Offices: Egyptian Youth's Epic Struggle </H5>   Although I was dead tired, I could find no justification for  sleep.    There was a yellow scorpion under my pillow, and a snake at  the door of my room. But for a foreboding from what you might  call a sixth sense (in reality it was only God's protection) and  the alertness of an on-site technician who quickly dispatched  the snake with a sharp instrument while his colleague hurried to  bring some gasoline and a lighted match--had it not been for all  these things, there would have been a different story to tell,  as the sports commentators say.    Even worse, we were in an area called Umm Ara, 180 km south  of Aswan in the remotest part of Egypt's eastern desert, some  distance from the place called Wadi al-'Allaqi. An experienced  camel trader in Aswan told me that once a camel got across, it  was perfectly safe. It was a burning furnace in the summer  months. Circumstances in the Atomic Materials Agency had  compelled us to go there to celebrate with them the beginnings  of the first experimental mine to search for uranium in the  southeastern desert. It was a mine with great promise. Having  awaited the event for years, we agreed immediately, saying:  "Heat passes, and no one dies of it." In our joy we gave no  thought to scorpions and snakes until we actually confronted  them. All our escorts had been completely silent about anything  of the sort. On the other hand, after the two incidents, a flood  of stories poured out so frightening to my photographer  colleague and me that, until just before the return trip, we  could hardly think of going into our rest house, even to get our  things, without carefully inspecting our simple equipment.    A 180-km trip would be simple with modern automobiles and  paved roads. However, on a bumpy dirt track in the heart of the  desert's harshness in perpetually dusty Zil cars that turned us  into ghosts with eyes, it took about eight hours broken by a  number of rest stops to help us endure the way. If you realize  that there was no antivenin at the site where we were, what  would our state be by the time we reached the hospitals of  Aswan, if--God forbid--we were bitten?    I did not succeed in calming myself for sleep by repeating  to  myself that I was not the most important visitor to the site and  that two of Egypt's top nuclear power scientists were with us on  the trip: Dr. Taha Sabah, former head of the Atomic Materials  Agency, and Dr. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Halim, head of the agency's  research section and supervisor of its development departments.  Not to mention that the least of the dust-caked young people  staying at the site had the academic rank of assistant professor  of atomic materials. All, without exception, counted as a  valuable part of Egypt's scientific treasure, along with the  other members of the camp--technicians, workers, and drivers. As  we saw and experienced, they were working as hard as they could.  Not only did they have expertise rarely found at many sites, but  in their dedication to the job despite its small economic  rewards they deserved to be esteemed and envied. While the  dangers of the place frightened me during a two-night visit,  they were the daily life of those staying at the camp and caused  them no evident distress.    Nor did the jokes of Dr. Ahmad Faruq, head of the  southeastern desert department, and Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Mansur, head  of the mission, succeed in bringing me out of the state of  grumbling that overcame me as I sat by myself in the camp.    The comment of one of the young geologists, that they all  had  children, made me again feel an embarrassment as a human being  and journalist that attacks me whenever I journey to one of  these harsh sites scattered throughout Egypt's deserts. Sadly, I  suddenly realize how the frills of Cairo life have made me  forget the reality of what I was seeing there--the effort,  creativity, and dedication of outstanding university youths,  graduates of the generation of the seventies, eighties, and even  nineties, who had embarked on this difficult life.  <H5>  Results of Study Doubted </H5>   Intuition was the main reason behind the discovery of this  site. We had come to celebrate the blasting open of one shaft of  the experimental mine, the first fruit of work that had already  gone on for about 25 years.    It all began about 1965, when the Canadian Hanting [name as  transliterated] company started making a aerial radioactivity  survey of the area south of Aswan as part of the regional  planning project for the Lake Nasir area. A group of young  Egyptian geologists assisted the company in carrying out the  work. They were from the nuclear geology department of what was  then called the Nuclear Power Agency, which later developed into  the Atomic Materials Agency, and had been sent by presidential  order because of their special competence in the field.    The work at the time was organized so that an Egyptian  geologist would accompany the airplane on its daily flight and  then would take the tapes for examination, approval, and  delivery to the foreign company the next morning.    Apprehensive about the results of the aerial survey, the  young Egyptians decided on their own, without informing the  foreign company, to hand copy the aerial survey tapes. They  spent long sleepless nights doing so.    As they expected, the Canadian company's report stated that  there were no radioactive anomalies in the area, and thus no  probable presence of uranium ore.    Rejecting this conclusion, the young geologists insisted on  studying the copies they themselves had made and submitted  doctoral dissertations based on them to prove what they deemed  to be true. Their dissertations as well as ground survey parties  proved this, and about 17 areas with radioactive anomalies came  to light.    These young people were:     -  Dr. Ahmad Abu-Bakr, now head of the exploration section of  the Atomic Materials Agency;    -  Dr. Wafiq Musharraf, who became deputy chairman of the  Petroleum Agency; and    -  Dr. Hamdi Sayf-al-Nasr, who became head of the electrical  survey department of the exploration section of the Atomic  Materials Agency.       Because the result of the foreign company's radiation survey  came out in 1967, when the work of exploration parties in the  mountains had to be postponed due to war conditions, and because  the doctoral dissertations took time to complete, real interest  in the Umm Ara area started in 1975.    A ground party was formed, including Dr. Ahmad 'Abdallah  'Abd-al-Majid and Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Mansur. The work began with  the submission of a master's dissertation on the area by Dr.  Ahmad 'Abdallah (he also received his doctorate on the same  area). These dissertations revealed that there really were  radiation anomalies, and the men investigated the sites on the  ground, locating them on maps so that detailed study of them  could begin.    Because the work of the Atomic Materials Agency in the  mountains depends for its studies on academic theses submitted  on the research areas, a number of doctoral and masters essays  were submitted, among them the master's thesis by Dr. Muhammad  al-Ahmadi. In addition, six students are currently working in  the area to complete their master's and doctoral dissertations:  'Adil al-Afandi, Sa'id Faraj, Hamdi 'Abd-Rabbuh, Abu-al-Futuh  'Abd-al-Ra'uf, 'Adil Fu'ad, and 'Abd-al-Ghani Faw.  <H5>  Encouraging Field Visits </H5>   In 1983, the Aswan mission began making field visits to the  Umm Ara area for detailed studies. These studies had encouraging  results and were accompanied by the development of the mission  camp from a hasty camp of one or more tents to a large camp. It  has now become a permanent camp of limestone rest houses with  all the requisites of settled life, such as a restaurant, a  meeting hall, and electricity generators. Work goes on all  year-round, despite the harsh conditions. Even in the fearful  heat of July, August, and September, which stops work on  implementing the mine due to the difficulty of providing the  necessaries**necessities of life, especially water, for a large  number of people, a limited number of people stay to continue  building rest houses for lodging and to ready the camp's other  needs, not to mention maintaining life there so that the camp  does not become a haven for the region's animals and insects  seeking shade or food.    The site was set up by the individual efforts of workers at  costs less than a quarter of what one contracting company had  set for implementing the project in this rugged area.    A Canadian scientific mission then visited the site and  suggested constructing an experimental open mine of two parallel  trenches in the hill in which the evidence for uranium had  turned up. Each trench was to be 1,000 meters long, so as to  follow the course of the ore in extension and various depths and  evaluate it in preparation for presenting feasibility studies on  exploiting it--which would be the prelude, God willing, to great  benefit for Egypt.    A dynamite storehouse was constructed for this purpose. It  was especially designed to keep its temperature below 30 degrees  [centigrade] in summer to protect the dynamite--quite a marvel  in the fiery heat I experienced there.  <H5>  Experimental Mine Implemented </H5>   Actual work to implement the experimental mine began in  March  1991. Twelve trenches were dug, through the colossal efforts of  the blasting team, which included Engineer Ashraf Jawdah, who  was in charge of the blasting, Hamid Sa'd, the chief technician,  Muhammad al-Mahdi, and blasting technician Tariq Ibrahim.    One should note that although the Umm Ara area is the most  important prospecting area in the southeastern desert thus far,  it is one of a number of areas in which parties are working  under the supervision of the Aswan mission. These include:     -  the Jabal al-Bakriyah areas south of the road from Idfu to  Marsa 'Alam, where there are anomalies whose sites have been  investigated;    -  the Wadi al-Jimal [name as transliterated] area, where there  is  new evidence;    -  the Wadi Qafah area; and    -  the Majal Jibril [name as transliterated] area, where there  are  small anomalies.   <H5>    Aerial Surveying, Experimental Mine </H5>   Before finishing the details of our trip, we must pause over  two points of importance to nonspecialists. We asked Dr. Taha  al-Sabah and Dr. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Halim to clarify them.    First, an aerial radiation survey involves using an airplane  equipped with devices to observe any radiation emanating from  the rocks. The plane makes low flights at regular distances.  Afterward, the tapes that the observation devices record are  examined to determine the areas of anomalies. Ground parties do  detailed follow-up of these areas for confirmation.    This system was implemented intermittently in Egypt using  various airplanes from 1956 until 1982, when the last airplane  caught fire while parked on the ground of the airport. No other  airplane has been obtained to date, although only about $5  million is needed. Seventy-five percent of Egypt's area has not  been radiologically surveyed. Doing so would bring great good to  light. The airplane would also be important now in monitoring  any radiation that comes to Egyptian territory from a foreign  nuclear accident such as the one at Chernobyl.    Second, the experimental mine is a very advanced phase of  the  search for and evaluation of uranium ore. It is the first stage  in implementing the basic operating mine, which will take about  15 years. Egypt now has about four experimental uranium mines  located in the areas of al-Musaythamat [name as transliterated],  al-'Ardiyah [name as transliterated], Jabal Qitar [name as  transliterated], and Umm Ara.  <H5>  Blasting Mine Passage </H5>   All the geologists rushed to the top of a high hill far to  the right of the blasting site for shelter from the danger of  the small stones thrown long distances by the blast and covering  the open area of the mine, as we saw. They said that the small  stones were hurled so fast after the blast that they might be  lethal.    However, my colleague, photographer Ahmad Nasr, insisted  that  the small hill directly facing the blasting trench was the best  place for photographing--"Why else did I come?" So all I could  do was take cover on the lowest part of the hill. Thus I was at  the foot of the hill, keeping an eye on the course of the cloud  of small stones as it spread toward us, so as to warn of  danger--even if no photographing was done--rather than death. I  found beside me Dr. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Halim and Dr. Ahmad Faruq,  so that we all might encourage and reassure him, though we kept  warning him that his safety was more important.    There was a strong, muffled explosion that sounded like a  shot from a cannon close by. It was followed by a loud echo that  the mountains around us reflected. Then we saw a large mass of  stone rise into the air with a gray cloud, and then a broad  cloud of pebbles that we followed with our eyes until it fell at  the foot of the hill.    No sooner did the features of the blasting trench become  visible again, than I noticed that there was a human being  wearing protective clothing standing on the ground of the site  with instruments to measure the radiation in the walls of the  mine. I did not know when he had arrived there or where he had  been hiding. It was 'Abd-al-Ghani Faw, who was responsible for  radiation monitoring and was making studies involving observing  the degree of radiation at the moment of the blast and at  regular intervals thereafter. He was the dark, handsome young  man whom I had just met in conversation the night before. The  difference between him dusty and with his head wrapped in a  scarf and his present appearance was great. He is a young man  from Qina, a 1978 honors science graduate of Asyut University.    Shortly before that, we had stood in the middle of the blast  trench, the sides of which rose above our heads. We were using  Geiger counters to monitor evidence of ore, whose rays caused  the counters to sound. At the end of the passage the blasting  groups were stuffing the holes that had been prepared for the  purpose.    Near us a bulldozer is at work moving the debris from the  blast. We learned that its presence had spread joy among those  standing around us. It had arrived a few days ago after a full  week of travel in the desert. There had been enormous  difficulties in getting it here, and now it was doing in minutes  the ore-moving job that used to take many workers hours to do,  thus compressing the time for completing the tunnel and  successfully fulfilling the plan.    Everyone agrees that the temporary workers should stay to  work in the summer, instead of a mandatory halt during the  summer months because of the climate and the end of the fiscal  year. They should work on building the new guest house at the  mission's Aswan headquarters to replace the original metal  building that gets so hot that entering it, even in the middle  of the night with fans that work all day, is a real adventure.  Practical experience has demonstrated that the best buildings  for these hot areas are those that use rock from the environment  and that they are much more merciful.    Near the end of Wadi al-'Allaqi we turned our car to guide  the other cars on the road with our headlights, so that no one  would get lost in the dark. As the car turned, we noticed  creatures moving under the light like the reflection of moving  water. "No, they are scorpions," explained the driver calmly. We  could not even open the doors to let in a breath of air! His  saying that they could not climb the body of the car did not  reassure us. As soon as the cars answered our signal with their  lights, we fled from the place.    In our present location we feel reassured by the company;  for  the site is lit up and all activity, and the camp dump is far  away as a precaution against the visits of nocturnal animals.  Hopefully they will find what they get there sufficient, instead  of making the rounds of the camp as they used to do last year.  One cunning jackal kept getting into the kitchen for months on  end and had the men baffled. They used every trick on him from  poisoned food to a barrel filled with water for him to drown in.  They chased him by car, but to no avail, until he suddenly  disappeared for no apparent reason.    The camp dog is the clearest proof of the nature of this  strange life. One of the workers brought him as a pup to play in  the camp. He ran happily around the camp until he met a jackal  and went to play with him. The jackal soon gnawed off half of  his tail, and the dog hurried back so terrified that it lost its  voice. It still does not bark, despite its size and age.  <H5>  Atomic Materials Youth </H5>   Nevertheless, you can only be delighted and sense the hope  in  the young geologists whose forms materialize around you under  the evening light of the rest house:     -  Geologist 'Adil al-Afandi, the head of the camp, has a  master's degree and is preparing to defend his doctoral  dissertation. A 1976 science graduate of al-Mansurah University,  he has worked in the agency since 1979. He is married and has a  daughter. His eyes gleam as he tells how she acts with Uncle  Fu'ad in the Ramadan Riddles children's programs.    -  'Abd-al-Ghani Faw is preparing a master's thesis. A 1978  honors  graduate of Asyut University in science, he is responsible for  radiation monitoring. He is married and has a son.    -  Abu-al-Futuh 'Abd-al-Ra'uf is preparing a masters thesis. He  is  a 1981 science graduate of Sawhaj University with a grade of  very good. He has been working since 1985.    -  Hamdi Mahmud, a 1983 science graduate of Alexandria  University,  is preparing a doctoral dissertation. He is married with  children.    -  'Adil Fu'ad is preparing to defend his master's. He graduated  in science from 'Ayn Shams University in 1985 with a grade of  very good and honors.   <H5>    Yellow Paste </H5>   With these liberated minds and youthful hearts, it has  become  possible to realize the Atomic Materials Agency's 40-year dream  of obtaining the "yellow dough" of uranium ore in the Egyptian  deserts. Thus was I told by Dr. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Halim, head of  the research section and supervisor of the agency's development  departments.    The first uranium crusher has now arrived at the Umm Ara  area. It was recently imported at a price of about  three-quarters of a million pounds. It arrived at the port of  Alexandria and was transported to Aswan. Foundations are now  being built to set it up at the mine site.    Three months from now the crusher will start crushing the  result of the blasts at the mine--currently estimated at 2,500  cubic meters--and turning it into gravel measuring from 2 to 10  cubic centimeters. It will then be piled in special basins,  where it will be sprayed with sulfuric acid in a closed cycle  for 13 weeks during which the ore will dissolve in the acid,  which will then go to laboratories for concentration. The  uranium ore will be obtained in the form of a yellow paste for  delivery to the Atomic Energy Agency, which will handle its  subsequent processing.    In the meantime, work at the promising mine will be  developed  by increasing the number of trenches and implementing a program  of deep excavation to 100 meters. This important event will  entail future participation in the celebrations for the  implementation of this work at the site now in its first stages.  This is what we shall do on a future trip for this purpose, God  willing.</p>

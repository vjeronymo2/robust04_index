			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BAN ON BEER, TOBACCO ADS IN PARKS LEADS TO CANCELED FESTIVAL  </P> <P> In what may be the first ban in Orange County against the advertising of  alcoholic and tobacco products in city parks, the city of Anaheim on Friday  drew criticism for imposing such a restriction and forcing the cancellation of  the city's first Mexican Independence Day celebration scheduled for Sunday.  </P> <P> The Diez y Seis de Septiembre (16th of September) celebration that was to be  held at La Palma Park was called off after the sponsors, R.J. Reynolds Co. and  the Adolph Coors Co., were told they would not be able to promote their  products during the festival.  </P> <P> Although other Orange County cities prohibit the sale or consumption of  alcoholic beverages at special events at their parks, Anaheim officials believe  their city is the first to go a step further and prohibit promotional  materials.  </P> <P> While not directly involved in the planning of the festival at La Palma Park,  the head of an Anaheim-based Latino business group blasted the new policy  because it will affect future fund-raising events.  </P> <P> Amin David, president of Los Amigos of Orange County, said the new policy --  not officially adopted by the City Council but imposed by the city staff --  applies only to city parks where fund-raising events are held, but not to  Anaheim Stadium, the home of the California Angels.  </P> <P> "We are very concerned about this type of censorship and double standard,"  David said. "Why do we have free-flowing beer at Anaheim Stadium?"  </P> <P> Los Amigos participates in Anaheim's annual Cinco de Mayo celebration, with  about half of the sponsorship dollars coming from R.J. Reynolds and Budweiser.  </P> <P> Without the ability to sell or market their products, there is no point in  sponsoring the events, Coors marketing spokesman Jaime Velasco said.  </P> <P> "We are in the beer business -- we have to sell beer," he said, adding that if  the company cannot promote its product, then it cannot make the earnings that  allow it to contribute to nonprofit organizations.  </P> <P> Coors marketing manager Mike Bobb also said the company spends about $1 million  each year to co-sponsor events. By helping reduce the cost of staging  fund-raisers, Bobb said, charitable organizations are able to raise additional  dollars that go back into the community.  </P> <P> "They (city officials) have isolated the beer and tobacco companies from being  sponsors," Bobb said. "I don't know what that's going to attract. There are not  too many sponsors to begin with."  </P> <P> Mark Deven, city recreation superintendent, said the new rule is a "test case"  that was based on previous discussions by council members who were concerned  about co-sponsoring events with beer and tobacco companies.  </P> <P> Deven said council members, who were aware this requirement would be imposed,  may be asked to formally adopt the advertising ban.  </P> <P> "It seems inappropriate to them, because the No. 1 violation of city ordinances  that they see is the 'no-alcohol' ordinance in city parks," Deven said.  </P> <P> City Council members were unavailable for comment Friday.  </P> <P> Deven said the Diez y Seis de Septiembre celebration -- commemorating Mexico's  call for independence from Spanish colonial rule -- coincidentally became the  first event to come under the new restriction.  </P> <P> "We are committed to making sure this event occurs in 1991," he said, adding  that the promoter will be looking for other sponsors.  </P> <P> Deven said "someone else other than myself" would have to determine why other  city facilities such as Anaheim Stadium are not subject to the advertising ban.  "I am only concerned with the effect that these type of sponsors have on  community parks," he said.  </P></p>

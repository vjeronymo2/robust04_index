			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec expected to agree formula for output cuts GULF OIL industry officials were optimistic yesterday that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries would agree on a formula to cut output for the second quarter. They expected the decision to be taken at Opec's next ministerial meeting on February 12, if, as expected, demand for crude of members states looked set to fall. Moreover, an agreement to reduce output could take immediate effect after the meeting in Geneva. Saudi Arabia is prepared to cut its output, at present running at near capacity of 8.5m barrels a day, provided it does not have to bear the greatest part of any overall cut in output, the official said. Opec agreed at its last ministerial meeting in Vienna in November to allow its 11 fully producing members to pump oil flat out for the first quarter of this year - rolling over a notional ceiling of 23.65m b/d from its September summit. However, the Opec ministers deferred until the February meeting the more ticklish question of where to set output when demand for Opec oil is expected to soften. A production-cutting deal in February would be unlikely to entail a return to a quota system as such. Quotas were last formally agreed by Opec at its July, 1990, meeting, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Rather, oil industry officials suggested, ministers might agree a flat-rate percentage cut to be made by all producers. Algeria, which has been among the most vocal in calling for tighter Opec discipline, is understood to have signalled its readiness to agree to some such formula. Saudi Arabia could favour such an approach, not least because this would preserve its augmented share of Opec output since the Gulf crisis. Saudi oil now accounts for more than 36 per cent of Opec output, against less than 25 per cent before August 2, 1990. The kingdom, which pumped 5.4m b/d under its July, 1990, quota, will also insist that cuts should be made based on production capacity, which now lies near 9m b/d for Saudi Arabia, since its accelerated expansion programme began during the Gulf crisis. Kuwait, which is now lifting 550,000 b/d, will be exempted from any cuts to allow the emirate to recoup revenues lost during the crisis. Iraq looks certain to remain sidelined during the second quarter, despite making some progress in recent talks with the UN on the export of Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil under a permitted exception to the oil embargo against Baghdad.</p>

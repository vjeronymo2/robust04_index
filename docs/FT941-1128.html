			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Macallan-Glenlivet down but confident Profits at Macallan-Glenlivet, the once high-flying Scottish malt whisky distiller, fell last year for the second time running. However, the company predicted a profits recovery this year and raised the dividend by 20 per cent. Pre-tax profits for 1993 were down 19 per cent from Pounds 7.04m to Pounds 5.7m, on sales 7 per cent lower at Pounds 15.5m. Sales of new whisky fillings to the trade were down by over 20 per cent by volume for the second year running, though prices were marginally ahead. Earnings per share were down from 4.45p to 3.62p. The final dividend is 0.74p (0.615p) making a 1.1p (0.915p) total. Though the company's net cash position was broadly unchanged, interest receivable fell from Pounds 852,000 to Pounds 555,000 as a result of lower rates. Bottled sales of Macallan malt whisky, which make up most of the company's turnover, showed little change on the year, said managing director Mr William Phillips. This was because of high stocks in the trade at the start of the year. 'We should see some movement this year', he said. Prices were up slightly last year, but margins had been affected by higher promotional costs. The company expects a further decline in new fillings this year, but said the Macallan brand is moving into a new phase of development. Mr Phillips said higher levels of stocks previously laid down were now maturing, leading to much greater availability of the product.</p>

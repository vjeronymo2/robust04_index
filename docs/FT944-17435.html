			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Bumper stickers cannot fix unruly, dirty and unlovely Bogota: City elections are focusing on social problems underlying the physical decay Bogota is an unruly, dirty and unlovely city. It has outgrown its transport, sewerage and water systems, and there are 14 murders a day. As Mr Antanas Mockus, the candidate in mayoral elections on October 30 who leads the opinion polls by a large margin, told a hall full of students: 'You can't fix Bogota by putting 'I love Bogota' stickers on your car. Instead, say 'I hate it, but I'll do something to improve it'.' Sick of empty electoral promises, Bogotanos have warmed to Mr Mockus's candid prescriptions. He is making no political pacts and his popularity scared the Liberals and Conservatives into discussing an alliance for the local government elections. When this fell through, Mr Enrique Penalosa of the Liberal party was left as the other contender. Fuelled by migrants from all over the country, the population of Bogota has grown at more than 4.5 per cent a year during the last decade to 6.3m. With about 16 per cent of Colombia's inhabitants and a third of its industry, the capital sprawls out from a ridge of mountains across a high plain, eating up rich farmland. The winter rains bring landslides to poor hillside barrios and floods to lower lying ones. Although many businesses have moved north from the original centre, public sector offices are still largely concentrated in the town centre. A few streets of pretty colonial and early republican buildings survive in the Candelaria area in the city centre, but only three blocks from the presidential palace there are street walkers, drug dealers and any number of thieves carrying knives up their sleeves. From time to time plans to remove the army of street sellers from the main avenues and to revamp parts of the centre are announced; but such enormous social problems underlie the physical decay that no mayor has had the courage to tackle them. Mr Mockus, a mathematician and philosophy professor, took on one of the more difficult jobs in the country when he became rector of the anarchic National University. He resigned after television news programmes showed him 'mooning' (making a crude gesture of defiance) at a noisy university audience which would not let him speak, but students think well of him. 'He's an intellectual in a million, a very good teacher. The university reforms he implemented have been successful - he's too far ahead on some things, though; people haven't his vision,' said a graduate student. The key to changing Bogota, according to Mr Mockus, is civic culture. All problems, including pollution, transport, security and tax collection could be resolved more cheaply if people's attitudes changed. This message, which forms the core of his programme, has been well received in a city where corruption is rife and cries for help rarely answered. A recent study by the mayor's office found the lack of civic solidarity to be people's foremost complaint, followed by transport, violence and administrative incompetence. The next mayor will have little to spend unless he can cut back on operating expenses. The capital has 60,000 on its payroll, including teachers. 'Bogota's financial situation has been deteriorating since the 1970s,' said Ms Maria Eugenia Avendano, in charge of UN projects at city hall. 'Service tariffs hardly changed and the money went to pay off multilateral loans. Now there's been a big increase in the industry and trade tax and more people are paying the property tax. Debts of the public service companies have been refinanced, so there'll be something over for investment.' Catching up on service provision is one of the priorities - only 60 per cent of households are linked to the main sewerage system and more than 200,000 water connections are illegal. Every year unauthorised barrios sprout on vacant lots; sometimes these take-overs are sponsored by unscrupulous politicians in search of votes. People living in areas such as Ciudad Bolivar, a vast conglomeration of low income barrios, resort to strikes to get the city to solve their most glaring problems. One of these is transport. Bogota has had no long-term transport or planning strategy and roads have been widened and fly-overs thrown up in a haphazard way. The number of vehicles has risen to over 600,000, boosted by the liberalisation of imports. There are 50 bus companies and nearly 90 per cent of all trips are made on public transport, so it is not surprising a rapid transit system is regularly debated. The British company Halcrow Fox analysed a series of proposals for transport strategies. 'The evaluation process was very useful,' said Mr Mauricio Cuellar, a transport specialist working with the local administration. 'It allowed us to arrive at a long-term project which attacks the main zones of congestion and central area access problems.' This would include a north-south metro line, combined with east-west bus highways. The metro is an expensive solution and would need a substantial contribution from the central government, which has promised special help for Bogota. It is one of the items on a list prepared by the Bogota 2000 planning team, along with the decontamination of the River Bogota, the establishment of free trade zones and a host of projects. As an attempt to involve Bogotanos in the discussion of their future and the choice between investment alternatives, the Bogota 2000 exercise is gathering steam. Mr Mockus thinks it is a good idea and wants to build on it. But his battle is not only to beat the powerful Liberal party machinery: if he wins, the unorthodox professor will have to govern the capital with virtually no city councillors to back him.</p>

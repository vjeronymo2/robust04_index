			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Slovak leaders in corruption clash The Slovak president yesterday accused Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar of corruption in a speech marking a final break between Slovakia's two top officials and a new push to end its political paralysis. President Michal Kovac stopped short of asking for the resignation of the populist prime minister, who has led Slovakia since it gained independence in the break-up of Czechslovakia 15 months ago. But deputies later voted for Mr Meciar to face a no-confidence motion. Mr Kovac, clearly angry stunned lawmakers by claiming Mr Meciar had told him he wanted a political ally in control of privatising the economy so he could wring money out of it for his political party.</p>

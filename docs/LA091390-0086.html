			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2ND SET OF QUADS THIS YEAR BORN AT UC IRVINE CENTER  </P> <P> A Santa Ana woman gave birth to quadruplets at UC Irvine Medical Center here  Wednesday afternoon, the second foursome to be born this year at the hospital.  </P> <P> Unlike the ones that arrived last Feb. 10, the boy and three girls born  prematurely Wednesday to 28-year-old Consolacion (Solly) Amante were not the  result of fertility treatments, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> The chances of such "spontaneous" quadruplets is about 1 in 512,000 births,  said Dr. Manuel Porto, the obstetrician who delivered the Amante infants by  Cesarean section shortly after 1 p.m.  </P> <P> "Even though she had seen the sonograms and we had gone over it, there's still  that surreal aspect to it. She didn't really believe it until they were there  -- four babies," said Porto.  </P> <P> The quadruplets, who were born 10 weeks prematurely, were in serious but stable  condition.  </P> <P> The boy, Jeremy Stewart, the biggest at 3 pounds, 9 1/2 ounces, arrived first.  Seconds later came a 2-pound, 14 1/2-ounce girl named Jeraldine Elaine. Then  Jessamine Eileen weighed in at 2 pounds, 14 1/2 ounces. Last was 2-pound,  12-ounce Jacqueline Elise.  </P> <P> Their father, Oscar Amante, 30, who workes for a computer printer manufacturing  firm in Irvine, was present for the births. "At first I thought it couldn't be  happening to us, but it's great," he said. "Our entire family is very excited."  </P> <P> The Amantes also have a son, Jonathan, 4, and a daughter, Jane, 1.  </P> <P> The previous set of quadruplets arrived at UC Irvine on Feb. 10 to Karen Miner,  a 32-year-old schoolteacher from Orange. They were the county's first set of  quadruplets to be born through a non-test-tube fertility technique known as  GIFT, which involves placing sperm and eggs in the mother's Fallopian tubes.  </P></p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Observer: Fidelity What do Fidel Castro and an expensive, brightly coloured woolly jumper have in common? Not much at the moment but perhaps a lot in the future. For Benetton, the shrinking violet of the Italian clothes business which recently opened a number of branches in Cuba, has asked the ageing dictator to become the figurehead of its planned 'research centre' to be based at Treviso in Italy. The letter from Luciano Benetton - the company's head - is a very odd document, probably one of the last flattering missives Castro can expect to receive. It invites Castro to become a 'teacher of revolution' at the new institution. 'A school of this kind needs a teacher. I thought of you because many of us have not forgotten the idealistic vision you offered your country . . .' 'It's not a joke,' says a Benetton pr. 'Castro's political cycle may be coming to an end but he did do an enormous amount to inspire the youth of his country and he would be ideal for an avant-garde school.' What next? Kim Il Sung signs up for Volkswagen?</p>

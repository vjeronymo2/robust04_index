			<p>BFN     [Text] An agreement on civil accord should be signed by  political forces at least for enabling them to resolve political  differences "through elections, through ballot booths, through  the press," not through the use of force, the leader of Russia's  Choice faction in the State Duma Yegor Gaydar told Interfax on  Friday.    A day earlier, during the debates over the signing of the  agreement in the State Duma Gaydar spoke in favor of its  signing. In his opinion, the parliamentary majority, which in  his words, consists of opposition forces should "take  responsibility for its like-minded persons", because "to provoke  tensions in Russia today is a strike on security."    At the same time, Gaydar acknowledged that the foundation of  possible civil accord "is very limited and there can be no  agreement with the opposition on program issues." In  particular, he pointed to different approaches to private  property and the restoration of administrative control over the  economy.</p>

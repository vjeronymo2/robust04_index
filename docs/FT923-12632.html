			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Boredom dogs a political junkie BEING a delegate at this week's Democratic convention may involve a lot of parties, but it is no picnic. As far as the party bosses are concerned, the cheering and waving of posters, which came to a climax last night, are essential elements of prime-time television coverage. But on the ground, life is different. Take Mr Roy Oppenheim, a 32-year-old delegate from Florida who came to New York committed to Mr Paul Tsongas. Like many of his nearly 5,000 peers he is a first-time delegate who is bored and frustrated. Mr Oppenheim is a property lawyer and lifelong political junkie who first became active in 1972 when, at the age of 12, he worked on the George McGovern campaign. In 1980 he worked for Ted Kennedy's campaign and in 1988 he gave speeches in Florida as a surrogate for Al Gore, then one of the candidates for the party's presidential nomination. He formed a local Democratic party club in Fort Lauderdale and was later asked to stand for Congress, an offer he turned down because he reckoned it was 'too soon'. Mr Oppenheim says he became a Tsongas delegate - one of 30 in the Florida delegation - 'because I wanted to influence the process, especially on the vital issue of education'. As with many delegates, he is paying his own way. He estimates his total travel, hotel and other expenses will come to more than Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,050). In the small hours of Wednesday morning, as he watched a doleful Mr Tsongas greet hundreds of delegates at a low-key reception at Central Park's Tavern on the Green restaurant, Mr Oppenheim opened up. 'I haven't participated in any decisions here in New York. I arrived on Sunday, checked into my hotel, found a ton of uninteresting paper and nine baseball caps from sponsors such as Coca-Cola and Con Edison. Then I was told that for security reasons I have to collect a new set of credentials every morning, between 6.45 and 7.30.' On Sunday afternoon he got down to the most common activity of most delegates - going to receptions. The first was a party in the dinosaur room of the Museum of Natural History, sponsored by Merrill Lynch and featuring a reggae band and Caribbean food. On Monday he sat through a breakfast meeting of the Florida delegation and found it so dreary he decided to pass on the others. Meetings of Tsongas delegates 'were equally boring'. During the afternoon and evening he has been on the convention floor. 'But I do nothing. It is hard to hear most of the speeches so I walk around a little, talk and read newspapers,' he said. 'There has been absolutely nothing for me to do here. It's a farce. This is really a media circus and I am just a pawn in the process. But I guess I'm a willing pawn. It may be boring here in New York, but back home it plays very well.'</p>

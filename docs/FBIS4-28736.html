			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 14 Jun (AKP) -- Following is the  declaration made on 10 June by His Majesty the King of Cambodia:    "This week in Cambodia, the civil war that, alas, continues  to rage and that pits units of the Cambodian Royal Armed Forces  against those of the Khmer Rouge, has produced hundreds of  victims among our innocent civilian compatriots, that is, nearly  100 killed and more than 100 seriously wounded (men and women  and old, adults, and children) not to mention scores of the  slightly wounded and those who have survived but who have lost  everything (houses burned, rice, fowl, and cattle lost, and so  on)...    "In this civil war that, alas, slowly but surely advances  through our motherland and pushes our people toward certain  death, there is not nor will there be any victor or vanquished  among the belligerents on either side. There is and will be  only a great loser, the innocent little people of Cambodia.    "I appeal to all belligerents to have pity for these people  who, for 24 years now, have suffered and still suffer so much.    "I ask them to please totally, immediately, and permanently  end their war.    "Only total peace in Cambodia can save our motherland, our  people, and our race from disappearing from the world map and  the universal history."</p>

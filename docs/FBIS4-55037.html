			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ul" report: "Iliescu: Discriminatory Measures Against </F> Romanian Germans"]    [Text] Bucharest, 5 May -- Romanian President Iliescu has  admitted that the German minority in Romania was subjected to  "discriminatory measures" in the years of communism. However,  in talking to this newspaper he chose a formulation that does  not correspond to what the leadership of the "Democratic Forum  of Germans in Romania" (DFDR) expects of him. Iliescu said that  there were "delicate moments" in Romania after World War II.  Germans and Romania got into "difficulties" at that time. Many  were deported or expropriated. The current Romanian leadership  rejects "these discriminatory measures." Iliescu added that,  since the end of the dictatorship, Germans are no longer being  discriminated in Romania. The current difficulties of the  country are general and affect all nationalities. Anyone who  emigrates today does that mainly for material reasons and not  because Germans are discriminated against in Romania. In  Romania politicians of both the parties close to the government  and the opposition keep repeating how much the country regrets  the emigration of the German minority.    DFDR Chairman Philippi called Iliescu's comments on the  deportations and expropriations of the postwar period "too  general." According to him, Romanian Germans can regain trust in  their state only if, apart from the injustices under which all  citizens suffered, Iliescu also recognizes those that were  imposed on the Germans in particular. Philippi says he expects  Iliescu to "solemnly" recognize the excesses of the state  against the German ethnic group -- similar to what Czech  President Havel did in the past. In January 1945, about 70,000  Romanian Germans were arrested by Romanian police and Romanian  military and extradited to the Soviet Union for years of forced  labor. More than 10,000 died during the transports and in the  Soviet labor camps. The Romanian Germans also accuse the  Romanian state of having carried out general expropriations at  the beginning of the communist dictatorship, which hit the  German minority particularly hard.    Germany supports the demand of the DFDR that Romania should  officially recognize the discrimination. Horst Waffenschmidt  (Christian Democratic Union), parliamentary state secretary in  the Interior Ministry and the Federal Government's commissioner  for resettlers, who is currently visiting the Romanian capital  and the most important settlement areas of the Romanian Germans,  broached the desire for an official statement during a meeting  with Iliescu in the president's palace of Cotroceni in  Bucharest. After the meeting Iliescu commented on this by  saying that the desires of the Romanian Germans exclusively  affect the relationship of the Romanian state with its citizens.    Waffenschmidt pointed out to Iliescu that Germany has spent  more than 111 million German marks [DM] since 1990 to help the  Germans in Romania. In 1994, another DM11 million are supposed  to be spent for this purpose. This help also benefits the  "neighboring surroundings" of the Germans in Romania. The  Federal Government wants to contribute to having Germans and  Romanians coexist peacefully. However, it is expected that  Romania abolish the customs duties that are currently levied on  German relief supplies. In addition, television must transmit  more German broadcasts. After the meeting, Iliescu announced  that the Romanian Government will reexamine the customs  regulations.</p>

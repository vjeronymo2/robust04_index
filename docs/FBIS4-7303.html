			<p>BFN     [Text] Communists in the breakaway factions who are opposed  to Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Maria  Sison have been charged with kidnapping and holdups,  embezzlement, corruption of comrades and gross misrepresentation  and usurpation of authority. They will be tried in a "people's  court," the party said yesterday.    In a statement, CPP spokesman Gregorio "Comrade Roger"  Rosal,  also said the "court" may resort to "extraordinary measures" to  get the side of Arturo Tabara, Romulo Kintanar, Ricardo Reyes  and Felimon Lagman. He did not say what those measures would be.    It was hinted, however, that the former rebel leaders facing  charges might themselves be made to face the "people's court."    "Alang-alang sa rebolusyonaryong katarungan, hindi tututulan  ng Partido kung ang hukumang bayan ay gagawa ng mga  ekstraordinaryong hakbang upang makuha ang panig ng mga akusado  -- basta't may sapat na mga pananggalang laban sa peligro ng  pagkakanulo sa kaaway [For the sake of the truth in the  revolutionary movement, the Party will not object if the  `people's court' will take extraordinary measures to get the  side of the accused -- as long as there is sufficient basis of  threat from the enemies]," Rosal said.    He also said the Party was not in a hurry to proceed with  the  trial. "Alam namin ang maraming malalaking gawain at maraming  limitasyong hinaharap ngayon ng mga kasama sa rebolusyonaryong  kilusan. Ang mahalaga ay maitala nang buong linaw ang  malalaking kriminal na pananagutan nina Reyes, Tabara, Kintanar  at Lagman at ilantad sila upang hindi makapanlinlang [We know  that there are more important things to do at this moment and  the members in the movement face some limitations. But, what is  important is that it will be clearly put on record the criminal  offenses of Reyes, Tabara, Kintanar and Lagman, so that they can  no longer beguile any one else]," Rosal said.    Amid the most serious rift to hit the rebel movement in 20  years, the National Democratic Front (NDF) held a "reception"  last Sunday at The Netherlands to celebrate the 25th anniversary  of the New People's Army (NPA) and the 21st anniversary of the  NDF.    A statement from the NDF leadership in Utrecht said more  than  100 took part in the celebration, along with guests from Japan,  Indonesia, India, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands , the United  States as well as a "big number of Filipinos residing in The  Netherlands."    Despite Philippine government pronouncements that the  leftist  rebellion has been all but defeated, Sison declared that the  Philippine revolution holds a "bright future." The ongoing  "rectification movement" that involves the purging of rebels who  refuse to toe the party line was deemed by Sison to be necessary  in "ensuring the steady advance and victory of the revolutionary  movement"    The "Democratic Bloc," the group formed by former comrades  of  Sison who now oppose him, recently announced that members and  leaders of sectoral organizations affiliated with the NDF have  joined the anti-Sison faction.    Yesterday, however, a statement from Reverend Wesley Fiore,  national spokesperson for the Christians for National Liberation  (CNL), said Father Felipe Patricio no longer speaks for the  organization. The CNL, one of the organizations under the NDF,  said the CPPs organizational problems are its own. The CNL  represents members of the religious organizations in the  underground movement.    Active rebel members have no business speaking for their  former comrades who want to avail themselves of the amnesty  program, Senator Rodolfo Biazon (Laban -- Struggle) yesterday  said.    He issued the statement after conducting a series of public  hearings where rebel returnees complained that the objections  raised by rebel leaders to Proclamation No. 347 will deprive  them of their choice to lead a peaceful life.    He said the typical response of former rebels in the regions  was articulated by one Manuel Raga in Tuguegarao whom he quoted  as saying: "We are sick and tired of Sison, Jalandoni, Honasan  and Misuari speaking for us. We have already left their  movements. All we want is a peaceful life "    Proclamation 347 grants amnesty to communist and Muslim  rebels who may have committed crimes against public order in  pursuit of their political beliefs.    Biazon, who heads the committee, has conducted hearings in  Tuguegarao, Cagayan; Naga City; Catbalogan, Samar; lloilo  City; lligan City and Davao City.</p>

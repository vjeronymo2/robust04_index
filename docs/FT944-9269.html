			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: US automotive recovery helps Wilshaw to Pounds 2.24m Recovery in the US automotive industry helped lift interim profits at Wilshaw, the specialist metals and distribution group, by 65 per cent. The company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.24m (Pounds 1.36m) for the six months to September 30, on turnover up by 26 per cent to Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 18m). Mr Guy Askham, chairman, said increased demand for magnets in cars helped the specialist metals division to more than double operating profit to Pounds 989,000 on turnover of Pounds 7.73m. The company is spending Pounds 500,000 building a new facility to manufacture bonded magnets for computers, electronics and small electric motors. The distribution division, which sells tractor parts, reported operating profits up 40 per cent to Pounds 1.61m on turnover of Pounds 12.2m. In April the company acquired Agripieces, the French distributor, for Pounds 1.75m in shares. This contributed Pounds 290,000 operating profit. Earnings per share rose to 1.62p (1.05p). The interim dividend is raised from 0.2p to 0.25p.</p>

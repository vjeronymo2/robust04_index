			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> OCTD APPROVES PLAN FOR MONORAIL TO AIRPORT  </P> <P> A developer's plan to build a privately financed monorail between John Wayne  Airport and an Irvine office center received unanimous support Monday from  Orange County Transit District board members.  </P> <P> Transit agency board members praised McDonnell Douglas Realty Co., the firm  that has offered to pay for the $3.5-million, half-mile monorail. It would link  the company's 23-story twin office towers in Douglas Plaza with the new  passenger terminal, which is due to open in April, 1990.  </P> <P> Board members said private financing for such facilities is welcome and  necessary because government does not have the money to build them.  </P> <P> Construction is expected to begin later this year.  </P> <P> The vote came at the board's meeting Monday at OCTD headquarters in Garden  Grove.  </P></p>

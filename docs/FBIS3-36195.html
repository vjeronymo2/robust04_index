			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] Yesterday another round of Russian-Estonian  interstate talks began in Nakhabino, near Moscow. The program  of discussion includes military, humanitarian, economic, and  border problems. The Estonian side is primarily interested in a  detailed schedule for the pullout of Russian troops from  Estonia. The Estonian delegation is ready to agree to the  Russian proposal on the final withdrawal date (31 August 1994)  only if Estonia gets a schedule providing for a priority pullout  of combat units and subdivisions. Vasiliy Svirin, chief Russian  negotiator, said last week that such a detailed document has  been prepared and it specifies the date for the relocation of  each military unit. The schedule will be presented during the  talks. Vyano Reynar, Estonia's ambassador extraordinary and  plenipotentiary, who has replaced Juri Luik at the post of chief  Estonian negotiator, has expressed the hope that in spite of a  number of contradictions, the main treaty on the pullout of  Russian troops will be ratified after all. At the same time Ago  Tiyman, the delegation's executive secretary and head of its  military group, stressed that Estonia would like the Russian  side not to link economic and political problems, in particular  the issue of human rights. It is precisely for this reason, he  thinks, that the fully elaborated and prepared agreements and  treaties on economic matters have not been signed yet.</p>

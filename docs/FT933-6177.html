			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Potter deplores BBC's 'Dalek' leadership MR DENNIS POTTER, the distinguished television playwright who has frequently written for the BBC, last night suggested that the corporation be broken up into smaller units. Mr Potter told the Edinburgh television festival that the time was near when public service broadcasting had to be saved from the BBC. 'The old Titan should spawn smaller and more nimble offspring if its present controllers cannot be removed,' he said in the James MacTaggart Lecture which traditionally opens the festival. The playwright suggested separating radio from television and turning BBC2 into a separate public service broadcaster. 'Let us begin to consider afresh how the thousands of millions of pounds of licence money could be apportioned between two, three or four successors to the currently misled corporation,' he said. Mr Potter said the political pressure from market-obsessed radicals and the BBC's confused self-defence had drawn the organisation so heavily into the 'dogma-coated discourses' of 'market efficiency' that in the end it might lose sight of why it was there in the first place. He attacked what he saw as a one-way system of communication in the corporation which carried signals laden with 'costive, blurb and bubble-driven didacticism'. In a clear reference to Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman, and Mr John Birt, director-general, Mr Potter said: 'You cannot make a pair of croak-voiced Daleks appear benevolent, even if you dress one of them in an Armani suit and call the other Marmaduke.' The BBC was under governors who seemed incapable of performing the public trust invested in them and under a chairman who seemed to believe he was heading a private fiefdom. Mr Potter also argued for the vigorous enforcement and even extension of current cross-ownership provisions to prevent 'dangerous concentrations of the media power which plays such a large part in our lives'. He said no individual, group or company should be allowed to own more than one daily, one evening and one weekly newspaper. No newspaper should be allowed to own a television station and vice versa. Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of BBC Network Television, said last night: 'The world of broadcasting has changed. And the BBC must change as well . . . Radical reform was our only option. I make no apology for seeking a BBC that is well-run.'</p>

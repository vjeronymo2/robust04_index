			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (4): Critical Alpine passes - Communications TICINO, as every Ticinese will tell you, is first and foremost a transit canton. From the 13th century when the Gotthard pass was opened, the triangular territory descending from the Nufenen, Gotthard, Lukmanier and San Bernardino passes has been of crucial strategic importance in traffic between northern and southern Europe. The early Swiss confederates fought often and fiercely to gain control of the territory, initially winning Bellinzona and later all the territory to Lugano and Locarno. By the early 16th century, all of Ticino was controlled by the confederation, and the territory remained a sort of colony until 1803 when, thanks to a Napoleonic Act of Mediation, it was transformed into a canton in its own right. Today, the Swiss are equally determined to control the critical north-south Alpine passes in their territory. Last year, a majority of the people endorsed in a national referendum the principle of building two new high-speed rail tunnels through the Alps - one of them through the Gotthard, the other through the Lotchberg - to improve the Simplon line. A century ago, when the first rail tunnel was drilled through the Gotthard, the then poor Swiss were content to lean on Italy and Germany for substantial financial support. Today, the more prosperous Swiss insist on paying for the tunnels themselves, even though the Italians and Germans will be the main beneficiaries. It is debatable how much benefit these new tunnels - or indeed the existing ones - are to Ticino. The Ticinese themselves are inclined to be self-critical and say that they have not profited much from the passage of so much important business and so many important people through their territory over the years. But there is no doubt that the canton's fortunes were dramatically improved by the opening of the first Gotthard railway line in 1882. It marked the beginning of the industrialisation of the canton and - even if that was achieved more by immigrating Swiss-Germans from the north than by local Ticinese - it was also the beginning of a period of growing prosperity that continues to our time. The opening of the Gotthard road tunnel in 1980 has been a mixed blessing - certainly improving access to the canton for motor tourists from northern Europe, but also bringing appalling noise and emission pollution from giant lorries that thunder through. So what is the balance sheet of the new rail tunnel likely to look like for Ticino? Mr Dick Marty, the canton's governor, is fairly sanguine. In the first place, he says, it should take a lot of lorries off the motorway, thus preventing a disaster. 'If we do nothing, by 2010 the motorway will be unbearable,' Mr Marty says. Why will freighters abandon the motorway? The idea is that the new tunnel, which is to run from Arth-Goldau in the canton of Schwyz south to Bodio in the Leventine valley, will have minimal grades and curves. That means that trains will be able to pass through at much higher speeds than can now be achieved either on the conventional railway, with its corkscrew and hairpin turns, or on the motorway. The journey from Basle to Lugano, for example, should take 1 1/2 hours compared with more than three hours on existing infrastructure. Experts believe that, provided the tariffs are right, that will be irresistible to truckers. The other benefit Mr Marty cites is to tourism. According to a recent study, nearly two thirds of those who cross the Gotthard either originate or end their journeys in Ticino. With the new tunnel, people will be able to get to the canton much more quickly. Mr Remigio Ratti, director of the canton's Istituto di ricerche Economiche and a transport economics specialist, is less optimistic. Indeed, he argues that if the project proceeds as planned, it will have a negative effect on Ticino. 'It will make Lugano into a suburb of Zurich,' he claims. The problem is that the Swiss, rather like the British with the channel tunnel, have not made any plans for what will happen to the new rail lines once they get to Lugano. Mr Ratti says that unless provisions are made for efficient connections to other Ticino cities and, more importantly, to Milan, then the most significant effect of the project will be to facilitate passenger travel between Lugano and points north of the Alps. Mr Ratti has joined with a number of local engineers led by Mr Aurelio Galfetti, the architect, in preparing a plan aimed at meeting these regional needs. The group presented it earlier this year to government and Swiss railway officials in Bern, but got a rather chilly response. The government sold the whole project to the people last year with the promise that it would cost SFr14bn, already a numbing amount of money. But since then, the engineers have sharpened their pencils and the general view is that the cost will be at least double the advertised sum. A few weeks ago, the federal finance minister suggested that only one of the two proposed new trans-Alpine lines be built, an idea that sent shudders through Ticino. They fear that if one is cancelled, it will be the Gotthard line because it is the more expensive one. 'We are a bit worried,' Mr Marty admits. 'We are the victims of our own Swiss perfectionism,' he suggests. 'We need more courage and fewer accountants. Yes, this project is expensive, but it will set the living conditions here for the next 100 years, just like the last rail tunnel did.'</p>

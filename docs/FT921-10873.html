			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Pay deal set to avert German steel strike A DISRUPTIVE steel strike in Germany appeared to have been averted yesterday after union leaders struck a last-ditch pay bargain with employers. The IG Metall union urged steelworkers to accept a pay package equal to a 6.35 per cent rise in the country's first big wage settlement this year. Members are to be asked to annul last week's overwhelming strike vote following the weekend deal, which includes a basic 5.9 per cent across-the-board rise and a one-off bonus of DM175 (Pounds 60.80). The settlement straddles the 6 per cent upper limit considered the maximum tolerable to the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, before it can consider reducing interest rates from their record levels. There was concern that the agreement would encourage other unions involved in, or about to start, their 1992 pay talks to strike in pursuit of claims which so far are averaging 10 per cent. Mr Rudiger Pohl, an independent economic adviser to the Bonn government, criticised the settlement, describing it as a case of 'pilot error'. The overall 6.35 per cent deal would set 'a standard for the whole economy', Mr Pohl claimed. The Bundesbank would interpret such agreements as provocation and maintain its high-interest policies, he predicted. Mr Helmut Kaiser, head of research at Deutsche Bank, said he was glad a strike and lost production had been avoided, and that the 'absolute pain threshold of 6 per cent' had not been overstepped. But he was anxious the deal should not be seen as a 'pilot settlement' for other sectors. The agreement did little to ease tension in world markets watching the Bundesbank for signs of relaxation of its tight grip on German money supply and interest rates. Although no rate cuts are expected until after the main pay deals have been completed, bankers and governments elsewhere in the European Community had hoped for a clearer indication of the outcome of the pay round. Steel employers warned that the extra costs of the 'unexpectedly high' settlement would have to be met by rationalisation. The industry is thought to be planning to cut its 130,000 workforce by at least 6,000 this year. Some 70,000 jobs have been lost since 1981. The deal was hammered out in secret at an industry 'summit' at the weekend after intervention by Mr Johannes Rau, prime minister of North Rhine Westphalia, the north-western state where the steel industry is concentrated. Mr Heinz Kriwet, chairman of Thyssen, Germany's biggest steelmaker, and Mr Franz Steinkuhler, chairman of the IG Metall union, joined talks with Mr Rau and the two sides' chief negotiators. According to Mr Steinkuhler, the settlement proved 'that reasonable agreements are possible even in these economically difficult times'. It also allowed the union to bring wages for steelworkers closer to those of their better-paid colleagues in engineering. Mr Klaus Murmann, head of the BDA employers' association, stressed the importance of keeping rises below 6 per cent. The most important element in the package for him was 'the five before the decimal point', he said. The next confrontation over pay is expected at talks between public employers and the OTV public services union.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi, May 29 (AFP) - An envoy from breakaway  south Yemen said on Sunday [29 May] he expected the United  Nations Security Council [UNSC] to call for a ceasefire in the  next few days.    "I expect the Security Council to discuss the Yemeni problem  in the next few days and to issue a resolution calling for a  ceasefire," the envoy, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, told AFP  before flying to Kuwait. "The resolution will be binding to all  parties and we are ready to stick to it. I think it is in the  interest of the Yemeni people to halt the war," he said.    Al-'Attas, envoy of southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid who  proclaimed a separate state on May 21, met United Arab Emirates  (UAE) President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan and briefed  him on the four-week war. The official news agency WAM said he  expressed appreciation of the UAE leaders role to stop  hostilities between the south and the north.    Al-'Attas, referred to by WAM as envoy of President al-Bid,  has also visited Saudi Arabia, Syria and other Arab states and  will fly to Bahrain after Kuwait. Sources close to him said he  might later go to Aden.    Al-Attas's comments coincided with press statements by UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that he would send an  envoy to Yemen after a ceasefire to help reconcile warring  parties and restore unity. The secretary general said contacts  were underway among Security Council members as well as with  Arab countries involved in Yemeni mediation to discuss the civil  strife and issue a resolution on a ceasefire.    "I hope the Security Council will issue a resolution calling  on the Yemeni parties to halt hostilities and to ask the UN  secretary general to send a special envoy on a fact-finding  mission so the United Nations will try to reconcile the two  parties within the framework of the Yemeni unity," he told the  United Arab Emirates semi-official daily AL-ITTIHAD. "I will  assign an envoy who will be trusted by the two warring parties.  He will start contacts in Yemen once a ceasefire is enforced."    Yemen's northern leaders, battling rivals in the south since  May 5, have rejected any UN role in the crisis on the grounds it  is an internal affair.    Egypt, Saudi Arabia and four Gulf Arab states have asked the  Security Council to discuss the war and call for a ceasefire to  pave the way for a dialogue. "From my contacts with the  concerned parties, they could agree on putting the Yemeni issue  to UN debate and on a resolution on the crisis," Butrus-Ghali  said. "If we assume there is opposition from some parties, the  Security Council has the authority to issue such a resolution.  But I am hopeful the warring parties will realise that it is in  their interest to cooperate with the Security Council."    He said he had discussed the Yemeni war with US President  Bill Clinton and sought his support for peaceful efforts.  "President Clinton agreed in principle that the Security Council  issue a resolution on a ceasefire in Yemen," he said.</p>

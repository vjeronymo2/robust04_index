			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Personal View: Compelling case for monetary union Economic and monetary union is the central part of the project for European unification. For a country to transfer power over its currency to an independent European central bank represents a most far-reaching form of European integration, not least because the central bank's decisions would affect governmental decisions in many other fields of economic and social policy. The European states linked by monetary union will need to show solidarity in many other spheres. If they were to drift apart on fundamental questions of foreign and security policy, for example, it would jeopardise the consensus needed in the economic field. Once the fundamental link between monetary and political union is recognised, three important assertions can be made. First, European Union members that form the 'core' of monetary union will also be, for the foreseeable future, at the core of political union. Second, any country that opposes monetary union can also be held to oppose political union, and vice versa. Third, any country that comes out against either of these goals clearly has no interest in the success of the 1996 intergovernmental conference to review progress since the Maastricht treaty. This conference will be important for trying to bring about further improvements in plans for political union, matching the agreements on monetary union made at Maastricht in 1991. No one can be in any doubt that monetary union is necessary. The D-Mark occupies what some feel to be a dominant position in Europe. As a result, the existing European Monetary System, which is in essence a German one, cannot be a permanent solution for Europe's monetary arrangements. In the long run, it is unacceptable for other member states to have to acquiesce in monetary decisions made by the Bundesbank. A recent discussion paper from the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union parliamentary group in Bonn attracted controversy because it postulated the likelihood of a core group emerging in the EU comprising those member states ready for monetary union. In reality, however, this statement contained nothing that was new. Not all 12 members of the EU will be able to take part in European monetary union (Emu) in 1997, or even after 1999, because they will not meet the convergence criteria for Emu set down in the Maastricht treaty. This has already been tacitly acknowledged in recent budgetary projections by Spain and Portugal, at least as far as 1997 is concerned. After the publication of the CDU/CSU paper, some observers in Britain voiced their hope that France would not join an Emu core group that included Germany but not other larger EU member states. Some people in Britain even appear to think that this could cause the Emu project to fail - perhaps for good. Such an argument flies in the face of reality, however. Even if monetary union were limited at first to a small core, each non-German member would be in a better position than today, since decisions would be taken not by the Bundesbank but jointly by a European central bank. Any country that meets the convergence criteria, therefore, has an interest in taking part in Emu as soon as practicable. Countries that deliberately chose not to take part in such a union would be in a difficult position. If the D-Mark is held to be dominant today, how much more would this apply to a future European currency in a monetary union comprising perhaps eight or 10 present and future member states? Countries outside Emu would have no say in the decisions of the European central bank. This would be a serious handicap to a country such as Britain which has Europe's largest financial market. There are other reasons, too, why Germany is interested in monetary union. Germany is no longer capable of, or interested in, exercising some form of European hegemony. Its strength vis-a-vis its European partners - in economic, political or military terms - is not comparable with that of the US vis-a-vis its partners in the Bretton Woods system or Nato after the second world war. The overwhelming desire of the German political establishment is to invest the country's strength in the construction of Europe. That fact has not been changed by the result of the German general elections, even though Chancellor Helmut Kohl's majority in the Bundestag has fallen. If, however, efforts to establish monetary union were to fail, the process of political integration would also come to a halt, at least for the time being. This would have disastrous consequences - not simply for Germany but also, directly or indirectly, for all other EU states. We Germans, facing various temptations and pressures to adopt a 'go-it-alone' policy towards eastern Europe, see - due to the catastrophe of 1945 perhaps a little bit clearer than other European states - the need to learn the lessons of history. Yet the Europe of the future cannot and must not be built simply on the lessons of the past. The imperatives of the present are equally compelling, and these call for common European institutions. The nation states of Europe must face the reality that they are no longer capable of mastering by ourselves all their external challenges. Those who cling to national sovereignty are seeking solace in an empty shell. In trying to escape from Europe, they are seeking to escape reality. And this is an endeavour which, as everyone knows, is doomed to failure.

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Observer: Hilfe] Most German businessmen can clinch a deal in English with facility, but there are times when even they wish to resort to their native lingo. In January, the Federation of German Industry (BDI) is holding a high-level seminar on industrial trends throughout Europe. Not content with the stilted discussions so often the product of simultaneous translation, it is urgently seeking some senior executives from Britain and France to take part in a panel discussion. Extraordinarily enough, the BDI cannot think of anyone from either country who can make him or herself easily understood in the language of Goethe. Bright ideas please to the BDI's spokesman Volker Franzen, tel no 49 221-370 8565.</p>

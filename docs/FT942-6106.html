			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Sugar signs new chief executive - Amstrad fills top post after seven-month search Amstrad, the consumer electronics group run by Mr Alan Sugar, yesterday appointed Mr David Rogers, a senior Philips executive, to the post of chief executive. Mr Rogers, aged 47, is currently chief executive of Philips Advanced Communication Enterprise, an investment vehicle for the Dutch electronics group, and will take up his new appointment in August. He was previously head of Philips Consumer Communications business which has annual sales of about Pounds 300m and is responsible for Philips' worldwide interests in telephones, facsimile machines, telephones and other products. His appointment comes seven months after Mr Sugar first announced that he planned to split the roles of chairman and chief executive and began the search for someone to fill the new job. The appointment comes at a critical time for Amstrad which is attempting to develop new markets to offset declining margins in its older consumer electronic operations. Mr Sugar and Mr Rogers are understood to have spent considerable time together over the past couple of months in an effort to ensure that 'the chemistry was right' and that they could work together effectively. Mr Sugar, Amstrad's colourful chairman and founder, has also strengthened the board through the appointment of two non-executive directors in the past 18 months. Mr Rogers' appointment appears to underline Mr Sugar's determination to expand Amstrad's advanced telecommunications equipment operations and to strengthen the group's strategic plan-ning. In his last job Mr Rogers was responsible for Philips' investment in General Magic, a Californian-based software company founded by the two lead designers of the Apple Macintosh. Before joining Philips in 1986 Mr Rogers spent most of his career in the British electronics industry working for both GEC and Plessey. He also had a five year spell with Black &amp; Decker. He has considerable international experience - particularly of the European Union, the US and east Asian markets. Mr Rogers speaks French and German and has a BA in business management.</p>

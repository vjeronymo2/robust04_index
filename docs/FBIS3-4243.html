			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 26 (XINHUA) -- China is to introduce  a set of new rules for foreign trade arbitration from June 1  this year.    The move is aimed at accelerating the modernization and  internationalization of China's international economic and trade  arbitration.    Cheng Dejun, vice-chairman and secretary-general of the  China  International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission  (CIETAC), said here today that the new rules will give better  expression to the principle of respecting the will of the  parties concerned and will be loser to international practice.    The existing rules for CIETAC, which is attached to the  China  Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), went  into force five years ago.    Cheng told a press conference that the amendment will better  meet the demand of China's further reform and opening-up and  building of a socialist market economy.    The new rules are complete in contents and easier to apply.    Added to the contents are provisions about jurisdiction,  arbitration agreement, withdrawal of arbitrators, evidence,  mediation, principles and deadlines for hearing cases,  examination and rendering of awards, and making, alteration and  addition of rulings, simple procedure, and abandoning of  disagreement as well as the working language for the hearing.    Cheng said that the new rules are more convenient for  parties  concerned and conducive to working efficiency and an  independent, fair, smooth and prompt settlement of international  economic and trade disputes.    CIETAC has drawn up a new list of 290 arbitrators including  87 from 22 other countries and regions.    During the past few years, CIETAC has accepted over 200  cases  annually; last year the figure rose sharply to a record 504, an  increase of some 90 percent over the previous year.</p>

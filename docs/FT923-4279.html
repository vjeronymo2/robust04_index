			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Technology: Acquiring new tricks - Geof Wheelwright describes how the humble fax machine has become an indispensable part of the office Since the facsimile machine first started to become a popular business tool in the early 1980s, it has changed out of all proportion. Once a slow and limited form of sending documents from one place to another over the phone line, it has become the heart of many office data and telecommunications operations. A number of important functions have given the humble fax machine much greater responsibility. These include: Corporate document management. When you circulate copies of a document around the country using the postal system or even a company's interbranch mail system, you can never guarantee exactly when the document has been sent and when it will arrive. With a fax machine, you can not only be sure that a copy of your document arrives moments after it is sent, but the built-in 'log' facility on most modern fax machines will automatically track which documents were sent, how many pages were in each document and when it was successfully received. Telephone management. Most modern fax machines incorporate a number of telephony functions. These include the ability to determine whether an incoming call is from another fax machine or a voice call, unattended answering of voice calls using an 'answering machine' mode, storage of large numbers of telephone numbers in the fax machine's internal memory and allowing the fax machine to double as a standard business telephone. Personal photocopying. Surprising as it may seem, fax machines are generally cheaper than photocopiers. For this reason many smaller enterprises use the 'copy' function of their fax machine to prevent laying out unnecessary cash for costly and more bulkier photocopy machines. Personal computer connectivity. Upmarket fax machines are starting to snuggle up to PCs. Major telecoms manufacturers such as Panasonic now offer computer interfaces at the back of their machines. These computer interfaces allow PCs to control the operation of the fax machine and hook up via a parallel or serial port. The software which usually comes with such PC connections allows the fax machine to act as a 'printing' device so that anything generated on the PC's screen can be sent as a fax. Anything received on the fax can either be printed out or saved as an image file on the PC. Using some innovative software from Xerox, you can even use a fax machine to give instructions to a PC. Known as PaperWorks, this software operates by having you fax a special form to your computer containing details of what you want it to do. The computer will then act accordingly on the instructions - which would most commonly be to fax back information stored on the computer itself. It is designed for people who often need to get at the information on their desktop computer, but do not want the encumbrance or cost of carrying a portable PC around with them when they travel. Xerox expects the system to have great appeal for people who are self-employed and work from home. Meanwhile, computers and fax machines are converging into one single system in many cases - eliminating the need for a dedicated fax machine altogether. The simplest example of this is a fax machine that uses PC and laser or ink jet technologies to produce what are called 'plain paper' faxes. These are ordinary fax machines with slightly more processing power and the ability to produce faxes on plain plain, rather than the thermal paper used in most machines. The second category of computer integration comes with fax devices that hook up to PC laser printers. These are miniature PCs in their own right but are dedicated solely to the purpose of handling faxes. JetFax's JetFax II, for example, will hook up to any Hewlett-Packard LaserJet or compatible laser printer and allow you to print incoming faxes out on the laser printer or send anything generated on-screen as a fax. HP has its own fax attachment, known as the LaserJet Fax, which does the same thing but allows you to send ordinary paper documents as faxes along with anything generated on screen. If you have little need for a printer, there is a huge variety of fax modems which will accomplish the same task - and many start for as little as Pounds 150. These are generally Hayes-compatible internal modems which come with fax 'send and receive' software. They allow you to fax documents directly from the PC which you would normally print out on a printer, and also take whatever is received from a standard fax machine and turn it into a computer graphics file that can be incorporated into other documents. According to a recent study by Norwell, Massachusetts-based BIS Strategic Decisions, 1991 fax modem sales in the US exceeded 500,000 units - more than double the number sold in the previous year. BIS says that fax modems currently make up 13 per cent of all fax products sold and predicts that modem sales will rise to 47 per cent of all fax products sold by 1995. Meanwhile, leading California-based market research firm Dataquest predicts that 8m fax modems will be installed by 1995 - something like five times the number in use today. By then the value of annual sales will reach Dollars 1.1bn. All of this has Intel Corporation - which has a strong business selling fax modems in North America - optimistic about the future of the technology. 'The conventional modem capable only of handling data is a dying breed,' says Dick Gough, desktop enhancements business unit manager for Intel's PC enhancement division. 'Today's users expect data and fax functionality when they buy a modem.' The only area where fax modems really fall down is that they are not ideal for transmitting documents that you did not create on the computer. If, for example, your lawyer faxes over a document which needs a signature, you will have a hard time providing that with an on-screen copy of the fax. The short message is that although fax machines, printers, scanners and computers are fast coming together - they are not quite there yet. And before you decided to junk your traditional fax machine in favour of a PC-based alternative, take a long hard look at what you expecting it to do first.</p>

This was the third event of its kind. This year  it was held within the framework of the "Aircraft Engines-94"  international exhibition.    A wide range of Air Force equipment was on show, from the  old  Tu-95 long-range aircraft, which has been in the arsenal for  more than 40 years now, to the super-modern Su-35. During a  demonstration flight of the latter, test pilot Viktor Pugachev  performed a new aerobatic maneuver for the numerous spectators.  For the time being it has been dubbed a "sideways cobra."  [video shows maneuver] Spectators were enraptured by the  amazingly harmonious demonstration flights performed by pilots  of the Kubinka Flight Center. [video shows formation flight]    Experts and interested onlookers were able to observe the  Tu-160 strategic bomber and Ka-50 front support helicopter at  work.    Characteristically, this grand event had been prepared by  frontline aviation officers with the active support of numerous  sponsors and aircraft enthusiasts.

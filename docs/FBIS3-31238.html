			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska  republic, gave a news conference in the international press  center on Mount Jahorina today. Numerous journalists' questions  referred to the current situation in the Srpska republic after  the latest NATO threats. [passage omitted]    The ultimatum is a direct consequence of the Sarajevo  massacre. An international investigative commission has been set  up. Asked by a reporter whether the Serbs will insist that the  investigation be fully completed by the ultimatum deadline and  whether the operation of withdrawing Serb artillery will be  canceled if the investigation ends up with some positive results  for the Serb side, and whether the international community will  turn the spearhead of its ultimatum on to the perpetrators in  such a case, Radovan Karadzic replied:    [Begin Karadzic recording] I believe that the international  community already knows who committed the massacre in Merkale  marketplace. It is in our interest to have the investigation  carried out as soon as possible and to have the results  published as soon as possible. The main reason is that delaying  the investigation will result in the loss of evidence; the  passage of time blurs any conclusions about the perpetrator of  this crime, this act of terrorism.    We believe that the Muslim side is doing everything to  disguise and conceal the evidence so as to prevent the  commission from drawing adequate legal conclusions. This  nothwithstanding, even if the fact that it was the Muslims who  did it is revealed and announced, NATO and some countries, some  NATO member countries, will not change their decision regarding  the Serbs. Although they know all too well what the Serbs are  doing, that the Serbs favor peace whereas the Muslims opt for  war, they have not changed their attitude. [end recording]    At today's news conference the president of the Srpska  republic also spoke about the UN Security Council's current  position and Russia's stance in this context.    [Begin Karadzic recording] I believe that the UN Security  Council is in a precarious situation, as it is clear that the  Serb side is doing its best to bring about peace while the  Muslim side is advocating war. There is, however, no  willingness within the UN Security Council and the international  community to tell the full truth. In this light the position of  the UN Security Council is delicate. China's attitude to this  issue, though, is to be applauded. I also believe that Russia  is getting increasingly aware that the true target of the entire  campaign and crisis is Russia rather than Serbia. [end recording]</p>

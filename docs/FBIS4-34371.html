			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Minister German Quiroga has reported that  the U.S. Government has extended once again the deadline for  eradicating 5,000 hectares of coca and 20,000 square meters of  coca nurseries, this time until September 1994.    Quiroga explained that once the commitment is signed,  Washington will disburse the $20 million aid for the local  balance of payment.    Quiroga explained that thanks to the government  negotiations,  it was possible to get the U.S. to extend the deadline.    Quiroga recalled that once the 31 March 1994 deadline  expired, the Bolivian Government began negotiations to have it  extended until next September.    Quiroga also explained that the conditions established by  the  U.S. Government are not mandatory for the government.    He added: "We either accept the resources and carry out the  policy or we simply do not accept it and we do not carry it out."</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> D'RIVERA OFFERS MORE THAN BASICS AT CATALINA'S  </P> <P> Paquito D'Rivera, the Cuban saxophonist who docked at Catalina's Bar and Grill  in Hollywood on Tuesday, believes in giving the people value for money.  </P> <P> Example: In what was announced as an original composition dedicated to Carmen  McRae, he managed to include quotes from "Mona Lisa," "Samba de Orfeu,"  "Pagliacci," "Allen's Alley" and a couple of other unidentified flying  melodies. Seven tunes for the price of one.  </P> <P> The basic melody was pleasant enough, though it might have worked  advantageously at a less frenetic tempo. Even D'Rivera seemed aware of this.  Granting that the pace was "a bit hectic," he said: "Now we'd like to offer our  South of the Border version of 'Summertime.' "  </P> <P> Starting with a synthesizer vamp by Cocho Abres, this took almost five minutes  to get to "Summertime" itself, played in 6/4 time, followed by a 4/4 passage  leading to a clarinet-and-cymbal interlude, a keening guitar foray by Fareed  Haque, and an alto saxophone solo in which D'Rivera managed to incorporate bits  and pieces from "Rhapsody in Blue" and "But Not For Me."  </P> <P> On a final samba the rhythmic accents were underlined by two Peruvians, Oscar  Estagnaro on bass and Alex Acuna, the highly regarded drummer. The arrangement  wove its way in and out of a quote from "Salt Peanuts" (Dizzy Gillespie,  vintage 1945).  </P> <P> With his shrill, abrasive alto sound, high-energy style and genial personality,  D'Rivera kept the customers entertained. He even had jokes such as the  reference to Miami as North Cuba. As a clarinetist he has chops to spare,  though an entire chorus played unaccompanied on "All The Things You Are" seemed  a little much. But at least it didn't include any quotes. The group closes  Sunday. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Letter: Level of UK aid budget Sir, So now we have it from no less an authority (and hard taskmaster) than the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Michel Camdessus: a doubling of the UK's foreign aid budget could easily be afforded. He would give us 'until the end of the century' to reach 0.7 per cent of gross national product (Monday Interview, September 14). Currently, UK aid stands at Dollars 3.25bn and it has been stagnating at around the current 0.32 per cent of GNP for a decade. To achieve a doubling to 0.7 per cent in eight years, and incidentally to match the French, we should need to increase the budget by just over a twelfth annually - that is to add currently a mere Dollars 280m each year (if I rather mischievously assume the economy does not grow; more, more affordably, if it does). I do hope both Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, and Baroness Chalker, overseas development minister, are readers of the Monday Interview as they lock horns for the autumn public spending round, because Britain needs to start now to meet the Camdessus target. Not since the days of Bob Geldof has public support been so strong for increasing development aid and sustained action to alleviate poverty.

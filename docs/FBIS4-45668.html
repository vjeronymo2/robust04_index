			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jeanne Rubner: "Research Tanker Steers a New </F> Course -- Rossendorf Focuses on Materials Science and Reclaiming  the Uranium Mining Area"]    [Text] No, the entrance is by no means imposing. Were it  not for a rusting sculpture of the Greek letter psi surrounded  by spheres in elliptic orbits -- symbolizing atomic physics --  one could drive straight past the gate of the Rossendorf  research site near Dresden without even noticing it.  Nevertheless, with close to 2,000 employees, the former GDR  [German Democratic Republic] Central Institute of Nuclear  Research used to be the largest Academy of Sciences facility,  indeed the largest research institute in the whole of the east.    Even today, the site, with its barbed wire fence and drab  buildings, hardly beckons invitingly to visitors. Perhaps it is  not meant to, for radioactive waste from the research reactor,  which has now been shut down, has been dumped in the Rossendorf  woods. "Things were easier in GDR days," says Gudrun Zwicker,  formerly a physicist in Rossendorf and now consultant to the  scientific director, Wolf Haefele. "In those days the waste  went to Morsleben." This permanent store has now been closed.  The nuclear laboratory had to be sealed up overnight after  unification. Many employees with the requisite know-how have  been dismissed, says Zwicker.    A reprocessing company now looks after radioactive waste  disposal. It was founded in 1992 and employs a staff of 130.  The waste problem is "highly complex and technically  difficult," says Haefele, who was previously the director of the  Juelich Nuclear Research Center. The disposal work will keep  the company busy for 15 to 20 years, he believes.  <H5>  Problems Specific to the East </H5>   The five Rossendorf Research Center institutes that are  currently operative came into being two years ago, some of them  growing out of the sectors positively assessed by the Science  Council. In the same way that the Karlsruhe and Juelich nuclear  research centers are looking around for new tasks, whether in  brain or environmental research, a new profile is also being  sought in Rossendorf. Problems specific to the east compound the  problems also experienced in the west in such attempts to steer  a cumbersome "research tanker" onto a new course. Unlike  Karlsruhe and Juelich, Rossendorf is not a major research  facility, but what is known as a Blue List institute, which is  consequently only 50-percent -- and not 90-percent -- financed  by the Federal Government. The Land of Saxony foots the other  half of the bill. Apart from the new institute directors, some  of whom come from the west, almost all the 450 permanent  employees were inherited from GDR days. Their average age is  very high, and as a result many of them are finding it difficult  to adjust to the changeover. To add to the problems, there is  considerable feeling of insecurity among the researchers.    Indeed, it is not yet known whether all the institutes can  actually carry on in their current form. For example, the  Institute of Nuclear and Hadron Physics is the only one of its  kind left in eastern Europe. However, competition in this field  of research, which is nevertheless slowly becoming extinct, is  considerable in the West. So is the institute still needed? It  also has the problem that its director designate has backed out.  There is thus also some doubt as to whether the planned  electron accelerator will be built.    If it is not, it is unlikely that there will be a major  facility in Rossendorf in the foreseeable future, as the  research reactor, a neutron source previously used for materials  research and for the production of isotopes for medical  applications, has been shut down, contrary to the Science  Council's recommendations. The federal research minister in  office at the time was unwilling to spend the 60 million German  marks that it would have cost to bring the reactor, which had  been renovated immediately prior to the German unification, up  to "western standards."  <H5>  Anxieties About the Future </H5>   The Institute of Safety Research, too, has grounds for  anxiety as to its future. It has to date been working on  Soviet-type reactors, but since the Greifswald pile was shut  down, there have been none left in the Federal Republic. The  Science Council met last week to discuss the future of  Rossendorf and will pronounce judgment in mid- May.    The prospects look better for the Institute of Ion Beam  Physics and Materials Research, where the focus is on  electrically charged atom beam applications in surface treatment  and materials research, things it was doing, at least in part,  before the unification. "At that time, our scientists were  competitive," says director Wolfhard Moeller, "although much of  the apparatus was hopelessly obsolete." This situation has  changed since then, the laboratories now boasting several  ultramodern ion accelerators and the institute being the biggest  of its kind in Europe.  The researchers there use a method, developed back in GDR days,  of extraordinary interest to art historians, as they use proton  beams to study works of art. The charged nuclear components  penetrate the layers close to the surface, and the radiation  emitted (X-ray waves, or protons themselves) makes it possible  to identify the chemical elements contained in the colors used  in a painting, for instance. The applications for this  noninvasive test procedure are self-evident: If the yellow, for  example, is not a lead and tin mixture but a chrome mix not  available in the middle ages, whereas the painting is attributed  to that period, it could be a fake.    The institute is also engaged in work on miniature sensors.  Sophisticated instruments have usually been needed to date to  detect certain pollutants in the environment, especially when  they occur in minute quantities. The intention is therefore to  build sensitive sensors that can be produced cheaply and on an  industrial scale for deployment on numerous sites. The  individual components required are already available: special  semiconductor devices known as ion- sensitive field-effect  transistors measure concentrations of substances in, for  instance, a water sample. Liquids are fed through by micropumps  and valves.  <H5>  Measuring Ion Levels in the Blood </H5>   The time has now come to combine these components on a small  silicon wafer, thus creating a complete, autonomous measuring  system capable of handling small samples. A system of this type  could also be of interest to the medical profession, for  measuring ion levels in the blood, for instance. The Rossendorf  researchers have now succeeded in building a pump that is  incorporated into the silicon wafer. It measures one centimeter  square and can flush one microliter of liquid per hour through a  fine pore. The scientists hope to present a complete measuring  system within the next few months.    Another institute in Rossendorf, the Radiation Chemistry  Institute, is endeavoring to assist Wismut GmbH with reclamation  work on the former uranium mine. "About 250,000 tonnes of  uranium ore have been mined in Saxony and Thuringia since 1945.  The earth was completely raped by pumping acids in," says Heino  Nitsche, director of the institute. Gigantic contaminated  areas, shafts, and slagheaps are the result.  <H5>  Controversy as To Correct Reclamation Method </H5>   The experts are still arguing over the best way to clean the  area up. In any case, however, the salvage work will cost a  great deal of money. "So it is worthwhile getting the basic  principles straight to start with," says Nitsche. In other  words, how does radioactivity spread in the air and soil, how do  the rock and water strata interact with one another, and what  by-products are formed when uranium decomposes? "There are  already models that describe the spread of radioactive  substances, for example," says Nitsche. All they need to obtain  accurate forecasts is precise input data, and this is where the  scientist comes in.</p>

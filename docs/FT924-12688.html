			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / EC frees food aid The EC council of ministers yesterday cleared a long-blocked Ecu350m (Pounds 275.45m) food aid credit to Russia. Exporters welcomed the news, but cast doubt on how quickly food might be dispersed, writes David Dodwell, World Trade Editor. The credit was first earmarked for Russia last December as part of an Ecu1.25bn credit for 12 former Soviet republics. It has been stalled by a dispute over EC demands that Russia should waive its diplomatic immunity privileges over offshore assets if it defaults on loan repayment. Shippers noted that 2m-2.5m tonnes of wheat, barley and corn earmarked in July for the 11 other republics were still blocked by technical problems.</p>

NEC will begin to take orders in December of  1993 for the 0.5&mgr;m cell-based LSI ``CB-C 8 Series'', which  provides users with this type of design environment for the  first time. The chip was developed in conjunction with Synopsys  Inc., a major U.S. manufacturer of logic synthesis tools, and  adopts a delay model that calculates the effects of input  waveform degradation and other effects using a table format. In  this manner, line delay can be calculated in a short time within  an accuracy of 10&percnt; relative to the SPICE simulation  method. The  delay test method can be used not only to evaluate timing, but  also to confirm that delay time meets requirements for logic  synthesis. Test results can be incorporated during logic  synthesis.    NEC will begin taking order in December of 1993 for the  0.5&mgr;m cell-based LSI ``CB-C8 Series.'' this chip provides the  user for the first time with a method that calculates line delay  taking into account the effects in input waveform degradation  and output load capacitance for the design of cell-based LSIs.  The NEC-designed delay model (which includes line equivalency  circuits and approximation methods for signal waveforms) can be  used for verification of timing and also for calculation of  delay time used for reference during logic synthesis. (See Table  1.)  <H5>  Delay Model Determines Success in 0.5&mgr;m Products </H5>   LSI manufacturing companies (such as NEC, Matsushita  Electronic Industrial Co., etc.) agree that the success of the  0.5&mgr;m generation cell-based LSI relies upon the ``line delay  model.'' Even in the 0.8&mgr;m generation, when designing LSIs  having a high operating frequency, ``one-chip system versions  could not be achieved due to the absence of a delay model''  (Casio Computer Co.). However, according to Fujitsu, the cost  involved in rebuilding the design environment was the underlying  problem. In the 0.5&mgr;m generation, high frequency applications  such as in image processing are on the rise, and NEC reports  that ``this problem can no longer be ignored.''    Matsushita Electric and Toshiba, which have preceded NEC in  commercializing 0.5&mgr;m cell-based LSIs, have not released this  type of delay model to customers. Matsuthita Electric recently  reported that although input waveform cannot currently be taking  into consideration, a second-generation model that includes the  effects of the input waveform will be announced in 1994. Toshiba  is also reportedly prepared to release such a model.  <H5>  Calculation of Delay for Input Waveforms </H5>   The parameters emphasized by NEC in the determination of  line  delay are the degradation of input waveform and gate output load  capacitance. The test model and CAD methods were developed  together with Synopsys Inc.    To calculate delay attributed to input waveform and output  load capacitance, the delay times written in a table format are  referenced. The SPICE simulation is a method which is generally  used to accurately calculate line delay arising from the input  waveform. However, the verification time needed for lines in  LSIs which have several hundred thousand gates, becomes  extraordinary. NEC's delay evaluation method which uses a table  format, greatly reduces the verification time required, and also  provides accuracy within 10&percnt; error of the SPICE  simulation.    The new evaluation method can be used not only for timing  verification, but also for predicting line delay for logic  synthesis. Delay time calculations can be done while performing  logic synthesis in order to meet the timing and other conditions  established by the design engineer. In the past, it was  difficult to add revisions to incorporate the results of timing  verification, because the delay model used for timing  verification was not the same as the model used for logic  synthesis.    Establishment of the design environment for 0.5&mgr;m  generation cell-based LSIs has made it possible to use high  performance CPU cores. In the CB-C8 series, the CPU cores which  can be used include the ``V30 MX'' 16-bit processor, the low  power-consumption type RISC processor ``V810'', and the  MIPS-related ``Vr series'' RISC processors. There are also  peripheral function blocks, including a RAM bus interface which  transfer 500M bytes of data per second. The chips will  reportedly be profitable in the market for high-end workstations.    Chip samples will be produced at the Sagamihara plant, and  mass production will take place at NEC Yamaguchi. Once the  0.5&mgr;m technology gains a foothold in the market, plans call  for mass production at NEC Kyushu and NEC Hiroshima, which are  currently producing the CB-C7.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

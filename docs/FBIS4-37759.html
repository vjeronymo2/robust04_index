			<p>BFN     [Text] Mosque imams in Baghdad and the governorates have  called on Muslims all over the world to uphold the Islamic faith  and to close their ranks in order to confront the enemies'  rancorous plans, which seek to undermine our Islamic religion  and divide Muslims into small states in order to usurp their  wealth and national will and dominate their destiny and future.    The imams affirmed in their Friday sermons yesterday that,  God willing, victory will be for justice represented by the  heroic Iraqi confrontation and steadfastness against the mean  aims and interests of the forces of evil, infidelity, deception,  and aggression headed by the United States.    The imams praised leader President Saddam Husayn's generous  offers that increased the wages of civil servants and low-income  people and his orders to oblige grocers to ensure the supply of  food for the people and to strike at greedy horders.    The imams prayed to God almighty to preserve Iraq, its  people, and struggler leader President Saddam Husayn, to  strengthen the march of reconstruction and faith in God and the  homeland, and to support the president against his unjust  enemies.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Envoy resigns over 'WA Inc' affair AN INQUIRY into alleged corruption in Western Australia claimed its first political victim yesterday when Mr Brian Burke, a leading figure in the governing Australian Labor Party, resigned as ambassador to Ireland and the Vatican. Mr Burke, a former Labor premier of Western Australia, is a central figure in the inquiry into the so-called 'WA Inc' affair concerning relations between the state government and local entrepreneurs such as Mr Laurie Connell and Mr Alan Bond. He is expected to begin giving evidence today to the inquiry, which is being carried out by a royal commission appointed by Western Australia's minority Labor government. Senator Gareth Evans, foreign minister, said Mr Burke's decision to resign 'was entirely his own, and not the subject of any request or direction by the government'. However, the resignation followed Senator Evans' admission that Mr Burke's position was under review because of concern over public interest in Ireland and Italy in the royal commission proceedings. Mr Burke's resignation represents a significant political victory for the conservative opposition parties, which have campaigned for his dismissal since the royal commission was appointed in November. Dr John Hewson, leader of the Liberals, the main opposition party, said Mr Burke's resignation was a recognition that he could not continue as ambassador while he remains 'the subject of serious allegations'. The royal commission is investigating business deals over a decade between Labor governments led by Mr Burke and Mr Peter Dowding, and Liberal administrations led by Sir Charles Court and Mr Ray O'Connor. The most serious allegations, involving relationships between politicians and leading businessmen, relate to Mr Burke's premiership between 1983 and 1988. Witnesses have given evidence that business leaders were pressed to contribute to the campaign expenses of the Labor Party, and that secret bank accounts and cash reserves were maintained by party leaders. Mr Burke has repeatedly denied any impropriety. 'Not only have I been responsible for no illegality or impropriety, I am confident the royal commission will in the final analysis find that none of my actions even approach impropriety,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Two newspapers that identified a source who had been promised anonymity must  pay him $200,000 in compensatory damages but not the $500,000 in punitive  damages also awarded by a Hennepin County jury, the Minnesota Court of Appeals  said. The First Amendment guarantee of press freedom does not protect the Star  Tribune of Minneapolis or the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch from liability  under contract laws, in this case their reporters' oral promises of  confidentiality, the three-judge panel said in upholding the compensatory  damage award. But the court rejected public relations man Dan Cohen's claim of  misrepresentation and said he is not entitled to punitive damages.  </P></p>

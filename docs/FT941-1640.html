			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher Marks and Spencer's surging profits are living proof that Kingfisher's everyday low pricing strategy works. Sadly, there is as yet little evidence that it works at Kingfisher. Last year operating profits in the main UK retailing businesses actually fell by 3 per cent, despite all the huffing and puffing. B&amp;Q is a central plank of the EDLP idea, yet profits here will probably be lower in 1996 than they were in 1990. Group earnings may rise by no more than 10 per cent in 1994 and 1995, which goes a long way towards explaining the heavy de-rating of the shares since the turn of the year. Perhaps Kingfisher simply has the right strategy and the wrong businesses. Electrical retailing offers a high return on capital in out-of-town locations, but most store chains are still dogged by their expensive high street shops. If they are eliminated, returns may fall. Superdrug has a weak position against Boots, and may also be squeezed by the food superstores. Woolworths is trying EDLP, but in many of Woolies' specialities, out-of-town chains such as Toys 'R' Us are more effective players of the EDLP game. If Woolworths did not exist, it would probably not be necessary to invent it. Faced with a difficult hand, at least the company is doing most of the right things. Mr Alan Smith, the new chief executive, is strengthening the management team and installing better systems. There may well be a revolution going on at Kingfisher. EDLP may work. But it will be quite a while before shareholders find out whether it is going to benefit them.</p>

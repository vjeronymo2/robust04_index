			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GLUTEN MENACE  </P> <P> I am extremely concerned that The Times has repeatedly run inaccurate  statements about gluten that not only misinform but, more importantly, give  potentially life-threatening information.  </P> <P> For the thousands of people who have Celiac Disease (a chronic, hereditary  intestinal malabsorption disorder), all gluten is bad.  </P> <P> The consequences of a Celiac eating foods with gluten (or derivatives of)  basically boils down to death by starvation, even if they were eating a  "normal," well-balanced diet.  </P> <P> The body fails to absorb fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, and K) and eventually  stops absorbing even the simplest proteins and carbohydrates.  </P> <P> The lack of awareness among the general public (and unfortunately, the medical  community as well) perpetuate the many problems facing Celiacs.  </P> <P> While Celiac Disease affects one out of every 1,500 to 2,000 Americans (the  same ratio as Muscular Sclerosis), patients cannot get the medical information  or FDA labeling laws they need to stay alive and healthy. Celiac is treatable  if diagnosed in time and only when strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is  maintained.  </P> <P>  -- RACHEL KAE  </P> <P> Senior Vice President  </P> <P> Celiac Disease Foundation  </P></p>

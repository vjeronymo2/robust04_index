			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Louis Validire: "An Old Couple on the Verge </F> of Divorce"]    [Text] While a PCF [French Communist Party]  congress is not the same thing as a CGT [General Confederation  of Labor] congress, the relations maintained by the party and  trade union confederation have always formed a cornerstone of  the communist movement. Indeed, the unique feature of the  party's 28th Congress stems from the fact that the communist  leaders of the CGT do not constitute a united bloc; far from it.    Alain Obadia, the confederation's "virtual" No. 2 man (no  such post exists), has created a bit of a media scandal. By  releasing the letter which he sent to Georges Marchais at the  end of December informing him of his intention not to seek a new  term on the PCF Central Committee, he opportunely reminded him  that one of the PCF's discreet--if not secret--trump cards is  also the control it can exercise over the CGT.    In a situation marked by the collapse of communism in the  East Europe and the crumbling of the PCF's election influence in  France, the CGT remains, despite a drop in membership, the  largest trade union force in France, a fact that rouses the envy  of PCF leaders, as well as the astonishment of others.    "Some intend to give trade union leaders instructions, even  when it is a matter of defining the union's guidelines," Obadia  wrote to his party's secretary general, thus unveiling an open  secret for noncommunists, but approaching the problem from an  unusual angle for practitioners of the "usual channels." His  longstanding (despite his youthful appearance) membership in the  CGT-communist nomenklatura only lends more weight to his words.    Indeed, the Marchais "group," mainly working through Michel  Warcholak, organizational secretary of the CGT until the last  congress, currently head of the PCF regions, and still a member  of the Central Committee, has repeatedly tried to bring the  trade union confederation into line. The most elaborate, head-on  attempt took place in October 1992, when the PCF organized a  national conference on business. Its avowed objective was to  bring PCF members together to refine party policy. Actually, it  represented a war machine against the 44th Congress of the CGT,  judged too "open" by the PCF leadership.  <H5>  Iconoclasts </H5>   The failure of the maneuver pointed up the limitations of  the  party's doctrinal power over the trade union confederation.  However, it did not settle the problem of the dual membership of  leaders.    Three CGT officials: Henri Krasucki, Secretary General Louis  Viannet, and Francois Duteil, a member of the Confederal  Secretariat and editor of the newspaper LA VIE OUVRIERE,  recently renamed L'HEBDO to the great chagrin of hard-line  laborites, are retiring members of the PCF Politburo. The  presence of the first of the three, a tribute to the history of  the communist movement, is no more than anecdotal. The other two  will be nominated again. The symbolic significance of a  withdrawal of the secretary general of the CGT would be too  heavy, particularly after Obadia's outburst. As for Francois  Duteil, "Tonton Jambon"--as he is affectionately called in the  halls of the CGT by his friends and, ironically enough, his  foes, for once united--he takes his place good-naturedly in the  ranks of those nostalgic for a time when everything was black or  white. Or simpler, at least!    At the intermediate level, Jacqueline Leonard, in charge of  social welfare issues in the confederal office of the CGT and a  member of the PCF Central Committee--based on the logic of the  old days when any CGT leader was a member of the PCF  organs--shares this "straightforward" conception of party-trade  union relations.    On the opposite side, Gerard Alezard, head of the economic  sector, already suspect in the CGT and the party,  decided--unlike Obadia--to agree to be represented on the  Central Committee. In a noteworthy contribution to the PCF  congress published by L'HUMANITE on 4 January, he wondered  whether the situation had been given proper consideration by the  party and posed the following questions in particular: "Can one  stand still on the notion of `renationalization' without any  further examination of concrete situations? Is it not urgent to  put together innovative elements for the public-private report?"    These iconoclastic questions got him into hot water at the  most recent congress of the CGT's Nord departmental section,  where a welcoming committee mainly made up of members of the  metal union awaited him. The fact remains that they are of  capital importance for the future of relations between the party  and the confederation. The heavyweights of the PTT [Postal and  Telecommunications Administration] and EDF [French Power  Company] federations, which enjoy great influence in the party  as well as the CGT, want to reduce demands to the defense of the  status-quo, without thinking about the slightest problem with  respect to the idea of a necessary shift in case of a crisis.    It all comes down to "knowing whether the PCF congress will  infect the CGT a little more," muses Jean-Christophe Le Duigou,  former secretary general of the CGT's finance federation and,  like Alain Obadia, a signer of the appeal to the "conclave of  social transformation." Le Duigou is close to Philippe Herzog,  who is going to join the economic sector of the CGT, and intends  to remain a member of the PC's Central Committee because "we  must fight on the political level and make a critical voice  heard so as to protect the union." Albeit recognizing that he  does so without excessive illusions.    Whatever the case, it is obvious that if the PCF congress  falls into lockstep with those, particularly in Paris and  Seine-Saint-Denis, who condemned the Socialist Party as the  "main danger and class enemy," it will be difficult to control  the damage within the CGT, as difficult as the prospect of a  refusal to consider the left's return to power in medium-range  terms. The latter would have the effect of strengthening the  confederation's systematic refusal of any compromise, its most  natural tendency.    Indeed, the shillyshallying on both sides illustrates just  how complex the relations of an old couple on the brink of a  divorce are. The hesitations of Jean-Louis Fournie, secretary  general of the Metallurgy Federation, who will finally be  represented on the PCF Central Committee after practically being  a candidate for the Politburo and, in the meantime, having  avowedly resigned from his seat on the Central Committee, is a  caricature of an illustration. When even the diehards doubt, the  skeptics are already banging on the exits.</p>

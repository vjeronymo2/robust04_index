			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Petr Zhuravlev under the "Visit" rubric: "Boris </F> Yeltsin in Georgia. Moscow and Tbilisi Sign Good-Neighbor  Treaty"]    [Text] On Thursday morning the Russian Federation  president arrived in Tbilisi, where he is expected to sign a  wide-ranging treaty with Georgia. In addition it is planned to  sign a whole series of documents, including agreements on the  status and conditions of the presence of Russian border troops  in Georgia and a free-trade agreement between the two countries.  According to Andrey Kozyrev, a centerpiece of the Tbilisi talks  will be the problem of conflict settlement in Abkhazia and South  Ossetia.    The friendship treaty between the Russian Federation and  Georgia would not be different from other documents of such type  were it not for two articles in the text that make it sound more  like a military-political agreement. What is at issue in the  first place is Article 3, which stipulates that Moscow and  Tbilisi "conclude an agreement on providing assistance in  organizing the armed forces of the Republic of Georgia;  equipping them and procuring armaments, military hardware, and  technology without the right to transfer them to third persons  other than upon consent of the Russian Federation." Under  Article 4, Russia and Georgia undertake to "take measures to  stop attempts to use their territories to create subversive  groups" and also to prevent "the infiltration into the territory  of the other side of formations planning to overthrow or to  change its constitutional order or to violate its territorial  integrity."    In light of the above two articles, Eduard Shevardnadze's  recent statements that the thaw in Georgian-Russian relations is  not to the Abkhazian leaders' advantage because it robs them of  "a base for separatism" is becoming more understandable. In  fact, that section of the treaty is clearly pro-Georgian or  anti-Abkhazian, which is actually the same thing. To all  appearances, it will be difficult to have the treaty ratified in  the Federal Assembly. At any rate, yesterday the leaders of the  agrarians, communists, "Russia's Choice," and "Yabloko" signaled  their negative attitude to its current phrasing.    As for President Yeltsin's immediate entourage, the greatest  doubts were raised by the very idea of a head of the Russian  state's paying a visit to Georgia. An authoritative  presidential adviser said that the visit was supported only by  Andrey Kozyrev. The other day Mr. Yeltsin had to learn a whole  series of openly critical opinions from his consultants on  international problems. In particular, although the duration of  the visit was reduced to one day instead of two, its itinerary  still included a meeting with representatives of the Georgian  intelligentsia. In the view of presidential experts, Tbilisi's  intellectuals have an extremely disapproving view of Eduard  Shevardnadze, who will, naturally, accompany his Russian  counterpart to the meeting. That same presidential adviser told  SEGODNYA that "what is at issue is not whether the meeting will  be conclusive and fruitful, but whether we will be able to avoid  incidents."    The problem of possible "incidents" was considered among the  most serious ones during the preparation for the visit. An  advance team of the Kremlin security service, which traveled to  Tbilisi a few days ago "to study the situation on the ground,"  presented a detailed report to their patron, a reliable source  said. The report concluded that going to the Georgian capital  was simply impermissible given the degree of the spread of the  most diverse firearms left from the time of the Abkhazian war.  Boris Yeltsin, however, ignored the opinion of his own  bodyguards.    Georgian special services, too, have been taking emergency  security measures on the eve of the visit. According to news  agencies, the operations to protect and to keep track of the  Russian president's route will involve 5,000 policemen and  around 300 officers of the Georgian Security Ministry.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWS GIVES NRA A SHOT IN THE ARM;  </P> <P> POLITICS: FOR ASSOCIATION'S LEADERS MEETING IN ANAHEIM, THE BOOST COULDN'T HAVE  COME AT A BETTER TIME.  </P> <P> As firearms exhibitors unloaded their wares here Thursday morning for the  biggest public event at the National Rifle Assn.'s annual convention, NRA  leaders huddled behind closed doors a few hundred yards away to track the real  gun news.  </P> <P> "What's the story?" NRA Chief Executive Officer Warren Cassidy anxiously asked  his chief federal lobbyist, who had just gotten off the phone with his staffers  in Washington.  </P> <P> The story, as those group leaders who were gathered in the room knew all too  well, was the prospect of a U.S. Senate ban on some military-style assault  weapons. And for them, the news was good: the sweeping crime bill that included  the ban had been stalled indefinitely in a vote that Senate supporters blamed  in part on a fierce, last-minute attack by the NRA.  </P> <P> For beleaguered NRA leaders, who will have to explain a series of recent  legislative losses to an increasingly frustrated membership at the convention  this weekend, the win could not have come at a better time.  </P> <P> The group's official reaction, as voiced by chief lobbyist Jim Baker at an  impromptu press conference at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers hotel, was one of  "mixed emotions."  </P> <P> While the NRA had pushed hard to kill the assault-rifle portion of the bill as  a staunch threat to the Second Amendment, it had supported other components on  the death penalty and other toughened crime measures, Baker said, making the  Senate vote only a partial win.  </P> <P> More typical, however, was the unbridled enthusiasm of Harlon Carter, NRA  executive committee member and former president, who said in an interview, "If  indeed the crime bill is dead, glory be!"  </P> <P> Cassidy, relating the early-morning update on the Senate bill, said NRA leaders  were both relieved and thrilled by word of the legislation's apparent demise.  </P> <P> But he and other NRA leaders said the assault-gun ban could still be revived in  some form by gun-control advocates and warned that they are preparing for a  tough fight.  </P> <P> "We don't feel our enemies are going to give up that easily," said legislative  policy committee chairman Richard Riley, who is likely to be elected the next  president of the NRA on Saturday.  </P> <P> In Washington, Senate supporters of the crime bill and its anti-assault gun  provision blamed their inability to cut off debate on the measure on a torrent  of mailings by the NRA to members in eight states, targeting senators whose  votes were seen as threatening. Majority Leader George Mitchell, one of the  targets of phone calls from NRA members, said many of the statements in the  mailings were "false and misleading."  </P> <P> But NRA officials insisted that their campaign included only "the truth" about  the threat posed by gun controls to law-abiding firearms owners -- and the  inability to deter criminals who they say will manage to get ahold of guns no  matter what the laws.  </P> <P> "If the American people knew the truth," said Riley, "we wouldn't have been in  this situation to begin with."  </P> <P> But the NRA was in this situation because of the Senate's surprising decision  two weeks ago to include in its crime package a ban on 14 semiautomatic assault  rifles and pistols. The move would have expanded the list of banned weapons  beyond 43 other imports that President Bush outlawed last summer under an  administrative order.  </P> <P> The Senate vote unleashed hundreds of phone calls to the NRA headquarters in  Washington from angry members demanding to know what had happened to a group  with an $87.5-million annual budget and a reputation as an unbeatable lobbying  force on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> If nothing else, the defeat of the crime bill Thursday shows that the NRA is  still a force to be reckoned with in national politics, despite reports of its  waning influence, group leaders insisted.  </P> <P> "Seems like our future is supposedly always threatened, but we keep on  surviving and keep on thriving," Carter said. But officials acknowledged that,  after a string of gun-control restrictions at the federal level and in  California, New Jersey, Connecticut and other states, it may take more than a  single vote to pacify NRA members.  </P> <P> "There's a great deal of frustration among the membership based on a very tough  year," Baker said. "I think that you're going to see that frustration played  out at the annual membership meeting."  </P> <P> The NRA convention gets into full swing today with the start of the gun exhibit  at the Anaheim Convention Center, which is open to the public and is expected  to draw about 250 dealers. At the Hilton, about 20,000 members are also  expected to take part in workshops, committee meetings, an awards luncheon and  a rally to kick off a new anti-gun control campaign.  </P></p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / French government in docks accord THE French government has taken a significant step forward in its attempt to modernise France's docks by clinching an agreement with Le Havre dock workers to cut 1,000 jobs and modernise working practices. France's dock authorities have for months been locked in negotiations with dockers at different ports as part of a national initiative to make the docks more internationally competitive and to stem the loss of business to other countries. The negotiations have been fraught with problems which culminated this summer in stoppages that brought many French ports to a standstill. The authorities have already concluded negotiations at some ports but the agreement at Le Havre, the biggest port in France in terms of the value of cargo handled, is a landmark and could clear the way for similar accords at other ports.</p>

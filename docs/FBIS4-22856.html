Prozhivalskiy] </F>   [Text]Today, the Ukraine possesses a sufficiently high  economic potential. It has well-developed industry, fertile  lands, and many mineral resources. Unfortunately, the  communications industry in the old centralized economic  management system was financed on what was left over. As a  result, telephone density in the Ukraine today comprises 16  telephones per 100 inhabitants, which is almost three times  lower that the optimal telephone level. We also lag in the  numbers of radio broadcasting and television programs which the  population of the country needs for transmitting data at great  speeds.    For the Ukraine to become a state and for its economy to be  revived, accelerated development of communications equipment is  needed, especially telecommunications equipment. In order to  bring the industry up to date and overcome the backwardness  which has accumulated for many years, the Ukrainian  Communications Ministry has developed a National Communications  Development Program to the year 2005.    The main goal of the program is to accelerate the  development of telecommunications networks, including  long-distance and international networks, telex, a packet  switching informational network and electronic mail by broadly  integrating modern digital transmission and switching systems.  Another goal is to meet the rapidly growing needs of the  population and government agencies, and to provide the newly  forming market economic structures with modern communications  services.    The program calls for all urban families to have telephones  by the year 2005, and 50% of rural families. Within a very  short time (5-7 years), the construction of modern long-distance  and international communications networks and data transmission  networks and the creation of honeycomb mobile communications are  planned. In order to implement the program, an enormous amount  of work must be done. It is unthinkable that this work can be  carried out without focusing the efforts of scientific,  industrial, construction and service communications enterprises,  without using modern equipment and technologies, and without  additional investments, including foreign capital.    Historically, the Ukraine found itself in a position in  which it did not develop or manufacture digital switching and  transmission systems, nor much other telecommunications  equipment.    As a result of conversion, more than 100 enterprises of  the military-industrial complex have been converted to the  production of communications equipment in the past two to three  years. They were able to arrange the manufacture of  small-capacity quasi- electronic and electronic automatic  telephone stations, digital transmission systems for local  networks, and some other equipment. As far as large-capacity  digital transmission and switching systems are concerned, it  would require five to seven years and large financial  expenditures to develop them, which is hardly justified given  the existing situation. In this area we cannot manage without  foreign investments and assistance. This will allow us to buy a  significant amount of time.    Unfortunately, the acquisition of modern communications  equipment overseas is complicated by the fact that the Ukrainian  national currency is not convertible at the present time. It is  impossible to buy this equipment at an exchange rate of one U.S.  dollar for every 2,000-3,000 coupons, which has been established  by some commercial banks. If you consider that the average wage  in the Ukraine at such an exchange rate is only ten dollars, the  acquisition of equipment overseas makes communications services  prohibitive for the Ukrainian population.    With this in mind, we concluded that it was necessary to  create joint enterprises for the production of modern equipment  in the Ukraine. The equipment produced by the joint venture will  be sold on the internal market with partial payment in  convertible currency and the national currency. Component parts  produced in the Ukraine will be used. The creation of centers  for the generation of software and editions of the software will  allow the hard currency portion of the cost of these items to be  significantly reduced. This alternative allows the need for hard  currency to be significantly reduced for equipment payments.  This also allows the Ukraine to significantly reduce its  production by taking into account a share of the cheaper labor  used for the production of equipment in the Ukraine. Of course,  according to all economic laws, the manufacture of large lots of  equipment causes a reduction in prices, and it will be more  expensive to produce small lots of equipment in the Ukraine.  However, the inconvertibility of the currency and the high  exchange rate of dollars to Ukrainian coupons make the proposals  of local industrial enterprises more attractive.    However, for joint enterprises to acquire equipment, a  certain amount of funds must be in hard currency. The banks (The  World Bank and the European Bank), from which we had counted on  receiving credits, drag out the provision of these credits and  establish many conditions which cannot possible be carried out  in one year. Time is flying. The lack of a market  infrastructure, including poorly developed communications,  prohibits a market economy from developing normally.    That is why the Communication Ministry's Concept for  Attracting Foreign Investments Necessary for the Implementation  of the National Communications Development Program calls for the  creation of joint enterprises (operating companies) to develop  and provide communications services, in addition to the creation  of joint enterprises with Western firms to produce modern  communications equipment. This allows results to be seen much  more quickly, and development with bank credits to take place  during phase two.    Based on this concept, the MKM Telekom joint venture for  producing EWSD equipment has already been created (the Koroleva  Production Association and Siemens in the FRG), as well as the  ChRPZ and AT&amp;T joint venture in Chernigov for producing 5 ESS  equipment.    Preparations are being made at the Odessa Cable Factory to  jointly produce fiber-optic cables with the U.S. AT&amp;T firm.    While the production of equipment was being organized,  specialists from the Communications Ministry were actively  searching for Western partners for joint implementation of  Ukrainian telecommunications development projects. As a result  of this search, three joint operating enterprises were created:        -  UTEL, a Ukrainian-American-Dutch-German enterprise,  founded by the regional communications administrations of the  Ukraine together with AT&amp;T, PTT Telecom, and DBP Telecom. By  the  year 2005, the joint enterprise should modernize and develop 25  regional automatic international telephone stations and  participate in the construction of six million local lines.    %UMT, a Ukrainian-Dutch-Danish-German enterprise,  founded by the regional communications administrations of the  Ukraine together with PTT Telecom, Denish PPT, and DBP Telecom.  The joint enterprise should create a honeycomb telephone  communications network in 21 cities of the Ukraine within seven  years.    %INFOKOM, a Ukrainian-German enterprise, founded by the  ``Kievsvyaz'' Production Association and an informational  computer center together with Controlwere, a German firm. The  joint enterprise should have already created ``UKRPAK,'' a  national packet switching center, in 1993.       Since the newly created joint enterprises, as well as  the highly profitable ones, will provide a significant portion  of low paying services (the majority for the national currency),  and since one of the main sources of currency receipts necessary  for developing and repaying the currency investments of Western  partners is international communications services, these joint  enterprises have received the exclusive right to provide such  services.    This right is also provided to them because free  competition does not always justify itself when communications  services are thinly spread, and it can cause higher quality  services to be provided in the economically developed regions  and fully satisfy demand, while low-paying services may not be  provided at all in regions with a poorly developed economy,  which can destroy the harmonious development of the whole  infrastructure of the state.    The newly created joint enterprises have already begun  to implement specific projects. On 17 November an international  telephone station system in the city of Kiev went operational.  On 17 February 1993 a new automatic international telephone  station came on line in Lvov. In 1992 the first 20 subscribers  began to operate on a packet switching network.    By using joint ventures and by taking advantage of  bartering, the investment of approximately 100 million U.S.  dollars in the development of communications in the Ukraine is  planned in 1993. Automatic international telephone stations will  be modernized in six regions, and a telephone communications  network will be brought on line in Kiev. All the areas and  regions will receive access to the packet switching network.    Despite the economic decline which continued in 1992 in  the Ukraine, the communications industry had 30% more  revenues  than in 1991. The decline in the rate of development of  international telephone stations was stopped.    Of course, everything cannot be resolved so simply.  There are many problems. Sometimes partners do not understand  each other. However, if the desire is great on both sides, any  problems which occur can be resolved. Unfortunately, some want  to get a quick return and do not want to work toward the future.    We need to modernize the primary network with  fiber-optic communications cables, and we hope to carry out this  work by obtaining credits. It is clear that credits can be  obtained if the investors are completely convinced of a return  on their investment. Therefore, we are working on improving the  structure and changing the tariff policy. We are learning to  earn money. Values are being reassessed. This reassessment is  not always understood by our people, who are used to having  social guarantees. However, there is no other way.    Ukrainian legislation is creating favorable conditions  for foreign investment. In accordance with the law ``On Foreign  Investments,'' these investments are not subject to  nationalization. Reimbursement of losses is provided for, if  governmental organizations act improperly, and the transfer of  revenues and profits after payment of taxes and mandatory duties  is guaranteed. The law gives enterprises with foreign  investments the right to determine prices for their products.  The joint enterprises are not taxed for five years, and then a  tax is established at 50% less than the existing tax. A  portion  of the profits which are reinvested in the Ukraine will not be  taxed.    The creation of joint enterprises and the integration of  elements of market relations have revealed inadequacies in the  industry's management structure, and at the present time it is  being reorganized. The Communications Ministry will not fulfill  the function of operating company any longer, nor interfere in  the economic and financial activities of the enterprises, but  will determine and be responsible for the political and  strategic aspects of development, and will accept responsibility  for regulating and creating conditions for competition in the  industry.    Work is being carried out to create a major association  on the republic level. This association will be involved in a  unified process in telecommunications and will eventually turn  into a holding company.    Foreign investment, advanced technologies and the  operating experience of Western partners under market conditions  will shortly permit a qualitative breakthrough in the  telecommunications field in the Ukraine. These will also permit  the integration of telecommunications into the world-wide  network, which will create good conditions for establishing  market organizations in the economy and for widely attracting  foreign investments to develop the economy in other industries  as well. In the final analysis, this will accelerate the process  of bringing the Ukraine closer to the advanced countries in the  telecommunications field.</p>

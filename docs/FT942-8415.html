			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise chief scotches hopes of higher oil prices Enterprise Oil, the explorer embroiled in a hostile Pounds 1.4bn all-paper bid for rival Lasmo, yesterday poured cold water on hopes for higher oil prices even as the commodity rose strongly yesterday. Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise chairman and chief executive, told shareholders at the annual meeting that oil prices in the first three months of the year were 20 per lower than 1993 at Dollars 14.73 per barrel. 'It is true that there has been a marginal improvement in the past six weeks, but even this may now be reversing,' Mr Hearne said. Nevertheless, Brent crude recovered most of its losses earlier in the week to trade at around Dollars 16.25 a barrel late yesterday. Shareholders refrained from questioning Mr Hearne on the bid for Lasmo. This will be the subject of an extraordinary meeting in London on Thursday.</p>

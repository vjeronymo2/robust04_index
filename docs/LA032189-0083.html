			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MEDICAL REPORT  </P> <P> Carroll O'Connor, who had been scheduled to be discharged Monday from Emory  University Hospital in Atlanta after coronary bypass surgery on March 11,  instead underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder Monday morning. Later in  the day, a hospital spokesman said the new surgery had been uneventful and that  the 63-year-old actor had tolerated it "very well." O'Connor was taken to  general intensive care and is expected to be hospitalized for another week to  10 days. He developed abdominal discomfort Saturday, and when the symptoms did  not resolve with medical therapy, the surgery was recommended. Physicians said  the gallbladder problem was not directly connected to O'Connor's recent bypass,  adding that in fact, having had the coronary obstructions corrected, he could  more safely tolerate the additional surgery.  </P></p>

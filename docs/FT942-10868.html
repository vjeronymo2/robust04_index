			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / US relaxes stance on Haitians President Bill Clinton said yesterday the US would stop sending fleeing Haitians home without an asylum hearing, reversing a policy that some critics had condemned as racist, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Clinton said he had ordered the change, to become effective shortly, because of what he called stepped-up repression of the Haitian people by Haiti's military rulers. 'The Haitian people will see we are not opening the floodgates to indiscriminate refugee migration into the US but that we are going to try to find those people who have left because they have a genuine fear,' he said. 'I hope that we will not have a flood of refugees but we are increasing our naval resources to deal with that.' Mr Clinton said the criteria for considering claims for political asylum would remain unchanged. 'We will determine aboard ship or in other countries which ones are bona fide political refugees,' he said in a briefing for reporters at the White House Rose Garden. Previously, the US had granted asylum hearings only to those who applied at processing centres in Haiti, intercepting boats at sea and sending back others without a hearing on their asylum claim.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Renato Garcia] </F>   [Text] On 30 March, Secret Service agents of the Military  Police [PM] and attorneys found computer diskettes with a list  of names of politicians, policemen, and media professionals next  to the amounts of money they allegedly received from numbers  game kingpins. The diskettes were found at the headquarters of  numbers game kingpin Castor de Andrade, in a huge old house at  1040 Fonseca Street in Bangu District. Vice Governor Nilo  Batista opens the list of politicians who allegedly received  financial help from the numbers game kingpins during the 1990  electoral campaign. Also on the list are Jose Vicente, Bocaiuva  Cunha (deceased), Jamil Haddad, Simao Sessim, Messias Moraes,  Cidinha Campos, Marcio Braga, Sergio Cinelli, Leoncio  Vasconcelos, Aguinaldo Timoteo, and Ludmila Mayrink, among  others. According to files found in Castor de Andrade's  computers, they all received financial help during the 1990  campaign.    District Attorney Antonio Carlos Biscaia said: It is well  known that the numbers game kingpins have blocs in the city  council, in the legislative assembly, and at the Chamber of  Deputies.    According to Biscaia, bribes from the numbers game kingpins  do not follow any political ideology: Leftist, center, and  rightist congressmen resorted to these irregular funds to  finance their campaigns. Biscaia reported that the list  contained the names of politicians from all parties except the  Workers Party, PT. As the lists contained in the diskettes are  made known, however, new names will be added to the current ones.    The files also show that these illegal funds were  effectively  used to pay for the maintenance of police cars, repair work at  the police precincts, and payment for "bonuses" to policemen.  According to the documents, police inspectors, PM colonels, and  almost all leaders of the Civil Police have received these  funds. The names of reporter Nelio Bilat and sports commentator  Washington Rodrigues, in addition to the names of the Tupi and  Manchete radio stations, are mentioned in the documents. They  also reveal the amounts distributed among all the special police  precincts, police barracks, and district police precincts. Also  recorded on the documents are the payment of extra bonuses,  donations to philanthropic institutions and to the Confraria do  Garoto, as well as the overall amount collected in numbers game  bets and expenses.    The dismantling of the illegal game network and the raiding  of its headquarters became possible with the November arrest of  Castor de Andrade's son-in-law, Fernando Ignacio de Miranda.  Miranda was caught red-handed trying to bribe Police Inspector  Mario Covas, director of the DGPI [expansion unknown]. In a  parallel investigation, and based on charges made by X-9  [expansion unknown], Ivan Custodio de Lima (main witness of the  Vigario Geral massacre), the PM agents, and attorneys arrived at  the bunker without knowing what to expect. To their surprise  they found what they believe to be the much sought after  evidence of the involvement of politicians, policemen, and  journalists in the numbers racket.</p>

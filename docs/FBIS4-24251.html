			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 28 Jun (AFP) -- Seven women demonstrators  were wounded by gunfire and hundreds of people arrested during a  rally in support of opposition leader Moshood Abiola, the  committee for the defence of human rights said on Tuesday [28  June]. The women, many of them small-time traders from the  Ikeja district of northern Lagos where Abiola lives, were  holding a demonstration Monday when police intervened, firing in  their direction and wounding seven, the committee said in a  statement signed by its national secretary Segun Jegede. There  was no independent confirmation of the incident. Abiola, a  millionaire tycoon, was arrested on Thursday after declaring  himself president, a year after the military annulled  presidential elections he was widely held to have won.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> 2 ARTS PANELS WILL MERGE  </P> <P> Santa Monica approved consolidation of its Arts Commission and Arts Foundation,  arguing that the two boards' roles of public art direction and private fund  raising should be unified to reduce overlap and public confusion between the  bodies.  </P> <P> The move, approved on a 7-0 vote by the City Council, directs the city attorney  to revise city ordinances to complete the merger.  </P> <P> When the city created the groups in 1982-83, the commission was directed to  give legal and administrative structure for public art programs while the  foundation solicited private funding support. Recently, however, the two  groups' operations converged, and foundation members complained that they had  no say over how the funds they raised were spent.  </P> <P> Under the new plan, both boards' members will sit on a panel that functions  alternately as a government policy agency and a nonprofit fund-raising group.  </P></p>

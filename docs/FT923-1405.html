			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Bombay broker released on bail MR Harshad Mehta, the 'Big Bull' broker at the centre of India's worst financial scandal, was freed on bail of Rs1m (Pounds 20,700) yesterday after 110 days in jail, Reuter reports from Bombay. Justice M L Dudhat of the Bombay High Court ordered Mr Mehta released after his lawyers claimed he was being detained illegally in the Dollars 1.2bn scandal. Supporters of the 37-year-old brash and flamboyant broker, who was India's highest personal taxpayer before his arrest in June, burst into applause as the judge ordered the release. Mr Mehta - who faces eight separate charges of currency violations, fraud and bribery - has become something of a cult figure as the broker who helped fuel India's most dramatic rise in share prices. Following his arrest, posters appeared on buildings in Bombay and Calcutta supporting Mr Mehta. He claims he was being unfairly singled out to take the blame for the scandal involving leading banks and securities traders. In an interview published yesterday, Mr Mehta claimed that 80 per cent of trading in the Indian securities market violated central bank regulations. His release is expected to boost the Bombay stock market, which crashed following exposure of the scandal in April.</p>

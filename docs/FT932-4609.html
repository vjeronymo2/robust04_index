			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (14): GPA's fall from grace - Roland Rudd on a crisis in aircraft leasing THE WORLD'S biggest aircraft leasing company recently averted examination, the Irish equivalent to administration, by pulling off a last-minute deal, subject to certain conditions, with GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric of the US. If GPA Group's 138 banks agree to restructure the group's Dollars 5.2bn of debts, the agreement with GE will close in the next few months. GE has agreed to buy 45 of GPA's aircraft worth Dollars 1.35bn, giving it breathing room at least until the end of March 1994, and has an option to take a minimum of 65 per cent of the equity for less than Dollars 300m. GE will pay for its controlling stake only when it exercises its option, which could be as late as March 1997. For a company that was once capitalised at more than Dollars 3bn, GPA's fall from grace has been spectacular. The downturn in the world economy, in the world airline industry, in demand for aircraft, and perhaps most important of all, in the supply of equity for aircraft finance, led to GPA's problems. Mr Craig Jenks, head of Airline/Aircraft Projects consultancy in New York, believes the reduced availability of long-term, low cost funding which adversely affected GPA was result of straightforward, legitimate credit concerns. 'The definition of a creditworthy airline is increasingly murky. A year ago, credit was assumed to vary directly with size, with the big carriers seen as the top credits. This is no longer the case.' Yet GPA has a big rival in the aircraft leasing business, namely the International Lease Finance Corporation, the Beverly Hills subsidiary of AIG insurance group, whose revenues have increased by more than 112 per cent since 1989, from Dollars 334m to Dollars 731m at the end of 1992. This contrasts with GPA's results, recently filed with the US Securities Exchange Commission. For the end of March 1993 GPA lost Dollars 128.1m of revenue, more than 11 per cent of its total lease revenue compared with Dollars 71m the previous year and just Dollars 4.8m in 1989. The group was forced to repossess 26 aircraft; a further 27 aircraft remained on the ground while other repossession costs and bad debts written off increased the total amount of lost revenue. GPA's aircraft sales fell from Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 746m. The only bright spot has been the core leasing business, which under Mr Phil Bolger increased revenues from Dollars 435m to Dollars 528m. However, after restructuring costs that are expected to run into hundreds of millions of dollars, the group will make a significant loss for the year end to March 1993. There are three main reasons why GPA has recently performed so poorly compared with ILFC. GPA's bulk-purchasing of aircraft, directly from the manufacturers, worked well during the worldwide aircraft shortage that developed in the late 1980s. In the recession of the early 1980s airlines were financially stretched. In the US their problems were compounded by deregulation. As the aircraft manufacturers found their order flow falling, GPA and other companies in the operating lease business offered cheap aircraft. Airlines were also pleased with new sources of off-balance sheet finance. However, GPA's success in this area promoted a further explosion of Dollars 17bn worth of options and firm orders in 1989. Two years later it was taking delivery of 10 per cent of all new aircraft as the industry went into one of its worst ever recessions. The group misjudged the potential in eastern Europe. At the beginning of 1990 it allocated Dollars 2bn of aircraft to east Europe for the coming decade. Mr Jenks says: 'This was a massive overestimate of ex-Comecon ability to pay dollar rentals.' As the market turned against GPA, it suffered a significant deterioration in the credit quality of its lessees. Some defaulted, such as VASP, the Brazilian airline, forcing GPA to repossess aircraft; others rescheduled lease rentals, and American West Airlines filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. Faced with Dollars 12bn of firm orders from aircraft manufacturers to the end of decade and more than Dollars 5bn of total debts, the company decided at the beginning of 1992 to raise equity via a global flotation. But it was pulled because of the lack of demand. The fate of GPA was determined largely by its inability to raise that equity, which it has tried to do on many occasions over the past year. If the banks agree to the restructuring the group's bondholders receive Dollars 762m in principal payments and Dollars 220m in interests. Mr Jack Hersch, research director at MJ Whitman, which specialises in selling bank debt, believes these payments are unrecoverable from future operations. He recommends that investors avoid the bank debt at current prices of 75 cents in the dollar and only purchase it as 66 cents or less. Most of the GPA's lenders are relieved that the end of the group's difficulties is at long last in sight. But the pessimists, such as MJ Whitman, believe the GE deal is only a temporary fix to GPA's problems and that only examination offers GPA the chance to restructure on a long-term basis.</p>

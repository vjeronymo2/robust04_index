			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DAY IN COURT;  </P> <P> CROWDS FORCE WHEELS OF JUSTICE TO TURN QUICKLY  </P> <P> Ramon Parra of Pacoima came to the San Fernando Courthouse's arraignment court  Tuesday to clear up a traffic ticket. But when his name was called once, then  twice, and it was pronounced "Ray-mond" instead of "Rah-moan" both times, Parra  didn't realize that it was his turn.  </P> <P> If a translator had not stepped forward and pronounced the name correctly, it  would have been too late -- Commissioner Gerald Richardson would already have  set Parra's file aside and called the next case. Parra would have had to wait  several hours until the end of the day when Richardson makes a second call of  cases.  </P> <P> Court officials say a frenetic pace has become standard in San Fernando  Municipal Court's Division 130, one of the busiest courtrooms in the Los  Angeles County court system. In something of a judicial assembly line,  Richardson may process as many as 350 cases a day.  </P> <P> While other courts in the building usually close by 4:30 p.m., Richardson said  he at times is still arraigning people at 6 p.m.  </P> <P> The division has seen a 40% increase in its daily caseload over last year. And  to cope with the heavy flow of cases, Richardson arraigns people nonstop at a  rate of one per minute.  </P> <P> The courtroom handles the arraignment for every case that comes to the San  Fernando Courthouse -- from minor traffic violations to misdemeanors to  murders.  </P> <P> The high caseload also translates into crowding in the courtroom as scores of  defendants, their families and friends wait for hours until their cases are  called. On Monday, the Los Angeles Fire Department cited the courtroom as a  fire hazard because of the crowding and blocked aisle exits.  </P> <P> "The volume of people coming here is ridiculous," said court interpreter Paula  Krawec. "We are overworked and overstressed, and we can't even breathe."  </P> <P> Many court officials say the daily caseload is too much for one courtroom and  should be split up between two.  </P> <P> "There are courts that do half as many cases with twice as much staff," said  Bob Jason, a deputy public defender.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traffic Cases  </P> <P> Traffic violators may soon be handled in a separate courtroom, court officials  hope, which will take about 90 minutes worth of cases out of Division 130.  Until then, however, they will continue to contribute to the general crowding  of the facility.  </P> <P> The moment the doors opened at 8:45 a.m. Tuesday, a throng of people pressed  though the narrow doorway into the courtroom.  </P> <P> Representing a cross-section of America, the defendants in Division 130 were  all ages, races, creeds and economic levels. Many were dressed in grubby work  clothes and baseball caps; a few wore expensive suits and carried briefcases.  </P> <P> "Every element of society comes through here, from rich businessmen who were  speeding in their Mercedes on the freeways to the gang-bang murderers,"  Richardson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> All-Day Wait  </P> <P> Despite the differences that separated the defendants in the outside world, all  were equal in Division 130. Each was ordered to the court at 9 a.m. and faced  the prospect of an all-day wait. Those who were late and missed Richardson's  reading of their constitutional rights were asked to return the next day.  </P> <P> Several Spanish interpreters are always in court to translate for the dozens of  Latino defendants who don't speak English. On Tuesday, Richardson also called  in Korean, Farsi and Arabic interpreters for other non-English-speaking  defendants.  </P> <P> Richardson arraigned people one at a time, in case after case, taking pleas and  dispensing verdicts.  </P> <P> The monotony was broken when Richardson arraigned 12 men at once. Each had been  charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and each pleaded guilty.  The entire procedure took less than five minutes.  </P> <P> Many defendants may be left bewildered by the brief proceedings, Richardson  said. But "I give them a written copy of everything I said," he said.  </P></p>

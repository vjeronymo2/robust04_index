			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POINTS OF LIGHT  </P> <P> As a father, one of the daily rituals I cherish most is reading to my kids. My  6 year old is currently on his second excursion through the "Chronicles of  Narnia," by C.S. Lewis. The sixth installment of the "Chronicles" is entitled  "The Magician's Nephew," wherein we encountered the following: "One moment  there had been nothing but darkness; next moment a thousand, thousand points of  light leaped out."  </P> <P> So now we know what George Bush's speech writers read -- kiddie lit. At least  it's good kiddie lit, and my estimation of our President's staff has been  elevated a notch.  </P> <P> J.S. KLEINSASSER  </P> <P> Bakersfield  </P></p>

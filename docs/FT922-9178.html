			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Serb/Croat plan for division of Bosnia defies UN and EC SERB and Croat leaders from war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina have formulated detailed plans to carve up the republic in a move which defies the peace efforts of the European Community and the United Nations. The division of the newly independent republic, which would leave the Moslems without a homeland, is being tacitly encouraged by the governments of both Serbia and Croatia. Secret negotiations this week, held in the Austrian city of Graz, run counter to official statements by Croatia and Serbia that they recognise the current borders of Bosnia whose independence was recognised by the international community last month. Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, said on his return from Graz: 'We do not need war. We can negotiate the division under the auspices of the European Community.' Speaking in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, Mr Karadzic  - who has close contacts with Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic  - said the Serbs 'will fight if the Croats do not agree to population exchanges, although any nationality is welcome to stay in the Serb regions'. Moslems make up 44 per cent of the 4.3m population, Serbs 30 per cent, and Croats 17 per cent. The Croat-Serb talks coincided with fresh appeals from Bosnia's Moslem leaders for the deployment of UN peacekeepers and foreign military intervention. The Graz talks were also attended by Mr Mate Boban and Mr Franjo Boras, the nationalist leaders of Bosnia's Croats, who held further consultations in the Croatian capital, Zagreb. Mr Boban is a close ally of Croatian president Franjo Tudjman. Last year, the Serbian and Croatian presidents had met secretly to discuss how the ethnically mixed republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina would be divided. Mr Branko Salaj, Croatia's minister of information, denied he knew about the Graz talks, but said: 'We do not want the Croats in Bosnia to be engulfed in a Bosnia which is part of a greater Serbia.' He also denied that Croatia was seeking to annex parts of Bosnia. However, he said: 'When you start dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina into two, it is not a very hard choice for the Moslems . . . it is widely believed here that many Moslems were originally Croats.' Serbia alleges that the Moslems were originally Serbs, forced to convert under the Turkish occupation from the 14th century. Mr Karadzic explained that the talks concentrated on 'the future borders of the Serb and Croat constituent states'. He said Croatia could gain the four-fifths of Mostar, southern Bosnia. Mostar is set on the banks of the River Neretva. The Serbian leader insisted that Serbia would retain control over the eastern bank of the Neretva, where federal army munitions factories are concentrated.</p>

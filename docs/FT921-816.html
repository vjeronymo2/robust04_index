			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Letter: Iraq-Kuwait border Sir, With reference to your article, 'UN aims to redraw border of Iraq and Kuwait' (February 19), to date no final recommendations on the actual boundary have yet been made. The ground survey and aerial photography work in the border area have been completed. This new, highly accurate survey, along with earlier maps, charts, aerial photographs and other documents, will be used to determine the precise boundary for demarcation purposes. The United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Commission will meet in April when it will review the results of the surveying and mapping and address the actual demarcation of the boundary. Miklos Pinther, secretary, United National Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission, New York, NY 10017, US</p>

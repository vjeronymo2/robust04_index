			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CINEPLEX BOX OFFICE DISAPPOINTS  </P> <P> Summer box office receipts for Cineplex Odeon Corp., one of North America's  biggest movie theater chains, are not as strong as the money-losing company  hoped, President and Chief Executive Officer Allen Karp said today.  </P> <P> But he still expects Cineplex's earnings for the peak movie-going summer season  to be higher than in 1989, in contrast to the rest of the industry, which he  believes will earn less.  </P> <P> "It was a tough summer," Karp said in an interview. "But we had a couple of  advantages going for us." He mentioned Cineplex's performance in Canada and its  conservative bidding that helped it avoid some highly touted films that did  poorly.  </P> <P> Cineplex, which loaded itself with debt because of over-ambitious expansion  plans, lost $50.4 million in the first half of 1990.  </P></p>

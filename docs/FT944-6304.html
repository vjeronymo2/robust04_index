			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94: Plan for open gilts repo market Mr Kenneth Clarke and the Bank of England yesterday unveiled long-awaited plans to establish an open market for gilt sale-and-repurchase agreements, or repos. The move was widely hailed as a liberalisation which would boost the attractiveness of the UK government bond market, both at home and abroad. 'This is excellent news for the gilt market,' said Mr Danny Corrigan, head of repo trading at NatWest Markets. 'It will add to market liquidity, tighten dealing spreads and reduce the opaqueness of this major bond market.' Mr Kevin Adams, UK bond strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said that the establishment of an open repo market would 'enhance the gilt market's attractiveness to international investors and will bring us more closely into line with international bond markets'. Stock lending and borrowing takes place in many government bond markets through repo arrangements in which any two market participants agree that one will sell securities to the other and commit to repurchase equivalent securities on a specified future date at a specified price. A repo is therefore a flexible transaction which is effectively the borrowing of cash against collateral for one party and stock borrowing for the other. Although the authorities stated their intention to set up an 'open' gilt repo facility - one accessible to any financial market participant - the details of that system have yet to be worked out. The Bank yesterday published a discussion paper on the development of an open repo market, proposing to widen repo activity beyond gilt-edged market makers and to abolish the current requirement that stock can only be lent or borrowed through one of the City's eight money brokers. Government bond markets in other countries, including the US, France and Germany, already have well-developed repo facilities. But although London has long been the European centre of non-dollar repo business, the sterling sector has limped behind its international competitors. In a statement accompanying its discussion paper, the Bank of England said it believed 'these steps should enhance the liquidity and efficiency of the gilt market, increase demand for gilts, and thereby reduce the overall interest cost over time to the government and the taxpayer'. Indeed, Mr Clarke in his Budget speech to parliament, said that an open repo facility 'should improve both liquidity and efficiency, reducing yields and hence the government's debt interest costs'. He added that 'each reduction in yields of just one basis point (1-100th of a percentage point) will eventually save more than Pounds 25m a year of public expenditure'. The Bank is seeking comments on the paper from market participants by January 31 1995. Final decisions will be taken after the completion of the consultation process, the Bank said, adding that commencement of gilt repo activity could not be before July 1995. The Bank also said that changes in the taxation of gilts might be needed to facilitate the efficient functioning of a repo market, and the Inland Revenue said yesterday that it would change tax rules.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Southern Radio Southern Radio, formerly Invicta Sound, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 363,000 for the year to end-September. That compared with a profit of Pounds 197,000 previously and came from turnover down from Pounds 4.21m to Pounds 3.62m. In December 1991, Invicta reversed into Southern Radio and the figures exclude the results of Southern. The company said that advertising revenue in the period had come under considerable pressure as the result of the recession. National airtime revenue fell by 3.7 per cent while local airtime revenue fell by 18.6 per cent. Strict cost-cutting measures had been introduced resulting in a 7.5 per cent reduction in operating costs. Exceptional charges during the year totalled Pounds 383,000, and mainly related to redundancy and reorganisation costs and provisions against loans of a related company. Losses per share were 3.51p (1.13p earnings) and there is no dividend (0.75p).</p>

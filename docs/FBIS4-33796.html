On this occasion he visited areas of the  Victoria de Giron Citrus Enterprise in Jaguey Grande, Matanzas  Province. Raul and his companions visited farm number 2 of  Jaguey's citrus program. The delegation held a meeting with  Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan, member of the Politburo;  provincial party leaders, enterprise managers; and the general  staff of the 102d Division of the Youth Labor Army [EJT].    In the meeting, an agreement was reached to incoporate  citrus  plantations into EJT farms, which have already demonstrated  their efficiency in this region and other parts of Cuba. The  EJT already manages six of the 10 farms of the enterprise, the  remaining four will be put under EJT control later in the year.  [passage omitted].</p>

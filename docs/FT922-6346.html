			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Arts: American Buffalo - Theatre David Mamet's 1975 American Buffalo is a hard gem of a play with a honed edge. This production by the Film and Theatre Foundation at the Hen &amp; Chickens Theatre, Islington, offers Mamet at his best: meticulously acted in a small studio theatre. Mamet is the Elmore Leonard of the stage: sharp and tough, with an exact ear for urban dialogue. He knows contemporary urban America and writes in the idiom of those at odds with their own lives and environment. His subjects are the relations between people forced by circumstance to deal with each other. His film, House of Games dealt with trust, and his 1981 rewrite of The Postman Always Rings Twice with betrayal. American Buffalo prefigures both. Mamet starts by placing the action elsewhere and allowing its impact to shape the situation on stage. Here, Don's Resale Shop is a clearing house for fenced goods. Amongst its urban detritus a numismatist finds and buys a rare Buffalo head nickel; Don has him followed, planning to steal his collection. Bob, a junkie trading up to larceny, and Teach, a hardened con-man and hustler, are in on the action. As the robbery is plotted, the three men become mutually suspicious, and the play erupts into extraordinary violence. So sit well back to avoid flying shards of set, and be prepared for much swearing. Mamet's text mixes subtlety and profanity. It demands and receives high quality performances from Steve James, Richard Brake and Jack Panter, showing how betrayals and compromises are made in the name of business, 'people taking care of themselves.' The characters are too stupid to reshape their own lives, but too smart not to be discontented. They resort to profundities which look like ironies: 'One thing makes all the difference in the world it's knowin' what the fuck you're talkin' 'bout. It's rare.' The insights are in the dialogue, like a Randy Newman song spoken out: 'You OK on the meter?' - 'The broad came by already, she came by.' Even for the con-men and hustlers, street life can be tough: 'Every day I go out there. There is nothing out there.' Jonathan Robinson directs. Recommended. The Hen &amp; Chickens Theatre (071-704-2001) until June 13</p>

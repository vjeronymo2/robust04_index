Ilchin decided not to  accept the ruling. Therefore, it is expected that an  intellectual property dispute in trade relations will emerge  between the ROK and the United States.    Yi Kwan-u, who represents Ilchin, said on 8 January: "We  cannot accept the U.S. court ruling that Ilchin must suspend  production for the next seven years because it used GE  technology." He added: "We will immediately appeal the ruling."    He also said: "Ilchin and the Korea Advanced Institute of  Science and Technology developed the technology after three  years of joint research. We even presented the letter of  technological research contract to the U.S. court as evidence.  However, the U.S. court only accepted GE's allegation. We  cannot understand this."    In October 1989, GE filed a suit against Ilchin in a Boston  court, contending that "Ilchin obtained the core technology from  (Song Tsienming), a Chinese technician who had left GE."    The U.S. court ruled Ilchin lost the case, stating that "it  should have known that the data the former GE technician  provided was GE's." However, Ilchin said that it had received  technological advice from the Chinese technician and had not  applied in production the technology he provided because most of  it was outdated.

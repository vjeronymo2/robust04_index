			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> LOUISIANA STATE SWEEPS MEN'S, WOMEN'S TITLES  </P> <P> California's Sheila Hudson fulfilled a promise by breaking her American record  in the triple jump and Wisconsin's Suzy Favor completed an illustrious career  by winning a record ninth title at the NCAA Track and Field Championships at  Duke University Saturday night.  </P> <P> Louisiana State swept the men's and women's titles for the second year in a  row, the only team to achieve such a sweep. The men had 44 points to 36 for  indoor champion Arkansas and 34 for Baylor. The Lady Tigers won their fourth  consecutive title with 53 points, led by sprinter Esther Jones. UCLA had 46 and  Wisconsin 42. The UCLA women finished second for the third consecutive year.  </P> <P> Hudson, in her final college meet, leaped 46 feet three-quarters of an inch to  complete a jump double. She won the long jump Friday.  </P> <P> Favor's final college meet ended with her fourth consecutive 1,500-meter title  that, along with her 800 victory Friday, gave her two championships for the  meet.  </P> <P> Jones led LSU by sweeping the 100- and 200-meter races Saturday night after  anchoring the Tigers to victory in the 400-meter relay Friday night. She took  the 100 in a wind-aided 11.14 seconds and the 200 in 22.49, the fastest by an  American this year.  </P> <P> After winning the long jump Friday night, Hudson said she would take a serious  shot at the triple jump record of 45-5 1/4 she set in 1987 at San Jose.  </P> <P> She made good on her promise twice. On her second attempt, she sailed 45-7 3/4,  improving the record by 2 1/2 inches. On her fifth jump, she became the first  American to jump 46 feet.  </P> <P> Hudson's jump was the best in the world outdoors this year.  </P> <P> The triple jump title was Hudson's third in an outdoor championship.  </P> <P> Favor, a senior with a cross-country season of eligibility remaining, swept to  an unprecedented fourth consecutive title in the outdoor 1,500 meters. She  pulled away down the final straightaway for a seven-meter victory over  Tennessee's Jasmin Jones in 4 minutes 8.26 seconds, the fastest by a collegian  this year.  </P> <P> Favor, who never has lost in the NCAA championships, won her first outdoor  800-meter title Friday night. She also has won three NCAA indoor titles in the  mile and one indoors at 3,000 meters. In four years at Wisconsin, she won 54 of  56 races against college competition, the last 40 in a row.  </P> <P> Steve Lewis of UCLA, 1988 Olympic 400-meter gold medalist, won his first NCAA  title, in 45.19 seconds.  </P> <P> UCLA's Tracie Millett became the fourth woman and first Bruin woman to win two  titles when she put the shot 53 feet 7 inches. She won the discus at 183-9  Friday.  </P> <P> She and Janeene Vickers lent luster to an otherwise disappointing showing by  UCLA's women.  </P> <P> "Obviously we wanted to come out on top, but I was very proud of the kids  tonight," UCLA Coach Bob Kersee said. "Janeene and Tracie showed the quality of  athlete they are today."  </P> <P> Vickers defended her title in the 400-meter hurdles, winning in the time of  55.40 seconds.  </P> <P> She also placed fourth in the 100-meter hurdles with a wind-aided time of 13.05  seconds, a personal best. And she anchored the 1,600-meter relay team that  finished fourth in 3:32.88.  </P> <P> In men's competition, UCLA finished 10th with 22 points, and USC scored only  nine points.  </P> <P> Track Notes  </P> <P> USC's Travis Hannah was sixth in 45.90 and UCLA's Mike Stevenson was eighth in  46.60. . . . USC's Mark Crear was third in the 110-meter high hurdles with a  personal best legal time of 13.65 seconds. . . . UCLA's John Knight finished  fifth in the hammer throw at 210-9 and Eric Bergreen was eighth in the shotput  with a mark of 59-7 1/2.  </P></p>

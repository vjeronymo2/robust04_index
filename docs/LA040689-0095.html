			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOWERS STUDENTS ON SAFARI, READING WITH THE ANIMALS  </P> <P> From the outside, Stowers Elementary School in Cerritos looks no different than  the other elementary schools in the ABC Unified School District. But inside,  the school has been turned into a jungle. Cheetahs, zebras, gorillas, tigers  and other wild animals and exotic vegetation created in crepe paper leap from  the walls of classrooms, the library and administration buildings.  </P> <P> The nearly 600 students at the school are on an African reading safari, aimed  at stimulating them to read. It started March 2 with a visit to the campus by  an ocelot, and will end May 26 with a "read-in" in a tent, a barbecue and rides  on an elephant.  </P> <P> The student body has been challenged to read a total of 1 million extra minutes  by the end of the expedition. Homework assignments do not count. Parents keep  track of outside reading and report the results to the school.  </P> <P> Students earn "reading tracks" or paw prints. Kindergarten through third-grade  pupils earn one paw print for 90 minutes of reading and fourth- through  sixth-grade students earn one for 180 minutes. Paw prints cover the walls and  ceilings of the school. Students who have earned 25 tracks get their pictures  posted in the principal's office. Students receive prizes that include pizzas  and trips to Knott's Berry Farm.  </P> <P> Everyone participates -- students, teachers, librarians and administrators.  Whenever jungle music is heard over the intercom system, everyone drops  whatever they are doing to read something other than assignments. On Fridays,  students and teachers wear jungle attire to get in the reading mood.  </P> <P> The school scores above district and state averages on the state reading tests,  and Principal Decla Johnson says she wants the students to do even better.  Johnson said she hopes the students will develop a lifelong love for reading.  </P> <P> "We have kids addicted to reading," said Johnson, who wore snake earrings, a  giraffe necklace and a blouse covered with zebras and jungle flowers.  </P></p>

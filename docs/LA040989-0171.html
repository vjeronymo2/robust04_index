			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS REMAIN ON HOLD AFTER LOSS IN OVERTIME  </P> <P> Erik Rasmussen scored the game-winner 8:04 into overtime Saturday as the  Wichita Wings defeated the Sockers, 6-5, in a Major Indoor Soccer League game.  </P> <P> The loss, coupled with the Dallas Sidekicks' 6-2 victory over the MISL-leading  Baltimore Blast, left the Sockers stuck in two ways. It prevented them from  clinching second place in the regular-season race and also from making up  ground on the Blast.  </P> <P> Baltimore leads the league with a 27-18 record with three games to play. The  Sockers, who are assured one of five playoff berths, are 25-20, also with three  games remaining, while Dallas is 22-22 with four games left.  </P> <P> The victory kept Wichita in the playoff hunt with a 21-24 record, good for  fifth.  </P> <P> The Sockers lost a game of streaks before 9,037. Both teams had runs of three  consecutive goals to take short-lived leads.  </P> <P> The Sockers rallied from a 4-2 halftime deficit on second-half goals by Allen  Willey, Paul Wright and Waad Hirmez to go in front, 5-4, with 8:30 remaining.  But Dale Ervine then scored his second goal of the game for Wichita with 4:18  left to force overtime, and Rasmussen followed with a blast from 30 feet out.  </P> <P> With newly acquired Otto Orf II starting in goal, the Sockers took first-half  leads of 1-0 (on a goal by Steve Zungul) and 2-1 (Kevin Crow with 12:33 left in  the half). The Wings then rallied for a 4-2 lead on goals by Chico Borja,  Ervine and Mike Stankovic, his second of the half.  </P> <P> Orf finished with 14 saves starting in relief of Victor Nogueira. Cris Vacarro  had 15 for Wichita.  </P></p>

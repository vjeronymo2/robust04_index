A group from Kanal-6 visited northern Iraq and met the  Kurdish leaders of the problematic region.    We are presenting our colleague Kursat Hakyolu's impressions  from northern Iraq with the pictures taken by cameraman Numan  Tunc Inal.    [Begin recording] [Hakyolu] While the PKK [Kurdish Workers  Party] terrorism escalated on the Turkish side of the  Turkish-Iraqi border, the position taken by the Kurdish groups  on the other side of the border against the PKK is somehow not  becoming clearer. Steps taken by the northern Iraqi Kurds toward  the formation of a state are being debated in international  forums. In the meantime, Kurdish groups are feuding with each  other. The clashes between the Kurdistan Islamic Front and  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan led by Jalal Talabani have just  ended. It is also being reported that there is disagreement  between Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani, leader of Democratic  Party of Kurdistan, on stances to be adopted toward the PKK.    Our meeting with the north Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad  Rasul Kusret took place while these important developments were  taking place in the region.    Barzani had once again declared the PKK a terrorist  organization, whereas Talabani made no statement. This was our  first question to Prime Minister Kusret, who is from Talabani's  PUK.    [Kusret in Arabic with superimposed Turkish translation by  an  off-screen reporter] We reject every sort of violence, no matter  where it comes from. If violence is coming from the PKK, we  reject that too. We condemn all sorts of violence.    [Kusret continues in Arabic in the background with Hakyolu  providing a summary of his views] Rejecting reports that the PKK  is infiltrating Turkey from Iraq, Kusret said that they are  controlling the borders and are not allowing the PKK through.  Nevertheless, he added that they need Turkey's support and that  this problem could be completely solved through cooperation with  Ankara. [end recording]</p>

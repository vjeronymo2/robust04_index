			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Allason loses Tory whip MR RUPERT ALLASON, the only Tory MP who failed to support the government in last week's vote of confidence on the Maastricht treaty, was last night suspended from the Conservative party at Westminster. The punishment - one of the harshest available to the government's parliamentary managers - followed Mr Allason's failure to provide a convincing explanation for his absence for last Friday's vote. It puts a serious question mark over the future of the 41-year-old MP for Torbay. If the suspension - known as withdrawal of the whip - is not lifted he will be unable to stand as an official Conservative candidate at the next general election. A letter to Mr Allason from Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, is thought to have left open the possibility of readmission to the party if he supports the government consistently in coming months. In theory the move reduces Mr John Major's parliamentary majority from 18 to 17. Mr Allason, who in private life writes spy novels, has long been seen as one of those backbench MPs who have little or no prospect of attaining ministerial office. An instinctive loner he has as many enemies as friends among Tory MPs at Westminster. A firm opponent of the Maastricht treaty, Mr Allason had earlier indicated that he had apologised for his absence. But Mr Ryder was thought to have judged that it would be impossible to maintain party discipline if he was not severely treated. Mr Allason said last night that he had had no opportunity to put his case but added that he could not bring himself to vote for Maastricht. He said the treaty represented the most important constitutional issue for 300 years.</p>

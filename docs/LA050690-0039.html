			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOOTHILL OFFICIALS DIDN'T GET MESSAGE OF STUDENT SIT-IN  </P> <P> It was with great sadness that I read of the teachers' boycott of the annual  open house at Foothill High School in Tustin (April 27) -- another myth totally  put to rest.  </P> <P> The myth: Most teachers have an inborn "calling" and sense of obligation to  their profession and to their students.  </P> <P> The hope: That teachers are somehow more than just human, that ranks them right  up there with other "care-givers" like doctors, nurses and ministers. As an  adult, it is necessary to let go of some of the hopes and dreams of childhood.  Facing reality is important, but some hopes and dreams are harder to let go of  than others, and this one (that of the superhumans who become teachers) has  been a particularly difficult one for me. And it has been slowly but surely  eroded by the constant emphasis on salary and other contractual issues, the  strikes, walkouts and boycotts that dramatically and tragically affect the  nation's children. I guess one could argue that the students are experiencing  bargaining as it is needed. I, on the other hand, wonder what the students must  think of their importance to our nation when they are often considered at the  bottom of the list of concerns by the teachers' negotiating groups.  </P> <P> I agree that teachers should be paid salaries and granted a status far above  what some currently enjoy. I also believe, however, that teachers themselves  have eroded their place of honor -- and the people of my generation (parents of  school-age children) feel a greater loss than many of the teachers at the  attitude that they themselves have created.  </P> <P> CAROL KIESSIG  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P></p>

State Secretary Andras Kelemen said the November  1992 accord could set an example for similar deals with other  countries.    Kelemen said ethnic Hungarians and Italians in Slovenia can  use their native language in education and administration, and  take part in law-making by means of positive discrimination.  The Slovenian Constitution allows native minorities to use  their mother tongue in official contacts at their places of  residence.    Under today's agreement, national minorities can freely keep  in touch with the parent country, study in their native tongue  at all levels of education, found learning groups, set up  native-language information networks, and make business links  abroad. Hungary has more than 5,000 ethnic Slovenian citizens.</p>

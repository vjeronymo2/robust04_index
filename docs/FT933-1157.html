			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Latin America 'chaos' warning A FAILURE by Latin American governments to act aggressively against poverty could lead to chaos, the World Bank argues in a report today. The region has the most unequal income distribution in the world, with the poorest 20 per cent of the population receiving about 4 per cent of income, it said. 'Failures to act aggressively on poverty will likely encourage distributive conflicts, prompting discontent and perhaps even a return to populism, dirigisme and chaos,' the report argued. Economic growth remained the best way out of poverty, but programmes should be directed towards the poor, both to tackle the short-run consequences of poverty such as malnutrition and longer-run issues such as poor schooling. It said three fundamental policy elements were needed: prudent macro-economic management, further reforms to the structure of the economy and its institutions, and the alleviation of poverty. In the overall economy, it was important to monitor the large increases of capital from investment portfolios. 'There is little doubt for most countries that the current capital inflows will not continue in the long run.' It added: 'If macro-economic management is less than prudent, capital inflows could grind to a sudden halt, unleashing potentially serious macro-economic dislocations.' Other priorities were to devise policies that encouraged domestic, especially private, savings; to invest in infrastructure; and to develop institutions such as central banks. It supported the move to independence of central banks in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. It said that only in Chile and Mexico did the economic reforms of recent years have a low probability of reversal and it was important to avoid premature exuberance and enthusiasm about recent policy changes. 'In the rest of the region, the reform process is at different stages of implementation - with different degrees of political popularity.'

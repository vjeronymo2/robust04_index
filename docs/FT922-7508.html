			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Kurdish leaders put on brave face as poll delayed KURDISH leaders last night moved to maintain the credibility of elections organised by Kurdistan Front guerrillas in northern Iraq, after postponing for two days the poll scheduled for yesterday. In an eve-of-poll twist, indelible ink supplied from Germany to mark hands and prevent anyone carrying out their democratic rights more than once was found to be washable. But Mr Massoud Barzani, leader of the KDP (Kurdistan Democratic party), one of two key parties contesting the election, said last night at a press conference in the mountains that 'our people at Salahuddin University' had managed to manufacture a substitute and that the election would take place tomorrow. Leaders had earlier played down the postponement as a 'technical hitch' while admitting there was a sense of anti-climax among a population keen to vote after years of war and violent repression by Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. Late on Saturday evening Kurdish-controlled television stations broadcast news of the delay and yesterday guerrillas toured the countryside with loudspeakers. But at 8am yesterday, the time scheduled for opening booths, the isolated and troubled residents of Halachan, a village razed by Mr Saddam's soldiers in 1988, emerged from their tents still expecting to vote. At Hajiyawa, scene of heavy fighting during the Iran-Iraq war, Kurds hungry for news anxiously discussed developments by a fleet of empty Land Rovers collected to ferry voters from villages. An armed guerrilla said: 'The people don't like to postpone. They think it's not right.' The Kurdish leadership is anxious to gain international recognition for the elections. Mr Hoshyar Zebari, a leading KDP member, said on Friday he was disappointed that no US or British politicians were attending the poll, but he was relieved that other international monitors would be remaining. A US State Department spokesman in Washington had said that the US welcomed 'public and private assurances by the Iraqi Kurdish leadership that these elections will deal only with local administrative issues and do not represent a move towards separatism'. But Turkey and Iran, neighbouring states with large Kurdish populations, have both condemned the elections as being outside Iraqi law. Ankara has announced that, on Friday, 27 Turkish soldiers and 36 Kurdish separatist guerrillas of the Kurdish Workers party were killed in clashes near the Iraqi border. All levels of Kurdish society appreciate the international dimensions of the elections. The dream of full independence is evident among ordinary people, but with 100,000 Iraqi government troops on a 320-mile frontier with Kurdish-controlled areas, the most widespread hope voiced in the streets, bazaars and tea shops is that the Kurds be allowed to live in peace.</p>

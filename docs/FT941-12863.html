			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / National talks fail in Algeria Algeria's conference for National Reconciliation has ended without naming a president to replace the five-man High State Council which has ruled the country since the suspension of elections two years ago, writes Francis Ghiles in London. The meeting was boycotted by Algeria's main political parties, including the lay Front des Forces Socialistes, led by Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, and the former ruling Front de Liberation National Party. Both urged Algerian leaders to open negotiations with the banned Islamic Salvation Front which was poised for victory at the polls two years ago. See Editorial Comment</p>

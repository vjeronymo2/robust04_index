			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Letter: Ignore critics and enjoy the show Sir, What surprises me is that Mr Carter (Letters, December 12) is surprised] In my experience theatre-goers are unlikely to be disappointed if they ignore convention and buy tickets only to shows which have received a critical 'right-hander'. My next excursion will, if I can obtain two tickets, be to the Royal Opera House. Are there any Clement Crisp devotees out there sufficiently apprehensive to send me theirs?

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the joint session with the party's executive  committee late last night, the council of the Slovene Christian  Democrats [SKD] decided to propose to Prime Minister Dr. Janez  Drnovsek that the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia [LDS] and the  SKD form a government themselves. Sandi Frelih reports:    [Frelih] Even before the decision to impeach Defense  Minister Janez Jansa, the SKD announced that it would reconsider  its further cooperation in the government. At the end of last  week, the highest party officials discussed this, however they  postponed any decisionmaking until the extraordinary  parliamentary session. At the joint session of the party  council and executive committee last night, they actually  discussed two possibilities -- immediate departure from the  government as proposed by Ivan Oman and the proposal of the  party leadership to stay in the government, but under certain  conditions.    For the first time so far, the party council took a secret  ballot. By 20 votes to 11 they decided that the LDS and SKD  should themselves form a government of speedy and accelerated  democratic and economic development of Slovenia, as the  conclusion says.    They also explain that such a decision in the times of  political crisis is dictated by the hitherto cooperation of both  parties, the current political situation, and the need to  establish a new political balance, which would all help  stabilize the political circumstances in divided Slovenia.    They put Lojze Peterle in charge of the negotiations with  Dr.  Janez Drnovsek. They expect the reply of the LDS president by 7  April.    SKD Secretary General Edvard Stanic is of the opinion that  the political balance in the government after the departure of  the Social Democrats is 2 to 1 and should be balanced out. He  is also of the opinion that a coalition agreement, which would  involve a greater degree of reciprocity and trust, should be  drafted. When asked what they will do if the prime minister  decides to keep the United List in the government and draws  another right-wing party into it, Stanic replied that a new  situation would emerge that would have to be discussed anew.  They definitely expect Drnovsek's reply by next Thursday when  the party council will meet again.    Let me also add that Drnovsek has already been announcing  changes in the coalition, saying that the coalition will have to  be balanced out again.</p>

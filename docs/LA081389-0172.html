			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESSMAN'S AIRPORT SITE STANCE  </P> <P> Rep. Ron Packard was 50% right when he opposed two county airport sites  recommended for consideration by the airport site coalition.  </P> <P> Even though a member of the airport site coalition committee, I too feel that  the Potrero Los Pinos site would be an ecological disaster. The Cleveland  National Forest should be protected! On the other hand, the south Camp  Pendleton site should be considered the top choice since it is conveniently  located to serve 40 million passengers annually -- with rail and freeway access  already in place -- and meets all of the Federal Aviation Administration  criteria for an international airport.  </P> <P> Rep. Packard spoke out just like the proverbial politician, considering only  the economics and job loss in the closing of Norton Air Force Base. He should  be more aware that members of the airport site coalition meet monthly,  averaging over 120 members present, studying and evaluating over 30 potential  sites in the past 14 months!  </P> <P> The Marine Corps has been very cooperative in its deliberations and favors the  southern site rather than the Las Pulgas location. They too realize that it  will take 10 years to build when it will be urgently needed to relieve the  overburden now building up at L.A. International and John Wayne airports.  </P> <P> OTTO KIESSIG  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

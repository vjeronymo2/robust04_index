			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bouygues edges ahead to FFr108m BOUYGUES, the world's largest construction company, managed a slight increase in profits in the first half of the year, but warned of a fall in sales for the full financial year. Bouygues, like other French construction companies, has been hit in the past year by the impact of the economic slowdown on the building sector. It has also suffered from the problems encountered in the Channel Tunnel project, on which it is one of the major contractors. The group, which this summer took advantage of the Paris stock market's brief rally to stage a FFr1.04bn (Dollars 210m) rights issue, saw net profits rise by 4 per cent - just above France's annual inflation rate of around 3 per cent - from FFr104m in the first six months of 1991 to FFr108m in the same period this year. Mr Martin Bouygues, chairman, said that he anticipated a slowdown in sales of 4 per cent to FFr62bn for the full financial year. However, Mr Bouygues refused to disclose profit projections for 1992. Bouygues has been building on its core construction interests by investing in film, through its Ciby 2000 production subsidiary, and television, as managing shareholder of TF1, France's biggest television channel. BSN, France's largest food group which was earlier this year embroiled in the bitter bid battle for Perrier mineral water, yesterday announced a 12.6 per cent increase in sales to FFr54.4bn in the first nine months of 1992. The increase was largely due to acquisitions, but BSN mustered growth of 3.5 per cent on a comparable basis.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries surge on lower producer prices data US Treasury bonds surged forward yesterday on news of an unexpected slump in producer prices last month. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  23/32 higher at 96 3/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.833 per cent and the two-year note was  1/8 better at 99 25/32 , to yield 6.601 per cent. Although economists had expected yesterday's Labor Department report to present no obstacle for bonds, few imagined the data would be as favourable as it proved. The September producer price index showed a surprising 0.5 per cent decline, while the 'core' rate, which excludes the more volatile energy and food sectors, was up by a more modest 0.1 per cent. Analysts were forecasting a 0.1 per cent rise in the PPI and a 0.4 per cent increase in core prices. The result in part reflected a 1.1 per cent downturn in car prices, which were thought to have appreciated. The inflation-sensitive long end of the maturity range leapt nearly a point on the news, with speculative retail accounts said to be leading the rally. Prices receded a little mid-morning, pushed higher just before noon,then settled back a little late in the day. The improvement capped a week-long advance for bonds triggered by Friday's announcement of a much smaller increase in employment in September than economists had forecast. Yesterday's news reinforced suspicions that the economy is not accelerating fast enough to warrant an immediate rise in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve. *something in here (HP) * However, the news on producer prices failed to chase away all the market's bearishness. Gains were limited by the reluctance of many traders to make commitments ahead of today's reports on consumer prices, retail sales and industrial production. The consensus forecast of a slight 0.2 per cent gain in consumer prices appeared to be a safe bet, given the decline at the producer level. The market was a little more edgy about the level of capacity utilisation at factories and mines, a good indication of future inflationary trends. The rate has hovered dangerously near the 85 per cent mark in recent months. European government bond markets followed the rise in US Treasuries yesterday, leaving dealers braced for the impact of today's data from the US. The US-inspired rally in the UK gilts market prompted the Bank of England to decide to issue stock into the strength. The Bank said Pounds 200m of 8 1/2 per cent 2007, Pounds 250m of 8 per cent 2013, and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked due 2013 would be available. News of this long-dated stock led some in the market to expect today's announcement of auction stock to involve a short-dated issue, possibly a five-year. Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets said the tone in the market had been good. 'Inflation numbers are good and the action by the Bank on interest rates looks more pre-emptive than it did at the time. People are starting to say that even if inflation does go up, gilts are still good value.' The December gilt future on Liffe rose  17/32 to 100 7/8 in late trading. The yield spread over bunds widened slightly to around 129 in late trading. German bunds also rose in line with the US. The December bund future was around 90.29 in late trading, up 0.87 on the day. Mr Thomas Mayer at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt said a victory by Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the elections on Sunday was now firmly priced into the market, and any other result would come as a shock to bunds. The Italian government's auction of a total of L5,000bn of bonds in three tranches was covered between 2.31 and 3.46 times. Mr Corrado Costantino at Williams de Broe in London said: 'The political situation is so unstable that I don't think the international investor is willing to put money into the Italian market.'</p>

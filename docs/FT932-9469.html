			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank pleases with bigger-than-expected repo rate cut GOVERNMENT bond markets rallied across Europe in the wake of a bigger-than-expected cut in the German repo rate. The 11 basis point cut to 7.60 per cent was not only a pleasant surprise in itself, but also raised hopes that the Bundesbank Council might reduce official interest rates at next Wednesday's meeting. The repo is now only 35 basis points above the discount rate and 90 basis points below the Lombard rate. The move was seen as confirmation that the Bundesbank was accelerating the reduction in interest rates. This was particularly good news for the short end of the market, and the yield curve took a step nearer normalisation with two-year stock starting to yield less than five-year stock. Further out along the curve, 10-year bunds, which had suffered the biggest losses in the recent sell-off, found some demand again. The yield fell by about 5 basis points to 6.72 per cent. But this area is still seen as vulnerable if the Danes vote Yes to Maastricht, lessening the safe-haven motive for holding longer-dated bunds. The June bund futures contract rose from 94.83 to 95.15 during the day. The Dutch and Belgian central banks followed the German move with bolder cuts of 25 basis points in their key rates - another factor giving the Bundesbank scope to ease next week. Both their government bond markets benefited. Dutch state loans continued to surge, with the yield falling to 15 basis points less than that on bunds. The question was being raised as to whether it was time to take profits. France outperformed the German market slightly and the yield spread between the 10-year benchmarks went back through the 40 basis point barrier. IN the UK, trade in government bonds was comparatively quiet. Without any stimulating economic data to mull over, most thoughts were trained on the likely gilt auction announcement by the Bank of England tomorrow. However, the pre-auction aversion that had attached to 10 to 15-year stock relented to some extent. The 8 per cent gilt due 2003 gained about  3/8 of a point and the 8 1/2 per cent 2013 was nearly  1/2 point up. US Treasury prices fell across the board yesterday after a bigger-than-expected rise in the April producer prices index revived fears of inflation. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was off its lows but still down  21/32 at 103 5/16 , yielding 6.859 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 100 1/8 to yield 3.791 per cent. Prices began falling after the Labor department announced that the PPI rose 0.6 per cent last month, a much bigger increase than expected and the largest in more than two years. Analysts had forecast a rise of only 0.2 per cent in the index. To make matters worse, the 'core' measure of producer price inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4 per cent in April, a worryingly big rise. Analysts said the figures confirmed their view that inflation is on an upward course, but warned against over-reacting to the data. The big fall in bond prices, however, was partly to blame on the timing of the PPI report. Coming in the middle of a huge refunding round, bad news on inflation could only have made a market facing a large injection of fresh supply even more nervous. In particular, dealers were worried that the PPI news would scupper the afternoon auction of Dollars 10.75bn in 10-year notes. The auction, however, went off relatively well considering the market conditions, and the notes were sold at an average yield of 5.96 per cent - in line with prior expectations. IN THE absence of fresh economic news, the Japanese government bond market continued to float downwards as technical factors and negative sentiment dominated trade. The background has been the growing belief that economic recovery is on the way, as reflected in the recent positive mood towards equities (with yesterday's fall in the Nikkei stock market index seen only as a normal daily fluctuation). This week's softness of the yen against the dollar has also removed a prop for government bonds. In the cash market, the benchmark No 145 bond due March 2002 underperformed again, its yield rising from 4.51 per cent to 4.57 per cent in Tokyo trading.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Representatives of the Ukrainian public and  political organizations in Crimea and the Crimean-Tatar National  Movement Organization have issued a joint statement. The  statement points out gross violations of the law in Crimea  during the course of the election campaign and during the  election itself. These include campaigning on the eve of  election, the issue of several ballot papers to one person, the  issue of ballot papers to people without identification, and  pressure on the electoral commissions and voters exerted by  representatives of the Rossiya bloc. The worst violation, the  statement says, was the propaganda speech by president of  Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, on local television last Friday.    The authors of the statement are convinced that the  situation  in Crimea will continue to deteriorate if Yuriy Meshkov, his  administration and the newly elected Supreme Council fail to  work constructively to preserve peace and stability on the  peninsula. Proceeding from this, the statement says, cooperation  between Ukrainian and Crimean-Tatar organizations has acquired  special significance. The Ukrainian organizations will be even  more uncompromising in defending the interests of the Crimean  Tatars through their central offices in Kiev and their deputies  in Ukraine's Supreme Council. The Crimean-Tatar National  Movement Organization will support Ukrainian organizations on  the issues of preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity and  consolidating Ukrainian statehood on the territory of Crimea.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Television, famous as the here-today-gone-tomorrow medium, described by my predecessor on this page as 'the ephemeral art', is tonight repeating The Rock'n'Roll Years for 1965 (7.30 BBC1). These programmes, mixing chart hits with contemporary news clips, form some of the most evocative historical documents imaginable. Today's programme deals with the year when Winston Churchill died, John Lennon wrote a book, PJ Proby split his trousers (again), Rhodesia sought independence and Watts rioted. Then at 9.00 BBC2 continues its repeat run of the 1984 series of Alas Smith And Jones, the duo's first series after 'Not The Nine O'Clock News'. Later, at 12.10, BBC2 repeats a 1984 edition of 'Arena', produced by Alan Yentob who is now controller of both BBC1 and BBC2: 'The Everly Brothers, Songs Of Innocence And Experience' in Rock Docs. Radio 3 offers a concert by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra In Shetland which includes the first performance of David Ward's 'Beyond The Far Haaf', dedicated to Scottish fishermen; and Tchaikovsky's fourth symphony (7.30).</p>

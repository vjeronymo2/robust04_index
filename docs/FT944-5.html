			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Polish draft budget passed The Sejm, the Polish parliament's lower chamber, yesterday passed the country's 1995 draft budget by a large majority in the face of pay demands by Solidarity-led health workers and teachers, which if successful could destroy the government's monetary strategy. The draft foresees a deficit at 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product which has already been agreed with the IMF but the budget has come under attack from President Lech Walesa, who has backed the Solidarity pay demands.</p>

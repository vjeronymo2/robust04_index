			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Police and protesters clash in London More than 20 people were arrested and about 25 others were taken to hospital with minor injuries last night after hundreds of demonstrators clashed with police at the end of a march through London against the criminal justice bill. Fires were lit in Park Lane as 2,000 police battled with members of a crowd estimated by police to number 20,000. Pieces of masonry and other objects were hurled at police and gas was sprayed at them. A loudspeaker warning was issued from a helicopter circling overhead: 'Disperse now or force will be used.' Protesters hemmed in by railings taunted police - many of whom had riot shields - while others in the crowd spread into Hyde Park. Police moving in waves then swept them across the park towards Marble Arch after fires had been lit in the road nearby. Park Lane was barred to traffic and Marble Arch Underground station was closed as mounted police chased part of the crowd along Oxford Street, where shop windows were smashed. The clashes came after the rally had been addressed by Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, and Mr Tony Benn, the former Labour cabinet minister who is now MP for Chesterfield. Mr Benn said: 'This bill is designed to prevent people from leading full and happy lives and from enjoying themselves.' He regretted that the Labour leadership had not joined the rally to protest at the bill, which curbs defendants' right of silence and increases police powers to disperse suspected gatherings of 'New Age travellers' and squatters. Mr Jeremy Corbyn, Labour MP for Islington North, who chaired the rally, said: 'The police deliberately charged demonstrators when they knew that everyone was leaving, and a number of people were seriously hurt, including young children. The police officer in charge needs to be disciplined for his actions.' Chief Supt Richard Cullen, who was in charge of the police operation, blamed 'anarchists' for the violence which he said was 'fully orchestrated'. He said: 'A hard core of 600 or 700 people have spoiled a legitimate protest. They had CS gas and bricks, and these are not things they found on the route.' The police had not lost control, but had endured some 'very unpleasant' clashes. He added: 'There was no need for this. There are many people who came up to me and apologised for this . . . the majority of people came here peacefully and the stewards worked really hard.' Asked why police were not able to cordon off the trouble-makers, he said: 'What can we do about these people? We are not allowed to infiltrate these groups. You never know where they are going to come from.'</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EL DIARIO PAPER CLOSES AFTER ITS MONEY RUNS OUT  </P> <P> El Diario de Los Angeles, one of the city's three Spanish-language daily  newspapers, stopped publication over the weekend after struggling for 2  1/2-years to win readers and advertisers.  </P> <P> Attorney Jose Mariano Castillo, who represents the paper's Mexican owners, said  on Monday that efforts to find new investors will continue, but he holds little  hope for raising the necessary money.  </P> <P> "They hope that it will be restarted again as soon as they can get  refinancing," Castillo said of the owners. "I don't see that happening right  now. I don't want anybody to get their hopes up."  </P> <P> Castillo said El Diario published its last edition Saturday and laid off 24  employees, including the paper's editorial staff. The company will continue to  operate as a printing press, he said.  </P> <P> El Diario's owners invested about $3 million to start up operations as the  region's third Spanish-language daily. The paper competed against La Opinion,  Los Angeles' largest Spanish-language daily, and Noticias del Mundo, owned by a  company controlled by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.  </P> <P> Plans called for the paper to begin turning a profit within a year. Instead, El  Diario circulation topped out at 30,000 and never managed to attract  significant amounts of advertising. The paper filed for bankruptcy earlier this  year and was losing about $60,000 a month, according to executives.  </P> <P> The paper even appealed to its readers for help, asking them to buy the paper  at news stands and attend fund raisers. But the efforts apparently fell short.  </P> <P> "They just ran out of money," Castillo said. "There were some very dedicated  employees there who struggled a lot. I hope it comes back again."  </P></p>

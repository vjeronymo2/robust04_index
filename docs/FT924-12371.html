			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Tower Colliery TOWER Colliery may become south Wales' sole pit if pressure on the government proves unsuccessful. A delegation of Welsh miners was told by Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commissioner, that he was deeply concerned about the government's pit closure programme, but the European Commission was all but powerless to intervene in a member state's domestic energy policy, Andrew Hill in Brussels writes. Mr Cardoso e Cunha said in an interview after the meeting - which had been arranged six months ago - that he was 'not happy to see expensive German coal burned and at the same time cheap UK coal being discarded'. Germany and Spain both offer heavy subsidies to their coal-mining industries and the European Commission has run into considerable political difficulty in persuading the governments to reduce their state aid. Mr Wayne David, Labour MEP for south Wales, who was present at the meeting, said that the commissioner had attacked the situation as 'irrational'. Mr David added that Mr Cardoso e Cunha had promised to look into claims that contracts signed with gas producers during the UK electricity privatisation process were discriminatory and that they infringed EC competition law.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACT ENSURES SALE IN HUNGARY OF PARKER PRODUCTS  </P> <P> Parker Automotive Corp. said Thursday said that it and TRW International have  signed a distributorship agreement with a West German company that guarantees  the sale of at least $2 million worth of Parker's products in Hungary.  </P> <P> The pact names S&amp;B Enterprises of Reilengen, West Germany, as the exclusive  distributor for Parker's CarbonClean products in Hungary. The distributor will  market and service the products for five years, with the option to renew the  contract.  </P> <P> Parker's product, a patented system, cleans harmful pollutants from auto fuel  systems. The negotiations with Hungarian authorities started in November,  continued in both Geneva and Budapest, and were concluded on March 23,  officials said.  </P> <P> The Hungarian authorities will pay Parker, through S&amp;B, in hard currency,  said Michael E. Parker, the company's president and founder. He said that this  is the company's first foray into the East European market.  </P> <P> "I think this underscores the new (Hungarian) leadership's attachment to the  importance of environmental issues," he said. "Through S&amp;B, we expect to be  in a position to set up similar arrangements in Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and  Poland by year-end."  </P> <P> Laszlo Sipos, president of S&amp;B, said the Hungarian government has given the  pact for the purchase of pollution control devices "priority status" for its  scarce hard-currency allocation to buy imported goods.  </P> <P> "The bottom line was I'm not interested in trading my goods for potatoes and  Skoda," a car made in Czechoslovakia, Parker said. His comment refers to the  recent pact between Pepsico Inc. and the Soviet Union to exchange American soft  drinks for Russian vodka and ships.  </P> <P> Parker's association with TRW International, a subsidiary of Cleveland-based  TRW Corp., began earlier this year when it signed a master distribution  agreement with TRW. That pact gives TRW exclusive rights to import, store and  export a line of CarbonClean products to their distributors throughout Europe,  including the Eastern bloc countries.  </P> <P> According to the terms of this agreement, TRW will sell $20 million worth of  CarbonClean products to its 500-strong European distribution network.  </P> <P> TRW officials could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa-based Parker began operations in February, 1987, and became a public  company in March last year with the sale of about 25% of the firm's stock.  Parker and his family still own a majority of the company's stock.  </P></p>

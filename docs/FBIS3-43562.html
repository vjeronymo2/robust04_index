Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front,  AVF] spokesman Stephen Maninger said about 300 members of the  rightwing mineworkers union assisted in digging trenches and  vehicle traps and piling up bullet-proof sandbags around the  station at Donkerhoek, east of Pretoria.    Cmdt Piet le Roux, of the Pretoria Boer Commando Group, who  is in charge of security at the site, said on Saturday if all  peaceful measures had been exhausted, "when it comes to the  push, we will fight".    Cmdt Willem Ratte, sought by the police for his part in the  Schanskop Fort Siege, on Saturday reportedly assisted in  training Boer Commando members to repel any attack by police or  defence force members on the station. The training session took  place near the Radio Pretoria caravan site, but reporters were  barred from the area.    The chairman of the broadcaster's management committee,  Dominee Mossie van den Berg, also arrived to express his  appreciation to the miners. He said he would meet Home Affairs  Minister Danie Schutte on Monday to discuss the further  extension of the station's temporary broadcasting licence,  although the authority to issue such licences will soon be  vested in the independent broadcasting authority.    Meanwhile, station personnel said repeater stations  extending  the station's FM signal to other parts of the Transvaal were  being planned. At Brits, the first repeater transmitter was due  to come on line on Saturday. Local communities would assume  responsibility for the repeater towers and transmitters,  carrying Radio Pretoria's service to more listeners around the  province.    Cmdt Le Roux said any efforts to shut down the station would  initially be opposed on legal grounds. Thereafter, tens of  thousands of unarmed civilians would be called on to form a  human wall around the station and protect it by means of passive  resistance. "Because of the freedom of speech principle, we  hope there will be an international outcry if they try to snuff  us out. But passive resistance has its limitations, and if the  government tries to take advantage of this, we will fight."    An unidentified symphasizer bought four armoured watchtower  units from Escom, and donated them to the station. They will be  erected on the corners of the station's razor-wire-protected  premises.    Cmdt Le Roux conceded the station could not repel any  conventional military onslaught in the long run. There would be  a battle between thousands of soldiers and "bloodshed on a big  scale", he said. But if the rightwing lost this battle, a new  phase of guerrilla warfare and sabotage may dawn on the country,  observers say.    Cmdt Le Roux estimated the assets at the station at about  R[rand]2-million.    On Saturday morning, broadcaster Jahannes van der Walt, a  former SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] newsreader,  was on duty in the mobile studio, parked on a hot, dusty koppie  at Donkerhoek. An endless stream of visitors arrived at the  studio, some bringing refreshments and old Afrikaans records to  add to the station's collection. Some camped at the caravan  site for R10 a day, but they asked a guard not allow television  crews into the area for the sake of their peace and privacy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 16, IRNA -- 'Abu Hamdan, chief of the  Tehran bureau of the Palestinian Islamic movement, Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] said here Thursday that PLO leader  Yasir 'Arafat in a bid to discourage Hamas from continuing its  armed struggle had offered it to take part in Gaza-Jericho plan.    According to Arafat's proposal, Hamas has been offered to  share the administration of Gaza and Jericho with al-Fatah, the  PLO's mainstream organization, 'Abu Hamdan said.    He told IRNA that Hamas leaders had turned down the proposal  and instead called on the PLO chairman to rejoin the Palestinian  nation and continue the armed struggle to liberate Palestine.    He refuted some western press allegations that Hamas was  conditionally ready to participate in Gaza-Jericho self-rule  plan and said, "We believe that Gaza-Jericho has not been  liberated but rather the area which covers only two percent of  whole Palestinian territory, has turned into a protectorate of  the Zionist regime."    'Abu Hamdan said that Hamas will never accept the plan,  because it is a Satanic plot aimed at guaranteeing security of  the Zionists and occupying the region economically.    Asked about an alternative formula acceptable to Hamas, he  said that based on the past experiences territories taken by  force should be recaptured by force and that negotiations with  the Zionists meant selling out the rights of Palestinian nation  to them.</p>

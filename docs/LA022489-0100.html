			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Paris, Tokyo Most Expensive: The typical business traveler staying in a  first-class hotel and eating in business-class restaurants for a month would  find that Paris and Tokyo cost the most money, a private survey said. A  monthlong stay in Paris would cost $7,260, with Tokyo close behind at $7,185,  according to the meal and lodging survey by travel consultant Runzheimer  International. Living costs in other major cities are considerably less for the  businessman or woman on the move -- a month's stay in Hong Kong runs up a bill  of $5,670, London $5,925, and Geneva, $5,115. Runzheimer said costs can be  roughly halved by putting employees up in furnished rental apartments complete  with a maid and a cook to serve half their meals at their home away from home.  </P></p>

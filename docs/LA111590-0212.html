			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> FEISTY COUNCIL PLANS SUIT COUNTERATTACK  </P> <P> The City Council will meet with City Atty. Doug Holland tonight to discuss a  lawsuit filed against the city by its primary developer, the Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> "The new council members ran on a platform of independence to the company and  we will be eager to demonstrate that independence," said Councilman Robert A.  Curtis, who endorsed two of the new council members -- Robert Breton and Sharon  Cody -- in last week's election.  </P> <P> Curtis, who earlier this year survived a recall effort that was heavily  financed by the company and is likely to become the city's next mayor, said the  new council "will not be intimidated by this litigation."  </P> <P> In a 16-page lawsuit filed in Orange County Superior Court last Thursday, the  company declared that it has the right to develop several parcels of land  scattered across the city. City officials have earmarked a significant portion  of the company's land for open space, but company officials insist that it has  a right to develop the land under an agreement with the Orange County Board of  Supervisors before the city was formed three years ago.  </P> <P> The company has asked the court to give it the right to go ahead with its  development plans for the property.  </P> <P> "We're willing to negotiate to sell the land to them," said company spokeswoman  Wendy Wetzel, "but the city cannot unilaterally take our land without  compensation."  </P> <P> At a council meeting Tuesday night, outgoing Mayor Christian W. Keena said the  lawsuit was "part of a grand scheme by the company to force the city to buy the  land."  </P> <P> Reacting to the statement, Wetzel said: "We don't care who buys the land. We  are land sellers and we are willing to sell it to whoever comes up with the  cash."  </P> <P> It appears the company and the new council are heading for a showdown. The  company, which planned and built the planned community of 75,000 people, had  contributed more than $300,000 to the unsuccessful recall campaign against  Curtis.  </P> <P> Wetzel denied that the company's action was meant to intimidate the new  council. "We were forced to act now since we have only 30 days to challenge the  city's environmental impact report which takes our land," she said. "It's  unfortunate but we did not choose the timing."  </P> <P> Curtis, a deputy district attorney for Riverside County, said the new council  will ask its lawyers whether the city has the right to protect its open-space  designations.  </P> <P> "If the city attorney so advises, we will assert those rights," he said.

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Letter: Lebanon defends efforts to regulate car imports Sir, It was deeply disturbing to those interested in the reconstruction of the Lebanon to learn from your article ('Chariots of Tyre', December 13) that the Lebanon is a haven for stolen cars. That the article describes the retrieval of stolen goods from the Lebanon as 'a knottier problem than releasing hostages from Lebanon' denotes an appalling lack of understanding of all successful measures taken by the Lebanese authorities to bring the country - except for the area occupied by Israel - under the rule of law and order. We were surprised that the writer misunderstood the laws governing car imports to the Lebanon. This is a highly regulated matter. A car cannot be imported into the Lebanon unless it is accompanied by documents including a registration certificate or an export invoice from the country where it was bought, or a certified bill of sale, and all of the legal shipping documents. Where does responsibility for the stolen goods lie in the first place? Is it in the country of original theft, or in the country receiving the stolen vehicles? If the police computers referred to in your article can trace stolen cars being re-imported to the country of original theft, why can't they trace vehicles being exported? Lebanon is a party to the Interpol agreement. If there is any proof of a stolen car being shipped to the Lebanon, the original owner can claim through appropriate police channels - in which case the Lebanese authorities would do their utmost to retrieve the vehicle, no matter how or where it had entered the country.

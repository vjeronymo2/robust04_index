			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / People: Evered Bardon Rationalisation at the head office of aggregates group Evered Bardon, where staffing levels have virtually halved in the past 14 months, has led to the jobs of commercial manager and company secretary being rolled into one. Tim Grimes, who was company secretary of Evered between 1986 and 1991, and who has since been commercial manager of the merged Evered Bardon, now reassumes the role as company secretary as well. This leaves David Kaye, who had taken over as company secretary in 1991 after previously being commercial manager, without a job. 'There was nothing else to offer him; the parting was perfectly amicable,' says chief executive Peter Tom, who was chairman and chief executive of Bardon, before Evered and Bardon came together last year. Grimes had initially wanted to leave before the merger, but stayed on in a consultancy role for two months in early summer of 1991. He then changed his mind and took the job of commercial manager.</p>

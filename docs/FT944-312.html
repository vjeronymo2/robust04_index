			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Procter wins painkiller fight Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, has won approval from a US court to continue its aggressive attack on the Dollars 2.4bn-a-year US market for painkillers. A district court judge in New Jersey ruled that Procter &amp; Gamble was not engaged in misleading advertising for its new non-prescription pain-reliever, called Aleve. Procter &amp; Gamble entered the market for pain-relievers in June this year in partnership with Syntex, a US drug company. It accompanied the launch of Aleve, an over-the-counter version of the drug naproxen, with television advertisements suggesting that the product was more effective than established products - notably Advil, an ibuprofen-based pain reliever made by another US drug company, American Home Products. In August American Home Products filed a lawsuit against Procter &amp; Gamble and Syntex seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the Aleve advertisements, claiming they were misleading consumers with 'unwarranted and unsubstantiated' claims. Among the most serious, it said, was the suggestion that Aleve lasted longer than Advil because the dosing interval was longer. Procter &amp; Gamble stood by its claims, and on Tuesday, a US district court ruled that American Home Products had failed to prove that the advertisements were false or misleading. Procter &amp; Gamble said yesterday that it was 'pleased, though frankly not surprised' by the ruling. American Home Products had no comment.</p>

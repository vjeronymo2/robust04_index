			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Benin, joint maneuvers between the national army  and the French army lasting until 11 March are starting today.  Similar maneuvers have just taken place in Cote d'Ivoire. The  Nigerian authorities are very unhappy with these Franco-Beninese  maneuvers, calling them a show of force. It must be stressed  that Nigeria was quite annoyed by the recent arrival of French  military reinforcements in Cameroon while relations between the  two countries are extremely tense following their border  dispute. However, France has often stressed that these joint  maneuvers had been planned for a long time and had nothing to do  with the situation in Nigeria. More details from Daniel  Desesquelles:    [Desesquelles] The FAR, Force d'Action Rapide, [Rapid  Reaction Force] staff has been planning these Franco-African  maneuvers with the Ivorian and Beninese staffs for nearly a  year. Therefore they are not linked in any way with the border  dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria; besides, Lagos has sent  observers for the whole duration of the maneuvers. These  Franco-African maneuvers take place every three years with one  or two African armies. While Ivorians are used to training with  the French, it is the first time the Beninese Army has trained  in an international environment. Some 1,000 French soldiers are  taking part in this exercise; they belong to the 43th Marine  Battalion based in Abidjan which was reinforced by a company of  the 8th Marine Paratrooper Regiment. The navy dispatched three  light naval craft. Air drops and amphibious operations are on  the agenda, but the main new event is the presence of three  Mirage F-1CT which will be used in the ground attack role. This  is the first time this latest version of the Mirage F-1 has been  deployed in Africa.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Howard blames lawlessness on parents Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday accused parents, teachers and social workers of failing to instil into children respect for authority and the difference between right and wrong. He told the delegates at the IoD convention yesterday: 'Clearly these failures create conditions in which crime and law-breaking can thrive.' Mr Howard, defending his controversial criminal justice bill to business leaders ahead of its second reading in the House of Commons, insisted that there was no specific evidence directly linking rising unemployment to rising crime, and urged inner-city small businesses to co-operate more fully with police. His speech sparked a political row, with one MP denouncing him as 'bonkers' while another said he was right and parents should be punished for their children's crimes. Mr Howard said the contentious aspects of his bill, including secure training centres for young offenders and a weakening of the right to silence in custody, would remain part of the bill. He also defended stronger powers for courts including tougher sentences. Mrs Alice Mahon, Labour MP for Halifax, said: 'His ability to lay the blame with anyone else except himself is breathtaking. Just to blame parents is ludicrous and shows how bonkers he is.' But Mr Terry Dicks, Tory MP for Hayes and Harlington, said: 'If parents were made responsible for the crimes of their children, juvenile crime would drop overnight. Some parents should be sent to prison for the sins of their offspring.' Last night Mr Howard called on the Commons to overturn a key change made by the House of Lords to the police and magistrates' courts bill. He accepted most of the amendments made when the government was defeated in the Lords during sustained attacks on the bill, but insisted that their refusal to accept planned new procedures for weeding out unsatisfactory police officers could not be allowed to stand. He also gave notice that MPs would be asked to reverse an amendment made by the Lords which would prevent disciplinary proceedings being brought against officers in respect of matters for which they had been tried and acquitted in the criminal courts.</p>

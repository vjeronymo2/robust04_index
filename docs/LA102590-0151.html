			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> BLUFF CALLED: A bronze sculpture, titled "The Hide Drogher," on Wednesday  became the crowning piece to Dana Point's new Blufftop Trail, honoring  19th-Century traders in skins. . . . And what better way to salute the city's  first large commercial venture than with another commercial venture? The statue  was paid for -- along with the two-block-long walkway, a bridge and a viewing  area on the blufftop -- by a Newport Beach developer. In exchange, the company  gets to build on the site.

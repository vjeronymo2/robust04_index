			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SNOWS, FLOODING, TORNADOES POUND U.S.  </P> <P> Snow blanketed much of the nation from New England to the Pacific Northwest on  Saturday, while the Southeast cleaned up from a wave of thunderstorms and  devastating tornadoes that killed two people and sent hundreds fleeing from  rising floodwaters.  </P> <P> A winter storm warning remained in effect for interior parts of western  Washington state, where up to 12 inches of snow fell between Whidbey Island and  Olympia.  </P> <P> Strong winds brought the wind chills to near zero in many locations.  </P> <P> Scattered showers fell over the Southeast, where a day earlier severe  thunderstorms roamed and tornadoes ripped through Cooper, Daleville and Ft.  Rucker, Ala.; Irmo, S. C., and Carrollton, Ga.  </P> <P> About 38 homes were destroyed or damaged in Carrollton, and 12 people were  hospitalized. The twister pulled trees out of the ground in a corkscrew motion,  witnesses said.  </P> <P> "Some houses looked like they just exploded," said Capt. Robert Lee of the  Carroll County Sheriff's Department. "It looked like a bomb hit right in the  middle of the subdivision."  </P> <P> More than 10 inches of rain had pelted Summerville, Ga., Friday, forcing dozens  of evacuations. Flooding was also reported in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee,  North Carolina and Kentucky.  </P> <P> North Carolina officials sent damage assessment teams to areas in 19 counties  hit with floods during the torrential storms, to determine if the state should  apply for federal disaster assistance.  </P> <P> All emergency shelters in the affected North Carolina counties were reported  closed Saturday. More than 200 state residents were evacuated because of the  floods.  </P> <P> Winds gusting to 45 m.p.h. moved snow around north-central Nebraska and caused  hazardous driving conditions.  </P> <P> Yellowstone Park in Wyoming had as much as 3 inches of snow overnight, and  there were greater amounts of snow in the higher mountains nearby. Gusts  reached about 50 m.p.h. near Casper Mountain.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zvornik, Bratunac, 20 Apr (TANJUG) -- UN  peacekeepers and a medical team have not yet succeeded in  entering Gorazde, although the Serbian side has done everything  in its power to ensure that this mission is accomplished,  TANJUG's correspondent learned from republic of Srpska army  sources this evening. The same sources specified that republic  of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic and UN special envoy  Yasushi Akashi agreed on this mission on Sunday. It was  allegedly agreed that 100 UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]  members and a 60-member medical team should go to Gorazde.  However, the Serbian side was not told about the reasons for  delaying the start of the mission; it was told that the military  and medical contingent could arrive in Gorazde tomorrow.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT: STEP BY STEP, TECHNIQUES FOR PAINTING OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> FOR YOUR OWN COMFORT AND TO HELP PAINT DRY BETTER, WORK IN THE SHADE IF  POSSIBLE.  </P> <P> The warm days of spring and fall are ideal for exterior painting.  </P> <P> Work in the shade if possible. The paint will dry better and you'll be more  comfortable. Wait for clear, dry weather and let at least two days pass after  the last rain.  </P> <P> PAINTING SEQUENCE: Begin by laying drop cloths to protect walks, shrubs and  other areas. Start painting the main parts of the structure first: siding,  shingles and other large areas. Then do the trim -- windows, doors, cornices  and so on. Next, paint decks, porches and patios.  </P> <P> Start at the top and work across in horizontal stretches. Paint gables before  painting the eave lines. Paint dormers before painting lower sections. Use a  clean drop cloth to protect roofing that's beneath the area you're painting.  </P> <P> SIDING: Clapboard siding should be painted with a brush. Load the brush by  dipping a third to a half of the bristle length into the paint. Gently tap the  brush on the can sides to dislodge extra paint. Do not wipe it against the  can's edge.  </P> <P> Paint the bottom edge of the board, working the paint into the crevice. Next,  apply paint in short strokes across the face of the siding and spread it with  smooth, even strokes. Paint an area about 3 feet wide and five boards deep.  After one section is completed, move to the next one and work from the dry area  toward the area just painted. If the siding has grooves, paint them first.  </P> <P> Paint vertical siding from top to bottom. On flat surfaces, a roller speeds  applications.  </P> <P> TRIM: On the eaves, brush a 2-inch paint band to separate them from the siding.  Then finish them with a roller. Use small brushes, 1 inch to 2 1/2 inches wide  for other trim.  </P> <P> WINDOWS, DOORS, STAIRS: On windows, paint horizontal dividers, then vertical  dividers, then the sides of the surrounding wall trim.  </P> <P> On doors, begin with the panels. Then, paint the horizontal and vertical  boards. Paint across the top of flush doors, and then down.  </P> <P> When painting stairs, paint alternate steps so you can use the steps while the  paint dries.  </P> <P> SPRAY PAINTING: Paint for spraying must be thinned to spraying consistency and  strained through a filter to remove lumps and dirt. Spray outdoors on a calm  day. Protect surroundings from the spray. Adjust the spray pattern to suit the  surface being painted. Use a narrow fan pattern for small areas and full width  pattern for large areas such as walls.  </P> <P> Keep the gun about 6 to 8 inches from the surface. Move the gun parallel to the  work surface and overlap each stroke by one-half.  </P> <P> Clean equipment thoroughly after use.  </P> <P> Need help on a home repair or improvement project?

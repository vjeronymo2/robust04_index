			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Writedowns push Cadillac Fairview to CDollars 2.7bn loss The main operating subsidiary of Cadillac Fairview, the Toronto-based property developer which is in the midst of a debt-restructuring, suffered a CDollars 2.71bn (Dollars 1.96bn) loss in its latest fiscal year. The loss, the biggest ever reported by a private-sector company in Canada, was largely due to hefty writedowns of real-estate assets to reflect the lower of their cost or market value. As a result of the writedowns and other non-recurring provisions, the book value of the subsidiary's assets tumbled to CDollars 2.8bn last October 31, from CDollars 5.3bn a year earlier. Cadillac Fairview (CF) is a private company owned by about 40 institutional investors in the US and Canada. Its 73 properties include Toronto's landmark Eaton Centre. The parent company does not publish financial results, but its main subsidiary, Cadillac Fairview Corporation Ltd, has issued publicly-traded debt securities. CFCL's operating loss was CDollars 195.6m in the 12 months to October 31, up from a CDollars 162.7m loss a year earlier. CF's capital-restructuring plan covers debt of about CDollars 3.3bn. The company is seeking to reduce its debt, raise new equity and sell some assets. It has segregated its various properties, servicing the debt only of those with adequate cash flows. Prospective providers of equity include the Reichmann family, former owners of Olympia &amp; York Developments; Mr Li Kashing, the Hong Kong tycoon; and US financier Mr Leon Black. Mr Doug Sawchuk, analyst at Dominion Bond Rating Service in Toronto, said CF's debt-restructuring was likely to be simpler and less acrimonious than the plan negotiated two years ago by O&amp;Y. CF has fewer subsidiaries, fewer tiers of creditors and fewer cross-default provisions. However, Mr Sawchuk said that bank lenders, led by Toronto-Dominion Bank, 'are a wild card'. The banks hold the bulk of CF's unsecured debt.</p>

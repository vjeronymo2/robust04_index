			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / US leads the charge as allies fight for Kuwaiti contracts TO THE victors go the spoils of war: at least, this was the hope of US, British and French companies which rushed to liberated Kuwait last year for shares of what promised to be a Dollars 100bn (Pounds 57bn) harvest of rebuilding contracts. A year on, though, it is clear that the rebuilding bill will be only about a fifth of the earliest estimates. It also appears that companies from only one of the Gulf war allies, the US, is winning anything like victors' spoils. 'We're doing well,' said one US official. 'Kuwait is certainly favouring US companies.' US groups have won at least Dollars 2bn worth of contracts and export orders in Kuwait since last March. Moreover, US exporters have increased market share in Kuwait, notably for cars and foods. Officials expect pre-war export levels of around Dollars 800m a year will rise to average more than Dollars 1bn for the next few years. US companies should also do well out of contracts still to be let. Of a likely bill for reconstruction of around Dollars 20bn over the next two or three years, at least half will be spent on restoring the oil industry, while this year's budget set aside Dollars 9bn for defence spending. US groups are leading contenders in both fields. Bechtel, the private Californian group, has been in Kuwait since liberation with an open-ended deal as the services contractor for restoring the oil industry. No one will put a figure on the deal, but it is certain to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Three US groups, Brown &amp; Root, Fluor Daniel and Foster Wheeler, are also the leading contenders to win the management contract for repairing Kuwait's three oil refineries - a task expected to cost Dollars 2bn overall. 'We're pretty optimistic it will go our way,' said a US diplomat. In defence, the US is already providing the first of 40 F-18 jets under a Dollars 1.6bn deal signed in 1988. It also has an Dollars 81m agreement under which two US groups have begun Dollars 42.5m worth of work repairing the country's two air bases. Kuwait is also considering buying up to 200 Abrams M1A2 tanks. AT &amp; T is fighting hard to enter Kuwait's telecommunications market, largely at the expense of Ericsson of Sweden, which built most of the existing network. The US company hopes to win contracts worth up to Dollars 200m. British and, particularly, French officials are disappointed. 'The overall picture here of awarding contracts is gloomy,' said a French diplomat, who reckoned French groups had tendered for Dollars 1.5bn worth of contracts but won just Dollars 500m worth since liberation. Most of this represents the French share of Kuwait's postwar Dollars 2bn order for 15 Airbus airliners. However, General Electric of the US is involved in the supply of the Airbus' engines (through CFM, a joint venture with France's Snecma) while Boeing is to supply three 747 jets. French officials are also piqued that none of their bidders won any significant share of the effort to control Kuwait's oil fires or of subsequent oilfield recovery work - a situation they attribute to lobbying by Bechtel. British companies have fared slightly better. Officials in Kuwait estimate that the UK has won nearly Dollars 1bn of trade and contracts since liberation, though this includes a Dollars 200m share of the Airbus contract. Among the main British successes, the Kuwait British Group, a consortium of Wimpey, AMEC and Taylor Woodrow has a contract worth nearly Dollars 200m to restore output from the northern oilfields; Morrison has secured Dollars 40m worth of work repairing the water system; and Royal Ordnance, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, has mine and ordnance clearance contracts worth around Dollars 100m. Britain's main hope for further large contracts lies in defence, where the Challenger 2 tank is competing against the US Abrams. But UK officials say few other big contracts appear likely to go Britain's way, and Kuwait's appeal to contractors has suffered accordingly. 'The level of interest in this market shown by British companies has just dropped off,' said a UK official.  ---------------------------   EXPORTS TO KUWAIT     MAR-OCT 1991  --------------------------- US        Dollars 800m Japan     Dollars 180m UK        Dollars 115m Germany    Dollars 93m France     Dollars 60m  --------------------------- Source: DTI  ---------------------------</p>

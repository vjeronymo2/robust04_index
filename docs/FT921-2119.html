			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Appointments: Rift forces Hayter to quit John Hayter, 54, is to part company with the rapidly growing Lloyd's agency group Hayter Brockbank, which he helped form, following a rift between him and the group's senior management. John Shipton, 57, who joined the group last year following Hayter Brockbank's acquisition of his own members' agency, JK Shipton, takes over as chairman. A former chairman of CT Bowring, more recently Shipton has been associated with CE Heath Insurance Services - the biggest personal lines broker in the Lloyd's market. The group decided on a new, more hands-on, management style after a recent review of its operations but Hayter, now 54, refused to stand down as chairman or to continue as a director of the members' agency company, which he founded in 1974 and merged with Alston Brockbank in 1988. According to George Stevens, group managing director, it was felt that the company needed a cohesive and single-minded approach to the boardroom in order to tackle problems and grasp the opportunities that lay ahead. ***** Ian MacLellan has been appointed a director of CT BOWRING REINSURANCE. ***** Alan Baines and David Wickerson are appointed directors of RICHARDS LONGSTAFF (INSURANCE).</p>

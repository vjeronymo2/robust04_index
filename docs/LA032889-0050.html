			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: HOUSE OF FABRICS PROFIT RISES 9% FOR 4TH QUARTER  </P> <P> House of Fabrics said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 9% from a year  earlier on a 10% increase in sales.  </P> <P> The Sherman Oaks company, which operates a chain of 653 fabric and  sewing-accessories stores, said net income in the quarter that ended Jan. 31  climbed to $4.73 million from $4.33 million, and sales increased to $100.8  million from $91.9 million.  </P> <P> House of Fabrics attributed the gains to its recent restructuring, in which the  company phased out many of its smaller mall stores and opened larger,  stand-alone outlets. The new stores are more popular because they offer more  merchandise and are more convenient for customers, House of Fabrics contends.  </P> <P> For its full fiscal year, House of Fabrics' profit rose 9% to $11.4 million  from $10.5 million, and its annual sales were up 5% to $338 million from $322.5  million.  </P></p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / US sees sharpest rise in indicators for a year THE US index of leading indicators - a guide to future economic trends - last month registered its sharpest increase for nearly a year. Propelled by a steep increase in consumer confidence, the index rose 0.8 per cent, following a 0.5 per cent increase in October. Optimism, however, was muted by unexpectedly poor figures for new home sales, which fell 8.3 per cent between October and November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 565,000. This followed a fall of similar magnitude in the previous month. The 8.3 per cent decline was the biggest drop since March when sales fell 11.5 per cent. The figures for new home sales were a marked contrast to Tuesday's report of a 5.4 per cent rise in sales of existing homes, a significant gain for the second month running. Figures for new home sales, however, are often heavily revised, usually upwards. The reported declines since October may thus overstate any loss of momentum in this sector of the housing market. Sales of new homes for the first 11 months of this year were 19 per cent higher than in the same period last year. The leading index was lifted by increases in eight of its ll component indicators, including gains in consumer confidence, a fall in weekly claims for unemployment insurance, a rise in share prices and faster growth of the money supply. The consumer expectations component rose far more sharply than other components and accounted for half of the total increase in the leading index. The index is intended to predict changes in economic activity several months in advance. However in the recent past it has failed to give warning of slowdowns, such as the dip in industrial production last summer. The index of coincident indicators, which measures the current state of the economy, rose modestly in November for the second month running. President-elect Bill Clinton welcomed the latest figures, saying they showed there is hope and optimism that the economy is improving. He was quoted by a spokesman as saying that it showed there was 'hope and optimism that things are going to get better.' The spokesman added that Mr Clinton said, 'what we've got to do is to keep interest rates down and get growth going.'</p>

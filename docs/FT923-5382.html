			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Letter: Victims of slump in UK housing market need urgent help Sir, I am disappointed to hear the chorus of bank and building society chairmen calling for measures to stimulate the housing market. The problem with this market is that, in spite of the decline, it is still too stimulated. House prices are too high in relation to earnings. Too high a proportion of our capital is tied up in overvalued property, so preventing it from being used as security for other investments. What we should be looking for is a way to protect the victims of the slump while allowing the fall in prices to continue and not encouraging more rises in earnings. Of the groups needing protection, occupiers seem to be attracting more sympathy - although their motives for over committing themselves may not have been different from those of the over-keen lenders. They should not now be rewarded for greed or protected from the consequences of folly. The Rowntree Foundation's proposal of selective support for interest payments may provide one short-term solution; another may be to limit the freedom of mortgagers to evict to those cases triggered by fraudulent behaviour rather than misfortune. There would have to be matching protection for lenders. Here the issue is their solvency. It should not be impossible to devise a guarantee allowing these lenders to continue trading with part of their portfolio frozen but secured by government. Such support should be linked to the relationship between house prices and earnings. The present situation in which revenue subsidies are spent annually to prop up house prices is unsustainable and, in the case of much mortgage interest tax relief, unjust.

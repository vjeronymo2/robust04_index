Sergey Zotov, who heads the Russian delegation to the talks  with Latvia, will arrive in Riga on January 10 to discuss a  draft agreement on the radar station after the Russian troops  have left Latvian territory.    Karasin said that the absence of such an agreement hampers  the signing of the prepared main document which sets the  deadline of the troop withdrawal and two other agreements on  social welfare of the Army personnel and the retired military  and members of their families.</p>

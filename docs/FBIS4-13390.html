			<p>BFN     [Text] Hizballah issued a statement today saying that the  participation of an official Zionist delegation in a conference  on water held in Oman is a serious development that proves the  Arab regimes' failure to observe the boycott of Israel. The  statement notes that the willingness to cooperate with the  Zionist enemy, which engages in the most brutal and criminal  practices against the Lebanese and Palestinian people, is  tantamount to encouraging such aggression and acquitting Israel  of its dreadful crimes.    Hizballah warned that such cooperation will undermine all  chances for regaining the usurped rights.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Mortgage lenders warn of housing grant cut Mortgage lenders yesterday warned ministers that cutting the proportion of public money used to fund housing association projects could jeopardise current private-sector involvement in this area. This is the first time that the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents banks, building societies and other centralised lenders, has expressed a view about the grant rate for housing asso-ciations. It reflects growing anxiety among lenders that the housing budget could again be under pressure in this year's public spending discussions. In recent years the government has expected housing associations to raise an increasing proportion of private finance to construct or acquire homes for social housing. Average grant rates have fallen from 75 per cent in 1991-92 to 67 per cent in 1993-94, and ministers have already signalled that they want to see the headline grant rate fall to 55 per cent. In a letter to Mr David Curry, housing minister, the council says that a reduction below an average 60 per cent 'would be a major cause of concern', and would leave lenders straining against the established prudential guidelines which govern their involvement in the initiative. Mr Andrew Longhurst, the council's chairman, says in the letter: 'There is a delicate balance to retain between reducing the housing association grant rate and ensuring the full participation of private lenders.' Mr Adrian Coles, council director-general, said yesterday that although further cuts in the grant rate would not end private finance in housing associations, they would lead to changes in lenders' attitudes because of the increased risks they would face. Some would withdraw from the market, some would reduce their exposure or insert tougher terms in their contracts, and others would consider raising their interest rates.</p>

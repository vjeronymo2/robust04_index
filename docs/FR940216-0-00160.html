			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has retained the ten percent blendstock-to-gasoline ratio trigger in the final rule, however, because a trigger at this level is appropriate for the like-time-period comparisons used in the final rule. With the promulgated approach, EPA believes that blendstock sales increases in excess of the trigger are only likely to occur in cases where a refiner attempts to improperly gain use of a less stringent baseline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments focused on the two options proposed for special blendstock accounting, the first option with the refiner accounting for the blendstock and the second option with the downstream refiner-blender using the baseline of the blendstock producer-refiner. These commenters stated that refiners using the refiner-accounting option would have difficulty if it became apparent late in the year that the ratio threshold would be exceeded, because the required adjustment must reflect the total volume of all blendstocks produced and sold during the entire year. These commenters stated that the refiner-accounting option also would be difficult to implement because downstream refiner-blenders of the blendstock, who would have included blendstock received during the year in compliance planning, would have to recalculate compliance with the refiner-accounted blendstock excluded. Similar timing and complexity concerns were expressed in the case of a refiner who selected the option of shifting the refiner's baseline to blendstock recipients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees with these comments, and has modified the final rule as a result. In any case where the blendstock-to-gasoline threshold is exceeded, special blendstock accounting is required beginning in the subsequent averaging period. This change will avoid the timing and complexity problems of requiring refiners and downstream blendstock recipients to recalculate compliance retroactively for the compliance period during which the threshold is exceeded. In addition, EPA has rethought the option of allowing refiners to pass the refiner baseline to blendstock recipients, and has excluded this option from the final rule. EPA believes that the burden of special blendstock accounting should fall on the refiner that produces the excess blendstock, and such parties should not be allowed to pass the accounting responsibility to downstream parties. EPA proposed the option of allowing refiners to pass the refiner-baseline to downstream blender-refiners in order to allow more flexibility in meeting the anti-dumping requirements. EPA now believes that this flexibility advantage is outweighed by countervailing considerations, including the complexity that results from this option, the equity in placing the blendstock accounting responsibility only on the refiner who has control over the volume of blendstocks that is produced, and the inequity that could result if a refiner imposed a more stringent baseline on downstream blender-refiners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter expressed concern that the reason EPA proposed blendstock accounting measures was to prevent new blender-refiners from entering the market in order to correct a perceived ``loophole'' in the proposed rules, and that such market manipulation by EPA is inappropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees that the anti-dumping program should not preclude new blenders from entering the market, and does not believe that the final regulations have such a result. Any refiner who enters the market beginning in 1995 will have the same regulatory requirements as refiners who were in business before that date. They of course will have the statutory baseline and not a baseline that is more stringent than the statutory baseline. A new refiner would therefore not be subject to the blendstock accounting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has implemented the following changes in the final rule in response to comments: (1) The gasoline portion of the compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio has been expanded to include all gasoline produced, including reformulated gasoline and RBOB, because a comparison to conventional gasoline alone would more likely cause the trigger to be exceeded and not represent true incidences of dumping; (2) straight run naphtha has been excluded from the list of applicable blendstocks that are included in the blendstock portion of the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio, because properties of this product are cleaner than the anti-dumping statutory baseline; and (3) feedstocks, exported blendstocks, and blendstocks transferred between refineries that are aggregated for compliance purposes are excluded from the blendstock portion of the ratio, as they are not indicative of a transfer of production to avoid a more stringent baseline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposed that refiners would be exempt from special blendstock accounting if the compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio is three percent or less, regardless of how this ratio compares with the baseline ratio. One commenter stated that EPA should either reduce the three percent threshold for this exemption, or eliminate the exemption altogether. The commenter claimed that refiners could produce primarily dirty blendstocks (e.g., benzene) within the three percent limit for sale into the downstream market, which would result in environmental degradation. This commenter further stated that with the three percent exemption, only approximately fifteen percent of refiners would be required to monitor the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio under EPA's proposed scheme. This commenter also stated that the blendstock tracking provisions should apply to all refiners and not only to parties with more-rigorous-than-statutory baselines, because all parties have the opportunity to sell dirty blendstocks into the downstream market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

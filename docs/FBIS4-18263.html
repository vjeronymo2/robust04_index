			<p>BFN     [Text] The True Path Party [TPP] has announced that it  wants the coalition government to continue until 1996, and that  it will not be the one to destroy this coalition.    The TPP leadership council, whips, and administrative  council  members met with Tansu Ciller, party leader and Prime Minister,  in Ankara today.    In a statement after the two hour meeting, TPP deputy leader  Esat Kiratlioglu said: The citizens gave us the responsibility  to solve the problems of terrorism and economy. They want us to  find solutions. Aware of our responsiblity, we are determined  to solve these problems and lead our country in a spirit of  unity and solidarity and in stability to the elections in 1996.    Kiratlioglu stressed that within this framework, the TPP  follows the principle of finding solutions to the country's  problems over and beyond political considerations. He added:  We want the coalition to continue. We do not want it  destroyed. We want it to fulfill its duties until the scheduled  elections. We will not be the ones to destroy the coalition.  We will certainly not be the ones to destroy it. At this  stage, the country needs stability, not a search for a new  government.    Asked to comment on the fact that certain TPP deputies were  collecting signatures, Kiratlioglu said that this signature  campaign was not aimed at ending the coalition, but at bringing  counterproposals to the one that might be posited by the Social  Democratic Populist Party [SDPP].    The TPP deputy leader stressed that at this stage, the party  is not seeking a coalition with the Motherland Party. If the  SDPP leaves the coalition, he said, every combination within the  parliament will be considered.</p>

The KGB chief said that this "act of international  gangsterism" was possible because the KGB did not control the  activities of the Interior Ministry.    Vladimir Yegorov, the Interior Minister, told parliament  that  officers of the Belarusian Interior Ministry detained the two  men in the presence of two Lithuanian law enforcement officers.  He said that the Belarusian police did not have a written  arrest warrant but this action had been discussed by Interior  Ministry and prosecution officers, in particular by the interior  minister and the prosecutor general of Belarus.    In Yegorov's words, the men involved in the detention  believed that an arrest warrant did exist, which is why the car  carrying the Lithuanian special service men and the detainees  left for the Belarusian-Lithuanian border.    Pyotr Kravchenko, Belarusian Foreign Minister, said that his  ministry had not received any messages that were required by the  appropriate agreement between Belarus and Lithuania about the  arrest.</p>

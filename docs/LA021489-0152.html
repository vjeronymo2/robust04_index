			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> MAILMAN GETS NEW ADDRESS: PRISON  </P> <P> A former mail carrier whose home was stacked with tons of undelivered junk mail  was sentenced today to a year and a day in federal prison for failing to  deliver two first-class letters.  </P> <P> William Ryan, 59, told the court that he felt he couldn't deliver all the mail  assigned to him on his rural route and started leaving a few pieces in his car  every day about three years ago. "Things just seemed to snowball," Ryan told  U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson.  </P> <P> The first-class letters were discovered among nearly 500,000 pieces of mostly  advertising brochures, catalogues, sweepstakes offers, give-aways and other  so-called junk mail found heaped in and around his home last August by  authorities following up on a tip.  </P></p>

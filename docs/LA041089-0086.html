			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: UC SAN DIEGO SETS ENDURANCE MARK IN WATER POLO  </P> <P> The UC San Diego men's water polo team established a new mark for the Guinness  Book of World Records when it completed a 26-hour game on Sunday.  </P> <P> The game, between two seven-man teams chosen from the 34-man Triton squad,  began at 1:15 p.m. Saturday at the UCSD Natatorium and continued until 3:15  p.m. Sunday and set a record for the longest continuous water polo game. It  broke the record of 25 hours 36 minutes set three years ago by a prep team in  Shropshire, England.  </P> <P> For the record, the white team -- Jason Brown, Todd Sells, Randy Franke, Tom  Schatz, Jason Vance, Greg Goodrich and John Sklut -- defeated the blue team --  Larry Sanders, J.P. Beay, Peter McConville, Stuart Sweeney, Chris Carillo, Mike  Schatz and Todd Brinton -- by a score of 488-460.  </P> <P> "I knew they would be able to do this," Coach Denny Harper said. "But I was  surprised by how strong they were at the end."  </P> <P> Harper also was a little surprised by what 26 hours in water can do to the  skin.  </P> <P> "They didn't look humanlike at the end," Harper said. "Obviously, their hands  were pretty wrinkled and had a real ashlike color, but an hour or so later,  they were all recovered."  </P> <P> MEN'S TENNIS  </P> <P> No. 15-ranked University of San Diego scored a 5-3 victory over Fresno State  with victories coming from No. 2 singles player Mark Farren and No. 3 Mike  Noel.  </P> <P> Farren edged Greg Anderson, 7-5, 6-4, and Noel had little trouble defeating  Bertrand Lemercier, 6-4, 6-2. Farren and Noel then teamed for a 6-4, 6-3 defeat  of Mike Noel and Lemercier at No. 2 doubles.  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> Eric Christopherson and Brian Dunn each drove in two runs in a four-run second  inning to help San Diego State (24-14, 8-4) to a 6-3 victory over host New  Mexico in the first game of a Western Athletic Conference doubleheader.  </P> <P> New Mexico (8-21-1, 4-4) came back to take the second game, 8-1.  </P> <P> Three consecutive walks to open the bottom of the third inning proved the  undoing of the University of San Diego as host Loyola Marymount scored five  runs in the inning en route to an 11-1 West Coast Athletic Conference victory.  </P> <P> The Toreros (15-20-1, 1-10) went on to walk eight and had six errors in losing  their ninth in a row.  </P> <P> SOCCER  </P> <P> The San Diego Nomads of the Western Soccer League scored a 2-0 victory over the  Arizona Condors in an exhibition game at San Diego City College. Jerome Watson  and Arturo Valesco kicked in the Nomads' two goals.  </P></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets played a leading role in the strong advance in UK equities in the wake of yesterday's interest rate decisions in Germany, writes Terry Byland. In stock index futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 led the underlying market above the important 2,900 barrier, responding quickly to evident pressures on the ERM currency network. After showing a solid but fairly modest lead during the early part of the session, the September contract jumped to a 20-point premium against the underlying cash market as traders watched the developments in world foreign exchange centres. With fair value - the estimated premium allowing for carrying costs and dividend considerations - now at only 5 points, heavy arbitrage dealing commenced at yesterday's peak. Both locals and the big institutional investors were heavy sellers of the future and buyers of the underlying stocks. By the close, the premium had steadied to around 11 against cash (five against fair value.) Turnover, however, was less exciting, with the contract recording only 6,500 at the official close. The contract closed at 2,926. Traded options saw 36,070 contracts dealt, against 32,707 on Wednesday. The Footsie contract traded 8,112, compared with a previous 7,617. Individual stocks were headed by British Steel (with 7,970) and Hanson (2,505).</p>

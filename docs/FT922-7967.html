			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hasbro plans to buy Japanese toy company HASBRO, the US toy maker, is planning to buy Nomura Toy, a privately-owned Japanese toy design and marketing company, in the latest in a string of Japanese acquisitions by foreign companies. Spurred by the decline in land and stock prices, foreign companies have shown increasing interest in buying Japanese businesses, particularly distributors and other groups with access to markets and marketing skills. For their part, the owners of many Japanese companies involved in wholesale and retail distribution are looking to sell their businesses in response to recent easing of regulations designed to protect small shopkeepers. Hasbro's proposed push into the Japanese toy market follows the success of Toys 'R' Us, the US toy retailer singled out for praise for its efforts by Mr George Bush, the US president, during his visit to Japan early this year. Hasbro plans to establish a Japanese subsidiary which will take over Nomura. The Japanese company, no relation of Nomura Securities, was founded in 1923 and employs 40 staff in the design and marketing of toy cars, games, dolls and toy animals. The products are made by sub-contractors. Sales are about Y3bn (Dollars 22.6m) a year. The purchase price was not disclosed. Mr Koichi Nomura, the president, and his family are selling the company to Hasbro because of difficult condi-tions in the market, said Nomura. Hasbro said it was buying Nomura as a way of entering the Japanese market. It would use Nomura to launch various toys on the market, including board games.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS smelting conditions attacked ENVIRONMENTAL conditions discovered in some aluminium smelters in the Commonwealth of Independent States by a team from the Aluminium Company of America were far worse than expected, said Mr Paul O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, yesterday. In some smelters conditions were so poor that the average life expectancy of a worker was only 47 years. 'There is no way we could be part of that,' said Mr O'Neill. The team from Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminium company, went to see if the group had a role to play in the CIS. Mr O'Neill said: 'I don't know if there is a place for Alcoa there. We are not willing to sacrifice our values to do business in an unseemly way in life-threatening circumstances.' On the other hand, he said the team found that the CIS had some leading aluminium technology arising from the former Soviet Union's willingness to provide unlimited resources for any material for military use. The CIS industry showed it could produce high quality products in 'ghastly operating circumstances'. The Alcoa team was also impressed by the level of education throughout the CIS smelter workforces. Mr O'Neill's comments coincided with a symposium in St Petersburg in Russia this week at which the CIS aluminium industry is putting itself on display, partly with the aim of encouraging more investment from western companies. Mr O'Neill warned that the flood of aluminium exports from the CIS to the west 'won't evaporate' and it was likely that exports of semi-fabricated aluminium products would also build up. Neither was there any sign that the CIS domestic economy would revive enough in the medium term to absorb more of the metal its aluminium industry was producing. Last year the CIS exported about 1m tonnes of aluminium, which helped drive the metals price down to its lowest-ever level in real terms. The market is still over supplied and some analysts believe there must be more output cuts by western producers if there is to be a strong price recovery. Mr O'Neill said all Alcoa's smelters were generating a positive cashflow and unless that changed the group would not close any capacity. However, neither would it invest in new smelter capacity until it was clear the industry could look forward to several years of aluminium prices of between 80 and 85 cents a pound. 'Those conditions will come but I don't know when,' he added. Last night cash aluminium closed at 57.5 cents a lb on the London Metal Exchange.</p>

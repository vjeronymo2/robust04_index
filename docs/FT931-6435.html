			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Caribbean economic hopes rest with trading partners: Growth in industrialised countries seen as vital CARIBBEAN countries can expect to improve on last year's sluggish economic performance only if there is significant growth in the industrialised countries, particularly in North America and Europe, according to the Caribbean Development Bank. In a review, the Barbados-based bank said the medium-term prospects were also clouded by fears among the region's producers and exporters about the impact of new trade blocs. The bank said the weak economic performance of most of its borrowing members last year 'reflected prolonged recession in their major trading partners and tight fiscal and monetary policies as many countries sought to protect the balance of payments contracting aggregate demand'. The CDB, which has resources of Dollars 800m (Pounds 563m), provides project loans for its 17 borrowing members. Its main contributors are the US, Canada, Britain, France and Germany. The bank reported that while some economies, such as Barbados and Dominica, contracted last year, Guyana and Belize each grew by about 7 per cent. Guyana's economy was buoyed by improved performance in all sectors except bauxite, while there was expansion in agricultural output in Belize. Other countries recorded growth below 4 per cent, the report said, with Jamaica's performance aided by stabilisation of interest rates and the slackening of inflation. Trinidad and Tobago suffered from a weak balance of payments. 'The generally weak regional performance has contributed to mounting unemployment, with several of the larger borrowing members reporting rates in excess of 20 per cent.' Tourism, increasingly important to many Caribbean economies, grew by 2 per cent last year, with a decline in the North American market being compensated for by an increase in the flow of visitors from Europe. The fall in volume from North America was caused mainly by recession in the US and Canadian economies, the bank said. Favourable weather last year contributed to an increase in banana exports to Britain, the CDB reported. But it warned that despite the European Community's agreement on a new marketing arrangement to be implemented in July, 'the future of this industry in the region appears relatively uncertain'. The region's sugar producers improved last year - with the exception of Barbados - with output growing by 38 per cent in Guyana. The bank reported, however, that the industry had been adversely affected by a reduction in import quotas by the US. Recession in the region's key markets dampened manufacturing output, while a weak aluminium market depressed demand for bauxite produced in Jamaica and Guyana. Falling oil prices and reduced production cut Trinidad and Tobago's earnings from its petroleum sector.</p>

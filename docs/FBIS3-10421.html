This statement was made during a meeting with the UN secretary  general. Jean-Bertrand Aristide spoke for more than an hour with  the UN secretary general while several thousand Haitians  demonstrated near UN headquarters in support of the president in  exile.    It should be recalled that on the previous day, 4 March, the  four countries, Friends of Haiti, had submitted to the UN  Security Council a draft resolution reinforcing international  sanctions against Haiti. The draft resolution provides for a  total commercial embargo, except for food and medicine, the  banning of non-commercial flights to or from Haiti, as well as  some restrictions on travel by the authors of the coup d'etat  and their relatives abroad. The UN Security Council is due to  make a decision on this resolution within 15 days.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. HYPOCRISY  </P> <P> Consider these three newspaper items:  </P> <P> 1. The U.S., hot on the heels of drug dealers and producers all over the world,  stands unmasked as one of the big "dealers," according to a column by Peter G.  Bourne (Op-Ed Page, May 15). Bourne reveals that the U.S. exerts intense  pressure on countries attempting to ban or curtail tobacco advertising, though  we are trying to accomplish that very thing here. A double standard?  </P> <P> 2. President Bush (speaking from behind bullet-proof glass) gives his usual  tough speech on crime, favoring the continued banning of assault rifles. Well,  those made elsewhere; domestic production is fine. This may be the civilian  version of "friendly fire."  </P> <P> 3. Panama strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega, for years the friend of U.S.  administrations, now takes the role of enemy, though his drug connections were  known for all that time. What has converted him from friend to foe? Could he be  needed to take the part abandoned by the Soviet Union? We need someone against  whom to carry on our War to Save Hypocrisy.  </P> <P> WILFRED COUZIN  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

Children with ADD who are eligible for special education and medically related services will qualify for services under ``Other Health Impaired'' as described in Criterion A, paragraph (h)(1) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Autism.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and non-verbal communication and social interaction generally evident before age 3 that adversely affects educational performance. Characteristics of autism include irregularities and impairments in communication, engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences. The term does not include children with characteristics of the disability of serious emotional disturbance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Case Study Committee (CSC).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A school-based committee that determines a child's eligibility for special education, develops and reviews a child's individualized education program (IEP), and determines appropriate placement in the least restrictive environment. A CSC is uniquely composed for each child. Participants on a CSC must include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The designated representative of the Section 6 School Arrangement, who is qualified to supervise the provision of special education. Such representative may not be the child's special education teacher. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) One, or more, of the child's regular education teachers, if appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A special education teacher. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) One, or both, of the child's parents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The child, if appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) A member of the evaluation team or another person knowledgeable about the evaluation procedures used with the child. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Other individuals, at the discretion of the parent or the Section 6 School Arrangement, who may have pertinent information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Child-find.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ongoing process used by the Military Services and a Section 6 School Arrangement to seek and identify children (from birth to 21 years of age) who show indications that they might be in need of early intervention services or special education and related services.

The terms ``child'' and ``student'' may also be used to refer to this population. The student must be determined eligible under one of the following four categories: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Criterion A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The educational performance of the student is adversely affected, as determined by the CSC, by a physical impairment; visual impairment including blindness; hearing impairment including deafness; orthopedic impairment; or other health impairment, including ADD, when the condition is a chronic or acute health problem that results in limited alertness; autism; and traumatic brain injury requiring environmental and/or academic modifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

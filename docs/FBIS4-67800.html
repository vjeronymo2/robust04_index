			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: ``Pakistan-U.S. Talks -- Hope for Positive </F> Progress'']    [Text] Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state,  has concluded his talks with Pakistani authorities in Islamabad.  It was generally felt that the entire attention at the talks  would be directed to the nuclear problem in the subcontinent and  the supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan. However, as Talbott  himself said, the talks were wide-ranging and encompassed not  only specific South Asian issues but other global and regional  issues of interest to Pakistan and the United States, too.  Although these talks, as the press reports indicate, have not  been conclusive and will be continued, but a big benefit  obtained from them is that they enabled Pakistan and the United  States to understand each other's viewpoints.    Pakistan repeated its proclaimed stand that it staunchly  supports nuclear nonproliferation. However, the objective can  be achieved only when the two major countries of South Asia both  agree to accept identical restrictions and no country is given  any discriminatory or preferential treatment. At his news  conference, Talbott clarified that the United States would like  to accomplish the objective of ending the weapons of mass  destruction by pursuing fair means, and there is no question of  any attempt to push Pakistan to the corner and to put any  pressure on it unilaterally. He also held extensive talks on  the supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan and said that the supply  of planes is part of the proposals presented to Pakistan as a  package.    The United States also made a proposal to Pakistan for  convening a multinational conference to discuss the nuclear  nonproliferation issue, which would include nine countries.  Pakistan has agreed to the proposal. Talbott repeated the  demand for an inspection of Pakistan's nuclear installations.  Pakistan responded with alternative proposals that were not  disclosed. The two sides have agreed that future talks will be  held quietly without much publicity so they can deliberate on  concrete proposals while keeping them free from political  pressures.    It is satisfying to note that the government of Pakistan  expressed its resolve to adhere to its stand on basic issues and  refused to compromise on them. The overall attitude of the U.S.  mission was also satisfying, and it did not demand that Pakistan  abandon its nuclear program right away. It is only after three  years that Pakistan and the United States have held such  high-level extensive talks that have helped the two sides  understand each other's viewpoint better. Now that it has been  decided to adopt the path of quiet diplomacy, it is appropriate  to hope that it will yield results and that the United States,  keeping with its claim, will be able to adopt an equitable  strategy toward the countries of South Asia.    Pakistan is ready to accept any reasonable proposal on  nuclear nonproliferation. The U.S. authorities might have  realized this fact very well during their recent talks. We hope  that the Clinton administration will have a greater realistic  approach to all issues after it receives the report on Talbott's  mission and will make a decision to supply F-16 planes to  Pakistan without making any unacceptable demand. It will not be  incongruous to hope that the Islamabad talks will result in the  revival of better and effective relations between Pakistan and  the United States. Talbott's remarks that the United States  still attaches the same importance to Pakistan as it did before  the end of the Cold War is encouraging. If this claim is  correct, then there is no justification for suspending the  military assistance to Pakistan.    Pakistan's stand on the nuclear issue is very rational and  legitimate. In no case can it be used as a plea for suspending  military assistance to Pakistan. Similarly, the refusal to  supply the F-16 planes is a totally unjustifiable action,  because under a business deal Pakistan has paid for them and the  U.S. Government is obligated to supply the planes. Talbott  announced that no extraordinary importance would be given to  India among the countries of South Asia. We hope the U.S.  Government posture will fully conform to this claim.</p>

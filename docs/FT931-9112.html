			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Tokyo's quick fix THE JAPANESE government is engaged in a substantial effort to support the Tokyo stock market through widespread government intervention in the financial sector. Its motives are understandable - the level of the stock market is a central determinant of the health of the Japanese economy. But this intervention looks increasingly misguided. The longer the authorities prevent the market from finding its own level, the longer Japan's financial institutions will have to wait before recovery arrives. Japan's stockbrokers are suffering because they are still geared up for the glory years of the late 1980s. Daily average trading volumes on the Tokyo stock market have fallen from a peak of 1,021m shares in 1988 to less than 200m shares at the end of last year. New issues have dried up. Buoyant share prices are not only in the interests of Tokyo's stockbrokers. Japanese banks, in the face of mounting bad debts from property loans which have turned sour, must pass the Bank of International Settlement's capital adequacy ratios at the end of this March. But a large share of their reserves is made up of unrealised gains on their equity portfolios. The fortunes of other financial institutions are also closely tied to share prices. Many smaller insurance companies have virtually no unrealised capital gains left on their equities. They would be desperately short of reserves to pay bonuses to policy holders if equities were to fall further. Yet a fall in equities is now a real danger. The Nikkei index is drifting listlessly around 17,000. Companies are eyeing the close of their financial year at the end of March. With a fourth consecutive year of declining profits looming for most of them, the sale of shareholdings has become a common tool to boost profits. But a selling spree before March would threaten the banks' chances of meeting the BIS standards. Little wonder that the government has succumbed to the temptation to try to place a floor under the Nikkei around the 16,000 level. By providing the trust banks with the necessary funds from the public sector postal savings system, the government has become just about the only domestic purchaser of equities. The Ministry of Finance has also exploited its considerable influence over the financial services industry by encouraging insurance companies and other financial institutions not to sell shares before the end of March. Banks are also being discouraged from selling equities. Yet the government is buying time at the expense of savers and taxpayers while casting doubt on the government's commitment to financial liberalisation. None of the government's ruses can disguise the underlying reason for the market's thin trading - that, with the Nikkei trading on about 55 times earnings, the market still looks high. There is a better alternative. The Tokyo stock market should be allowed to fall to a level that bears some reasonable relationship to the level of returns in the rest of the world. In order to prevent a fall in share prices provoking a systemic financial collapse, the Bank of Japan should follow the precedent of America's handling of its savings and loans crisis. It should guarantee to provide direct financial assistance to the banks and insurance companies, which will inevitably suffer as their unrealised equity gains evaporate and the underlying balance sheet malaise is exposed. Only then will investors return to the market, volumes pick up and brokers start to make some money. The government's current attempt to prevent a crisis at any significant financial institution risks distorting Japan's financial markets for years to come. It makes little sense to use the money of ordinary savers to defy financial gravity. The time for such manipulation is past.</p>

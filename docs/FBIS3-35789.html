			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo February 1 TASS -- A three-sided forum on  security in the Northern Pacific with the participation of  representatives from Russia, the United States and Japan opened  here on Tuesday [1 February].    "A political basis for the forum was laid during Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan in October last year.  The forum will consider practically the entire range of matters  concerning the situation in the Asia-Pacific region and measures  to build confidence among the three countries," Colonel-General  Andrey Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of Russia's frontier  forces, told ITAR-TASS. The general arrived here to participate  in the consultations.    This forum is being held as an unofficial meeting at which  no  official agreements will be adopted and no statements issued.  The principal purpose of the forum is to enable experts and  government representatives of the three countries to exchange  views frankly in a confidential atmosphere on the complex  problem of ensuring stability and security in the region and map  out ways to establish effective three-sided cooperation in this  respect, the need for which Washington, Moscow and Tokyo have  come to realise.    Konstantin Sarkisov, deputy director of the Russian Academy  of Sciences' Institute of Oriental Studies and member of the  Russian delegation, in an ITAR-TASS interview, described the  forum as a "sign of the times", pointing out that the time has  come to make multilateral efforts to ensure security in the  Asia-Pacific region.    To Russia, the Tokyo forum is of particular importance, the  expert said. His opinion is that the forum may become a regular  one and in due course turn into a permanently functioning  three-sided commission of representatives of the three countries.    On the Russian delegation are also Gennadiy Burbulis, a  deputy to the State Duma, Vladimir Zhurbenko, first deputy chief  of the General Staff, Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov,  Academician Aleksandr Yakovlev, and Vladlen Martynov, director  of the Institute for the World Economy and International  Relations.    The United States and Japan are represented at the forum by  a  large group of experts and officials, among them Graham Allison,  a prominent expert on Russia and U.S. assistant secretary of  defence, and Hiroshi Fukuda, Japanese deputy minister of foreign  affairs.</p>

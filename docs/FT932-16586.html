			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Offering packaging for many new owners - The forthcoming Pounds 70m flotation of RPC Containers HAVING four owners in six years might be enough for any company. But RPC Containers, which has enjoyed that distinction, is looking to bring in yet more new owners with a flotation, likely to value the rigid plastics packaging group at around Pounds 70m. Its current owner is a venture capital backed management buy-out arranged only two years ago. The float is expected in the early summer, beating internal expectations of the earliest date for flotation. The business was originally put together by Reed International in the days when it was in paper and packaging as well as in publishing. Reed bought two businesses, in 1983 and 1986, and built two factories, giving a total of five plants. But in 1988 Reed decided to focus on publishing and a buy-out of the European paper and packaging side, under the name Reedpack, was arranged. Reedpack succumbed to a take over by Svenska Cellulosa of Sweden in 1990. SCA decided to concentrate on paper and paper-based packaging so once again RPC was up for sale. The mbo beat trade buyers with a bid of Pounds 33.4m. SCA agreed to defer 40 per cent of the purchase price for three years, taking Pounds 13.5m of dividend free preference shares. The float ought to raise more than enough to redeem Pounds 21.5m of preference shares, including SCA's. Some of the existing shareholders may use the chance to top-slice their investments. Despite the regular ownership changes, the operating management of the company has seen surprising continuity with many directors dating back to Reed days. RPC, which cannot use the Reed name, has flourished in the last two years. Despite a sluggish market for packaging, says Mr Ron Marsh, chief executive, its volumes have risen by 28 per cent over the period. Products range from packaging for motor oil to orange juice, paint to pills, and tomato ketchup to baby wipes. It is aiming to expand in higher margin areas such as packaging for health and beauty products. RPC is especially proud of a stone-look plastic cider flagon. Working with customers on designing new packaging - often part of their marketing strategy for a product - can be the key to winning business, and improving margins. Operating profits have risen from Pounds 2.8m in the year to end March 1991 to Pounds 5m in 1991-92 and are likely to show another significant rise in the year just ended. Cash generation has been impressive too. The buy-out started life with Pounds 12m of debt but when the latest accounts are published that should have reduced that to only Pounds 1m or so. The five-year loan set up at the time of the buy-out was paid off before the end of the 1991-92 financial year. Significantly, it was repaid from trading not from asset sales. Furthermore, RPC has been able to finance capital spending and make three acquisitions totalling between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m. One drawback might be the heavy reliance on the UK. But Mr Marsh has plans to expand in Europe. Exports are modest, he says, but growing fast. But what RPC really needs is a manufacturing base there, and that will have to be acquired. Polymer prices could be another worry, as they represent about 30 per cent of turnover. These have been weak over the last two years and may now be set to rise again. Increasingly RPC has contracts with customers linking selling prices to raw material costs, automatically passing on increases. There are no directly comparable companies on the stock market, so RPC's arrival is likely to generate interest.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LA REINA ROUTS BISHOP DIEGO BEHIND PERFECT GAME, 37-0  </P> <P> La Reina High crushed Bishop Diego, 37-0, Thursday in a Tri-Valley League  softball game at Bishop Diego that was shortened to five innings because of a  10-run rule.  </P> <P> Freshman right-hander Michelle St. Pierre pitched a perfect game and the  Regents (7-3, 2-0 in league play), who scored 15 runs in the third inning,  collected 18 hits and capitalized on 22 walks and 11 errors by Bishop Diego  (3-3, 0-1).  </P> <P> Last season, La Reina hammered Bishop Diego, 41-1, in a game featuring a 23-run  inning.  </P> <P> "I feel good about the pitching and defense, but the rest of it. . . . It  doesn't do you any good," La Reina Coach Don Hyatt said. "How do you say,  'Congratulations, you played a nice game' ?"  </P> <P> St. Pierre (3-2) was four for five with five runs batted in and five runs  scored. Carolyn Russo was four for six with five RBIs and four runs scored.  Sheri Sisco hit a three-run home run in the third inning.  </P></p>

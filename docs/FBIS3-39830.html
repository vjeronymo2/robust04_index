On board the aircraft carrier Foch, which is patrolling the  Adriatic and where he spent the previous night, Defense Minister  Leotard attended the arrival on Sunday, 20 February in Istrana  -- a base located 60 km northeast of Vicence (Italy) -- of six  French Mirage 2000-D aircraft for low altitude all-weather  attack. These aircraft belong to the 3d squadron at Nancy and  have been in service for less than a year. This is the first  time that such aircraft have left French territory. They will  reinforce NATO's allied surveillance and intervention force over  Bosnia.    Originally, the Mirage 2000-D was not scheduled to join the  armada of French fighter aircraft to be used in the air fleet  placed under NATO command for carrying out UN missions.    At the Cervia base, some 200 km south of Venice, France  already maintains eight Jaguar attack planes, which are not  all-weather aircraft; 10 Mirage 2000-C air defense interceptors;  five Mirage F1-CR reconnaissance planes; and five Mirage F1-CT  ground support aircraft. All in all, the allies currently have  some 210 fighter aircraft, 76 of which are American, in Italy  and the Adriatic.    Mirage 2000-D's were kept in reserve in the south of France.  Late last week the decision was made to have them fly out of  their base in Istres (Bouches-du-Rhone) to have them land in  front of Mr. Leotard in Istrana, before stationing them  permanently in Cervia, which is just a 45-minute flight from  Sarajevo.    Like the latest American aircraft -- the F-15, eight of  which  are based in Aviano -- the Mirage 2000-D is able to navigate and  accurately fire ammunition (to within 10 or 100 meters,  depending on the coordinates it receives) in all types of  weather, night or day, whether conventional or laser-guided  (Footnote 1) (Very low-altitude firing, which is done via visual  identification of the target, requires the presence on the  ground of guidance officers who help the aircraft's crew adjust  firing. Atmospheric conditions (low clouds, overcast, snow) and  rough terrain can cause momentary difficulty.).    With its newly arrived Mirage 2000-D, France has now  deployed  some 68 airplanes and helicopters, including the 18  Super-Etendard attack helicopters on board the Foch.  <H5>  Infrared Spy Cameras </H5>   The arrival in Italy of the Mirage 2000-D's is not the only  indicator of the increase in French military power to the  benefit, either directly or indirectly, to UN troops in Bosnia.  There are others, which are more discreet but no less real.    Thus, it is expected that 12 new Sagaie tanks fitted with  90-mm guns will bolster the 18 already present in Sarajevo and  placed by France under the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  colors. Similarly, there is talk of bringing 10 French Gazelle  and Puma helicopters to the Bosnian capital, which have long  been based in Split (Croatia). These helicopters are equipped  with infrared cameras and should play an important role in  reconnoitering the location of batteries and the movements of  units around Sarajevo.    Lastly, since Friday, 18 February the French have had two  Cymbeline radar tracking units -- like the British, who have  three -- which make it possible to track the path of a shell  from where it was fired and identify who fired it. The  Americans, who are refraining from risking the lives of any GI's  on the ground, will not put these radars into service so as not  to expose their operators. The French reinforcement does not  mean, however, that extra UN troops will be deployed in  Sarajevo. If there were to be any, they would be taken from the  French contingents in Bihac and Croatia.</p>

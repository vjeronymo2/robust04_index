			<p>BFN     [Text] The 290 kg of crystallized cocaine that National  Narcotics Directorate (Dinar) personnel recently seized in  Vallemi is allegedly linked to the ongoing exchange of  Paraguayan cattle for high-grade Bolivian cocaine.    Police sources released this information yesterday, adding  that the backgrounds of several local cattle breeders are  currently under investigation.    It is assumed that the cocaine is being brought into  Paraguay  and exchanged for cattle, preferably cows capable of surviving  and reproducing in the Bolivian climate, so as to replenish  Bolivia's cattle stock.    Drug enforcement agents arrested Paraguayans Victoriano  Gomez, 41, ID card No. 2,919,135; and Juan Albino Frutos, 44, a  tradesman born in Bahia Negra, ID card No. 1,788,598.    The two were carrying 20 kg of crystallized cocaine en route  to Europe, where the black market value of the shipment is over  $20 million.    Initial reports indicated that the discovery and seizure of  the narcotics was possible thanks to information that the U.S.  Embassy in Asuncion supplied to Dinar.    According to rumors, the U.S. Embassy received encrypted  information on this affair via satellite from the Department of  State in Washington, following an investigation ordered by the  Pentagon.    Reliable sources have indicated that the Clinton  administration is closely following South American drug  enforcement programs, especially in Bolivia and Paraguay, an  area which is considered to be "of interest for the security of  the United States."    It would seem that the recent seizure in Vallemi awakened a  great deal of interest among Washington officials because the  "cattle meat" connection is involved, sources close to the case  said.    Meanwhile, Dinar sources have been saying that the seizure  in  Vallemi was the result of patient investigations carried out in  Fuerte Olimpo and Bahia Negra.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPILLING THE BEANS  </P> <P> Question: Only a short while ago I never would have believed some of the foods  that are being recommended today as part of a healthy diet. I always used to  think that pasta and potatoes had to be avoided, but now I can understand that  these are nutritious foods. Now I see that beans have become a kind of glamour  food. Is this just a fad, or do beans belong in the average diet?  </P> <P> Answer: Beans are a nutritious food that have the added advantage of providing  a great deal of fiber. They also lend themselves to being served in combination  with a variety of animal foods, such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, milk and  cheese, as well as with non-animal foods, such as peas and lentils. These  combinations provide a complete protein.  </P> <P> Still another advantage is that beans are an economical food, a consideration  that cannot be ignored. Furthermore, they do not contain unwanted fat or salt.  </P> <P> One of the criticisms often heard about beans is that they cause gas. While  this is true, this effect can be reduced by adding beans to the diet gradually,  as well as by the manner in which they are prepared.  </P></p>

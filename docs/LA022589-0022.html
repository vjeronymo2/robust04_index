			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITH RAVELING, USC BASKETBALL PROGRAM CONTINUES TO UNRAVEL  </P> <P> I like George Raveling. Always have. I admired his incredible success in that  remote outpost, Washington State.  </P> <P> But when Raveling charges that criticisms of his USC program are racially  motivated, well, it shows that George is losing more than just ballgames.  </P> <P> Within weeks of Raveling's arrival at USC, he forced three blue-chip players,  two of whom are black, out of USC's basketball program. During his tenure, USC  is 25-57, has finished in the cellar for two consecutive years, lost 13  consecutive games this season and is a lock for finishing in the basement for  the third year in a row. Bob Boyd, coaching year after year against John  Wooden, was 216-131 at USC.  </P> <P> One more thing. Despite John Thompson's Olympic setback, he has proved year in  and year out that he can recruit and coach. But if Walt Hazzard is Raveling's  idea of a great coach, he soon may join him on the sideline.  </P> <P> TOM LALLAS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

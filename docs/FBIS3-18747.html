			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Johanna Korhonen and Hannu Sokala: "Suddenly </F> Last Fall"]    [Text] The small stimulus package announced on Friday [4  February] by the nonsocialist government of Esko Aho (Center  Party) raised embarrassing questions. During the whole bleak  recession, the government has repeated over and over that it  would not undertake to "stimulate through borrowing." Now the  government announces that the recession is over and at the same  time starts to stimulate the economy through borrowing.    The government's attitude toward stimulation changed  suddenly  last fall. The government justifies its conversion by the  achievement of equilibrium in the balance of payments or by the  fact that Finland no longer is incurring debt abroad overall.  The change in the balance of payments to a surplus, however, was  not a surprise at all, nor did the government in addition  promise before last fall to turn its sleigh when the balance of  payments changed. Iiro Viinanen, the minister of finance  (Conservative), and Aho rejected stimulation through borrowing  once and for all as impossible.    "There is reason to emphasize that a disciplined fiscal  policy has not been just a slogan for the government, but rather  a choice that constitutes one of the central anchors of a  credible economic policy," Viinanen said when presenting the  government's 1994 budget proposal last fall.    In October Viinanen said that an "unconditional no" must be  said to support for investment that occurs through additional  borrowing. Viinanen was absent from the Friday news conference  at which the government presented the supplementary budget  implementing the stimulus package.    The real reasons for the government's change of direction  can  only be guessed. Perhaps the government has come to the position  that record unemployment will not improve of its own accord.  Perhaps the hawks are getting the upper hand over the doves in  the government. Perhaps the Conservatives and the Center Party  have begun to fear for their support before the spring Eduskunta  elections.    One would like to think that announcing the stimulus  projects  two days before the second round of the presidential elections  was pure chance, although Elisabeth Rehn (Swedish Peoples  Party), the minister of defense, stubbornly defended the  government policy in her campaign. The government would not have  the gall to play games with so serious matters, would it?    The Finance Ministry opposed stimulation up to last fall,  because it believed that stimulation would deepen the  government's long-term indebtedness and stop the reduction in  interest rates. The interest rate fear seems to have been  unnecessary; interest rates continued to fall after the  government announced the beginning of stimulation through  borrowing.    The government may have delayed the beginning of stimulation  also to keep the labor market organizations and the Eduskunta  under control last fall. Planned gloominess promoted arriving at  income solutions that suited the government and budget  deliberations in the manner desired by the government.    Finnish economic policy has traditionally reinforced  business  cycles: Through government measures declines have been deepened  and booms heated up. This time too the beginning of stimulation  has gone awry from the standpoint of breaking up the recession.  When presenting the stimulus package on Friday, Aho himself said  that the recession had ended already in the last quarter of last  year.</p>

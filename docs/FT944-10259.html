			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Personal View: Sweden must vote Yes for influence On Sunday, Sweden votes on whether to join the European Union. If the majority is against, it will remain a member of the European Economic Area, the free-trade zone that links the EU with members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta). The vote is too close to call. But there is a danger that an indecisive and insecure electorate is poised to vote No by a close margin, fearing a Yes vote will change Sweden for the worse and unaware that it will help change Europe for the better. If Swedes appreciate influence on matters that affect them, they will vote Yes. The EEA provides the Efta countries with little influence. The common administrative and decision-making institutions proposed when the EEA was first negotiated have never materialised. EEA rules are in reality determined by the EU's decision-making procedures. The Efta countries face a constant stream of legislation from Brussels, which they are obliged to take on board without much say in its development if the EEA is to remain homogeneous. In the words of the Swedish prime minister, Ingvar Carlsson, the formal sovereignty of Sweden in the EEA is the sovereignty of the powerless. Becoming a full EU member would increase Sweden's influence over EU legislation. And even though a small country prepared to pool sovereignty in such a union runs the risk of being outvoted, EU voting procedures give such countries relatively large influence. While Sweden would have four out of 90 votes in the Council of Ministers of an enlarged union, Germany, with a population nine times larger, would have only 10 votes. If both Sweden and Norway follow Finland into the EU, the four Nordic countries would have 13 votes, more than not only Germany, but the UK and Italy too. Further, each country has a veto on questions determined by unanimity. On questions decided by qualified majority, a small number of countries can block a decision. A small country can be influential if it builds winning coalitions. One argument for a No vote is that EU membership will bring few economic benefits, above those of membership of the EEA. This overlooks the economic dividends of greater influence on legislation and the increased investment in Sweden that membership would generate. Sweden's public debt and deficits are among the largest in Europe. If it joins the EU it would be encouraged to reduce both to meet economic convergence programmes. A reduction in the deficit would help lessen the damaging differential between long-term interest rates in Sweden and in Germany - now running at four percentage points. Lower interest rates and the certainty that future EU rules would apply in Sweden would also generate an investment boom. This would help the unemployed and the young - as new entrants to the labour market - by reducing unemployment, now running at 13 per cent of the labour force. Public sector employees, mainly women, would also benefit, since the sector's current size can be maintained only if Sweden's industrial base is strengthened. Yet, as the referendum approaches, wishful thinking has flourished to avoid facing the hard choices. Some contend that if Swedes vote against membership, it would be possible to renegotiate the EEA agreement to gain greater influence over legislation. This seems unlikely. The European Court of Justice struck down the only common institution in the EEA agreement, the proposed EEA Court, as unconstitutional. And the Efta countries' negotiating power is less than when the EEA was negotiated, partly because the political will to accommodate them has diminished, and partly because there could soon be only two or three Efta members left in the EEA. Others, recalling the first Danish referendum over Maastricht, argue that a No vote on Sunday would make it possible for Sweden to renegotiate its accession agreement. However, Denmark was already a member of the EU with a veto over the Maastricht treaty that gave it a strong negotiating position. A Swedish No vote would be similar to the Swiss rejection of entry to the EEA in 1992. A debt-burdened Sweden on the periphery of Europe can ill afford to be an outsider. Finally, some have argued for a No vote to give the country space to make the final decision in a few years' time. But to stand by and watch other countries - including Sweden's closest neighbours - shaping the EU would be to miss a golden opportunity. EU members will hold an intergovernmental conference in 1996 to shape foreign, security and defence policies, relations with eastern Europe, agricultural and fisheries policies, and economic and monetary union. Now, if ever, is the time to join the EU. The author is chief economist of the Federation of Swedish Industries</p>

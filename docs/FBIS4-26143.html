			<p>BFN     [Text] Manila, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Philippine Vice  President Joseph Estrada left here this morning for Beijing on a  nine-day official visit to China at the invitation of Chinese  Vice President Rong Yiren.    The vice president told XINHUA at the airport that he hopes  his first visit to China will help cement closer relations  between the two countries, particularly in cultural and economic  fields.    During his stay in China, he said, the two sides are  expected  to sign a cultural agreement.    Estrada was born in Manila on April 19, 1937. As a former  action movie star, he is very popular in the country.    He was chosen as one of the "ten outstanding young men in  public administration" in 1972.    Having been the mayor of San Juan for 16 years, he was  elected senator in 1987 and became vice president in 1992.  Subsequently, he was designed by President Ramos as chairman of  the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Ovcharenko and Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin commentary under </F> the "Our Commentary" rubric: "Nixon Persona Non Grata to  Kremlin"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The Russian Federation  president said that "Nixon has met with Rutskoy and Zyuganov but  the most interesting thing was that he had come to meet with  me." After this, Boris Yeltsin noted, "I will not meet with  Nixon, and neither the government nor Filatov will receive him."  [passage omitted]    Let us try to examine what is happening through the eyes of  Moscow officials. Were the amendments which Viktor Chernomyrdin  and the Russian Federation president himself caused to be made  to Nixon's program evidence of nascent "Great Russian pride"?  Maybe, we have become more discriminating and will not now  simply rush off and welcome with open arms both overt and covert  emissaries from the across the ocean? There is no disputing  that not all politicians like sharing the stage with  Zhirinovskiy and his crew.    But in that case we are still showing the same political  clumsiness through which we are constantly causing blunders in  our relations with the United States. We have clearly chosen  the wrong time and place to show our dissatisfaction. The  opposition is something sacred in a democracy, and it would be  bad form to snub some well-known person on a well-known mission  -- unorthodox though it may be to us -- for the sole reason that  Washington has woken up to the fact that it had gotten a  fixation with its favorite political figures and has decided to  broaden its official appointments book.</p>

Of the total, 3,444  tons are allocated to fishing in the Pacific side and 1,375 tons  to the Sea of Japan side, Japanese officials said.    Japan's quota in Russia's 200-mile zone is yet to be  decided.  Russia offered 14,000 tons, 1,000 tons less than in the previous  year. Japan and Russia will continue negotiating on the private  level, the officials said.    Japan agreed to pay 759 million yen to Russia in return for  its 1994 fishing, unchanged from the previous year, they said.    The two countries negotiate annually about the quota of  those  fish which grow up in rivers in Russia and come out to the  ocean, as well as on the fund payment for fishing by Japan.</p>

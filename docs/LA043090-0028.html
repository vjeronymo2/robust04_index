			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TODAY AT AFI FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are The Times' recommendations for today's schedule of the American  Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival (AFIFEST), with  commentary by the film reviewing staff.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213) 520-2000.  </P> <P> Recommended:  </P> <P> "THE CONDUCTOR"(France-Belgium, 1989; Director: Marion Hansel. Century Plaza 2,  7 p.m.) Exquisitely wrought meditation on the nature of identity, involving  guilt and responsibility, with a classical music background. The acting is  wonderful: including Malcolm McDowell's best performance in years. As in many  international co-productions, though, the mix of nationalities may unsettle  some audiences. (Kevin Thomas).  </P></p>

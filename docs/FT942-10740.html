			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: London An already glum gilt-edged market is unlikely to receive much support from tomorrow's Bank of England inflation report, while the fall-out from last week's UK local elections is expected to deter investors. Mr John Shepperd, chief economist of Yamaichi International in London, believes there is enough medium-term anxiety about inflation for the Bank to adopt a cautionary tone. In particular, the recent slight acceleration in pay increases could encourage the Bank to emphasise longer-term inflationary risks. The market's attention could shift to funding arithmetic by the end of week, Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, believes. Although this year's PSBR will be lower than the Pounds 46bn of 1993-94, political uncertainty and medium-term inflation worries make a repeat of last year's heavy Pounds 23bn foreign gilt purchases an unlikely bet at present. The Bank's next auction announcement is due on Friday. With the yield curve abnormally steep (the 10-year benchmark bond ended last week yielding 8.21 per cent against base rates of 5.25 per cent), Mr Shepperd believes the Bank may opt for another floating-rate issue. A convertible with an option to convert from a short to a long gilt would be another way to overcome current uncertainties.</p>

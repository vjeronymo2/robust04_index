			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (12): Gadgetry of excellence - Computers and controls play a bigger role THE CURRENT emphasis on reducing costs and increasing efficiency in power generation, and the technological transformation of the industry caused by gas turbines, are presenting new opportunities for suppliers of monitoring equipment and computer-based facilities management systems. Inevitably, the privatisation of Britain's electricity industry has meant that many of the most significant developments in this field are happening in the UK - or are casting UK companies in a lead role. Last month for example, the European Commission awarded a major project to a consortium led by Intelligent Applications, a Scottish-based software company, to develop the next generation of fault diagnosis and prediction systems for gas turbines. The Pounds 2.8m Tiger project is supported by the EC's Esprit Programme. It involves six companies, including Exxon Chemicals' Fife ethylene plant and John Brown Engineering in Glasgow. According to Dr Robert Milne, managing director of Intelligent Applications, the project will develop the world's most advanced gas turbine monitoring and diagnosis system, through the application of knowledge-based systems and artificial intelligence. Gas turbines are highly complex pieces of equipment, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify developing faults and understand the cause of any current problems or alarms. The project, says the Scottish company, will use advanced modelling techniques to predict failures that even the best human experts are not able to anticipate. A different approach is taken by Beran Instruments, a Devon-based company which 18 months ago launched a condition monitoring system developed in conjunction with the UK power industry. This uses sensitive transducers to establish the rate of change of vibration, enabling engineers to predict when a piece of plant needs maintenance. Mr Tim Salter, Beran's sales manager, says the UK market for such systems has exploded over the past year. But not all the innovations are UK-based. Another recent development, announced in May by the New Jersey-based Micron Instrument Company, is a temperature monitoring instrument package designed to detect infra-red emission from exit gases in power generating plants. The system is based on Mikron's M67 Transducer, which converts the infra-red reading into an electrical signal proportional to the temperature reading of the gases. The aim is to increase efficiency, allowing operators to keep the gas temperature below the ash level and determine whether soot blowing is needed to maintain efficient heat transfer from gases to the boiler. According to Mikron, the advantage of the system is that the instrument does not come in contact with hot gases, due to its ability to read temperatures from its fixed position on a standard observation door. Another US development, launched into the European market last year by Detector Electronics, is a range of flame scanners for large industrial and utility boilers. The company's new all-fuel self-checking flame scanner eliminates the need for separate ultra-violet and infra-red scanners in burner management systems. Away from the power generation process itself, information technology companies such as Isicad, a Wokingham-based facilities, cabling and communication systems management company, are increasingly promoting the need for utilities to manage their computers and controls better. Over the past 20 years, utilities' computer installations have tended to grow like Topsy, with insufficient attention paid to the wiring that interconnects successive generations of equipment - in buildings that rapidly run out of space and require redevelopment to house the next generation of computers. Consequently, identifying hundreds of miles of wiring can be a mammoth task. Over the past three years, Isicad has been working for Southern Electric on the phased installation of a facilities management system which enables the utility to model on screen its computer rooms, with all the associated wiring and connections, to accuracies of less than a centimetre. For Southern Electric, privatisation has increased the need for competitiveness, requiring responsiveness to the market place and internal efficiency. This has prompted a pro-active approach to innovations such as the Isicad system, but also ensured that every step of its installation has been ruthlessly examined in cost terms. Mr John Anderson, Isicad's managing director, believes the opportunities for systems such as Isicad in the power generation business are immense. 'What is important is that managements are buying into this system, and are asking themselves what they have to do to be more competitive.'</p>

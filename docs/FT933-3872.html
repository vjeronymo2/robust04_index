			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Customs climbs down on VAT plan HM CUSTOMS and Excise has backed down over proposals which would have prevented many holding companies from reclaiming value added tax. The department had proposed in a consultation paper issued last October that holding companies owning operating subsidiaries would no longer be entitled to recover VAT incurred on 'basic business activities' such as fees paid to professionals. Customs yesterday abandoned this proposal saying that it now planned to make only minor changes to the existing system from October this year. The reversal follows intensive lobbying from businesses and professional bodies. The proposals were based on an interpretation of a ruling by the European Court of Justice on a holding company called Polysar. Initially due to be introduced in April, they were delayed until this October pending further consultation. Objections included representations from a Pounds 125,000 lobbying campaign by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, paid for by 17 companies. Customs stressed that there are still minor changes. Companies which are not active trading companies, not grouped with active trading subsidiaries or which do not provide genuine management services to trading subsidiaries will not be able to claim VAT refunds. Customs said: 'We are a fairly pragmatic department and don't want to put extra burdens on business.'</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BSM sees operating profits of Pounds 4.55m BSM GROUP, which is coming to the market later this month, yesterday forecast operating profits for 1993 of Pounds 4.55m in its pathfinder prospectus. Last year operating profits were Pounds 4.11m on turnover of Pounds 21m. The group owns the British School of Motoring, one of the largest franchisers in the UK, with 15 per cent of the driving school market. It operates through 134 branches spread from Aberdeen to Plymouth, and has 2,000 self-employed instructors. Pre-tax profits are forecast at Pounds 880,000 after payment of interest on debt arising from the Pounds 40m management buy-out of the company in 1990. Mr Paul Massey, chief executive, said yesterday that without the interest payments pre-tax profits would be Pounds 4.35m. Money raised in the flotation, which is expected to give the group a market capitalisation of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m, will be used to repay the debt and help to fund expansion. 'I want to leave the group ungeared on flotation,' Mr Massey said. The prospectus also shows that the group expects a 75 per cent tax charge for 1993. This is a one-off cost, arising mainly from planning measures being taken in relation to capital allowances on the tuition vehicle fleet. From 1994 the charge should drop to about 25 per cent. The new shares will be placed with institutions and offered through intermediaries. Impact day is on Thursday October 14. The offer closes at noon on October 21. Morgan Grenfell is sponsoring the flotation and James Capel are brokers. At the time of flotation Morgan Grenfell Development Capital Partners will own 70 per cent of the shares and the family of Sir Anthony Jacobs, the former owner, 20 per cent. The balance will be held by the 21-strong management team. No directors are selling any shares.</p>

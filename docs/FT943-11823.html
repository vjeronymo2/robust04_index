			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Pounds 100m levy proposed on packaging tofund waste recycling Proposals for a Pounds 100m levy on packaging were put forward yesterday to pay for a nationwide scheme to recycle packaging waste. The levy would be paid by manufacturers and users of packaging material, but would be passed on to the consumer, who would pay about 1p more for every Pounds 10 of purchases. The plan comes in a long-awaited report by Sir Sydney Lipworth in response to a request by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, that industry find ways of recovering between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of waste by the year 2000. Sir Sydney, a former chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, is an adviser to the Producer Responsibility Group, an alliance of packaging and manufacturing companies and retailers which is putting together a waste recycling plan. His report recommends that all big users of packaging as well as wholesalers and retailers should be registered. The registered users, known as packers and fillers, would be liable for the levy. Manufacturers and importers of packaging who sold to unregistered users would be liable themselves. Retailers and wholesalers would not be liable for the levy where it was already included in the price of the packaging. Sir Sydney says that there should be provisions to prevent value added tax being charged on the levy. The plan envisages that waste would be collected by organisations representing the various types of packaging materials. They would seek the best way of recovering value from the waste, whether by recycling or by using it as a fuel. The recycling would be financed by the proceeds of the levy, which would also be used to help prime markets for recovered packaging. The plan is designed to recycle about 58 per cent of UK packaging waste. There will be a six-week consultation before the proposals are presented to the Department of the Environment. If they are acceptable to Mr Gummer, legislation will be brought forward. Last night the British Retail Consortium, representing 90 per cent of the retail industry, said it welcomed the report.</p>

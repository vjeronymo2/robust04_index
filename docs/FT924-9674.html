			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentine farmers in free market protest ARGENTINA'S farmers yesterday ended a 48-hour lockout to protest against the government's free market policies, which they claim threaten the survival of small and medium-sized farms. Three farmers' groups representing the majority of Argentina's 300,000 farmers on Monday stopped shipping cattle and grain to market, although they maintained deliveries of perishable produce such as milk and vegetables. Mr Osvaldo Sarachu, an economist at Coninagro, a farm co-operative umbrella organisation, said 'the government's policies are bankrupting small and medium farms by forcing them to adjust without providing adequate credit'. But Mr Marcelo Regunaga, agriculture and fisheries secretary, said the protest 'will not have any effect on the government's economic policy'. Farmers are already heavily indebted but are unable to refinance their loans at reasonable terms. Mr Sarachu said banks only lend for a maximum 210 days at high interest rates of 18 per cent a year in dollar terms. He admitted, however, that Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister was trying to improve farmers' profitability. Last week the government abolished an 18 per cent fuel tax and reduced other federal taxes. That should raise farm revenues by about USDollars 450m a year. If promised reductions in provincial taxes were implemented, farmers would double that gain. However, farmers' incomes are being squeezed by inflation of 20 per cent a year, an overvalued exchange rate and the US-EC subsidy war that depresses international prices. Unrest over the costs of economic adjustment and falling incomes is rising throughout Argentina. The CGT trade union confederation has called a general strike for next Monday.</p>

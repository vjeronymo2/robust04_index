The editorial reads in part:    We still have to overcome many weaknesses and shortcomings.  Nonetheless, those important achievements have created new  opportunities and premises for us to gradually lead the country  to a new development stage and accelerate the national  industrialization and modernization program a step further. Our  country is facing great challenges, namely, the danger of left  farther behind economically compared with many countries in the  region and other parts of the world, the danger of deviating  from the socialist path in case we fail to overcome  irregularities in direction for implementation, the very serious  development of corruption and bureaucracy, and the hostile  forces' peaceful evolution strategy and maneuvers. We have  great opportunities but also face great challenges.    In reflecting the will of the entire party, the conference  maintained that we have the possibility and determination to  grasp opportunities and overcome challenges. It maintained that  we are resolved to motivate the entire party, people, and army  to display single-mindedness, make outstanding efforts, heighten  the spirit of independence and self-sufficiency and self-help,  broaden international cooperation, practice frugality, instill  honesty, uphold righteousness, make every effort to exploit  advantages, eliminate dangers, overcome challenges, and  successfully materialize the general goals set by the Seventh  Party Congress. The conference is also resolved to accelerate  the implementation of the objectives of the socioeconomic  stablization and development strategy for the period till the  year 2000, and to strive to turn into reality the goals of  making the people rich and the country powerful and to bring  about justice and civilization in society.    The conference stressed the need to effect economic  restructuring to serve the industrialization and modernization  goals. From now until the end of the decade, let us pay special  attention to the industrialization and modernization program to  benefit agriculture and the rural economy. As the conference  put it, this program is part of the key tasks for the days  ahead. This is the way for our country to overcome the danger  of being left farther behind compared with the neighboring  countries, to maintain political stability and social order,  safeguard national independence and sovereignty, and persist in  the socialist path.    To this end, we must adopt uniform measures to carry out the  multisectorial economic development policy and create even more  favorable conditions for the different economic sectors and  business establishments to develop quickly and achieve high  results. It is necessary to form a uniform market mechanism  under state management that is in accordance with socialist  orientations. It is important to pay due attention to social  and cultural issues as well as consolidate national defense and  security capabilities. Continued efforts must be made to  broaden diplomatic relations and build a law-governed Vietnamese  state which belongs to, comes from, and works for the people so  as to make the country advance quickly and firmly under all  circumstances.    Speaking at the Midterm National Party Conference, Comrade  General Secretary Do Muoi said: Lying ahead of us is a new era  full of bright prospects, great challenges that we must be  resolved to overcome, and favorable opportunities that we must  exploit to the full extent.    To seize opportunities and overcome ordeals, our party must  upgrade itself in proportion to its tasks. It must be renovated  and rectified. Ties between the party and the people must be  consolidated. We must ensure political and ideological unity  within the party, that party cadres and members are thoroughly  aware of party concepts and policy lines, that they improve  their knowledge and persist on their path toward socialism, and  that all party organizations and every party cadre and member  can creatively apply and develop Marxism-Leninism, Ho Chi Minh  thought, and the best contemporary ideas, and sensitively  acquire new things and correctly deal with issues that arise.    We must strengthen the unity bloc within the party, apply  various organizational principles to party activities,  especially the principle of democratic centralism, build the  party into a steadfast bloc, and be more mindful of  consolidating and strengthening grass-roots party organizations  and consolidating the close relations between the party and the  people.    We must strive to study to improve our knowledge and build  our revolutionary ethics and a wholesome lifestyle. These are  the most important things in party building. Party cadres and  members must constantly improve their knowledge and their actual  organizational abilities, associate themselves closely with the  people, scrupulously comply with party resolutions and  directives and state laws, exemplarily carry out the motto of  industry, thrift, integrity, and righteousness, and resolve to  fight wasteful spending, corruption, and illegal dealings. As  an immediate task, they must successfully carry out the  resolution of the midterm national party conference and must  take the lead in guiding the entire society in achieving the  general goals set forth by the seventh party congress for the  period until 1995. This means overcoming difficulties and  ordeals, stabilizing and developing socioeconomic activities,  enhancing political stability, dispelling negativism and social  injustices, and basically tiding the country over the crisis in  the advance toward building a prosperous people, a powerful  country, and an equal and civilized society.</p>

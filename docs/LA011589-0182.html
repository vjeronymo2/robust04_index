			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BEL-AIR PREP SURPRISES FAITH BAPTIST, 63-53  </P> <P> There is a new force in the Delphic League.  </P> <P> Perennial power Crossroads High has been beaten by Bel-Air Prep 3 out of their  past 4 meetings. And Saturday night at home, Faith Baptist couldn't get past  Bel-Air Prep, suffering its first league loss, 63-53.  </P> <P> Faith Baptist (11-3, 3-1 in league play) was without 6-10 center Jason  Henderson, who sprained his right ankle in a victory over Providence on  Tuesday. Picking up the slack was too tall an order for the Contenders.  </P> <P> "I wish he was in there," Bel-Air Coach Mike Whiting said of Henderson. "I  don't like to see a team not at full strength. But in our two league losses we  were missing two key players.  </P> <P> "This time it was our turn."  </P> <P> Taking turns on offense for Bel-Air Prep (9-7, 3-2) were Ahmad Clayton, who  scored a team-high 18 points, Jason Plazoulo (14) and Gerald Hill (13).  </P> <P> Plazoulo also enjoyed the absence of Henderson under the backboards, bringing  down a team-high 8 rebounds.  </P> <P> Faith Baptist Coach Dean Lobdell conceded that the loss of Henderson, who  averages 17 points and 13 rebounds a game, was crucial. "When Jason's in there,  it gives us those extra rebounds and closes down the middle," Lobdell said. "We  got no second shots and we had no inside game without him."  </P> <P> Bel-Air Prep took an early lead and maintained it throughout the game. The  Bruins led only 34-30 at halftime after committing a series of turnovers but  extended the advantage to 47-38 after 3 quarters.  </P> <P> Faith Baptist pulled to within 6 points early in the fourth quarter but missed  9 of 15 free throws in the period. Bel-Air Prep connected on 6 of 8 and  stretched its lead to 11.  </P> <P> Guard David Hairston led Faith Baptist with 22 points, 13 in the second half.  </P> <P> "Every night someone is going to pick us up," Whiting said. "We built intensity  in spurts and when we play together we can beat anybody."  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian 21  December 1993 carries on page 1 a short article reporting on a  conflict between Black Sea Fleet and Ukrainian navy personnel on  14 December. According to the Navy Press Center report about 20  Black Sea Fleet naval infantry, led by an officer, came to a  housing area which had some days earlier been occupied by  families of Ukrainian navy personnel. They presented residents  with the demand that they vacate the quarters and tried to enter  the building. However they were stopped with the help of four  unarmed Ukrainian sailors. The article noted the irony of this  occurrence on the same day on which Ukraine's Navy Commander  Vice-Admiral Bezkorovaynyy was meeting with First Deputy Black  Sea Fleet Commander, Vice-Admiral Larionov to discuss problems  in dividing the housing.    Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian on 19 January 1994 reports  on page 1 that Ukraine's Navy Commander, Vice-Admiral Volodymyr  Bezkorovaynyy made a trip to the Navy's Odessa and Izmayil  Garrisons. While with the Izmayil Garrison he was briefed on  combat training and the formation of a section of the Naval  Engineering Service within the garrison.    In Odessa Bezkorovaynyy met with deans and department heads  at the Odessa State Maritime Academy and the Odessa Maritime  Engineers' Institute, where training of specialist, future  officers for the navy was discussed.    Vice-Admiral Bezkorovaynyy also conversed by telephone with  Acting Black Sea Fleet Commander Larionov. Agreement was reached  on a procedure for resolving problems arising from unsanctioned  actions of certain leaders or military collectives of either  country.    Vice-Admiral Bezkorovaynyy expressed the need to work out a  bilateral document between the Ukraine's Navy and the Black Sea  Fleet to address housing, financing, energy supplies, etc. to  prevent confrontations, which would interfere with mutual  understanding and trust.</p>

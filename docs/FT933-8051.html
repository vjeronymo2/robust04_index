			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Tax rises will cost households 2% income TAX increases announced in the spring Budget and last April's switch from poll tax to council tax will cost households an average of 2 per cent of annual income by the time they are fully introduced in 1995, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies says. Concluding that the combined measures will have a 'significant impact on household living standards', Mr Christopher Giles and Mr Michael Ridge, IFS research officers, say that income losses will total 0.5 per cent for the bottom 10 per cent of households measured by income, while the top 10 per cent will experience an aver-age drop of 2.65 per cent of income. Writing in the latest issue of Fiscal Studies, an IFS publication, the two researchers say the Budget tax increases planned for the period to April 1995 will lead to both rich and poor losing a significant share of their income. However, the replacement of the poll tax by the council tax will mitigate the income losses of those with low standards of living. Although public attention has focused on the government's plans to levy value added tax on domestic fuel and power from next year, the researchers point out that the VAT change will account for only 22 per cent of the total Pounds 10.3bn increase in tax revenues which is planned by the government for 1995-96. The combined effect on income tax and National Insurance contributions will be twice as important as the VAT change. In a separate article the IFS says the government must take care to avoid another poll tax-type fiasco as water companies shift from water rates to alternative methods of charging households for water and sewerage services by the end of this decade. It points out that water charges have become a large and increasingly conspicuous item for UK households in recent years. The 1989 Water Act prohibits the use of rateable values - the basis of the UK local property taxes before 1990 - for levying water charges after the end of the century. The switch to new systems will lead to 'significant numbers of households experiencing gains or losses compared with the present system' and is likely to amplify public awareness of water charges, the IFS says. Local authorities in England collected 26 per cent of this year's expected income from the council tax in the first three months after its introduction, according to figures released yesterday by the Department of the Environment. The equivalent figure for the first year of the poll tax was only 16 per cent. Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, described them as a 'very good set of results', and added that outstanding poll tax arrears had also been reduced by 10 per cent during the same three months. The Institute of Revenue, Rating and Valuation, whose members collect the tax, said the news was encouraging, but added there was 'no room for government complacency' because transitional relief for the council tax has yet to be removed.

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Rutland associate doubles to Pounds 2.5m RUTLAND TRUST, the financial services and property surveying group, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.66m for the year to December 31. That compared with a Pounds 6.75m loss in 1991 as restated to comply with new accounting rules. However, attention was focused on Rutland's plans for Capital Industries, its 44 per cent-owned associate, which announced pre-tax profits almost doubled at Pounds 2.45m (Pounds 1.29m). Shares in Capital Industries, a financial services and industrial group, fell 10p on the day to 228p Capital Industries' profitability reflected the effect of sterling's devaluation and the acquisition of Samuel Jones, which exports more than 50 per cent of its laminated paper products, for Pounds 7m last October. The acquisition was funded by an Pounds 8.74m rights issue. Samuel Jones' high borrowings inflated interest payments to Pounds 322,000 compared with Pounds 62,000 of interest received in 1991. Borrowings have fallen since the purchase of Samuel Jones with gearing down from 75 per cent to 63 per cent. Capital Industries took an exceptional charge of Pounds 214,000 arising from the sale of loss-making polythene bag and bar accessories subsidiaries. Earnings rose to 11.8p (8.5p) and a final dividend of 2.4p gives a 4p (2p) total. A 1-for-4 scrip issue is also proposed. Rutland's 1991 loss reflected a net loss on disposal of Technology Group and Property Enterprise Managers of Pounds 4.03m and Pounds 10.9m of goodwill originally written off to reserves which must now be shown on the profit and loss account on disposal. Pre-tax profits on continuing operations were Pounds 7.06m in 1991. Turnover decreased to Pounds 93.9m (Pounds 94.6m). Earnings per share rose to 1.68p (re-stated losses per share of 4.05p). Earnings per share on continuing operations were 1.57p. The board proposes a maintained final dividend of 0.53p giving an unchanged total of 0.8p.</p>

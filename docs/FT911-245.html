			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Agencies downgrade parts of Reichmann empire PROBLEMS with tenants and subsidiaries are having a domino effect on some credit ratings of the Reich-mann brothers' business empire. Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its rating on the Reichmanns' 59 Maiden Lane in New York, citing a tenant of the big office development and the parlous state of the New York property market as problems. A USDollars 200m issue of Euro-notes due 1995 secured on 59 Maiden Lane was downgraded to A- from AA. However the agency said this did not affect Olympia and York Developments, the Reichmanns' core holding company. Moody's downgraded nearly USDollars 1bn of Gulf Canada Resources debt because of the company's poor profit prospects and declining interest coverage. The Gulf Canada senior debentures were lowered to Baa-3 from Baa-1. About USDollars 150m of short-term debt issued by a Reichmann property subsidiary in Calgary, Alta, was also downgraded because a leading leaseholder is Gulf Canada. The Reichmanns have several big resource holdings, including Gulf Canada, which operates in oil and gas developments in North America and south-east Asia.</p>

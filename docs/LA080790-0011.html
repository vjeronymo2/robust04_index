			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> Chemical giant W. R. Grace &amp; Co. has selected Vice Chairman J. P. Bolduc as  president and chief operating officer.  </P> <P> Bolduc, 51, will succeed Charles H. Erhart Jr., 65, who is retiring as  president but will continue as a director. Erhart had been president for a  little more than a year. The post of chief operating officer has been vacant  since 1986. The move appears to put Bolduc in line to succeed Chairman and CEO  J. Peter Grace should the 77-year-old chairman decide to step down.  </P></p>

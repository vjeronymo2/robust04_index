			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS QUESTION TIMETABLE FOR TROOP CUTS;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: PENTAGON CHIEF SEES THE SOVIET UNION PULLING ITS FORCES OUT OF EUROPE  BY 1995. SENATORS ARGUE THAT EVENTS CALL FOR FASTER NEGOTIATIONS.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney predicted Thursday that the Soviet Union will  withdraw all of its troops from Europe by 1995, a forecast that prompted key  Senate Democrats to question whether President Bush's new proposal for cutting  U.S. forces should be faster and deeper.  </P> <P> As the Senate Armed Services Committee opened congressional debate on reshaping  the nation's military structure, Cheney and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, were repeatedly challenged on the Administration's  troop-reduction plans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 195,000 Force Level  </P> <P> Cheney, disclosing the Pentagon's rough timetable for cuts in Europe, testified  that it may take a year or two to carry out any U.S.-Soviet agreement on the  issue.  </P> <P> Bush announced Wednesday night that he was recommending that each side cut its  combat forces in Central Europe to 195,000, with the United States allowed to  have an additional 30,000 elsewhere in Europe. Currently, the United States has  305,000 troops on the continent.  </P> <P> Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.), sharply criticizing the pace of negotiations,  declared that he would push the subcommittee he heads to legislate an immediate  reduction of 50,000 American troops in Europe and 10,000 in Korea.  </P> <P> Dixon said events are overtaking negotiations, with NATO allies West Germany  and Belgium already planning their own deep cuts and Soviet forces certain to  be kicked out by new governments in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying we should strip until we're naked," Dixon said. "There are  reasonable, moderate, fair reductions we can make."  </P> <P> Later, Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) applauded Bush for going beyond his  proposal of last May and advocating the withdrawal of 80,000 U.S. troops, not  just the 30,000 he called for then. He called it "much more relevant to the  changes in Europe and to the budget realities here at home."  </P> <P> But Nunn voiced strong concern when Cheney seemed to advocate keeping 225,000  U.S. troops in Europe indefinitely, despite his prediction that the Soviets  would pull all of its forces out of Eastern Europe and the two Germanys would  be reunited.  </P> <P> Nunn warned that unless the United States had plans to make substantial  withdrawals in such a case, it could wind up supplying most of the ground  forces for NATO as other allies disbanded their units.  </P> <P> The influential senator got Cheney to concede that the Administration would  "take another look" at U.S. troop levels in the event of a sweeping Soviet  pullback and German reunification.  </P> <P> Despite Cheney's expression of flexibility, the defense secretary firmly  defended Bush's new plan. He asserted that any effort by Congress to make  unilateral troop cuts before the conclusion of U.S.-Soviet arms control talks  would undermine the NATO alliance and encourage greater instability in Europe.  </P> <P> "We are on the verge of winning one of the greatest victories in the history of  the world without a shot being fired," Cheney said. "We should not unilaterally  bring them (U.S. troops) home before we get an agreement."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Republicans Cautious  </P> <P> Several Republicans on the committee strongly backed that position.  </P> <P> "We cannot let the euphoria sweeping this nation drive us to unilateral and  hasty reductions in these forces," Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S. C.) said.  </P> <P> Although members of both parties warmly pledged to work cooperatively with  Cheney and Powell in the battles ahead, several Democrats served notice that  they would press for deep cuts in the Administration's proposals for increased  spending on strategic weapons programs.  </P> <P> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) proposed a "Democratic alternative" that he  said would carve a $169-billion "peace dividend" out of the defense budget over  the next five years, more than quadrupling the savings proposed by Bush for the  same period.  </P> <P> Kennedy singled out the B-2 Stealth bomber, the "Star Wars" anti-missile  program and other major programs for deep slashes. He argued that Bush's budget  fails to reflect a dramatically diminished Soviet military threat and a massive  upgrading of U.S. strategic weapons in the last decade.  </P> <P> "We have to have a modernization program," he said, "but does it have to be at  the madcap pace of the 1980s?"  </P> <P> Cheney, while acknowledging major changes in the world, said that the Soviets  continue to modernize their own strategic arsenal. "The Soviet Union remains  the only nation on earth capable of destroying the United States," he said.  </P> <P> Powell likewise contended that this was no time for the nation to let down its  guard.  </P> <P> "I never want to return to that leisurely, comfortable 'From Here to Eternity'  attitude of the 1930s that helped invite global conflict to an unsuspecting  world," he said.  </P></p>

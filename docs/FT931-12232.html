			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices under further pressure THE LONDON stock market looked decidedly uneasy yesterday, and investors continued to take profits ahead of the close tonight of a two-week trading account which has seen the FT-SE 100 Index rise by nearly 2 per cent. Dealers in government bonds, on the other hand, are believed to have lost up to Pounds 20m following the auction of gilt-edged securities held in the wake of Tuesday's cut of one percentage point in UK interest rates. Sentiment in the equity market was helped at first by a relatively steady performance from sterling and government bonds. But early gains in shares melted away in the face of a widely predicted batch of rights issues and lack of genuine investment buying to offset the profit-takers. The mood was not helped by discouraging news from the corporate sector, where the departure of the chief executive of Lasmo, the North Sea oil group, revived worries over the outlook for the market's dividend yield prospects. Also unsettling for the market was the announcement of a sharply increased deficit of Pounds 1.54bn on the UK trade account in December. At the close, the FT-SE 100 was 15.6 off at 2,816.9, virtually the low of the day. But the FT-SE Mid-250 Index shed only 1 point to 2,963.5. Volume in non-Footsie stocks jumped to around 67 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 828.9m shares, compared with 56 per cent in the previous session. Wednesday's 753.5m-share Seaq total was worth Pounds 1.48bn in retail business, at the top end of the recent range of daily averages. Rights issue nervousness in the stock market proved well-founded following a call for Pounds 347m from Asda, the food supermarket group. and for Pounds 28m from Stakis, the UK hotel company. The expectation of more rights issues continued to overhang the market. It is an open secret that only underwriting difficulties have restrained other UK companies from bringing cash demands into the stock market. Much of yesterday's trend in equities was dictated by the stock index futures sector. Profits were taken in building materials, stores and brewery stocks, but there was renewed demand for the construction and contracting shares which have led the market advance over the past two trading sessions. Aerospace issues strengthened significantly as UAL, the US airline, announced contract policies. Reverberations of this week's reduction in domestic interest rates to 6 per cent continued to sound round the stock market, not always to a favourable reception. While suggestions of further base rate cuts at Budget time in March remained favoured, doubts were widely expressed regarding the political handling of this week's move. Some analysts suggested that the Footsie might now not be far from the high of the year. Tough measures in the Budget are now thought more probable and any good news may now be in the market. Strategists at NatWest Securities commented that the latest cut in base rates, while unexpected, indicated that a further reduction to 5 per cent is likely and that this should provide further short-term upside for the stock market. But the authorities were 'somewhat naive in the unsympathetic timing of the base rate cut, as far as gilt-edged marketmakers are concerned', NatWest added.</p>

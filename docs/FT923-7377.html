			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Timeshare buyers win right to cancel in cool-off period TIMESHARE BUYERS will soon have the right to cancel their transactions and claim back advance payments, Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, said yesterday. The right to withdraw from a timeshare transaction within 14 days will apply from October 12 and follows many complaints of misleading advertising and high-pressure selling. The rule change also provides for cancelling credit agreements. The right, contained in the Timeshare Act, will not apply where the agreement is concluded outside the UK. The European Commission has said, however, that it intends to issue a directive covering timeshare throughout the EC. The act has been criticised by the Timeshare Council for not going far enough. The council, which represents timeshare owners and sellers, says it wants to see better protection for purchasers' money through the use of escrow accounts; the compulsory provision of full prospectuses to buyers; and provisions to ensure that buyers acquire their timeshare free of encumbrances such as pre-existing mortgages. The council also says that only 25 per cent of British purchasers buy timeshare in the UK so the majority will not be protected by the changes. Last month the Office of Fair Trading revoked the consumer credit licences of six companies associated with Club Riviera, one of the UK's leading timeshare groups. Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said a stream of complaints against the companies had suggested that their conduct had been 'seriously misleading and deceptive'. From October 12 a timeshare seller must provide a buyer with a notice setting out the right to cancel and a blank cancellation form before the agreement is signed. If the buyer is not given the notice or form, the right to cancel extends indefinitely or until the buyer takes action that can be construed as acceptance. Failure by the seller to comply with the act could result in fines of up to Pounds 5,000 on summary conviction or an un-limited amount on indictment. Baroness Denton said she intended to use the UK's EC presidency to make progress on the European directive.</p>

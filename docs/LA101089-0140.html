Rawl said he doubts serious harm has been done  to his company's public image since the Alaskan oil spill that has cost nearly  $1.3 billion in cleanup bills.  </P> <P> "I think we still have a good image around the world," Rawl said at a meeting  in San Antonio of the Society of Petroleum Engineers late Monday. "People,  especially along the Gulf Coast, realize that accidents can happen."  </P> <P> Rawl said the company has spent $880 million of its own funds and $400 million  from insurance companies on the cleanup effort.  </P> <P> "Whether it (will cost) us any more, I don't know. I don't think so," Rawl  said.  </P></p>

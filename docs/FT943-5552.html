			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Brazilian party steps up fight Brazil's Workers' Party (PT), whose candidate Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva is trailing in polls for next month's presidential elections, yesterday accused the government and media of giving unfair backing to his main rival, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The PT alleged that the government and state-owned companies were approving spending projects in areas likely to benefit Mr Cardoso. It also said Brazil's latest economic plan and the new Real currency were being used for electoral ends. Mr Cardoso, former finance minister, left the government to contest the elections. 'We believe these actions are electoral crime and a crime against democracy in a plan to elect the candidate of the right at any cost,' the PT said. Mr da Silva has 23 per cent support in opinion polls, compared to Mr Cardoso's 45 per cent, and the PT is desperate to find a way to fight back.</p>

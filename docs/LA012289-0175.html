			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 RALLIES PROTEST ABORTION RULING; 200 ARE ARRESTED  </P> <P> About 200 people were arrested Saturday at an anti-abortion demonstration in  Northern California marking the 16th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court  decision legalizing abortion. Hundreds of other anti-abortion activists staged  peaceful rallies in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties.  </P> <P> The arrests were made when about 400 protesters in Sunnyvale attempted to block  the entrance to a family planning clinic, police said. The demonstration, held  by Bay Area Rescue, a coalition of anti-abortion groups, also drew about 150  supporters of Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 case.  </P> <P> In Southern California, nearly 500 demonstrators rallied at the Federal  Building in Van Nuys. Several hundred more gathered for a prayer rally at Our  Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in the San Bernardino County city of Montclair  and then marched several blocks to a family planning clinic, where they stayed  several hours.  </P> <P> No arrests were made in Van Nuys or Montclair. Thousands of anti-abortion  activists are expected to be in Washington Monday to march in favor of a  proposed anti-abortion constitutional amendment. A sit-in on the steps of the  Supreme Court is also planned.  </P></p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / NZ peacekeepers for Bosnia New Zealand is to send 250 troops to serve under British command on peacekeeping duties in Bosnia. This is the country's biggest commitment of military personnel to a combat zone since World War Two. The government is believed to have been reluctant to send the troops, but felt obliged to do so as it was chairman of the Security Council when the decision was taken to step up the UN peacekeeping role in Bosnia. The force will serve for six months and then be replaced by another company. Many MPs are known to be privately concerned at the development, although only the leader of the Alliance party, Mr Jim Anderton, spoke against it in parliament when the decision was announced. The foreign minister Mr Don McKinnon said earlier this year that New Zealand should not be drawn into another European war, but he supported the move yesterday saying it was in line with New Zealand's membership of the Security Council.</p>

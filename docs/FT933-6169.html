			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Secret talks in Norway led to deal NORWAY hosted several clandestine meetings between Israelis and Palestinians to help secure the interim agreement on resolving the Middle East conflict, Norwegian officials said yesterday, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Representatives of both sides met in Norwegian farmhouses and in the private homes of Norwegian officials between April and August this year. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, and Mr Abu Ala, a top Palestine Liberation Organisation official, are said to have met for the first time earlier this year at the 19th century Borregaard farm near Sarpsborg, just south of Oslo. Mr Johan Joergan Holst, Norway's foreign minister, said his country's role as a 'back-door' mediator was central to what he described as a historic breakthrough. There were 25 meetings in all, he said. They took place, with Washington's blessing, in Norway, elsewhere in Europe and in Tunisia. Five Norwegian representatives made up a special mediating team. They included Mr Holst, his wife, Ms Marianne Heiberg, a foreign policy researcher, Mr Jan Egeland, secretary of state in the foreign ministry and Mr Terje Roed-Larsen, head of Norway's Trade Union Centre for Research and Documentation, and his wife. Norway, currently governed by the Labour party, gained the trust of the PLO and Israel largely because of its traditional ties to Israel's Labour party, earlier meetings with PLO leader Yassir Arafat and Norway's status as a founding member of Nato. The Borregaard farm is thought to have been chosen as one of the sites for talks because it is owned by Orkla, the listed paper and food group. Mr Jens Heyerdahl, Orkla's chief executive, has close links with Mr Roed-Larsen, a leading figure in the Norwegian team at the talks.</p>

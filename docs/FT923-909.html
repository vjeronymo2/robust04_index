			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Substantial rise in losses at Era Era Group, the retailer and distributor, incurred a seasonal loss of Pounds 1.66m in the half year to June 30, compared with Pounds 951,000. Mr Tony Fay, chairman, described the result as in line with expectations and satisfactory in the economic conditions. He pointed out that the year's results were dependent on November and December trading - last year the group made Pounds 2.17m pre-tax profit. He said a return of consumer confidence was still awaited, but the group had moved ahead significantly over the past 18 months with new stores, designs and products. The group trades in models and toys, photographic, video and related electronics, and console and computer based games. Turnover this time came to Pounds 29.3m (Pounds 28.7m) on which gross margins were slightly lower partly because of competitive pressures. Losses per share were 2.07p (1.28p). The cumulative preference dividend, absorbing Pounds 96,000, has been passed.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> *** BOB GELDOF "THE VEGETARIANS OF LOVE" ATLANTIC: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE  OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> This earthy album could save Live Aid's instigator from living embalmment in  pop-star humanitarianism. There is nothing more unpretentious than the Irish  folk strains that dominate the record, and Geldof undertakes his Celtic roots  renewal with a commingling of the Waterboys' reverence and the Pogues'  roughneck charm.  </P> <P> For Geldof, the real St. Bob is Dylan -- a pervasive influence here, along with  Van Morrison's "Astral Weeks" mysticism. Geldof mulls the fate of the world  about a third of the time, with mixed artistic results ranging from the leaden  "Thinking Voyager 2 Type Things" to the invigorating "Chains of Pain."  </P> <P> But the best songs are directed inward, where Geldof finds the private soul as  susceptible to starvation as the Third World masses. "No Small Wonder" is a  fine evocation of how transcendence (represented in a stirring instrumental  chorus) and emptiness exert a simultaneous, omnipresent tug on our lives. MIKE  BOEHM  </P></p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (4): Substitute for the 'impersonal' hotel - Staying in a serviced apartment can ease the strain of working away from home Wouldn't it be nice when you're away from home on business to be able to stay in a place where you could relax? Hotel rooms, even the most luxurious, can be soulless, and not everybody wants to pay for frills such as room service and a grand reception area. Regular travellers may prefer somewhere to relax with a light supper rather than eat alone in a formal hotel dining-room. They may also want to hold a meeting without being overheard by all and sundry or having to use a hotel's expensive business centre. The answer is a serviced apartment. These are something between a residential let and a grand but impersonal hotel room, and for the not-so-wealthy traveller, they also offer financial savings. In general, serviced apartments have something of a home-from-home atmosphere, with the added advantage of daily maid service and a concierge. Many are also well-equipped for business needs and will either have a fax in the apartment itself or access via the concierge to fax machines, as well as additional telephone lines and satellite television. Others offer services such as babysitting for those who bring the family on trips, laundry, a limousine service and access to swimming pools, gyms and gardens. And of course all will have kitchens in case the traveller wants to cook rather than eat in a restaurant or risk the local take-away. Serviced apartments are a particularly good idea for single women travellers, who may find a hotel lonely and threatening. Single travellers of both genders may sometimes find themselves in poky hotel rooms next to the lift shaft, or with a view of the back of another building, while paying a high single supplement. Women may feel uncomfortable eating alone, and regular travellers report being relegated to tiny tables behind plants and next to kitchen doors, while a hotel bar can be an intimidating place. One regular traveller reports that, more than once, she has had to resist unwelcome male attentions in a hotel bar while staff have ignored her plight: for her, the privacy of a serviced apartment would be a blessing. For longer trips some like to combine business with a family holiday, so an apartment with proper cooking facilities and a washing machine can make an ideal base. Serviced apartments are also often used by leisure travellers for the same reasons - the convenience of a comfortable base together with cost savings. Mr Dev Anand, sales and marketing director of The Apartment Service, a London-based agency, says this type of traveller tends to be the 'adventurous second- or third-time visitor' to a city. Hotels sometimes have as many different rates as they have rooms. First, there is the published rate. Then, there is the corporate rate. Then, there is the 'It's a Sunday in January and anything is better than nothing' rate. And then, there's the rate that a cheeky traveller can convince the receptionist to offer. Not so with serviced apartments, according to Mr Anand. As they offer a saving of up to 30 per cent on hotel rooms, they are an attractive alternative for a longer stay. Mr Anand's service offers studio apartments sleeping two people in central London from about Pounds 275 a week. Set against a hotel rate, this starts to make good financial sense, and while there is always room for some negotiation on prices, generally for a serviced apartment you can expect to pay the published rate. The key to this is low overheads. You won't be tripping over chambermaids and bellhops, but at the same time you won't be paying for them. And while a few properties will have a restaurant or bar, most do not. Nor will they have an ornate lobby and armies of lift attendants. But equally you won't start chatting to someone in the bar and discover that he is paying considerably less than you for the same room because it was booked through a different travel agent or because his company has negotiated a better corporate rate. Locations for serviced apartments are often as good as, if not better, than hotels. The Apartment Service has flats near Olympia and Earls Court in London and Mr Anand says that companies exhibiting for several days will often put a sales team up in an apartment. For example, a three-bedroom apartment in a building in Kensington, handy for both exhibition centres, costs from Pounds 1,000 a week, and allows companies to keep a tighter rein on overall expenses. Another more recent entrant to the market is Grosvenor House Apartments, within the Grosvenor House hotel in central London. These also offer a private entrance, reception and concierge - keeping the apartment-dwellers separate from the rush of hotel traffic, as well as twice-daily maid service, fresh linens every day and use of the hotel's fitness facilities. It also offers use of the hotel's other facilities such as room service and a business centre. The concept comes from the US where all-suite hotels, as they are known, began as mid-market accommodation and developed into the more upmarket type of property now being offered in Britain and in the rest of the world. Keith Prowse, the ticket agency, acts as an agent for serviced apartments in Vienna, Brussels, Copenhagen and Helsinki, as well as for various locations in France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. In the UK, it is the agent for properties in London and provincial towns, including Bath, Birmingham and Edinburgh. These are definitely a longer-term option: while you may be able to stay for just a couple of nights, most services will want you to stay for at least a week, and many use serviced apartments for much longer, up to several months in some cases. Mr Anand points out that this is a good stop-gap between the short-term hotel and a longer-term residential let. 'Most estate agents won't deal in anything less than six months, but a hotel looks expensive for more than a couple of nights,' he says. It seems like the best of both worlds: a comfortable base with all the facilities of a hotel that you are likely to want without the frills - and without the high costs.</p>

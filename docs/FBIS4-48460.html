			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A shell hit Kigali's hospital this morning,  killing 30 people, according to the United Nations. [passage  omitted]    Yesterday, the United Nations attempted to negotiate with  the  government forces and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] to gain  control of the airport. The United Nations asked for all  weapons to be withdrawn within a two-kilometer radius of the  airport. Jacques Bihozagara, one of the RPF officials, gives  his opinion on this issue. He is interviewed by Adala Benraad:    [Begin recording] [Bihozagara] What we are asking is that  UNAMIR [United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda] should  remove the Rwandan Government forces, which are firing at us,  from the airport, so that the airport can be put under its  control.    [Benraad] Is the airport still a military target for you?    [Bihozagara] It is not a military target but we say there  are  two forces in the airport, UNAMIR and the Rwandan armed forces.  The Rwandan armed forces are firing at our positions from the  airport. So you do understand that the airport is not completely  neutral.    [Benraad] So, consequently, after the removal of the  government forces you would agree to UN convoys being escorted?    [Bihozagara] We are not against the principle of escorting  aid convoys, but we say that the airport is now in a dangerous  zone and therefore the military should move out so that the  United Nations can operate freely in complete neutrality.    [Benraad] What does the RPF think of the French proposal for  a regional summit with the participation of Zaire, Uganda, and  Tanzania to reach a cease-fire?    [Bihozagara] This is a proposal from France, which has not  approached us to ask for our opinion as a party to the conflict,  but we are ready to examine this proposal. We have no problem  with the principle of a meeting. [end recording]</p>

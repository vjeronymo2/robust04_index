			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italians Generally Dissatisfied </F> About Environment"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 17 -- Despite the good intentions  behind the latest environmental measures, Italy still has a long  way to go before its citizens are happy with the conditions of  their surroundings, according to the findings of a survey of  Italians' views on the environment carried out by the National  Statistics Institute, ISTAT.    In its annual report covering the year just past, ISTAT did  acknowledge that the recent launch of the 1994-96 plan for the  environment, new laws on water supplies and the setting up of a  national agency to deal with environmental protection, "steps in  the right direction" but the findings of the survey suggest that  the Italian population harbor large doubts about air pollution,  drinking water, and dirty streets.    According to 31 percent of Italians interviewed the air they  breathe is increasingly unfit, with only 3.5 percent expressing  satisfaction at the quality of the air where they live. The  trend shows that those in the North are most afflicted by smog  and that people are aware that motor vehicle exhaust fumes are  the main culprits.    Similarly, the poor quality of tap water and the shoddy  service offered by water distribution networks were points that  38 percent expressed worries about, with many of those  interviewed up and down the country choosing bottled water to  drink rather than trusting their local supply. Sicily and  Sardinia are the worst hit by irregular and undrinkable water  supplies.    Cleaner streets is one of the cries most heard from  inhabitants of the bigger cities and from regions in the South,  although at the same time, according to the survey, there is a  general lack of "necessary awareness" about the problems of the  rising levels of refuse in Italian streets. In fact only 27  percent of all interviewees referred to their streets as "too  dirty."    On a wider scale, other figures published by ISTAT show that  last year was catastrophic for Italy's national forests, 1.5  percent (104.34 hectares) of which were destroyed by 11,932  reported forest fires.    Italy's beaches do not escape scrutiny either with just over  half (59.7 percent) of the nation's total coastline vaunting  offshore waters in which swimming is allowed. People are  advised to stay away from the seas elsewhere because of  excessive levels of pollution or the lack of necessary analyses.  However, in comparison with 1992, ISTAT stressed that this  represents an actual rise of eight percent in the total quota of  "swimmable" beaches.    Some good news does emerge from the Institute's report  regarding the numbers of environmental monitoring stations being  developed throughout Italy that eventually will feed a  nationwide network of research centers.</p>

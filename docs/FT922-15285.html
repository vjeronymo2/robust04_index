			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Book Review: A change in climate BACKLASH: THE UNDECLARED WAR AGAINST WOMEN By Susan Faludi Chatto and Windus, Pounds 9.99 THE WAR AGAINST WOMEN By Marilyn French Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 9.99 When the nuclear bomb testers were waiting for the result of the mission to bomb Hiroshima, they expected a coded message. If the mission was successful, the message would read: 'It's a boy.' But if the bomb was a dud, it would read: 'It's a girl.' In that code lies a clue to the desire of families all over the world to produce boys not girls, to selective abortion of girls, to infanticide of female children, and to gradual starvation of women in areas of the Third World, where men get first share of the food. Both Marilyn French and Susan Faludi write of the war against women. For Marilyn French, feminism was the first philosophy to challenge patriarchy per se. The anger of 'men-as-a-caste' at this challenge partly explains the war they are now waging. She cites many examples of this: domestic violence; the abandonment of women and children by men who fail to support them; attitudes to work and food in much of the Third World; employment law and practices; the denial of abortion rights; and the growth of fundamentalism. Her text is passionately argued and largely convincing. But it sometimes lacks accuracy, rendering it less compelling than Susan Faludi's meticulously researched Backlash. Time after time Faludi takes a piece of well-reported research, and re-examines it. While Marilyn French recites a litany of wrongs done to women, and argues, somewhat loosely, that women are fighting back, Faludi records cases of discrimination and the reporting of them, while interviewing the people involved, showing that things are not as they seemed. For instance, Marilyn French reports that women and their families are on average 73 per cent worse off after divorce in the US. The backlashers, who want to toughen the divorce laws, use that evidence to strengthen their argument. But Faludi shows that the figures usually quoted, published by Lenore Weitzman in 1985, were almost certainly inaccurate. Two economists, Hoffman and Duncan, found that their work on divorce statistics suggested a much smaller decline, of about 30 per cent. And, they suggested the average woman's living standard, five years after divorce, was actually slightly higher than when she was married. When they published their findings, there was only one brief item on them, in the Wall Street Journal's inside-page demography column. Weitzman's figures still tend to be quoted because they suit two discrete groups: those who wish to beat up men for abandoning their families, and those who wish to say that divorce is having the most disastrous effects on the economic circumstances of families, and should be made more difficult. This 'evidence' is at the heart of the backlash line: that women are better off 'protected' than equal. Faludi's most telling arguments come from her accounts of women trying to use anti-discrimination legislation to get better working conditions, pay and promotion prospects. The cases of female employees at Sears Roebuck and ABC Television who attempted to use the legislation to improve their lot make depressing, infuriating reading. And the fact that one of the biggest critics of the ABC tactics, Rita Flynn, a former seasoned CBS reporter, first found her career on the skids and then found herself unemployable when she moved west suggests that in the US, as in the UK, it does not always work to one's benefit to take issue with the company discriminating against one. Susan Faludi has written a cogent, compelling account of the change in climate for feminism in the US. The UK is different in many respects; the English additions to the original US edition do not work because some of the arguments need modification for the UK and European scene. But Faludi's note of optimism at the end, with her assertion that 'there really is no good reason why the 1990s can't be their (women's) decade', is one we would do well to echo. There is indeed no good reason, but what is needed, propounded by neither Faludi nor French perhaps because of their American world-view, is a different attitude to children. They need to be recognised as a public concern and the nation's future - not a private (women's) matter, with properly funded childcare and child protection - alongside generous maternity rights and benefits. The UK is poor on these issues in comparison with the rest of Europe, and has resisted protection of part-time employees (blocking the EC directive on part-time work), 86 per cent of whom are female. These are matters that should come to the fore in the last week of the election campaign. Then women voters could use their political power to vote for the party that promises the most for women and children. No party has pledged enough. The reviewer is a rabbi. Her book, Whatever's Happening to Women?, was published last year.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: German rate cut hopes propel European prices higher EUROPEAN bond prices ended mostly higher yesterday, boosted by growing expectations of a German rate cut. GERMAN bond prices closed  1/8 point firmer as expectations that the Bundesbank will cut rates at its council meeting on Thursday gained ground. A weekend agreement by the German government on a package of austerity measures, known as the solidarity pact, has prompted strong speculation that the Bundesbank will not be able to hold out any longer against pressure for a cut in official interest rates. However, the market fell from overnight highs in Tokyo. The agreement 'makes it easier for the Bundesbank to cut rates because its creates a more organised fiscal structure,' said Mr Klaus Baader, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. He added that the fundamental effect was very small, but 'it caps the potential for chaos in public sector financing'. The Euro D-Mark future on Liffe also benefited from mounting expectations of a cut. The March contract ended at 92.19, up from a previous close of 92-10. UK GILT prices ended slightly higher in very thin trading. The market is expected to remain in suspense until today's government Budget statement. THE DUTCH government sold Fl 1.4bn of the new 10-year state bond yesterday. Dutch bond prices rose in line with the German bond market. THE Czech Republic has launched a Kcs2.5bn domestic Treasury bond issue  - the first such issue for more than 50 years - which has been fully pre-placed with domestic investors. The four-year issue, arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston, carries a fixed coupon of 14.6 per cent. 'There are enough domestic investors willing to lend the government money. The response has been better than expected for an entirely new instrument. It also shows investors' confidence following the break-up of (the former) Czechoslovakia (in January),' said an analyst with CSFB. The proceeds will be used to help finance a 1991 budget deficit of Kcs9.9bn. US Treasury prices opened firmly then fell at the long end of the maturity range after rising commodity prices had revived fears of inflation. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/2 at 102 27/32 , yielding 6.896 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.066 per cent. Prices opened higher, buoyed by comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who at the weekend said that the recovery remained 'tentative'. The market then suffered a mid-morning setback, however, after the Commodities Research Bureau index jumped more than 2 1/2 points to 210.41. The CRB's rise, which some dealers said was a reaction to Saturday's huge snowstorm that hit the eastern US states and may have an impact on some crops, showed higher prices among a broad range of commodities. The rise in the CRB unsettled Treasury investors, who fear that inflationary pressures may be building up in the economy as the recovery gathers pace. Last week the February producer prices index increased more than expected, and with yesterday's CRB rise, dealers and investors are nervously awaiting the February consumer prices report, which is due out tomorrow.</p>

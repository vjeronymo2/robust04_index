			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There are still hopes for a diplomatic solution to  the siege of Sarajevo. The Spanish prime minister said so this  morning and the foreign minister as well as the minister of  defense said so too. [Defense Minister Julian] Garcia Vargas  came back this afternoon from Paris where he examined the  situation with his French counterpart.    [Correspondent Martinez Durban] Garcia Vargas says that the  Serbs are slowly but surely withdrawing their artillery from the  positions they have around Sarajevo. However, the same cannot  be said about the mortars. All heavy weaponry sites are well  known so that, if the NATO attack were to go ahead, it would be  successful. However, the defense minister still believes in a  diplomatic solution. If on Sunday [20 February] evening the  conditions set out by NATO have not been fulfilled, the allies  will not backtrack.    [Begin Garcia Vargas recording] Taking into account how far  we have gone in our decisions, we have to explain to the  Russians as well as we can what our position is, mainly why we  think that this has to be done. But we cannot do anything else.  There is no going back, I think it is no longer possible. [end  recording]    [Durban] The fact that the blue helmets are now taking  military positions under their control should keep the Bosnian  Muslims from taking over the positions that have been under Serb  control until now. According to Garcia Vargas, the security of  our contingent is guaranteed although there are possible risks,  the contingent is aware of them and keeps them under control.</p>

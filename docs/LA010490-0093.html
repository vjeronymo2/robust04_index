			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BEATHARD TAKES OVER AS NEW CHARGER GM;  </P> <P> NFL:HE HAS BEEN PROMISED NO INTERFERENCE FROM CLUB OWNER ALEX SPANOS. HE WILL  ACCEPT BLAME IF THINGS GO WRONG.  </P> <P> Bobby Beathard officially became San Diego Chargers general manager on  Wednesday, and went to work to build the team his way with a promise of  non-interference from club owner Alex Spanos.  </P> <P> "I told him when I accepted the job that I would like to be put in the same  position we were in in Washington. We don't want to use the excuse that the  owner has handicapped us," the former Redskins general manager said.  </P> <P> "We're the guys he's hired to turn this (club) into a winner and if it doesn't  happen, then I would rather be the one to blame than say that somebody else  caused it.  </P> <P> "That's why I am very optimistic about this. It won't be for lack of money that  we won't win. If we don't do it here (win), it will be because I've done the  wrong things."  </P> <P> Beathard, who turns 53 this month, succeeds Steve Ortmayer, who was fired on  Dec. 18, when the Chargers were 5-10. San Diego won its last game to finish  1989 at 6-10.  </P> <P> Two of Ortmayer's key aides, his personal secretary and the entire five-member  scouting staff also were released. Beathard said he planned to rehire one of  the scouts, Dwight Adams, and would fill the other positions during the next  few weeks.  </P> <P> Beathard's hiring in San Diego marks his return to football after a one-year  hiatus as a network sports commentator and reunites him with Dan Henning, a  former assistant in Washington who just completed his first season as Chargers  head coach.  </P> <P> Terms of Beathard's contract were not disclosed. But Beathard, who owns a home  in nearby Leucadia, said: "I want this to be my last football job. I love it  here. I firmly believe this is the place to be."  </P> <P> Beathard left Washington last May after helping to assemble the talent for  three Super Bowl teams in 10 years as Redskins general manager. Before that, he  spent seven years as director of player personnel for the Miami Dolphins, who  appeared in two Super Bowls during his stay with the team.  </P> <P> "Bobby Beathard represents an outstanding addition to our organization," Spanos  said. "He's one of the best in football in evaluating and acquiring talent and  he will also be able to do whatever he feels is necessary for us to have a  winning ball club."  </P> <P> Beathard said he wasn't worried about working for Spanos, regarded by many as  one of the league's more impulsive owners.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't be here if I thought it would be the wrong situation. I would have  gone somewhere else or stayed with NBC," Beathard said. "I came here because I  was convinced the Spanoses (Spanos' son, Dean, is the club's vice chairman)  were going to give us the support that we need to take this team in the right  direction."  </P> <P> For his part, Alex Spanos said criticism of him as a meddlesome owner was  unfair. Beathard is the third general manager and Henning the third coach in  Spanos' six years of ownership.  </P> <P> "I have to laugh when I hear people call me a 'meddlesome owner,' " he said. "I  am an owner, but I have to hire people to do the job for me and I have to trust  their judgment.  </P> <P> "I just finished my sixth season and I can tell you I have so much confidence  in the new operation I feel the next couple of years I'll be able to sit back  and relax more than I ever have."  </P> <P> During Ortmayer's nearly three-year tenure, the Chargers were 19-27, 16-27 in  non-strike games.  </P> <P> Since Spanos bought the team in August 1984, the Chargers have finished last in  the AFC West three times.  </P> <P> Beathard said his top priority in the coming days is Plan B free agency, both  from the perspective of deciding which Chargers players to put on the protected  list and which players from around the league they might be interested in  signing.  </P></p>

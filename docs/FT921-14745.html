			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Acceptances for Inchcape rights delayed in post INCHCAPE, the international services and marketing group, said a delayed postal delivery resulted in a number of acceptances for the group's recent Pounds 376m rights issue being received two days after the final payment date. The group said 952 provisional allotment letters for 1.53m stock units, representing 1.2 per cent of the shares on offer, were postmarked by the Royal Mail on or before January 3, but not delivered to Barclays Registrars until January 9, two days after the due date. Inchcape said it believed it would be possible for the group to issue those affected with new shares, in lieu of the stock units they would have received, at the same cost. Acceptances were received for 89.3 per cent of the issue by the due date. Internatio-Mueller Engineering, a Netherlands-based trading and transport concern said it was negotiating the sale of its Wm H Mueller shipping agency to Inchcape. Internatio said the sale would help it concentrate on engineering and trading activities.</p>

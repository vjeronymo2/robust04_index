Already, protests by Ogoni people have been squashed  and the leaders arrested. A rally by maverick businessman,  Arthur Nzeribe, was interrupted by security forces, and now the  police have issued a warning that the authorities will not  accept any public political statements, which sounds ominously  like a gag on freedom of speech. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports.    [Begin recording] The tough statement from Police Federal  Headquarters in Abuja warned those described as members of the  political class to stop making statements, which it said, were  capable of threatening government's good intentions to bequeath  a viable democratic institution in the country. The police said  that it would not tolerate any further political statement at  this period of a ban on political activities. It said that  those who had positive contributions to make towards the  political development of Nigeria should wait until the proposed  constitutional conference commission was inaugurated or else  risk arrest and possible prosecution.    Shortly before the statement was issued, about 50 armed  policemen aborted the press conference called in Lagos by the  leader of the Association for a Better Nigeria, Chief Arthur  Nzeribe. The policemen turned back journalists from the venue,  which ironically was the property of the Nigerian Union of  Journalists. Later, Chief Nzeribe described the police action  as unfortunate and he said that it undermined the very  foundation of democracy. Last weekend, Chief Nzeribe said that  the government of Gen. Sani Abacha was incapable of solving  Nigeria's complex political crisis and it should therefore  resign and hand over to a civilian government of national unity.    Two days ago, former presidential contestant, Major Gen.  Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, called for the immediate restoration of the  right to free association and free speech. Addressing  journalists in Lagos, he suggested that the decisions of the  proposed constitutional conference should not be subject to  approval by the Provisional Ruling Council and he advised the  military government to ensure that its tenure did not extend  beyond the end of this year. Such statements are now covered by  the police warning.    However, the government today constituted the National  Constitutional Conference Commission. It has 19 members, most  of whom are well-known politicians from across the country. It  is headed by a retired justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria,  Alhaji Saidu Kawu. The commission's terms of reference are  expected to be announced at its formal inauguration next week.  [end recording]</p>

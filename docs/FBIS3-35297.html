			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Lebanese judiciary is eager to handle the murder  of the Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah with extreme  delicacy and secure the defense for those charged with the  murder, who belong to the Abu-Nidal-led Fatah Movement--the  Revolutionary Council [FRC]. The defendants are interrogated in  the presence of Bisharah Abu-Sa'd, a lawyer who is a partner and  the brother-in-law of Deputy Najah Wakim.    AL-SHIRA' previously reported that the Abu-Nidal group  undertakes the personal protection of Deputy Wakim by providing  him with a permanent escort of armed men. Hence, Wakim adheres  to the FRC line and adopts it in his political positions.</p>

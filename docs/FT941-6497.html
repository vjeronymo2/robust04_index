			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Government subsidy bolsters first-half earnings at Sasol Sasol, South Africa's oil-from-coal petrochemicals producer, reaped rich rewards from its R2.5bn investment in new chemical projects in the half-year to December 25. The group reported a 40 per cent surge in pre-tax profit to R1.06bn (Dollars 305m) from R759m in the same period of 1992. The improvement was achieved through productivity gains and the rand's weakness against the dollar, which lifted export revenues. However, the robust performance, which saw sales climb to R4.67bn from R4.34bn, includes an estimated R450m government subsidy at the pre-tax level. Sasol's synthetic fuel operations are compensated for any fall in oil prices below a floor of Dollars 21.85 a barrel, adjusted from Dollars 23 late in 1993. The subsidy has increased as international crude oil prices have sunk to new lows of below Dollars 13 in recent months. Mr Paul Kruger, managing director, said the investment in petrochemicals helped lift operating margins while cost cutting had continued at the group's mines and synthetic fuel operations. Mr Kruger added that talks on the deregulation of the South African oil industry were proving to be 'difficult, slow but going ahead'. He said that progress was likely to accelerate once a new government was installed. Operating income rose to R1.11bn from R822m. The exhaustion of tax allowances led to a jump in tax provisions to R365.8m from R158.7m. After-tax profit rose 16 per cent to R698.7m from R600.3m. Earnings improved to 115.9 cents from 99 cents a share. An 11 per cent higher dividend of 42 cents against 38 cents is declared. The group has completed the revamp of its Sasol 1 synfuel plant, now dedicated to chemical production, and has commissioned the expansion of Natref, the Durban oil refinery jointly owned with Total. Meanwhile, production has started in this calendar year at Polifin, the R400m petrochemicals joint venture with AECI, the Anglo American-owned chemicals group.</p>

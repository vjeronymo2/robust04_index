			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Tokyo in Strong Defence JAPAN put up a vigorous defence of its trading policies to Gatt's governing council which yesterday concluded discussion of the critical secretariat report, writes Frances Williams. Mr Kazuo Asakai, a senior trade official in Geneva, said Japan was committed to free, non-discriminatory trade in accordance with Gatt principles. The main reason Japan undertook voluntary export restraints was that importing countries were not acting in conformity with Gatt rules. These measures were taken as emergency or unavoidable expedients and to the minimal extent, he said. Mr Asakai also queried Gatt's analysis of its import incentives, which he said were analogous to tariff cuts, not export subsidies. He defended Japan's stance on farm trade in the Uruguay Round which he said should take non-trade aspects such as food security into account.</p>

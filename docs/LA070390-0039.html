			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOUISIANA'S NEW ABORTION LAW  </P> <P> Your editorial refers to the Louisiana legislature's efforts to turn back the  tide of legalized killing (abortion) as a "giant step backward in the area of  basic rights."  </P> <P> In the previous century, the Supreme Court declared that blacks were not  persons entitled to the protection of the law. I wonder if your staff would  have considered efforts to reverse that decision as an unconstitutional "giant  step backward in the area of basic (property) rights?"  </P> <P> SCOTT MYERS  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: DTI case against Polly Peck adjourned THE HIGH Court yesterday adjourned a case brought by the Department of Trade and Industry concerning former directors of Polly Peck International, the fruit, electronics and leisure conglomerate which collapsed in 1990. The DTI had sought to extend the period during which it could launch proceedings to have some of the former directors disqualified from becoming company directors again. The law allows such proceedings to be brought within two years of the date of a company going into administration. Polly Peck was put into administration on October 26 1990, with debts of Pounds 1.3bn. Proceedings were adjourned so that a judge, as opposed to a registrar, could hear the petition. The official date has yet to be fixed.</p>

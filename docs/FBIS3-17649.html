Notes  From Interparliamentary Assembly Session"]    [Text] The fourth plenary session of the  Interparliamentary Assembly [IPA] of the CIS states was held in  St. Petersburg last week.    The assembly legally came into being two years ago, when the  speakers of the parliaments of seven countries of the former  Union signed an agreement setting up the IPA. In actual fact,  however, it came into being last year. But I believe that the  Russian Supreme Soviet's stormy activity last year overshadowed  everything, leaving in the memory of readers no definite  attitude toward the international parliamentary organ.    To all appearances, the assembly is now breaking out of its  zero cycle. Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the IPA Council, has  very actively set about building this institution of  interparliamentary cooperation -- a process that is as yet  unusual for the parliaments of our independent states.    What is the essence of the IPA's work? It does not adopt  binding decisions, just statements, appeals, proposals, and  recommendatory legislative acts relating to the CIS states'  common problems. These problems are not becoming any fewer. At  the same time integration processes are gathering momentum in  the Commonwealth countries, and there is a growing desire for  concerted actions.    Now, as distinct from 1991, positive changes in relations  among the peoples of the countries of the former Union really  are being felt. The Commonwealth's international organs -- the  Councils of the Heads of State and Government -- have now been  operating for more than a year. They adopt decisions and reach  agreement on economic integration and recently, for example,  they adopted the treaty setting up the Economic Union....    But, however many agreements presidents and governments  reach, each state has its own laws, customs offices, currencies,  borders, etc. It is only possible to surmount these obstacles  and coordinate actions by formulating common rules and bringing  the CIS countries' legislation closer together. Here the role  of the IPA in joint norm-creating activity is inestimable.    "We are at the head of the legal process," Shumeyko  declared,  emphasizing the assembly's role in creating the Commonwealth's  common legal area. Incidentally, the day after the  parliamentarians' session the international conference "Civil  Codes of the Commonwealth States: Harmonization and Modeling"  opened in the same place, in the Taurida Palace.    But does this modeling, not to mention harmonization, do any  good for people?    Only in the long term. The assembly's chairman believes that  it must get down in earnest to elaborating social policy and  prepare some common document like the social charter of the  Commonwealth states, which would clearly designate a unified  system of social guarantees for citizens living in the CIS.    Here there is also the problem of refugees, the possibility  of free movement from one state to another, the ensuring of  personal safety and safeguarding of property, the prevention of  any discrimination whatever when employing people and paying  them, guarantees of pension provision when changing the country  of residence, etc.    What, after all, was decided at the assembly's last  session, in which delegations from the parliaments of eight  Commonwealth countries participated: Azerbaijan, Armenia,  Belorussia [Belarus], Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia  [Kyrgyzstan], Russia, and Tajikistan?    The parliamentarians adopted 17 decrees: on the IPA's role  and tasks in strengthening the Commonwealth, on peacemaking  actions, the drafting of a model civil code, legal backup for  the ecological safety of internal reservoirs, recognition of  higher education diplomas, on the drafting of legislative acts  in the fight against crime, on a list of recommendatory  legislative acts governing economic relations within the  framework of the Economic Union, etc.    Just one of the drafts proposed by the IPA Council -- on the  impermissibility of a blockade of Commonwealth members -- was  not adopted. This happened because of disagreements between the  parliamentary delegations from Azerbaijan and Armenia. But it  is assumed that at the next session it will be possible to reach  a consensus on this question too, since a special commission has  been set up to work it out under the chairmanship of M.  Sherimkulov, speaker of the Kirghiz Supreme Council.    A question naturally arises: If all the decisions the  assembly adopts are of a recommendatory nature, then surely its  activity cannot have serious consequences?    It is hard to say whether there will be any practical  benefit  from these decrees. Not only is the assembly not able to  influence the CIS governments and parliaments by virtue of its  consultative nature, but neither does it have a mechanism for  monitoring the implementation of its own decisions.    This is undoubtedly the chief difficulty -- to embody even  some of the decrees in legislation. There is no need to recall  the difficulty with which laws are adopted in the Russian  parliament and, evidently, in others too. How much more  difficult is it to bring closer together the lawmaking processes  in national parliaments? No mechanisms, no experience.... But  without this, all the noble impulses of the heads of state and  government will remain just good intentions. The Economic Union  will run the risk of remaining a paper union only.    The IPA's headquarters in the Taurida Palace could become a  factory of legislative daydreams unless a different status is  accorded this norm-creating process.    In the opinion of observers, the assembly at present is  merely a good platform for contacts among parliamentarians and  communication among the political elites of the CIS, something  like a corridor of trust.</p>

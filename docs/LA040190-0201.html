			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 7 UCI STUDENTS HELD AT NEVADA NUCLEAR TEST RANGE;  </P> <P> CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE: THE DEMONSTRATORS JOIN A FIVE-DAY DECADE TO DISARM PROTEST  OF UC'S PARTICIPATION IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS RESEARCH AT LABORATORIES IN LIVERMORE  AND LOS ALAMOS. NEARLY 600 ACTIVISTS ARE ARRESTED.  </P> <P> Seven UC Irvine students were among the first anti-nuclear activists who were  arrested Saturday during a daylong protest at a federal underground nuclear  testing range.  </P> <P> Eighteen UCI students and alumni were among about 1,500 protesters at the  Nevada Test Site, 68 miles northwest of Las Vegas. By late Saturday, nearly 600  protesters had been arrested, with dozens more waiting to be processed.  </P> <P> As they stepped onto test site property, the seven UCI students were met by Nye  County sheriff's deputies, who smiled and chatted with them. The students  handed the officers handmade toy missiles, which were used in a mock theater  presentation staged just before their arrests to protest the University of  California's participation in nuclear weapons research at laboratories in  Livermore and Los Alamos.  </P> <P> The demonstrators were participating in a five-day Decade to Disarm protest,  sponsored by three peace groups: American Peace Test, the Western Shoshone  Council and a Soviet anti-nuclear group called the Nevada Movement.  </P> <P> Nevada Highway Patrol Capt. Glenn Jewett said most of the arrests occurred when  the demonstrators crossed a cattle grate at the main Mercury entrance and  stepped onto the federal property that includes the nation's top-secret nuclear  testing grounds.  </P> <P> "It is important that some students take the step and cross that line," said  Jessica James, a first-year music and biology student who was arrested.  </P> <P> "Being from UCI, we have a specific aim in opposing the connection that (UC)  has with nuclear weapons," she said.  </P> <P> The arrested UCI students were taken to a holding pen. Authorities said they  would be cited for trespassing and released on their own recognizance.  </P> <P> Also arrested were: Joetta Moon, 25, a UCI graduate; Jeff Rouder, 23, a  graduate student in anthropology; Caephren McKenna, 20, a political science and  psychology major; Stephanie Lasko, 19, a drama major; Kate Sullivan, 19, a  sophomore undeclared major, and Bob Harrison, 19, a freshman English major.  </P> <P> Shortly before being arrested, the students donned mortarboards fashioned from  black construction paper. On their backs, they hung signs noting their class  year. They then lined up, blindfolded themselves with white streamers and began  humming a loud rendition of "Pomp and Circumstance," the graduation theme.  </P> <P> Each student handed play money to a fellow student, who wore a sign designating  her to be a UC representative. The students then accepted "diplomas" -- in the  shape of miniature missiles, covered with aluminum foil and tied with a red  ribbon. They then read statements condemning UC involvement in nuclear  research.  </P> <P> The presentation was meant to symbolize that students blindly hand over money  to the UC system without questioning how it is being used, said Wendy Doetkott,  23, a UCI senior and a protest organizer.  </P> <P> "A few of us have thought we'd come to the university's graduation and repeat  the same ceremony," said Joetta Moon, 25, a UCI graduate. "That's still being  discussed."  </P> <P> Authorities promised to return the mock missiles to the students after they are  released.  </P> <P> The action began Thursday and was timed to coincide with last week's deployment  of the Trident II missile from Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in southern  Georgia, organizers said. The Trident II is the Navy's most powerful nuclear  weapon.  </P> <P> Similar demonstrations were held this weekend in Great Britain, West Germany  and the Soviet Union, American Peace Test spokeswoman Katherin Dress said.  </P> <P> Highway Patrol spokesman Jewett said Saturday's action was peaceful. "It's a  good crowd," he said.  </P> <P> However, protesters closed the access road at the Mercury entrance for more  than five hours when they blocked the highway, then built a rock wall across  it.  </P> <P> Highway Patrol trooper Phillip Dart said the highway had been closed for about  five hours when Department of Transportation workers were called at 5 p.m. to  remove the rocks. The road was expected to be cleared early Saturday evening.  </P> <P> The student action was part of a demonstration that has taken place annually at  the test site for several years.  </P> <P> But this year's crowd appeared to be smaller than in previous years, when  protesters numbered about 8,000, Dart said.  </P> <P> Many members of Saturday's crowd linked arms and skirted the perimeter of the  site, creating a colorful band against the bleak, brown desert property.  </P> <P> Some carried flags and banners. Others carried water and beat small snare  drums, giving the otherwise-cheerful crowd a solemn tone.  </P> <P> Most of those who set up camp about a mile from the main entrance of the site  were college students, including contingents from UC Santa Cruz and UC Santa  Barbara.  </P> <P> Several high schools, including Brentwood High School in Los Angeles County,  were also represented.  </P> <P> Michael Valleo, 18, a student at Brentwood, said a recent visit to the Soviet  Union convinced him that the U.S.S.R is as interested in peace as the United  States is.  </P> <P> "I don't see any reason to kill millions of people when we could be saving  them," he said. "We all want peace."  </P> <P> The Irvine students said they hope the demonstration and their arrests will  inform other students of UC nuclear activities and pressure the governing body  of the system, the Board of Regents, to cut ties with the Department of Energy  and the Department of Defense that involve nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> The UC Irvine Academic Senate is expected to take up the issue this spring.  Similar discussions are taking place at other UC campuses.  </P> <P> In the heart of conservative Orange County, it is often tough to be an activist  at UCI, said the students who camped out on the stretch of desert, but they  found the company of the fellow protesters reassuring.  </P> <P> "At Irvine, you can feel so alone," Harrison said.  </P> <P> But the students said such protests show that their activism is changing. From  beside a large tent decorated with a U.S. flag emblazoned with a peace symbol,  UCI students such as Doetkott said the emphasis on nonviolence in protests is  the biggest change.  </P> <P> "You don't see the kind of atrocities that occurred" in the 1960s, she said,  noting that both police and protesters are educated now in civil disobedience.  </P> <P> The police "treat us a lot better," she said.  </P> <P> Equally important, the students said, is that UCI activists are more organized  than ever. They use the word networking, have newsletters and have a core group  that acts as an umbrella organization for their causes.  </P> <P> Several students protesting Saturday have also demonstrated for gay rights at  UCI and have demanded more participation in student affairs.  </P> <P> "What we're dealing with is serious," McKenna said. "We're dealing with the  future."  </P> <P> Associated Press and United Press International contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Former president heads Venezuela race WITH just over two months to go to Venezuela's presidential elections, Mr Rafael Caldera, 77, a former president with an ambivalent stance on the country's continuing free-market reforms, has emerged as the leading candidate. Mr Caldera, who founded the Christian Democrat (Copei) party in the 1940s, is one of Venezuela's most prominent politicians. An expert in labour legislation and a member of Congress for much of his life, he served as president from 1969 to 1974 and first ran for the presidency in 1947. For the current presidential campaign, his sixth, Mr Caldera broke with his party and is now running as an independent. Much of his campaign has been based on attacking the free-market reforms initiated in 1989 by ex-President Carlos Andres Perez, who was forced out of office this year because of corruption charges. But Mr Caldera and his advisers have tried recently to convince businessmen and investors that they back private investment and will not return to excessive government intervention in the economy. His adversaries, though, accuse Mr Caldera and his team of saying one thing in Venezuela and quite another to audiences overseas. The ex-president, until now a strong anti-communist, has accepted a wide range of support from more than a dozen smaller political parties, including the Communist party of Venezuela and other leftist groups. Many of these enthusiastic supporters of today used to consider Mr Caldera one of the country's worst reactionaries. Mr Caldera's strategy of breaking with his former party could possibly pay dividends. More than ever before, Venezuelans are rejecting the two political parties that have dominated national politics since the last military dictator was ousted in 1958. Democratic Action (AD) has captured the presidency in five out of the seven democratic elections held over the last 35 years, and Copei has won twice. Mr Caldera is one of four leading candidates from a pack of 17 contenders, which includes a spiritualist, a sexologist, a former guerrilla and two retired military officers. Second in the polls and representing Copei is Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, 50, a longtime congressman and twice-elected governor of Zulia state. After winning a stunning primary victory last April, Mr Alvarez declared he was in favour of continuing free-market reforms, but added he would seek a wide political consensus and more effective social welfare programmes. Mr Andres Velasquez, 40, is a labour organiser who turned to national politics and was elected twice as governor of Bolivar state. For the third time, he is standing as presidential candidate for Causa Radical, a small left-wing party. He has called for a 'peaceful revolution' in Venezuela, and has proposed a broad mix of reforms. Representing AD is Mr Claudio Fermin, 43, ex-mayor of Caracas and a sociologist who has been a party activist since he was 15. Mr Fermin is also convinced Venezuela must push ahead with economic and political reforms, but seeks a greater share of social justice for those hardest hit by economic change. A national poll in August showed Mr Caldera had 24.8 per cent support: Mr Alvarez (whose position eroded sharply in comparison with surveys in May and June) 15.4 per cent; Mr Velasquez 13.4 per cent; and a humiliating 9.8 per cent for Mr Fermin.</p>

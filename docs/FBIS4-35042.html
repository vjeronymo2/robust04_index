			<p>BFN     [Text] The transport of cocaine from Bolivia and Colombia  -- though from the latter country to a lesser extent -- to  Europe has reportedly become easier with the discovery of a  direct route to the European black markets.    The construction of clandestine airstrips for medium- and  large-sized planes in the Paraguayan Chaco is reportedly the key  to all this. Bolivian drug traffickers are reportedly gradually  giving up the obligatory route through Asuncion for shipment of  cocaine directly from the Chaco.    Police sources have reported that the Chaco-Europe  connection  reportedly includes Spain and Portugal, and other neighboring  countries, as the final destination for the drugs.    Top officials from the National Antinarcotics Secretaria  (Senad) are reportedly aware of this fact, which is under  investigation to verify the seriousness of what is really  happening.    The sources added that the clandestine airstrips are no  longer limited to small single-engine or twin-engine planes, but  can also receive larger planes capable of direct international  flights or with fewer stopovers.    The controls carried out lately at the airports in the  various countries of our continent have forced traffickers to  find other ways to continue to export cocaine to Europe with the  least risk possible.    The Paraguayan Chaco offers the traffickers the best  possibilities for conducting clandestine operations and flights,  due to little or no air or land control, the sources added.    Senad does not yet know for sure where the landing strips  are  located, although the sources reported that they could be  located in Pedro P. Pena, Eugenio A. Garay, Parque Cue, and  Infante Rivarola. The police sources added that these airstrips  could also be located north of Lagerenza, or in the woods near  San Alfredo or Sierra Leon.</p>

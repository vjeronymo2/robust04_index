			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Cuban President Fidel Castro met privately  with his South African counterpart, Nelson Mandela. Castro  attended Mandela's inauguration ceremony in Pretoria yesterday.    Early this morning, Castro visited Mandela at Mandela's  official residence, where they talked behind closed doors. In  remarks to the press yesterday, Castro said new possibilities  for cooperation between the two countries are opening up, as the  African National Congress assumes power. He added that because  of the ties of friendship and affection that exist between the  two countries, with no other country in the world are there such  broad possibilities for cooperation as there are between South  Africa and Cuba.    After meeting with Mandela, Castro granted the South African  Broadcasting Corporation, the local television network, an  exclusive interview at the Arcadia Hotel, where he and all the  members of his top-level delegation are staying.    Regarding his first visit to South Africa, whose army fought  Cuban troops in the struggle for the independence of Angola and  Namibia, Castro said there are two South Africas and two moments  in the history of South Africa. He said there was a moment of  strong confrontations but that now there is a new South Africa,  where there is peace, respect, and affection toward Cuba.</p>

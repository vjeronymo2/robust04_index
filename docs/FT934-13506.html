			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Aegis to raise Pounds 61m in rescue move AEGIS, the London-based holding company of Europe's largest media-buying and planning group, yesterday announced details of a rescue package centring on the issue of Pounds 61.2m new equity. An open offer of 231m new shares, at 20p a share, will raise Pounds 46.2m, with the rest coming from a preference share issue. Aegis's share price plunged 11p to 21 1/2 p yesterday. One of the underwriters is Omnicom, the US-based advertising giant, which is expected to become a significant shareholder in the group, prompting speculation that it could eventually combine its advertising activities with Aegis' media-buying. Aegis said yesterday that the refinancing was 'crucial to the future of the group and in the best interests of all holders of Aegis securities.' The group mainly operates through Carat, based in France, and has activities in 17 countries, employing 1,600. Aegis also announced that it would exchange convertible securities and warrants for ordinary shares, and cancel voting deferred shares. New banking facilities have been arranged with Samuel Montagu, National Westminster and Societe Generale. Aegis said its net debt has averaged Pounds 75m-Pounds 85m this year, on a monthly basis. The group, hit by changes in French law on media buying, reported pre-tax losses in 1992 of Pounds 1.9m, while turnover increased 35 per cent to Pounds 2.84bn. There was a move back into the black in the first half of this year with pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.2m. The company has said no dividends will be paid this year. It also announced yesterday that it would purchase the remaining 50 per cent of HMS, its German media-buying operation, for Pounds 15m. The restructuring and provisions for bad debts in Spain and irrecoverable assets in Holland would cost Pounds 14m in exceptional charges, it said. The refinancing will take effect from November 22, providing the necessary resolutions are passed at an extraordinary meeting on November 12. Other underwriters of the ordinary share offer are SFEC and SCP Lagoon - in settlement of deferred considerations - and Warburg, Pincus, the US financial institution. The preference share issue is underwritten by Electra. Lex, Page 24; Details, Page 26</p>

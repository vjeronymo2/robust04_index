			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Management: An approach to non-execs Last month's announcement that DHL chairman and chief executive Patrick Lupo has joined the board of WH Smith was routine in many ways. But the heartsearching which preceded his appointment as non-executive director of the British retailing group illustrates how leading British companies are adopting more professional and objective boardroom selection procedures. Interest in non-execs was fuelled by successive corporate scandals and by publication in 1992 of the Cadbury report, which laid down guidelines for best practice in corporate governance. Smith chairman Jeremy Hardie, though, is not alone in thinking that the 'regulatory' issues raised by Cadbury have overshadowed the often more challenging and significant role for boards of determining company strategy. 'In many businesses,' observes Hardie, 'the directors turn up once a month, receive a lot of (predominantly financial) information, find out what the profits are likely to be, and generally keep tabs on what is going on. Inevitably many of the decisions to be taken are cut and dried as the board is primarily there as a check.' The Smith chairman, who led the 15-month hunt to replace Edward Elson, and who is also a director of John Swire &amp; Sons, is careful not to knock that model. His ideal, though, is of a group of experienced outsiders contributing ideas and insights helpful to the company's day-to-day managers. 'In extremis the board has got an authoritative function because directors are trustees of the assets. Most of the time the function should be a collegial one supporting and working together.' Hardie says the people running companies 'are often short of certain insights', and there is a fear inside most organisations about 'making mistakes' - but with non execs, he says, 'it doesn't matter, every now and then it even helps'. Hardie insists non-execs are there 'to draw on their experience across a wide range of issues' and believes it is wrong to use vacancies to fill a resource need. 'If you're thinking of moving into Spain you can hire a consultant, get someone in the corporate planning department to look at Europe, or find a director with Spanish experience. I'm against this last idea.' Smith used the headhunting firm Spencer Stuart as part of a process which also resulted in the appoint-ment of Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of the Economist Group.</p>

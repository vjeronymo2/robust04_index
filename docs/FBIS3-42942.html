It should be noted that so far only three branch plants of  large state enterprises have been privatized. There was a time  when the republic, having adopted the Law "On Privatization of  Land," was in the orbit of economic reforms. At the time the  foreign press wrote about the courage of the Republic of Armenia  Government, about a radical turn in the national economy away  from command and toward market methods. However, the reformist  zeal gradually ran out, and now Armenia is bringing up the rear  in this process. They have been talking about a market economy  for four years now, but what market relations may there be in  the absence of privatization and private property? Three hundred  shops and other small facilities hardly make a difference.    Speaking at the session, Chairman of the State Committee for  Privatization Simon Konakhchyan stated that the privatization of  more than 8,900 facilities is envisioned within the framework of  the 1994 program--shops, enterprises processing agricultural  products and manufacturing consumer goods, and facilities under  construction. At present, the fixed capital of the republic is  appraised at 12.5 billion drams. The plan for this year is to  privatize property worth 2.3 billion drams. In the process,  transportation, railways, nuclear power stations, and quite a  number of other facilities are not subject to privatization.    Supporters of the adoption of the government program believe  that it will assist in setting in motion a new economic  mechanism and embarking on a civilized path of economic  development which will, of course, bring about favorable social  changes within society.    Many members of parliament, in particular the fraction of  the  Armenian National Movement (AOD), have come out in favor of the  immediate approval of the program, pointing out that under these  conditions in which the state lacks funds, bridges, roads, and  residential buildings have ended up as facilities under  construction. They may be commissioned within short periods of  time upon being privatized with the help of foreign investment.    The opposition did not have a uniform opinion on this issue.  From the point of view of the Ramkavar-Azatakan Party (Liberal  Democrats), privatization will make it possible to begin the  formation in the republic of an owner class in the absence of  which an amelioration of the economic situation is  inconceivable. Some deputies (from the Dashnaktsutyun, the  Communist Party of the Republic of Armenia, and the  National-Democratic Union) called on their colleagues not to be  in a hurry for two reasons: first, because of the absence of the  necessary legal foundation, and second, because Armenia, which  as a matter of fact is on a wartime footing, needs a maximum of  control and centralization of all resources in the hands of the  state.    All the i's were dotted by the presentation of President  Ter-Petrosyan, who pointed out that privatization is unavoidable  and recalled that even the Declaration of Independence of  Armenia passed in September 1990 referred to the need to  establish market relations. Besides, small enterprises account  for 61 percent of the facilities to be privatized. Therefore, in  essence, the proposal was to approve the program of small-scale  privatization.    Thereafter, the program was passed by a majority vote.</p>

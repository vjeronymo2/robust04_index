After his meetings yesterday with the major parties, Ciampi  this morning met with delegations from the Network, Green and  Communist Refoundation parties. In the afternoon, after a  working lunch with the director of the International Monetary  Fund, Ciampi will receive representatives from the Italian  Social Movement, Sudtyroler Volkspartei [South Tirol People's  Party] and Union Valdotaine [Valdostan Union].    The traditional government parties yesterday urged Ciampi to  stay at his post and delay a vote until combined European  Parliament and early elections can be held in June, while most  of the smaller opposition parties, as well as the Left  Democrats, the Northern League and the Italian Social Movement  want elections as soon as possible.    The no-confidence motions were submitted by Federalist Party  leader Marco Pannella and were signed mostly by members of the  four governing parties -- Christian Democrats, Socialists,  Social Democrats and Liberals. The premier's resignation in fact  would prevent the president from dissolving parliament until a  new coalition cabinet is formed.</p>

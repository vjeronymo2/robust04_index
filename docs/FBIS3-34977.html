Saudi Arabia announced some months ago  that it intended to purchase 60 planes to complete its  passenger-plane fleet. Thus, it began talks with the U.S.  companies Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, as well as with the  European Airbus Consortium.    Political analysts believe that handing this bid over to the  United States is more for political rather than commercial  reasons, and that various elements were involved in this  decision. The agreement of U.S. arms manufacturers one month  ago to accept installment repayments of the military loans of  Saudi Arabia, which was unable to repay its debts because of the  drop in oil prices, is one of the most important elements.  Also, the U.S. aircraft-manufacturing companies offered more  benefits than their European competitors in an effort to  maintain their world markets, especially under current  conditions when White House officials are trying to help the  U.S. economy emerge from its recession by expanding foreign  markets.    Bill Clinton's contacts with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia may  have been the most important reason why the bid for the purchase  of dozens of passenger planes went to an American company. This  contact--especially during the newly commenced economic war  between the United States and Japan--is of great significance.  Even though economic sanctions on Tokyo, which Clinton has  threatened, would deprive Japan from the large U.S. market, it  would also limit U.S. access to the Japanese market; this has  set a new priority for U.S. economic policy of expanding its  international markets as much as possible.</p>

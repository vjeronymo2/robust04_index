			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Cater Allen edges up to Pounds 10.1m at midway Pre-tax profits at Cater Allen Holdings, the discount house and banking group, edged ahead from Pounds 9.85m to Pounds 10.1m in the six months to October 31, partly because money market banking did not match the 'exceptionally high profit of the same period of 1993.' Profits from this area declined to Pounds 2.99m (Pounds 5.27m), while stock lending activities grew to Pounds 5.83m (Pounds 3.75m). Offshore trust and banking business made Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 1.86m) and losses from Lloyd's agencies were reduced to Pounds 546,000 (Pounds 1.12m). Financial futures brought in Pounds 295,000 (Pounds 440,000). In June the group launched a Pounds 32.3m rights issue and in August it acquired the banking operations of Jupiter Tyndall, the asset management group, and Compass Trust Group, a Jersey-based trust. Cater said the latter deal would extend its trust business, which is part of its private banking business on the island. Sheppards Moneybrokers also received some of the rights money. Cater said the investment of the rights proceeds had earned a return of 15 per cent a year before tax. Profits at Cater Allen Ltd, the money market bank and discount house, were satisfactory, the group said, at a time when interest rates generally rose. Cater said that, as an operator at the centre of the secured money market, Cater Allen Ltd approved of the development of an open gilt repo market after June 1995 to increase liquidity, efficiency and broaden investor participation in the gilt-edged market. Earnings per share declined to 24p (28p) and the interim dividend is held at 8p.</p>

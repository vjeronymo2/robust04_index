			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Leading Article: The trouble with insurance FOR UK clearing bankers who are now paying heavily for the ill-judged loans and acquisitions they made in the 1980s, there is at least one consolation. Their opposite numbers in the insurance business appear to have been quite as successful at finding novel ways of losing their shareholders' and policyholders' money. The news that General Accident is to wind down the banking interests of its NZI Corporation subsidiary in New Zealand, having failed to find a buyer, is just one of several unhappy legacies from diversification moves that continue to haunt British insurers. Others include the loss-making incursions by Prudential and others into estate agency, Guardian Royal Exchange's unhappy joint venture into the Italian insurance market and Eagle Star's adventures in property loan insurance. Why, it might be asked, do these mistakes seem to come in neatly ordered batches? Clearly the insurance company losses are not on the same scale as those incurred by the banks in the Third World or in property. But nor is it coincidence that banks and insurers found themselves taking unusual risks at much the same time. The problems of the banks could be rationalised by pointing to the impact of excess monetary expansion on a sector whose core business was being eroded by excessive competition. Underlying profitability was inadequate, yet the obvious solutions - hostile takeovers and corporate bankruptcies - were not permitted to whittle down sufficiently the number of banks chasing unprofitable business. Overcapitalised Insurance, too, is a mature industry. And while monetary policy does not have such a direct impact, it does have an influence through asset prices and the broader pattern of the economic cycle. In the mid-1980s stock markets were riding high at a time of increasing underwriting profitability, causing solvency margins to soar way above the legally required levels. Insurance companies were thus overcapitalised; and since this is an industry in which there is no equivalent of the industrialist's fixed or working capital requirement, cash flow tended to burn a hole in insurance companies' pockets. The process then accelerated further, as 1992 fever gripped Europe. British insurers started to worry that their open capital markets would make them vulnerable to foreign takeovers. Against that background the acquisition of estate agents looked an attractive way of obtaining access to customers in a more competitive market. At the same time growth by acquisition looked a tempting substitute for a genuine strategy for selling insurance products in the single market. In practice ownership strategies were heavily influenced by availability of listed companies. Continental European insurers plunged into the mature US market because there were companies there to buy. New Zealand gave British insurers an entree to otherwise inaccessible countries in South East Asia. Perverse result Overcapitalisation naturally provided a temptation to overpay. And the result has been strikingly perverse. General Accident's acquisition of a New Zealand insurance and banking conglomerate has resulted in Britain importing New Zealand's banking bad debts. The Italians have recycled the skeletons in their domestic motor insurance industry's cupboard to a British company that was chiefly interested in the Italian life market. An army of British estate agents has been absurdly enriched. The consumer of insurance services, meantime, has yet to see much benefit. When an industry moves from cartelisation to liberalisation it is inevitable, whether in insurance or banking, that management aspiration will outstrip capability. That problem is magnified by the huge challenge inherent in conglomerate or cross-border acquisitions where managers abandon familiar territory for the great unknown. Yet some boards of directors have exercised a more judicious restraining influence than others. Too many non-executive directors have failed to pull their weight.</p>

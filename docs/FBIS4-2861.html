			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China's State  Development Bank (SDB), one of the three policy-oriented banks  set up as part of a scheme to reform China's financial system,  went into operation today.    The move will ensure the smooth flow of capital to key state  projects and provide the central government with a powerful  vehicle to rein in excessive investment in fixed assets, said  Yao Zhenyan, president of the new bank.    According to Yao, the new bank, basically a merger of the  six  investment corporations under the State Planning Commission,  will handle low-interest loans for important infrastructure  construction projects and basic industries which have been  bottlenecks in China's economic expansion in recent years.    It is also expected to channel funds for the technical  renovation of backbone state enterprises.    The bank already has 345 large and medium-sized projects to  support, which include the initial preparations for the giant  Three- Gorges Dam, construction of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway  and several big power stations, said Yao, former vice-minister  of the State Planning Commission.    The funding will come from the national treasury, which has  promised to inject a total of 50 billion yuan over the next four  years as part of the bank's capital assets.    However, the working capital will come mainly from bonds  issued to financial institutions which have been instructed by  the People's Bank of China, the Central Bank, to purchase SDB  bonds at a certain proportion of their new deposits.    This year, Yao said, the bank will issue some 65 billion  yuan- worth of bonds. The first issue of 28.5 billion  yuan-worth will be made during April and May.    The national treasury will grant the bank 1.3 billion yuan  this year as discount on funded indebtedness.    "It is likely that the SDB will sell bonds to Chinese  individuals and float bonds, though not this year," said Yao.    But the new bank president stressed the importance of  investment efficiency.    "As it is a state bank," said Yao, "we must ensure the  return  of principal, although we are not aiming at profits."    At present, the right to choose target projects will stay  with the State Planning Commission, "but we have a great say in  deciding the timing of capital lending after feasibility studies  of the projects," said Yao. He added that the SDB has a special  working group comprised of senior SDB officials and experts to  see that credits flow to the projects most in need of capital.    The SDB will gradually set up branch offices in regions with  a relatively high number of key projects, and establish overseas  agencies if necessary.    According to the 61-year-old president, SDB has set about  reviewing all the projects taken over by the bank this year.    "We will try to see that the projects get 40 percent of the  funding required this year," said Yao.    Sources at the central bank say the formation of the other  two policy-based banks, designed to support imports and exports  and agriculture, respectively, is under way.</p>

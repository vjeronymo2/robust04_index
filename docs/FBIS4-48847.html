			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos at the opening </F> of the third session of the Council of Republic at the Futungo  de Belas Palace in Luanda on 27 May -- recorded]    [Text] Distinguished members of the Council of the  Republic, between our last meeting and today's, I asked for the  distribution of a (?report) on the complex peace talks under way  in Lusaka, for your information. The government and the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] are  holding peace talks in Lusaka with a view to establishing peace  and national reconciliation.    I decided to convene this meeting because, despite the  progress that is being observed, there is still a way to go.  (?You are all aware) of the issues that remain to be discussed.  Discussions on these important issues have not been easy.  UNITA has been presenting concerns and at times adopting stands  which openly go against the country's Constitution. If these  positions are accepted, they would disenchant all the Angolan  people who believed and continue to believe that it is possible  to establish in the country a true multiparty democracy, without  setting conditions of ethnical, regional, or racial nature.    Our immediate objective is to achieve a just and lasting  peace to end the suffering of the Angolan people. For this  reason we have been adopting an open and tolerant stand, which  does not senselessly bank on contradictions and  misunderstandings but which will on the contrary contribute to  draw up our common future here in Angola, within the framework  of a patriotic and constructive spirit. Under the present  circumstances, we do not think it makes sense to opt for radical  solutions that will exclude part of our people -- no matter how  small that part is -- or even some of its representatives from  the democratic game or the tasks of reconstruction and national  development.    We want to obtain an understanding that will benefit all the  Angolan people. We still have very many difficult and delicate  issues on the working agenda. They include the situation of the  Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel, the reinstatement of  state administration in occupied areas, Jonas Savimbi's status,  the role of the Joint Political and Military Commission, and so  on.    I am convinced that in view of this reality, the  distinguished members of the Council of the Republic will be  able to present views and give advice, as has been the case in  previous occasions. In your reflections, it is probable that  you could have the South African process as a point of  reference. The South African process is truly a good example.  All the same, it is important to know that it is a different  country, with problems which are also very different from ours.  The lessons that the Angolan people can draw from their  experience is that all the protagonists of the political process  abandoned violence and war as a means of politics. When UNITA  decides to embrace this example there will be peace in Angola.  There is a need to force UNITA to end the war. This could be  done through strong pressure from the international community or  through our military or political pressure.    Also with regard to South Africa, I would like to take this  opportunity to inform you that our foreign minister will soon  meet with the new South African foreign minister to discuss  issues of common interest to the two countries. He is not going  to request South Africa's participation in the negotiating  process between the Angolan Government and UNITA, since this  process has already been defined within the framework of the  Bicesse Accords. The foreign minister will make the first  attempt to establish general foundations for a broad and  multifaceted cooperation with mutual benefits.    As you are aware, the past has been characterized by wars of  aggression on one side and solidarity on the other. We want to  bury all that was negative and validate what was positive, but  history must be assumed by all of us. South Africa has  obligations toward Angola, resulting from some resolutions of  the UN Security Council.    In conclusion, I would also like to inform you that I  recently sent a letter to His Excellency President Bill Clinton  of the United States. The letter was in reply to his promise of  concrete guarantees, within the framework of the United Nations,  for a strict implementation of an eventual agreement that could  be signed in Lusaka. In the letter, I expressed my desire to  consult all opinion sectors in the country to obtain a minimum  consensus to allow the government to adopt a decision relating  to some of the suggestions of the mediators, in conditions of  some political stability.    These are just some of the actions that we are undertaking  to  achieve peace. It is only in a climate of peace and  reconciliation that the government's economic and social program  can finally halt the serious crisis facing the country. The  program, now in the implementation phase, has received praise  from international financial organizations for the courage and  realism demonstrated. Thus, we could begin to find a solution to  the pressing problems facing our people, by stabilizing the  national currency, enhancing the value of our salaries, making  investments viable, and resuming economic growth. We have,  through concrete actions, to guarantee our people's confidence  in the existing institutions and reinstate the authority of the  organs of sovereignty at all levels to prevent our newly  established democracy to be subverted by the opportunism and  ambition of those who place their personal interests above the  interests of the people and the nation. I count on your  contribution.    I thus declare officially open this third session of the  Council of the Republic.</p>

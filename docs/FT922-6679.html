			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Climate changes may cut cereal production Climate change could cut world cereal production by between 1 and 7 and per cent and put up to 360m extra people at risk of hunger in the next century, a scientific study has found. The largest reductions in staple crop yields, of 9 to 11 per cent, would occur in developing countries, while developed countries at higher latitudes might increase yields. Reduced supply could lead to price rises of 25-150 per cent. Slower population growth and a number of other measures, such as full trade liberalisation, adaptation of agricultural practices and faster economic growth, could mitigate but not neutralise the effects, and the impact on developing countries could still be severe. The three-year project by 50 scientists around the world investigated the effect of three global warming scenarios of varying severity on yields of wheat, rice, maize and soya, and on world food prices, using computer models to make projections up to the year 2060. The study was commissioned by the US Environmental Protection Agency and jointly managed by the Oxford University Environmental Change Unit and Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Copies of the report will be circulated to delegates attending the Earth Summit in Rio next month. Current environmental policies were taken into account, but proposed restrictions on the emission of greenhouse gases were not. The study also assumed benefits from the direct effects of increased levels of carbon dioxide, which in experiments have been found to increase plant growth. But it is not known whether these benefits would be fully realised outside experimental conditions.</p>

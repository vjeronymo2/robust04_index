			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said today that it has  completed all the necessary legal procedures to withdraw from  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as of June 13.    KOREA'S CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) reported that Foreign  Minister Kim Yong-nam had sent a notice to Warren Christopher,  secretary of state of the United States, which is the depository  state of the IAEA statute, on the same day as Pyongyang  announced its withdrawal from the world's nuclear watchdog body.    This move, which is in accordance with the related principle  of the IAEA statute, means that the DPRK Government has  completed all the legal procedures necessary for the withdrawal,  according to KCNA.    The statement came on the second day after the IAEA said  that  the DPRK has failed to formally inform the agency of its  decision as well as not presenting a written notice to the  United States.    The actual state of the withdrawal will be decided by the  agency's secretariat after it gives an official reply to the  DPRK's written notice to the United States, which should be  submitted in advance, said the IAEA.    Pyongyang Monday announced its withdrawal and said it will  permit no more IAEA inspections for the continuity of nuclear  safeguards in the country after the IAEA decided on June 10 to  impose sanctions against it.    In the notice to Christopher, Kim described the IAEA  decision  as "another unjust resolution" despite DPRK's "strong opposition  and warnings" and said: "The secretariat has pursued the  dishonest political purposes of stifling the DPRK under the  pretext of its inspections rather than seeking a fair resolution  of the nuclear issue."</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Arts: In the spirit of myth-making - Cinema INNOCENT MOVES (PG) Steven Zaillian THE PAPER (15) Ron Howard WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE? (12) Lasse Hallstrom MY FATHER THE HERO (PG) Steve Miner We all know why we love Hollywood, when we do not bow to intellectual dogma and say we hate it: because the place is determined to turn the mundane into the magical. Look at Innocent Moves, a film about a father-child relationship tested by the boy's rise as a chess prodigy. And even when the transformation does not quite work - listen for the sound of creaking corsetry and snapping stays as The Paper inflates the journalist's life into a melodrama the size of Mr Blobby - we love Hollywood for its urge to risk all in pursuit of the grand and passionate. I have just come back from the place and can testify that nothing has changed. Little can dent Tinseltowners' up-and-at-em nature: not earthquakes, nor murders, nor smog, nor the worst post-Oscars famine of good American movies I can remember. Topping the box office was - ultimate humiliation for non-limeys - a British film: the romantic comedy Four Weddings And A Funeral, opening here next week. So what has happened to the men and women lost in self-congratulation only a month ago, when Schindler's List swept a quality Oscars night? Looking for fresh directions and fresh directors - while staying true to the myth-making spirit. One Oscar winner, Schindler screenwriter Steven Zaillian, has got behind a camera and made Innocent Moves: a film so good that it did only medium business in the US under the over-enterprising name Searching For Bobby Fischer. This title recklessly assumed familiarity with Fischer's name in a country where many people have not heard of Arthur Miller, Einstein or the Pope. The plot is plain. Seven-year-old Josh, played by real-life chess prodigy Max Pomeranc, rises from early promise outwitting chess hustlers in New York's Washington Square to a will-he-won't-he finale in which he faces the reigning champ. But the drama is less in the climax than in all that goes before. Zaillian moves the characters themselves around like thinking chess pieces. Joe Mantegna is kindly-bullying Dad, charging forward or sideways like a chutzpah-fortified castle. Ben Kingsley is Josh's European teacher, zigzagging in crafty knight moves. And imperious Robert Stephens, the rival's mentor, drawls in bishop-like diagonals across every crowded room. Some Copland-ish music by James Horner reminds us how close this film could have been to pure American corn. But intelligence keeps outflanking mere inspirationalism. Zaillian knows when to hasten his story with montage sequences, pasting-and-scissoring whole weeks or months in speedy scrapbooks of images. And he knows when to slow to one perfect, glowing image: like the close-ups of Pomeranc (excellent), sitting luminous in thought over his chequered battleground. Newspaper buildings, as we all know who work in them, are orderly places full of crisp business suits and calm, incisive decision-making. But what is a newspaper office in a Hollywood movie? To judge by The Paper - idiotically enjoyable even when idiotic - it is something between the bridge of the Titanic and the last days of Pompeii. Michael Keaton, city editor of the New York Sun, needs a crisis a day to keep his adrenalin going. So writers David and Stephen Koepp and director Ron Howard (Backdraft, Far And Away) decide to test him with an overdose. What about three crises? In the morning and evening our baby-faced perpetuum mobile must deal with a miscarried justice story about two young blacks wrongly arrested for a shooting. In the afternoon he has a job interview at the snooty New York Sentinel (read New York Times). And throughout the day his wife Marisa Tomei is in the last stages of pregnancy. This New York could exist only in Hollywood. But the advantage of over-egging a pudding is that no one can complain about the quality of the eggs. Dome-pated Robert Duvall sizzles away as Keaton's editor, whose own panjandrum of crises includes an estranged daughter and a 'prostate the size of a bagel.' There is Randy Quaid, hardboiled hack par excellence. And there is the toughest egg of all, assistant editor Glenn Close. She insists on 'rolling the presses' - cue trembling floorboards and San Andreas sound effects in the upstairs newsroom - before Keaton has made his final dash to the cop shop for that clinching piece of police evidence for his 'They didn't do it' story. Add a fight and another shooting and by the last reel almost everyone is being carried off in an ambulance. But in Hollywood this is what they think of as real life. No day goes by there without the sweet music of emergency-service sirens. The Paper has nothing to do with the New York newspaper business, everything to do with the nerves of a city where a day without make-or-break news is counted a day lost. The whimsical, under-energised What's Eating Gilbert Grape? demonstrates another truth about America's movie capital. Hollywoodites believe that once you step outside Los Angeles time stands still. The entire country - this film is set in Endora, Iowa - consists of hicks, hillbillies and the handicapped, frozen in American Gothic postures. Strike that frown: clasp that pitchfork: chew, if possible, that cornstalk. Here is stalk-chewing Johnny Depp, who divides his days between tending his oversize Momma - 'Did yer ever see a beached whale on television?' is how he describes her to strangers - and saving his mentally retarded brother Leonardo DiCaprio from suicidal escapades. DiCaprio keeps climbing the town water tower, to the distress of Depp and the enthusiastic curiosity of undertaker Crispin Glover. Then a girl floats into town. She is Juliette Lewis, a trailer waif with a line in mystical repartee. Show her a sky and she will quaver 'So-o limitless]' Which boy, if either, will she enchant or ensnare? Screenwriter Peter Hedges, adapting his own novel, must have been force-fed Carson McCullers as a child. Archness and bucolic surrealism reign, though McCullers herself would have ensured there was some muscle under the mimsy mythopoeia. But better Gilbert Grape than My Father The Hero. This time Hollywood takes an even larger step outside its own borders and an even smaller step imaginatively. Remake a recent French movie. Hire the same star, Gerard Depardieu, to play the jealous father holidaying with his nubile daughter on a paradise isle. Have the daughter pretend that Dad is her ageing boyfriend. And then sit back to watch the film nosedive at the box office. Deservedly too. For the original film's slender wit and charm, read the Disney Studio stomping across the sand in size-12 schmaltz-boots. Hollywood could not, of course, get to the all-French-made Germinal, also starring Depardieu. But unfortunately neither could I. I returned from Lotusland on Sunday to find that the press show, like that for M. Butterfly, had happened last week. Watch for both in next week's space.</p>

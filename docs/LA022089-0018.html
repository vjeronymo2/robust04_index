			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OHIO RIVER BARGES SPILL GAS AFTER MISHAP; ENVIRONMENT PERIL STUDIED  </P> <P> Seven barges carrying gasoline broke free from a towboat Sunday on the Ohio  River and spilled an estimated 40,000 gallons of fuel into the river after  striking a railroad bridge piling, officials said.  </P> <P> Recovery of the gasoline was impossible because it had been diluted, said Rich  Carter, assistant chief of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency's Office of  Emergency Response.  </P> <P> "No impact has been observed thus far," he said.  </P> <P> Other downstream communities close enough to be affected draw their water from  wells or underground aquifers, Carter said. The river's speedy flow makes the  spill unlikely to affect water supplies or aquatic life much, he said.  </P> <P> The rain-swollen Ohio River crested Saturday at 52.2 feet, inches above flood  stage, and was falling Sunday. The spill posed the most immediate threat to the  Louisville, Ky., water system about 100 miles downstream.  </P> <P> Gasoline tends to float on the water's surface, and authorities said water  systems served by the river could close their intakes until the gasoline floats  past. The spill occurred downstream from Cincinnati's intakes, officials said.  </P> <P> The barges were being pushed down the river by the towboat MV Super America  from an Ashland Oil Inc. refinery at Ashland, Ky., to an Ashland products  terminal on the river in Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Officials at the scene said several other towboats helped recapture the loose  barges. Carter said two oil company facilities were draining the remaining  gasoline from the leaking barges.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rebecca Sanchez Fernandez from the "Early </F> Morning" newscast]    [Text] This Wednesday, the Federal Electoral Institute  [IFE] General Council received Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon's  documents requesting his accreditation as PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate replacing Luis  Donaldo Colosio. The formal request presented to the IFE  includes documents attesting the PRI National Executive  Committee's unanimous decision for Ernesto Zedillo for the  1994-2000 period. The accreditation request was presented to the  IFE General Council so this institute can issue an opinion  during its next extraordinary session. On the other hand,  Ernesto Zedillo announced that he plans to coordinate his own  political campaign.    Early yesterday morning, Fidel Velasquez Sanchez, leader of  the Confederation of Mexican Workers [CTM] went to the PRI  national headquarters to express his support to the new  presidential candidate. Mr. Ernesto Zedillo reiterated his  decision to honor the commitments with the labor sector adopted  by Luis Donaldo Colosio.    [Begin Zedillo recording, in progress] ...I fully expect to  honor the commitments agreed by Luis Donaldo Colosio and the CTM  as well as its affiliates. [applause] I would like to be  considered a supporter of the Mexican workers in order to  safeguard their demands and to be their staunchest ally in  defending their accomplishments. [end recording]    During an impromptu event, the PRI presidential candidate  headed to the PRI press room and met with the numerous  journalists following everything that has taken place. Zedillo  thanked them for attending and reiterated his absolute respect  for freedom of the press. He also referred to his presidential  campaign and indicated that the starting date had not been  decided yet.    [Begin Zedillo recording] I would like to say that so far,  everything related to coordinating the campaign will fall  directly under my supervision. I was doing this same type of  job for Mr. Luis Donaldo Colosio, and we had developed a  strategy he had previously approved and enriched with his own  suggestions and great experience. I plan to follow with that  same campaign plan. [end recording]    Later, Zedillo received a telephone call from Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria congratulating him on his nomination.  They agreed that Colombia and Mexico are united in their desire  to ensure the Bolivarian ideal of a more prosperous and  undivided America.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Cost of a loaf under threat as rain hits wheat crop UK BREAD prices may rise because of a bad harvest and the increased cost of imports due to the devaluation in sterling. Wet weather damage in southern England in August has left millers facing steep increases in the price of wheat used in bread-making. Mr Peter Baker, president of the National Association of British and Irish Millers (Nabim), said that wheat for delivery in January was at a record Pounds 162 a tonne. Before the harvest was disrupted, Nabim was expecting to pay around Pounds 148 a tonne. Mr Keith Marsh, sales director of British Bakeries, part of the Rank Hovis McDougall group, said it was inevitable that any increase in the price of flour would lead to an increase in the price of bread, but he could make no specific prediction until it was known how much flour would cost. Other cost increases also had to be taken into account, he said. The price of a white sliced loaf in the large supermarkets varies between 39p and 49p and has not been raised for about a year. John Malcolm of the National Farmer's Union said it was not surprising that millers were worried about supplies. The premium payable for bread-making wheat, which yields less tonnage per acre than feed wheat, had not encouraged farmers to plant it. Millers should contract with farmers to guarantee a fixed premium for bread-making wheat, he said. The UK mills about 3.3m tonnes of wheat for bread each year, importing a shortfall of 500,000 tonnes from other EC countries and Canada. This year, the UK harvest is likely to provide only 2m tonnes of bread-making quality, leaving an import requirement of 1.3m tonnes. Canada is also having weather problems and its export prices are expected to rise by 15 to 20 per cent. The fall-out from sterling's devaluation is also affecting the UK wheat market because of widening differences between sterling and the green pound, part of the EC's system for subsidising agricultural prices.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / UK life insurers poised to merge CLERICAL Medical and National Provident Institution, both mutually owned life insurers, are shortly expected to announce a merger creating a new company with Pounds 11bn in assets under management. The merger would be part of a growing trend among mutually owned life insurers, who need either to merge or demutualise in the quest for capital. Mutually owned life companies need to expand distribution channels and meet reserve requirements to write new business. Earlier this year, National Provident said it would limit sales of its single-premium with-profits bonds - the life industry's most successful product in the past year - due to concern about the strain the sales were placing on reserves. Sir Douglas Morpath, chairman of Clerical Medical, would only say there had been widespread speculation about the deal. However, he said Clerical Medical 'has been discussing business combinations with various parties for some time.' Last January, Clerical Medical said it would provide life office administration and investment management for a new joint venture life insurance company 92 per cent owned by National Westminster Bank. Sir Douglas said Clerical Medical, like other mutually owned life insurers, would have to consider its future in the face of growing competition from Europe and the need to raise capital for expansion.</p>

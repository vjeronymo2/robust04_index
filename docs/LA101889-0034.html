			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Mikis Theodorakis, a former Communist member of the Greek Parliament and the  composer of the music for the movie "Zorba the Greek," says he's going to run  for Parliament again, this time on a conservative party ticket. Theodorakis  resigned his seat in 1986 after 4 1/2 years in office, complaining that his  presence there had become pointless. He said the turnabout was prompted by the  slaying of Pavlos Bakoyannis, the spokesman for the New Democracy Party, by the  extreme left-wing November 17 guerrilla organization.STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

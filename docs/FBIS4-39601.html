			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning the Russia's Choice faction in the  State Duma decided to back the draft federal budget in the  second reading if 3.5 trillion rubles more are allotted for the  needs of defense structures, Russia's Choice member Sergey  Yushenkov told Interfax.    He stressed that as the Chairman of the State Duma Committee  on Defense he thought that the Army must be given 55 trillion  rubles instead of the 37 trillion rubles stated in the draft  budget. Yushenkov said he would vote for the proposal of the  parliamentary Budget Committee providing for the increase in the  funds for defense needs by 3.5 trillion rubles and for the  amendment put forward by the Committee on Defense demanding that  18 trillion rubles more be allotted for these purposes.</p>

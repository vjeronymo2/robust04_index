			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Carl Bildt by Lothar Ruehl; </F> place and date not given: "Russia Has No Right To Have a Say in  the Baltic States"]    [Text] [Ruehl] Mr. Prime Minister, with the expected  accession of Sweden and Finland to the European Union [EU] in  1995, West Europe's political and economic organization will be  expanded to northern Europe and will have a common external  border with Russia. You have called the Brussels membership  agreement the most important treaty that Sweden has concluded in  this century. Why?    [Bildt] With the accession of Sweden and Finland the EU will  adopt a northern European dimension. It would become even  larger and more fleshed out if Norway were to join the EU as the  fourth north European country. However, with Sweden and Finland  the EU will acquire a strong northern part, which will also  provide it with new strengths. In any case, Sweden will make  its contribution to that, as soon as the people have approved  accession, as I confidently expect they will do.    Of course, Sweden will fulfill the Maastricht Treaty and  support the entire construct as a full partner. We will also  participate in the common foreign and security policy without  any reservations or deductions. Similar to Finland, my country  has a special regional importance for northern Europe and the  Baltic Sea area, which means also for the relationship with the  three Baltic states and with Russia. Here a new situation will  develop for Europe.    [Ruehl] Some people fear or expect that the expansion of the  EU might loosen it and will, perhaps, even dissolve the  political consolidation and the economic ties again. What are  the Swedish interests? Will Swedish foreign policy move away  from traditional neutrality to such an extent, as you have  always indicated, that Sweden can act as a full, active security  partner also in the case of crises?    [Bildt] I do not share such fears about a loosening of the  EU ties, and I agree with Chancellor Kohl on this matter. Quite  certainly, Sweden has not decided to join the EU to dissolve it  or to weaken it. On the contrary. Sweden has always been part  of the liberal-democratic Europe; Swedish policy has always been  guided by its values. In the new situation in Europe, which has  developed since 1990 and which is no longer based on the policy  of blocs and on confrontation, accession is easier but no less  important than in the past. Another European prospect has been  opened up, not only by the Maastricht Treaty on the EU but also  toward the north and the east, toward those countries in Europe  which belonged to the Warsaw Pact and to the Soviet Union in the  past, including Russia. In this larger Europe there lies a  historic challenge for the expansion of freedom, which must be  consolidated together. Establishing common security is our  historic assignment. As an old European state, with its own  history of empire and its varied international experiences, in  particular in United Nations peacekeeping, Sweden will  contribute to that.    [Ruehl] What is the particular importance of northern  Europe, the usefulness of the northern European dimension of the  EU?    [Bildt] Quite clearly the changed geopolitical situation.  With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, especially the  independence of the Baltic states and of Ukraine, Russia has  been cut off from direct territorial contact with West Europe,  in particular since the last Russian troops will withdraw from  Germany this year. This new reality gives Sweden's accession to  the EU, with the consequence of West Europe's expansion to  northern Europe and to the Baltic Sea area, a particular  significance, because this establishes neighborhood with Russia  and with the three Baltic countries, which will naturally be  intensified by Finland's accession into the EU, which we expect.  A new ensemble is developing in the EU, which will link  Europe's northeast to the West. However, this does not mean a  delineation toward Russia but a bridge for coming closer  together. Northwest Russia is of great importance for Europe,  politically and culturally as well as economically and in  scientific-technological terms.    [Ruehl] Give us a specific example, please.    [Bildt] St. Petersburg as a large city and a region is twice  as large as Berlin. This area will be a focal area of modern  development that will radiate to the east, the Baltic, and the  center of Europe. Russia's ties with West Europe will develop  anew via the Baltic Sea, with the Baltic states and northern  Europe. Sweden is located in the center of this area with  historical ties and experiences toward both sides. Therefore,  it is important that it participate in formulating the interests  of the EU in East Europe and in the EU policy toward and  together with Russia as an EU partner. In the field of  security, the EU will border in the north on the Western focus  of Russia's Armed Forces and Navy: the deployment area of the  North Sea Fleet with missile-armed submarines, whose importance  as high-sea-capable, globally mobile carriers of nuclear  deterrence will even grow -- compared with the Soviet past -- as  a result of the START [Strategic Arms Reduction Talks] agreement  between the United States and Russia. Therefore, too, it is  good that Sweden, as a country experienced in dealing with  Russia and the Russian empire, can exert direct influence within  the EU on the EU's security policy.    [Ruehl] This also appeals to the Western European Union  [WEU] as the military policy defense pact of West Europe and  annex of NATO. What is Sweden's attitude toward the WEU and  toward this prospect? Does this touch upon the issue of  neutrality?    [Bildt] Neutrality, which has existed up to now, will not  hinder Sweden in this respect, because the preconditions for  neutrality in Europe have changed fundamentally; this means the  historical sense and purpose of neutrality have disappeared as a  result of the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact.    We are primarily interested in helping to build democratic  national defense systems which are oriented toward international  cooperation, in the former Warsaw Pact states, whose security  needs are to be covered by NATO's Partnership for Peace. For  that we can use Sweden's rich experience with our own defense  system as well as with our participation in UN peacekeeping  missions. However, the most important thing for Sweden is active  participation in the EU's common foreign and security policy,  because this means playing a key role in establishing stability  and security spread to all of Europe. When Sweden has become an  EU member, we will decide whether Sweden is to join the WEU or  whether it is just to have observer status. I think that the  latter is the more likely option.    [Ruehl] What is NATO's importance for European security in  the future? Should it expand toward the East and could all of  northern Europe become part of the Atlantic-West European  alliance system?    [Bildt] Not the latter; northern Europe and the Baltic Sea  area should be reintegrated in an all-European security  structure, together with the Baltic states, which are also part  of northern Europe. Of course, the Russian Federation, just as  well as other European states which belonged to the former USSR  should also be included in such a security structure. There  must not be a new delineation along a new dividing line through  Europe, after the division of the Cold War has now been  overcome. The EU, too, must find its place in such a security  structure. NATO has its focus in the West, as a counterweight,  so to speak, to Russia as the big power in East Europe and on  the Eurasian continent.    NATO remains important for the anchoring of the United  States  in Europe and for the defense of West Europe. It essentially  contributes to all-European security, for instance as a result  of the U.S. commitment to Norway's security, which, for its  part, is indispensable for security in all of northern Europe.  Sweden will develop special relations with the Baltic states to  strengthen their independence and security and to exert  influence on them so that they establish special security ties  with West Europe. The EU as well as the system of Partnership  for Peace with NATO are suitable for this purpose.    [Ruehl] Is the development not moving further into the  direction of NATO expansion to the east, beyond the "Atlantic  West Europe" toward Central Europe and beyond Poland and  Lithuania to the eastern Baltic Sea area?    [Bildt] This is correct, as far as Lithuania is concerned in  the Baltic area. However, the concept of NATO's Partnership for  Peace is flexible. Flexibility is the most important element of  the whole thing. It permits various solutions, tailored to the  specific security situation of the individual partners.    In general, one can say that this initiative can, to a  certain extent, bring about a gradual expansion of NATO in  Europe. However, the actual function of NATO, its central  function, lies in the West, in the relationship between North  America and West Europe in the narrower geographical sense,  which also includes Norway and Denmark and Germany. In  addition, the specific situation of the individual countries  remains the basis of common security.    [Ruehl] What does this mean for common security policy?    [Bildt] European security policy -- including that of NATO  and the EU -- must take this diversity into account and,  therefore, distinguish between the individual countries in the  spirit of the Partnership for Peace program. NATO cannot  organize unified security for all of Europe. However, it can  form a focus and thus be a major part of the foundation of the  European security structure.    As regards the three Baltic countries, they are realistic;  they know that their acceptance into NATO is not likely in the  foreseeable future. In the long term, however, everything is  open. The NATO Partnership for Peace, which they want to enter,  offers them contact. Sweden will help them, for instance in  military cooperation with NATO within the framework of the UN  for international peacekeeping: The "Nordic battalion" of the  four northern European states in the UN Protection Forces, in  which Sweden is essentially involved, can serve as an example  for the establishment of a "Baltic battalion." The northern  European countries can advise the Baltic states and support  their military training and organization. Cooperation with NATO  within the UN framework is necessary and useful, e.g. for  taking over and applying NATO standards and NATO procedures,  which have proved their worth at the international level.  Sweden can participate in this outside the formal NATO  framework, and the Baltic countries can as well. A pragmatic  policy permits this without expansion of the NATO alliance  framework.    [Ruehl] What are your expectations regarding the  development of the security situation in Europe between Russia  as the superpower in the East, and the Atlantic Alliance and the  EU in the West?    [Bildt] The threat of Soviet imperialism and an aggressive  ideological power policy has disappeared for good; it will not  be reestablished regardless of what trends will influence  Russia's foreign policy in the future and the relationship with  the outside world. The Soviet empire will not be revived.  After its loss of the empire and its position as an  international power, which the Soviet Union mainly held due to  its military strength and armament, Russia is currently  unsettled after the secession of large territories in Europe and  Asia and the independence of the former Soviet republics and the  ongoing state and economic crisis.    [Ruehl] And this unsettled situation does not exactly help  to stabilize the political situation in the region.    [Bildt] Well, this crisis will not be over soon.  Nevertheless, despite its weakening and the internal confusion,  Russia remains a major power due to its sheer size, its huge  population, its natural resources, and its still existing  industrial-technological potential. It also remains a potential  international risk factor, yet so far I do not see this  developing. On the contrary, Russia has so far remained ready to  cooperate, which can be seen in Russia's policy in the Bosnian  conflict.    [Ruehl] Is the resurgence of nationalism in Russia a danger?  What do Zhirinovskiy and the new majority in the Duma mean?    [Bildt] There is, of course, Russian nationalism, which is  being strengthened by the crisis and the misery; but this has  happened in the past too, and is currently also happening in  other countries. Russian nationalism is even necessary to a  certain extent. Russia must restore national pride and its  national identity after the humiliation it suffered as a result  of the decline of the Soviet Union. Yet this has to take place  in a democratic system. The nationalist and the old  national-Bolshevist forces are gathering; this is the  disquieting aspect of the development; but so far Russia has not  been overwhelmed by a wave of chauvinism.    [Ruehl] But Zhirinovskiy is a political nuisance.    [Bildt] No doubt about that. He is a political clown, who  is making a caricature of Russia, but who is certainly not  backed by a majority of Russians. The large cities, in  particular, Moscow and St. Petersburg, neither followed him nor  the other nationalists and the communists, with whom he entered  into a kind of "brown-red" front. Many Russians are ashamed of  Zhirinovskiy's excesses, which tarnish Russia's reputation; they  think it is a shame that Russia is being disfigured by a  charlatan. Zhirinovskiy will destroy himself, because he is  yelling for war, for invading all territories reaching to the  Indian Ocean, for the borders of the Czarist empire from the  beginning of the century.    [Ruehl] So you do not think that the people will follow his  slogans?    [Bildt] The Russian people will not follow Zhirinovskiy and,  after its experience in the Afghanistan war, the army will not  do so either. He is a grotesque phenomenon that will pass by as  others did before him in the history of Russia. Today, he is  personifying social protest in a situation of misery and  national frustration. Yet, it is doubtful that people will  follow him for a long time.    [Ruehl] What is your assessment of Russia's foreign policy  in general? How should one handle the "near abroad" as a sphere  of Russian interests?    [Bildt] Russian rhetoric about the "near abroad" and a  "special Russian role" there is incompatible with  good-neighborly relations and CSCE rules, particularly with the  Paris Charter for a new Europe of 1990, and the UN Charter.  Nobody must accept those claims because they mean interfering  in affairs of other states who have become sovereign and  independent. There is no "near abroad" that can be politically  controlled by Russia or any other power in Europe. The Baltics  are as close to Sweden and Finland as Russia, historically and  culturally even closer. In Estonia and Latvia there are  problems of political integration with the Slav part of the  population, which was transferred there in the Soviet era to  annihilate the national identity of these small peoples and to  control these countries from the inside. Yet, this is no reason  for Russia to claim a right to a say. Russia must not be  permitted to intervene there or anywhere else. The Russians are  also wrong when they claim that the "human rights" of the  Russian minorities would be violated. That is not true: The  new laws on citizenship are correct as is the treatment of the  Slav groups of the population. The Council of Europe helped to  work out these laws.    [Ruehl] How should Russia act toward its neighbors?    [Bildt] Russia now has a historic chance to find its way  back to Europe, to which it belongs. A new European order  requires equal rights and mutual respect. Spheres of interests  are not compatible with it. Neither is a security condominium  between Russia and NATO, including joint security guarantees for  former allies of the old Soviet Union. The litmus test for  Russia's intentions and its relationship toward Europe is  Russia's policy toward the Baltic states. This is the criterion  for European security and cooperation.    [Ruehl] Apart from the Baltics there is the question of East  Europe and the CIS. Ties that developed over a long period were  suddenly interrupted in 1991. Do you see that as a risk or as a  chance for a new beginning?    [Bildt] Geography, joint history, economic and human ties  between the peoples of the individual states rather speak for  careful rapprochement after the separation. It will not be a  return to the Russian empire or under Moscow's hegemony. Yet,  Belarus is already looking to Moscow again for guidance. There  are forces that are working toward voluntary association, but  there are also tensions that speak against it. The situation in  Ukraine is extremely critical, particularly since the reformist  forces do not dominate there, as could be seen in the election.  The post-Soviet and postimperial era has only just started, and  many things can still change; the current situation in East  Europe is one of transition. Rapprochement between Russia,  Ukraine, Belarus, and maybe even Kazakhstan for a great Slav  confederation appears to be possible. A CIS that is politically  and economically organized around Russia is one possibility that  would be geographically and economically plausible and,  moreover, would be historically founded.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] At Kanombe Airport in Kigali yesterday, where  Belgian troops have been getting ready to return home, handover  ceremonies were held between Belgian troops and the Ghanaian  troops who had previously been in the neutral zone between the  two sides. They came to replace the departing Belgian troops at  the airport. One of the departing Belgian soldiers, after  recalling the 10 colleagues who had been killed by government  troops, said they could not remain in Rwanda as part of UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] because they were  mistreated, and in some cases killed. They could not defend  themselves because of the instructions given to UNAMIR. The  soldier went so far as to say that Belgium will no longer send  its troops to the United Nations. Although the job of the  Belgians was rendered impossible and they were obliged to leave  Rwanda, they continued to show that they were willing to help  Rwanda. During the ceremonies yesterday, Belgian troops left  the Ghanaians all their equipment so that they could continue to  carry out the job previously done by Belgians without too many  problems.    The United Nations is still faced with the important problem  of replacing the Belgian troops within UNAMIR, as the country  was UNAMIR's most important component due to the skill of its  troops. It is said that even though they left their equipment,  their skills to use it are also needed. Apart from the skills,  they had the third biggest force, after Bangladesh which has 940  men and Ghana which has 840 men.    Therefore it is clear that the withdrawal of the Belgian  troops complicates the work of UNAMIR in Rwanda. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Weak prices leave Utd Energy in loss United Energy blamed weak oil and gas prices and unfavourable exchange rates for pre-tax losses of Pounds 52,000 for the six months to June 30, compared with profits of Pounds 91,000. For the full 1991 year, however, there were losses of Pounds 127,000. The result was despite an increase in turnover from Pounds 160,000 to Pounds 834,000. The figures included only a partial contribution from AmBrit International, which was acquired in February. The comparable figure was assisted by exceptional gains of Pounds 185,000 and net interest received of Pounds 42,000 whereas in the period under review there was a charge of Pounds 5,000. Losses per share came out at 0.2p (earnings 0.8p). Mr John Billington, chairman, said that the recent improvement in exchange rates, firmer oil and gas prices and increasing production volumes made the USM-quoted company cautiously optimistic.</p>

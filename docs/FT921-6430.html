			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / S Dakota vote deals blow to Bush PRESIDENT George Bush's re-election campaign showed signs of growing disarray yesterday as a weak vote in Tuesday's South Dakota primary reinforced signals of dissent among Republicans. Mr Bush's campaign advisers seem at a loss over how to reverse their candidate's plunging popularity. Unless they can stem the tide, many rightwing Republicans fear that their party could lose the presidency to the Democrats for the first time since 1976. While the president, the sole candidate on the ballot paper, won 69 per cent of the Republican primary vote in South Dakota, the remaining 31 per cent of Republican voters entered a protest vote against Mr Bush by casting their ballots for uncommitted delegates to the party's national convention, which chooses the presidential candidate. 'It shows a terrible endemic weakness of the George Bush candidacy,' said Mr Patrick Buchanan, the rightwing television commentator and former Nixon speechwriter who won 37 per cent of Republican votes in New Hampshire's primary last week. Mr Buchanan was excluded from the South Dakota ballot by the prairie state's party leadership. Mr Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst, described South Dakota's uncommitted Republican delegates as an 'anybody-but-Bush ticket.' While the Bush campaign could dismiss Mr Buchanan's vote in recession-scarred New Hampshire as a 'primal scream,' South Dakota, which has been hurt much less, showed that the president has so far failed to convince voters that he knows how to help the economy. This could damage him in other states with struggling economies such as Florida, which votes on March 10. One of Mr Bush's campaign co-chairmen in Florida, Senator Connie Mack, has made it plain he does not believe the president has taken the measure of the recession, and yesterday renewed his attack ecretary. Some conservative Republicans feel that Mr Bush himself has lost all credibility as a bulwark against higher taxes by breaking his 1988 campaign pledge of 'No new taxes' and argue that he needs a new, conservative treasury secretary to regain this credibility. Mr Bush's less than exuberant victory in South Dakota's Republican primary showed the dilemma for his campaign: he faces no serious obstacles to winning his party's nomination - indeed, he is likely to win every single state - but every weak victory will be chalked up as a loss. Bush campaign officials have been irked by a Washington Post report that former president Ronald Reagan had told friends Mr Bush was in political trouble because 'he doesn't seem to stand for anything.' However, after a 20 minute meeting with the president last night, Mr Reagan said he supported Mr Bush's candidacy 'to the fullest'. Among the Democrats, South Dakota's primary shed little light on the eventual outcome; all four major candidates still need to prove themselves with a strong victory in a neutral state in order to translate regional strength into national support. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who won with 40 per cent of the vote, badly needed this strong score to revive his flagging campaign. Mr Kerrey intends to take on Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who came third in South Dakota with 19 per cent, in Georgia on March 3, but his best chance of a victory may be in Colorado, on the same day. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, second with 26 per cent, would have liked a stronger performance, but has the funds and to compete in Maryland and Minnesota on March 3.</p>

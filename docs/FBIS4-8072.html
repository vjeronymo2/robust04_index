			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Scepan Aleksic from Cajnice] </F>   [Text] At about 1820 this evening, NATO forces bombed the  forces of the Herzegovina Corps in the region of Preljuc and  Goli Vrh, some 13 kilometers southwest of Gorazde. NATO air  forces carried out one attack.    The Command of the Herzegovina Corps is still not presenting  details as to whether the Serbian forces have suffered any  losses in the bombing. There is no confirmation of reports  carried in foreign media that two Serbian tanks have been  destroyed.    With this act, as most responsible people in the Command of  the Herzegovina Corps claim, NATO forces fell for Muslims lies,  and without any warning carried out open aggression on the army  and people of the Serbian Republic [of Bosnia-Herzegovina]. The  Command of the Herzegovina Corps this evening stated that the  units of the Herzegovina Corps did not enter Gorazde, thus  denying reports by the Muslim radio that they had already taken  half of the town.    Without checking the facts, this report was carried by many  western agencies this afternoon. That these claims are  groundless can be concluded by the statements of UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] representatives. It is incorrect that  artillery is shelling the city center of Gorazde, which is also  an invention by the Muslim propaganda machinery. Chemical  agents have not been used, as claimed by foreign agencies. The  truth is that chemical agents were used by the Muslims yesterday  and this morning, but without any major consequences for the  Serbian fighters.</p>

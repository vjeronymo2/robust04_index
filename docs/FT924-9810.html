			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Birds Eye on soya charges BIRDS Eye meat products were found to contain textured soya protein that was not mentioned in the food description, Telford magistrates in Shropshire heard yesterday. Branded items described as 'pure ground beef with a hint of seasoning' or 'two pieces of southern fried chicken' were not all they might seem from the packet descriptions, the prosecution alleged. Birds Eye Walls Ltd, of Walton-on-Thames, Surrey - part of the Unilever Group - denied seven charges brought by Shropshire County Council's Trading Standards Department. Four charges under the food labelling regulations said the name used for the products was not sufficiently precise to tell a buyer of the true nature of the food. Three others alleged false trade descriptions. Mr Robin Spencer, prosecuting, said the case centred on the use of textured vegetable protein in meat products and the way it was declared. The soya protein content was listed in the ingredients but was not included in the name of the products, even though it formed a substantial proportion of their make-up. 'The prosecution do not suggest there is any dishonesty to mislead but perhaps in the labelling Captain Birds Eye was sailing a little close to the wind.' When interviewed, Birds Eye allegedly said the soya was used to add texture and strength to the product and prevent shrinking. The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.</p>

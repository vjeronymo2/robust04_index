			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE DIAPER WAR PROPOSALS;  </P> <P> ECOLOGY: A LAWMAKER WANTS TO ENCOURAGE USE OF CLOTH DIAPERS BECAUSE OF  ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. SOME BUSINESS GIANTS OPPOSE THE IDEA OF WARNING LABELS  ON THE DISPOSABLE VARIETY.  </P> <P> It's cloth vs. disposable. Environmentalism vs. convenience. Manufacturers vs.  delivery services.  </P> <P> The Diaper Wars are heating up in the Legislature.  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) has introduced legislation -- bitterly  opposed by such industry giants as Proctor &amp; Gamble -- to encourage parents  to swaddle their babies in reusable cloth diapers instead of the more common  disposable variety.  </P> <P> One of Killea's bills would tack a label on all disposable diapers, warning  that "single-use disposable diapers pose significant environmental problems and  costs when disposed. The state of California recommends that you consider  reuseable diapers for your daily diaper needs." The other bill would require  all day-care centers to give parents the option of wrapping their children in  cloth diapers.  </P> <P> Environmentalist groups such as the Sierra Club strongly support Killea's  legislation because they believe that disposable diapers are a major  environmental hazard. Every year, Californians dispose of 2.5 billion plastic  diapers -- enough to cover a 10-foot-wide strip of Interstate 5 from the  Mexican border to Oregon, according to Craig Reynolds, Killea's chief of staff.  He said that it costs $50 million annually to dispose of all those diapers.  </P> <P> Killea said she is "confident" that warning labels will reduce the use of  disposable diapers. "When people find out about the problems of disposable  diapers, their immediate reaction is, 'Oh, I may not be able to give up  disposable diapers all the time but it's a good argument,' " she said. "It will  have an effect."  </P> <P> Diaper manufacturers argue that while Killea's legislation may hurt their  sales, it will not have a significant impact on the amount of waste headed for  California landfills.  </P> <P> "Disposable diapers contribute less than 2% of the entire flow into solid waste  landfills," said Victor F. Stefan, a Sacramento lobbyist for Proctor &amp;  Gamble. "There's no reason for banning disposable diapers since they have such  a small effect on the landfills."  </P> <P> When told of Stefan's comments, Sierra Club lobbyist Gordon Hart exclaimed:  "Only 2%? My gracious! You know how many consumer goods there are -- and it's  incredible if one of those goods represents 2% of the waste stream, especially  when there's an obvious alternative for it."  </P> <P> Killea's bill requiring day-care centers to give parents the option of using  cloth diapers passed the Senate unanimously, breezed through two Assembly  committees, and is scheduled for an Assembly floor vote this week.  </P> <P> The bill requiring the warning label on disposable diapers has had rougher  sledding. It was rejected by a Senate committee but reintroduced in the  Assembly, where it passed one committee and is scheduled to be heard by the  powerful Assembly Ways and Means Committee this week.  </P> <P> The prospects for the child-care bill becoming law are considered better than  the warning bill's chances. Supporters fear that Gov. George Deukmejian, who  has not taken a stand on the issue, may object to the warning bill because of  its perceived anti-business slant.  </P> <P> The cloth vs. disposable diapers debate has sprung up in recent years as part  of a general wave of environmentalism. Disposable diapers started to dominate  the market in the 1960s, and now account for 85% of all diaper sales. But many  parents have begun to rebel against the plastic underpants, leading to a  resurgence of the more traditional cloth variety.  </P> <P> Cloth diapers, often reused as many as 85 times, cost about the same or a  little less to buy than the disposable diapers, which usually run 20 cents to  25 cents per diaper. Parents can also use one of the resurgent diaper services.  </P> <P> Dy-Dee Diaper Service -- one of the largest delivery companies in Southern  California -- has experienced 200% growth during the last two years, President  Tim O'Neil said. Dy-Dee serves 22,000 customers in Orange, Riverside and Los  Angeles counties who pay $12.80 per week for 90 cloth diapers delivered to  their doors, he said.  </P> <P> O'Neil attributed his company's phenomenal growth not only to increased  environmental awareness, but to what he described as the health benefits of  cloth diapers. The cotton diapers breathe more easily than plastic diapers,  they are treated with a "germ fighter," and their acid level is individually  adjusted for each baby, he said.  </P> <P> Robert W. Stewart, a spokesman for Proctor &amp; Gamble in Cincinnati, argued  that disposable diapers are more convenient as well as more healthy than cloth  underpants. The plastic diapers are designed with a layer close to the baby's  skin that absorbs liquid and prevents babies from getting an infection or  diaper rash, he said.  </P> <P> Stewart said that a recent study conducted for his company by the management  consulting firm of Arthur D. Little Inc. found that cloth diapers have no  environmental advantage over their disposable counterparts. "Cloth diapers  consume more water, release higher levels of total water pollutants and emit  higher levels of total air pollution," he said.  </P> <P> The Sierra Club's Hart strongly disagreed. Citing the landfill problem as well  as the hazardous wastes emitted during the manufacture of disposable diapers,  he said: "I think the environmental community is quite convinced that any  (negative) impacts from cloth diapers are clearly outweighed by the harmful  impact of disposable diapers on the environment."  </P></p>

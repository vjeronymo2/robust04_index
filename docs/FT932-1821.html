			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Shield Diagnostics plans flotation later this year SHIELD Diagnostics, a Dundee-based biotechnology company, is planning a flotation in September or October. Until recently it was incurring heavy losses but has achieved success with selling kits to diagnose a number of common diseases in the UK, continental Europe and North America. It made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.4m on sales of Pounds 445,000 in the year to March 31 1992. But Mr Hamish Hale, chairman, said that in the last financial year sales were a multiple of those in 1992. It broke even in the last quarter, but incurred a loss over the year. Shield's kits are used to diagnose genito-urinary infections such as chlamydia, and auto-immune diseases. The company is also developing a product which tests for incipient heart attacks in collaboration with Stago Diagnostica of France, using funds from the EC's Eureka programme for technological innovation. Apax, formerly Alan Patricoff Associates, the venture capital company, is a large shareholder. Mr Hale is a director of Apax and also has a personal equity stake in the company. Details of the flotation have not been decided. The company's stockbroker is Allied Provincial.</p>

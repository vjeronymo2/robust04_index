			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> VALLEY RESIDENTS TO VOTE IN JUNE ON PREFERRED TYPE OF RAIL LINE  </P> <P> San Fernando Valley voters will be asked in June what kind of rail line, if  any, they want built through the area, Los Angeles County supervisors decided  today.  </P> <P> The June 5 referendum, which will be advisory only, will ask voters to choose  one of four alternatives: an elevated monorail along the Ventura Freeway from  Universal City to Canoga Park, an underground extension to the Sepulveda Basin  of the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail subway, a light-rail line in a  shallow trench from North Hollywood to Canoga Park or no rail line at all.  </P> <P> The board voted 4 to 1, with Supervisor Ed Edelman, who represents part of the  east Valley, dissenting. Edelman warned that delaying a decision until June  could leave the Valley without any rail line.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which is building a  countywide network of rail lines, is scheduled to make a decision as early as  next month on the next line to build. Two other areas of the county are in  competition with the Valley for the next line.  </P></p>

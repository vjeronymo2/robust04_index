			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CANYONS SHOWS MUSCLE IN WHIPPING HANCOCK  </P> <P> Len Mohney never imagined his Canyons baseball team would enter the 10th game  of its season without home runs from sluggers Don Pedersen, Chris Joy and Peter  Washington.  </P> <P> Entering Saturday's nonconference game against visiting Hancock, however,  Pedersen, Joy and Washington -- the Cougars' third, fourth and fifth batters --  each had yet to hit one out of the park.  </P> <P> Mohney juggled his lineup Saturday, leaving Pedersen in the third position, but  moving Washington, the designated-hitter, to sixth and Joy to seventh.  </P> <P> The moves paid off. Pedersen and Joy each blasted two home runs and Washington  added another as Canyons hammered Hancock, 16-4.  </P> <P> Pedersen hit a pair of solo home runs, the first in the third inning with  Canyons trailing, 4-1. Three batters later, Washington smashed a two-run home  run to tie the score. Joy followed with a solo home run and Canyons (5-5) was  in the lead to stay.  </P> <P> Pedersen hit his second home run, in the fifth, to give Canyons a 6-4 lead. In  the seventh, Joy hit a two-run shot to highlight a six-run explosion.  </P> <P> Right-hander Jeff Frifth-Smith (2-2) pitched 5 1/3 innings and struck out seven  to earn the win. Lance Gibson pitched three innings in relief and notched his  third save.  </P> <P> In other baseball games:  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton 17, The Master's 5 -- Leading, 7-4, after three innings,  Fullerton scored six runs in the fourth and ran away with the nonconference  game at Fullerton.  </P> <P> Fullerton (7-4) collected only two hits in the fourth inning but capitalized on  three errors. David Staton delivered a three-run double and John Paboojian  added a run-scoring single. Staton, who was two for three with five RBIs, also  hit a solo home run.  </P> <P> Sophomore left-hander Rich Faulks (1-0), who relieved starter Matt Watson in  the third inning, allowed one hit in three scoreless innings and picked up the  win.  </P> <P> West Valley 8, Pierce 5 -- Pierce blew a 4-0 lead after two innings and was  eliminated in the second round of the Mt. San Antonio College tournament.  </P> <P> Pierce starter Shinya Fukuda (0-1) was chased in the third inning as West  Valley struck for two runs. West Valley scored four more runs on four hits in  the fourth to take the lead.  </P> <P> Pierce (4-3) took a 3-0 lead on five hits in the first inning. Tony Dello led  off with a single and scored on a triple by Kevin Johnson. Billy Morris singled  to score Johnson and later scored on a single by Chris Murphy.  </P> <P> Moorpark 3, West Valley 2 -- Moorpark rallied for an 11-inning victory in the  Mt. SAC tournament after tying the score in the bottom of the ninth.  </P> <P> Moorpark freshman John Chiaramonte (2-1) pitched a complete game and allowed  six hits.  </P> <P> SOFTBALL  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach 3-3, Cal State Northridge 0-1 -- Long Beach pitchers Diane  Lewis and Karrie Schott each recorded complete-game victories in a  nonconference doubleheader at Long Beach.  </P> <P> In the first game, Lewis (3-0) scattered five singles and allowed no walks.  </P> <P> Heather Lindstrom (1-2) surrendered only four hits but was charged with the  loss.  </P> <P> Schott hurled a four-hitter in the second game as Long Beach (9-2) erased a 1-0  deficit with a run in the third and and two in the fourth.  </P> <P> Christy Alves (1-1) gave up six hits for Northridge (8-6) and was tagged with  the loss.  </P> <P> Occidental 2, Southern California College 1 -- Donna Trimble singled home  Connie Brazell to give SCC a 1-0 lead in the top of the sixth, but Occidental  scored twice in the bottom of the inning.  </P> <P> Moorpark 1, Fullerton 0 -- De Dow raised her record to 6-0 with a complete-game  victory for Moorpark (7-2) in the Diamond tournament at Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> Moorpark is undefeated in the tournament and will play for the title today.  </P> <P> WOMEN'S TENNIS  </P> <P> Occidental 7, Westmont 2 -- Sue Hulse (6-2, 7-5), Maro Najarian (6-2, 6-2), Kim  Black (7-5, 6-0), Jenny Olson (6-0, 6-1) and Kirstein Crabtree (6-0, 6-0) won  singles matches for Occidental (4-2) in a nonconference match at Westmont.  </P> <P> MEN'S VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge d.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- China's economy is  operating in the direction required by macro-economic controls,  the State Planning Commission announced today.    Wei Liqun, a spokesman for the commission, said at a news  conference that the gross domestic product (GDP) -- the value of  goods and services produced nationwide -- shot up 12.7 percent  during the first quarter of 1994, compared with the same quarter  a year ago.    "Agricultural production is rising steadily," he said.    Localities have encouraged farmers to grow grain crops and  cotton on acreages as planned by the government, have increased  funding in support of the farming sector and have stepped up the  construction of vegetable and non-staple food production centers  in major cities, he said.    "Meanwhile, industrial production has scored a sustained and  fast growth," he said.    The increased value of China's industrial production rose  16.4 percent in the first four months of 1994, compared with the  same period last year.    More importantly, industrial production of state-owned  factories has begun to pick up, he said. For example, the  production value of such factories rose five percent in April  over the same month in 1993, up nearly three percentage points  from the first quarter of this year.    According to Wei, China's financial situation has been  stable  since the beginning of the year.    For instance, all newly-printed money put into circulation  between New Year's Day and the Spring Festival in mid-February  had been withdrawn from circulation by March 28.    Savings deposits in urban and rural areas soared by 130  billion yuan during the January-April period than the same  period a year ago, Wei said.    Furthermore, 50 percent of the quota for the issue of this  year's treasury bonds had been met by May 10, he added.    The excessive increase in fixed asset investments has been  curtailed, he said, noting that such investments by state-owned  companies and institutions climbed 38.4 percent in the first  four months of 1994, 30.5 percentage points lower than in the  same period a year ago.    "Basically, the domestic market is stable," Wei said.    For example, the country's retail sales grew 4.2 percent in  real terms during the January-April period. At least 90 percent  of commodities are either in a near balance between supply and  demand or with a surplus of supplies.    The spokesman said that China's exports soared 22 percent in  the first four months of 1994 to 28.04 billion U.S. dollars,  while its imports shot up 20.3 percent to 29.79 billion dollars.    "The tendency towards an over-rapid increase in prices has  been brought under initial control," he told the news conference.    The increase in the retail price index in March fell to 0.9  percent from three percent in both January and February, he  added.    He forecast that in the first half of this year, the GDP is  expected to rise by around 12 percent, industrial output value  by about 18 percent, fixed asset investments by state-owned  companies and institutions by 30 percent and retail sales by 22  percent.    The spokesman also anticipated a further fall in the  increase  in prices during the second quarter of the year.    He noted that some deep-rooted and structural problems in  China's economy are yet to be solved and warned against relaxing  efforts to control inflation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA) -- "President Kim Il-song  who has been active as an outstanding statesman for many years,  performing great exploits in the struggle for the freedom and  independence of the country, is a great leader of the present  time who is famous worldwide," said Pedro Margolles Villanueva,  director general of the PRENSA LATINA of Cuba, who visited Korea.    Giving his impressions of Korea here, he said, "When I had  an  audience of President Kim Il-song, I could deeply feel once  again comrade president's unshakable revolutionary will to  defend the cause of socialism with no retreat before the  imperialists and his strong and resolute position never to  pardon any invading enemy."    "Under the wise guidance of the great Comrade Kim Il-song  and  dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, enormous achievements have been made  in socialist construction of Korea and the Korean people have  wrought miracles which no one else can effect over the 40 odd  years since the ceasefire," he said.    The director general of the PRENSA LATINA added that  wonderful and magnificent grand monuments have taken shape in  different parts of the country, Pyongyang has turned into the  most beautiful city and all people lead a happy life with stable  jobs.    "Now the West is alleging that the DPRK is stepping up `war  preparations.' But it is quite contrary to the fact," he said,  adding that Korea is promoting peaceful construction, not war  preparations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 29 April (YONHAP) -- The Russian Government  said Thursday [28 April] that any foreigners staying in Russia  "legally" are free to leave the country, indicating Moscow has  no intention of tuning in to Seoul's bid for an early  resettlement in South Korea of North Koreans who have escaped  from Siberian logging camps.    Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin said at a  routine news briefing, "Russia will not prevent foreigners from  leaving for any country if they did not commit particular  criminal offenses, are not on a police wanted list and possess  legal immigration documents. In such cases, we do not have to  discuss with their countries of origin (on allowing them to  leave Russia for any destination)."    Karasin's remarks were taken by diplomats here as an  explicit  expression of Moscow's intention to have North Korean loggers,  most of whom have no passport or travel documents, apply for a  permit to stay in Russia before trying to fly to Seoul.    Karasin also said it is not within the Russian Government's  authority to issue visas or departure permits to foreigners  wishing to leave the country.    Moscow was astonished by the recent media fuss in South  Korea  about the North Korean escapees, said the spokesman, who feared  any distortion of Russia's position on the matter could damage  its relations with third countries.    The Russian Government has yet to receive any applications  from North Korean loggers seeking help to go to Seoul, Karasin  said.    The South Korean Embassy here also said no North Koreans  have  contacted it since Seoul announced 15 April that it would accept  all willing North Korean loggers. At the time, the Seoul  Government revealed around 100 North Korean loggers had  contacted Seoul missions in Russia seeking refuge in South Korea.</p>

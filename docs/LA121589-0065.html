			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> In the darkness Christian Boltanski's altar-like memorials to nameless children  glow like votive candles or sad, dim memories of war victims. Almost identical  to the pieces he showed at the Museum of Contemporary Art last year, the  wall-mounted grainy photos, biscuit tins, memento boxes and crudely wired  electric lights express once again how closely Boltanski comes to creating  contemporary sacred art (while tenaciously keeping alive its secular  underpinnings). All the emotional components are there for making icons of the  dead. Yet the gallery context acts as a subtle reminder that this is art, not  religion, arguing for caution on the part of any viewer who might confuse them.  </P> <P> After the blatant emotionalism of Boltanski, the clinical distance of Joseph  Nechvatal feels all the more intellectual. His small red, high contrast,  computer/robot generated images mix high technology with nature. The results  are almost as unreadable as infrared photographs to the untrained eye as they  pit their technical format against fragmented images of what look like  enlargements of leaves and skin. In the next space are two intriguing found  objects by Ann Messner that appear to embalm energy in lead as a way of  suspending time. (Shoshana Wayne Gallery, 1454 5th St., to Jan. 13.)

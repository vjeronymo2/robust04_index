			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Socialist to head three-party coalition in Japan: Dollar remains weak on fears of continued trade impasse Japan's parliament chose a 70-year-old socialist yesterday to lead a three-party coalition government dominated by the Liberal Democratic party, which was ousted last summer after 38 years in power. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, leader of the leftwing Social Democratic party, becomes the country's fourth prime minister in a year and the first socialist to lead Japan for 47 years. Mr Murayama was elected by 261 votes to 214 with the help of the LDP, the socialists' traditional enemy, in a second-round parliamentary showdown against Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a former LDP prime minister who broke ranks to stand against his old party. Last night, Mr Murayama, who has never held a cabinet post, pledged to push ahead with economic and political reforms. However, foreign ministry officials warned that talks on the US trade dispute were likely to be postponed because of his inexperience in foreign affairs. Mr Murayama is expected to travel to Naples next week for a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. The White House said President Bill Clinton looked forward to working with the new Japanese government. Asked how the US viewed a socialist in charge of Japan, Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House spokeswoman, said: 'That's an internal decision that the Japanese have to make.' However, the prospect of a continued impasse on efforts to curb Japan's trade surplus with the US contributed to another rise in the yen against the dollar. The US currency dropped to a postwar low of Y98.55 yesterday, although it closed slightly higher in London at Y98.678 and edged up to Y98.75 in New York. Early today in Tokyo it opened at Y98.83. The LDP and SDP differ radically on most policy issues. Their unexpected marriage is a mark of the collapse of the traditional structure of power started by the LDP's defeat in a no-confidence motion last June. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, leader of the New Harbinger party, a centre-left former LDP splinter group which is the third member of the new coalition, said: 'A new round of political realignment has suddenly started.' Mr Murayama sought an alliance with the LDP's president, Mr Yohei Kono, after talks broke down with outgoing prime minister Mr Tsutomu Hata. Mr Hata resigned with his minority coalition on Saturday, two months after taking office, rather than face a no-confidence vote put forward by the LDP with SDP support. The SDP and the coalition were deadlocked on proposals to reduce income tax and raise consumption tax. Mr Murayama said: 'I was struck by Mr Kono's sincerity. The political turmoil requires this kind of sincerity and I am sure I will meet your expectations.' They are expected to form a cabinet today, with the LDP likely to take the most senior seats. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, former prime minister, condemned the new coalition as 'nothing less than collusion'.

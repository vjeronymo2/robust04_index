			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Adolph Coors upgrades charge estimates ADOLPH Coors, US brewer, expects to take a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 1993 in the range of Dollars 100m to Dollars 125m, rather than the previous estimate of Dollars 65m to Dollars 75m, Reuter reports. The company also said it signed an agreement in principle with Madrid-based El Aguila to buy a 500,000 barrel brewery in Zaragoza, Spain, allowing it to produce beer in Europe, and so reducing its reliance on American exports for European sales.</p>

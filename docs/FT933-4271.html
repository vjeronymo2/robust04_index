			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Gota Bank to spin off problem loans GOTA BANK, the Swedish state-owned bank, is to spin off SKr43bn (Dollars 5.4bn) worth of problem loans into a separate bank to facilitate the disposal of its healthy activities before the year-end. All problem credits valued at more than SKr5m will be transferred to the unit, Retriva AB, by the end of the year. Although Retriva will initially be a wholly-owned company, it is almost certain to follow Securum, the bad loan bank for Nordbanken, in being split off and taken over by the state. The Swedish bank support authority, which is overseeing the reconstruction of Gota Bank, said yesterday it had decided to siphon off the problem loans to get a better price for the bank's healthy assets, valued at SKr60bn. It also stressed that Gota's problem loans could be wound down more effectively if they were part of a separate unit. Details of how Retriva is to be financed during the liquidation phase were not revealed. Around 65 per cent of Retriva's problem loans are linked to real estate. It will be managing 1,200 properties, around half of which it expects to purchase over the next few years. The long-term aim is to dispose of all the properties, but gradually so as not to depress market prices. The state has provided SKr15bn in guarantees to help Gota Bank meet minimum capital adequacy requirements during a period of heavy credit losses. Final bids for the bank's healthy activities, which made a SKr836m operating profit in the first six months, have to be received by September 23.</p>

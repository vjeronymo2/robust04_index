			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BRADLEY VOWS HE WON'T STEP DOWN  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley today vowed that he would not resign, despite a  recent allegation that he had a conflict of interest between his private  finances and his public role.  </P> <P> "To anyone who has any such thoughts, I'll be around here four years from now,  as mayor of this city," Bradley said.  </P> <P> A city auditor revealed Monday that someone had tried to "white out" a notation  indicating that the mayor had directed that city funds be deposited at Far East  National Bank, which had employed him as an adviser.  </P> <P> But the mayor said today that he did not know why his name appeared to have  been obliterated on the city treasury document.  </P></p>

GERMAN ARTIST GETS WOLF PRIZE  </P> <P> West German painter Anselm Kiefer has been awarded the $100,000 Wolf Prize in  the arts. Kiefer will be presented the prize by Israeli President Chaim Herzog  in May at the Knesset, or Parliament, the Israel-based foundation said.  </P> <P> The announcement said Kiefer, who was born in 1945, "has created an art that  synthesizes human history and the present condition of life in epic canvases  that inspire gravity and awe."  </P> <P> It noted that Kiefer first came to prominence in the 1970s "with subjects that  dealt derisively with his German heritage and particularly with the Nazi  period."  </P> <P> Kiefer, who works out of his studio in Buchen, has paintings on exhibition in  New York's Museum of Modern Art, the Tate Gallery in London, the National  Museum of Modern Art in Paris, the National Gallery in Berlin and Jerusalem's  Israel Museum.  </P> <P> The Wolf Foundation was established in 1975 by the late Ricardo Wolf to  "promote science and art for the benefit of mankind."  </P></p>

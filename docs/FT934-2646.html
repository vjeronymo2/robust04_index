			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (7): Growing need to diversify - The dependence on agriculture must be shifted Shropshire may be among the most beautiful and unspoiled of all British counties but the rural characteristics which make it so special also present it with big economic challenges. The county is among the most rural of all, with the number of people employed in agriculture - at 7 per cent - more than three times the national average. Half as many again work in agriculture-related employment and, in the south of the county, one in three people depend for their jobs on agriculture and associated sources of employment. With agriculture in decline - the county's farming workforce fell by nearly 20 per cent during the 1980s and is expected to remain in decline - the challenge is to diversify away from economic dependence on the land and put in place an employment base which can provide long-term jobs for the local population. Past failure to do so means that younger people have been steadily drifting away from the area in search of employment. The county council calculates that the 1980s saw a net migration of 6,500 people aged 15-24, a trend which also threatens the ability of potential employers to secure the skills base they require to expand. The workforce left behind tends to be older and increasingly immobile. Alongside the decline in traditional sources of employment, rural services are also being cut back, with schools, village shops and transport links topping the list of casualties. In Shropshire, up to 30 per cent of all post offices, garages and primary schools have been closed. The county council acknowledges the need to act decisively to stem the rot threatening the survival of rural communities and has, in spite of tough restrictions on resources, put in place a framework intended to construct new dimensions for Shropshire's economy. The task is not an easy one. Shropshire may be exceptionally beautiful, but one of the reasons it has remained so is because road links remain comparatively poor and public commuter services are non-existent. Employers may have taken to Telford in the north of the county, which is now tapped into the motorway network, but places such as Ludlow to the south have found the going much tougher when it comes to attracting new employers. In the county's eyes, diversification of an agricultural economy means enacting a series of integrated initiatives on several broad fronts, including help to the existing farming community, support for new and existing businesses and the targetted promotion of specific industries. The focus for the county's efforts to develop the rural economy is its rural economic development initiative (Redi) which was set up in 1992 to bring together public, private and voluntary organisations intent upon developing the county's rural economy. Redi's objectives are to identify economic blackspots, devise suitable initiatives and then appoint the most suitable agencies to deliver a response. South Shropshire district, for example, has been designated part of the Marches countryside employment programme, comprising a three-year pilot scheme which aims to stimulate economic diversification through a partnership of local organisations. Several initiatives are in hand to improve the efficiency of remaining farms and to offer advice on training and employment opportunities beyond agriculture. There are moves to help farmers add value to their products to help them to survive, as well as to develop new products. Given the problems emanating from the county's comparative remoteness, other policies are in place to help overcome the difficulties of physical separation of the producer and supplier from the customer. One of the new 'business link' centres established by the Department of Trade and Industry is to be located in Telford but, because of the distances between north and south, local partners in the county's business support network are to establish a satellite business development centre in Craven Arms, the small market town which sits astride the A49 close to Shropshire's southern boundary. The problem of access to advice and information, training and business support services across such a widespread geographical region has also encouraged the county's business development unit to organise a series of rural business surgeries throughout the county. This year, the unit changed its business grant scheme to give priority to applications from the rural south and west of the county and to those companies generating additional employment. Shropshire training and enterprise council is now also providing business start-up and development courses in rural locations. Modern telecommunications systems have already been identified as one of the keys to economic development and diversification in a county such as Shropshire. In a taste of what may be to come, the small town of Kington, across Shropshire's southern border in Hereford and Worcester, was this year selected for a national pilot scheme to study the effect of state-of-the-art communications and computer technology on the economic and social fabric of small towns and villages. The intention is to protect existing businesses and to attract new ones, partially by luring back those people for whom high-tech business and rural locations have always been seen as incompatible. The results of a 12-month study will be closely scrutinised across the border in Shropshire. Perhaps the most obvious candidate for development as Shropshire tries to escape its agricultural base is tourism, which already accounts for an estimated 10 per cent of employment and which accounts for a Pounds 20m annual spend on the part of visitors. The county last year launched its sustainable tourism project, intended to achieve a sensible balance between the benefits of tourism development and the need to conserve and protect Shropshire's natural beauty. Woe betide county hall if it gets the balance wrong.</p>

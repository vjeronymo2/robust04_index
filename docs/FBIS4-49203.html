			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 4 (AFP)--Dissidents in China's biggest  city, Shanghai, Wednesday denounced police for harassing them  for the past week and said the situation is increasingly tense.  Telephone service to his home and the homes of four other  dissidents was cut April 27, said Bao Ge, adding that he was  "constantly followed by policemen."    Also losing the use of their telephones were Yang Zhou,  spokesman of the Chinese Human Rights Association, its secretary  general, Wang Fucheng, as well as Fu Shenqi and Zhang Xianliang,  two activists sentenced last summer to three years in a  reform-through-labour camp.    As for Wang, he "disappeared three weeks ago and nothing has  been heard from him since," Bao said. "The situation in Shanghai  is more and more tense."    Chinese officials, fearing renewed antigovernment activities  this May, have stepped up their repression of dissidents over  the past few weeks, arresting dozens of them.    China's best-known dissident, Wei Jingsheng, remains under  police surveillance in a hotel in suburban Beijing because,  officials said, he is suspected of "new crimes."    Bao also said a meeting between lawyers and the general  public in Shanghai's Xiangyang Park on April 24, with the theme  "Legal Advice," had been cut short by police because of the  large number of complaints and insults directed against the  police and the government. "This public meeting almost  degenerated into a demonstration against corruption and human  rights violations," Bao added.    Asked about the incident by telephone, police declined to  comment.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Murdoch in joint venture to develop TV services MR RUPERT MURDOCH, chairman of News Corporation, the media group, and Mr Andre Rousselet, chairman of Canal Plus, the French pay television service, are setting up a partnership to develop new television services across Europe. The 50-50 partnership between Europe's two largest subscription television companies is designed to take advantage of 'future technologies in satellite transmission, digital compression and encryption'. Engineers are increasingly optimistic that digital compression can be used to squeeze up to four television channels into the space now occupied by one. Encryption, or scrambling, of the television picture can be used to run pay-per-view services - charging to view a film or sporting event. A working group of senior executives of the two companies has been set up to work out an agreement on programming, technology and strategy. In each European country, including the UK, the aim would be link up with a large local company to distribute any new services created. Canal Plus claims a total of 4.5m subscribers to its pay television channels in France, Germany, Spain, Belgium and western Africa. Cable News Network and Financial Times Television said yesterday that from the end of this year they would no longer jointly produce World Business Today. FT-TV, which will continue making a range of business programmes, apparently wanted a five-year deal with CNN, but the US company did not.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- There were no political  reasons for suspending the publication of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA.  The reason was purely economic: the editors owe the Pressa  publishing house 250 million roubles for printing services and  newsprint, Pressa director Vyacheslav Leontiev told ITAR-TASS.    He explained that the newspaper had been published  practically without payment since the beginning of the year.  Since that time SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA received four written  warnings, but failed to pay its debt to the publishing house.  This is why its publication was suspended last Thursday [31  March]. Similar warnings were sent to the editors of PRAVDA and  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, which managed to pay their debts.    According to Leontiev, warnings will be sent today to other  debtors -- EKONOMIKA i ZHIZN (its debt amounts to 165 million  roubles), KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (42 million), NEUES LEBEN (11  million), SELSKAYA ZHIZN (6 million) and KULTURA (3 million).  If the editorial boards do not pay their debts soon enough, the  publication of those newspapers may also be suspended.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: VENICE  </P> <P> Idaho-based painter and teacher Rome Stuckart paints tree littered forest  knolls using robust, mahogany tinged hues and an abbreviated, visionary  realism. The artist studied abroad and you can see traces of academic training  and European landscape savvy in the works. In Stuckart's hands, the genre  acquires the formal eccentricities of Surrealism and a twist of 20th-Century  Angst.  </P> <P>  Colors are not exactly natural, they're exaggerated or invented, as in the  rainbow veneer she gives the bark of fallen branches, or the inexplicable blue  shadows that give foliage a threatening bite. The artist keeps her colors very  warm, mixing them with lots of red and orange to make scenes vibrate with  energy. Her arrangement of space is believable enough to pass for naturalism,  but closer consideration reveals the artist's selective imagination at work.  The pictorial space she frames is narrow and somewhat claustrophobic.  </P> <P> In "Dry Creek Basin," the twigs of a bare tree trunk plunked in the foreground  block our entry point like weapons or sentinels, and in "Bone Yard" a tree  leveled to a jagged stump by some violent force is about as cozy as a bed of  glass shards. In just about every work, tangled boughs, dark pools, and  boulders suggest inanimate nature about to come to life. Just beyond this  barrier of seductive, yet off-putting nature we spy an intense, inviting glow.  It's almost too obvious that these aren't literal landscapes but metaphors for  life's sublime yet rocky course. (Market Street Gallery, 48 Market St., to Jan.  6.) MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

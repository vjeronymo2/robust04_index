The two leaders  also recommended the holding of a regional summit of east and  central African states and governments to discuss the issue of  refugees in the region. This was disclosed by President  Museveni at the opening of bilateral official talks between the  delegations of the two countries at the Lake Victoria Hotel in  Entebbe this afternoon.    The two leaders have just concluded their fruitful  tete-a-tete at which they reviewed the general situation  relating to Rwandan refugees. President Yoweri Museveni  welcomed President Habyarimana, who was making his third visit  to Uganda in three years. He said the two countries, like  others in the region, shared a lot in common among their  peoples, especially their common languages and historic  linkages, which, he noted, were ready infrastructures that could  be used by leaders in the region to unite the people and work  towards giving them good life and better living standards other  than trying to divide them. The president assured his guest  that Uganda is ready to do everything possible to assist in the  process of establishing lasting peace in Rwanda.    On his part, President Habyarimana said he recognizes  Uganda's contribution towards the implementation of the Arusha  peace accord which put in place institutions of transition to  lasting peace in his country. He was optimistic that these  institutions will be firmly established in Rwanda to solve the  problem of refugees and to allow the people of his country to  fully enjoy peace and stability.    He said that the meeting being organized by church leaders  and by the special representative of the United Nations in his  country make him optimistic about the process of establishing  these institutions. The Rwandan leader further explained that  the contacts he is always making with President Museveni are  always aimed at restoring peace and stability in the region and  to see how their people can resume living together in peace as  before. He also said that the two neighboring countries should  look towards the future with confidence and optimism.    In a joint communique signed by the two leaders at the end  of  President Habyarimana's working visit, President Yoweri Museveni  commended President Habyarimana and through him the entire  people of Rwanda for the efforts made so far in implementing the  peace agreement signed between the Government of Rwanda and the  Rwandan Patriotic Front on 4 August 1993 in Arusha, Tanzania.  He expressed the hope that the deadlock which has delayed the  installation of the transitional government would be overcome  soon so that the long- awaited era of peace, national  reconciliation, and development of the people of Rwanda and  stability in the subregion could begin.    The two heads of state, the communique adds, expressed  appreciation to the United Nations for its role in overseeing  the implementation of the peace accord. They renewed their call  to the international community to render both moral and material  assistance to facilitate the implementation of the peace  agreement. The two leaders reviewed the relationship between  their two countries and renewed their commitment to enhancing  cooperation. In this regard, they noted that traffic within the  northern corridor is still badly affected by the situation in  Rwanda and that it has adversely affected the economies of the  countries in the subregion. They called for the reopening of  the transit route as soon as possible. The two presidents  discussed the Rwandan refugee problem and confirmed their  commitment to resolve the matter once and for all.    With regard to the Kagera Basin Organization, KBO, the two  leaders reviewed the progress made in the implementation of its  projects and programs and reaffirmed their commitment to the  objectives of the organization.    Answering questions from the press shortly before departure,  President Juvenal Habyarimana said he was committed to full  implementation of the Arusha peace accord and called on the  parties concerned to do the same. He accused some factions of  two political parties in the opposition in Rwanda of placing  obstacles to peace and of lack of seriousness in observing the  recommendations of the peace agreement.    On the allegation of ambushes by government troops against  the Rwandan Patriotic Front, particularly at (Gasaka) in  northern Rwanda, President Habyarimana said he had asked the  commander of the UN force in the UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda  to investigate and report back. He said he is still waiting for  their findings.    Asked about the hurried return of Rwandan refugees from  Uganda now under way, President Museveni assured the  international community that there is no pressure on them to  return home. He, however, observed that Ugandan political  opportunists resented their presence and used them as a  scapegoat to problems in the country. In this connection, the  refugees themselves felt the indignity of their status in a  foreign country and were naturally anxious to return home.  [passage omitted]    President Habyarimana was later seen off at Entebbe Airport  by President Museveni, cabinet ministers, ambassadors, and  senior government officials.</p>

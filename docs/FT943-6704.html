			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / All change in the pits: Kevin Done on the uncoupling of Benetton cars and Ford engines In the brittle world of Formula One motor racing, the most surprising feature of the relationship between Benetton Formula and Ford was that it lasted so long. Benetton's announcement this week that it was renouncing Ford, its engine supplier for the past eight years, in favour of Renault, shocked only because the partnership appeared finally to have found the elusive winning formula this year. The combination of a competitive chassis from Benetton, the most accomplished driver in the championship in Michael Schumacher, and a reliable - and this year more powerful - engine from Ford and its partner Cosworth, has brought seven victories in the first 10 races of the season. On the grid of the Belgian grand prix at Spa Francorchamps tomorrow, the Benetton-Ford team will still be intact, with the unfinished business of winning this year's championship. Behind the pit lane, however, the machinations have already moved to 1995. Renault's coup of agreeing two contracts within weeks of each other to supply engines for the next three years to both Benetton and Williams will be difficult to trump, but it remains to be seen how long the French carmaker can run with both the hare and the hounds. Renault has won the world championship for the past two years with Williams, in 1992 with Nigel Mansell and last year with Alain Prost at the wheel, and it is desperate to remain on the winner's podium. Ambition is naked in Formula One: there are no prizes for second place. The manoeuvring is ruthless. 'The objective is to win grand prix and to be champion of the world,' says Mr Patrick Faure, director of Renault Sport. 'Our presence in Formula One is only justified by winning. Competition is increasing and it is necessary to give all our efforts to winning with the knowhow of Benetton and the talent of Michael Schumacher.' Such a statement is hardly likely to create a sense of ease in the Williams camp. Renault promises that both Benetton and Williams will receive identical works V10 engines next year, and that both will be treated as 'works teams', but in practice it has probably already cooked up a recipe for high octane behind-the-scenes conflict. The parting of the ways between Benetton and Ford was also the culmination of many months of growing unease. It is understood that Mr Jacques Nasser, then chairman of Ford of Europe, had warned Mr Flavio Briatore, flamboyant managing director of Benetton Formula, as long ago as last November that Ford was unwilling to continue supplying engines beyond 1994, unless the conditions of the alliance changed. 'After eight years, relations had worn thin,' says one executive close to the team. 'There were continual frustrations. You would like to have Michael Schumacher driving for you for the next five to 10 years. He is going to be a megastar, but the price was too high.' For the so-called 'works team' in F1 the engine maker pays for the development and manufacture of the engine at its own cost. In return it gets access to joint R&amp;D, representation, the prominent placement of its name, and endorsements from drivers and team - Schumacher as-sures the world that his favourite car really is a Ford Scorpio. The go-faster version of the Renault Clio becomes the Clio Williams. Ford felt increasingly that it was being short-changed. Drivers were not always turning up for Ford events when promised, the Ford oval logo did not seem to get the proper prominence. One of Benetton's controversial advertisements featured a Mafia car-bomb ex-plosion in Sicily. The car was recognisably a Ford Escort: 2,000 posters were pulled down in 48 hours when Ford Germany sounded the alarm. Last year Ford's misgivings were not being assuaged by success on the track. With full Ford backing as works team, Benetton managed only one victory. In contrast, Ron Dennis's McLaren team - no longer powered by Honda - found itself without a works engine. It paid for a Ford power unit and, with a lesser specification than Benetton's works engine, won five of 16 races with Ayrton Senna as driver. There was also a growing sense of insecurity for Benetton. The US carmaker had been undergoing one of its periodic bouts of soul-searching over the level of its commitment to Formula One, and Benetton could not afford to be left stranded. In the event, Benetton has gone from success to success this year, and Ford has decided to maintain its F1 commitment, but too late to save the partnership. One route could see Ford team up with McLaren. The world champion for seven of eight years between 1984 and 1991 - powered first by Porsche and then by Honda - has had a trying season with Peugeot, Renault's arch domestic rival. 'The joke of the pit lane this season has been to guess on what lap the Peugeot engine will expire,' says one rival team member. The Ford package is attractive. Its V8 engine is currently powering the winning team. It has forged a fruitful, long-standing partnership with Cosworth Engineering, the Vickers subsidiary, which engineers and manufactures the engines, and its electronics resources match the best. The computer screens in the Ford telemetry truck behind the pits monitor the performance of its engines in real time. 'It's like having a runner in the London marathon linked up to a heart machine with doctors alongside to warn that you are about to have a systems failure, or you need more water or whatever,' says a team executive. For next season Ford must now find a new runner, while for the moment, at least, Renault has acquired Michael Schumacher, the hottest property in Formula One - as long as he goes on winning.</p>

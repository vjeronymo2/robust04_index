			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nadezhda Garifullina: "They Have Hushed Up the </F> Discussion; State Duma Discusses Agreement on Social Accord"]    [Text] On Thursday, at an extraordinary meeting of the  State Duma, the deputies began discussing the draft of the  Agreement on Social Accord. But, being true to himself and to  his unpredictability, the president proposed "Variant 2" for  discussion, which none of the deputies, obviously, had ever  seen. It was passed out just before the meeting.    Informing her colleagues about the process of preparing the  Agreement on Achieving Civil Accord in Russia, State Duma Deputy  Chairman Alevtina Fedulova said that this is not a legal and not  an ideological document, but a political one, which "must  reflect the consolidating viewpoints of different  socio-political forces and representatives of different branches  of power on a definite circle of vital questions." She also  announced that the agreement, as compared with its first  variant, more clearly "defines the rules of behavior of the  parties." However, even a passing acquaintance with the document  shows that this is far from being so, and that "Variant 2," like  the first one, is reminiscent of a one-way street.    "The parties promise to take all necessary measures for  ensuring calm in the country," states the first section.  Wonderful! Who would dare not to agree and to object against  "calm in the country"? These "measures" are presented further:  "The organizers of meetings, demonstrations and strikes assume  not only legal, but also moral-political responsibility for the  peaceful character of these actions and their implementation in  strict accordance with the effective legislation." But what  "obligations" do the president, the government and the power  ministers assume? Or do they, as before, reserve the right to  surround a peaceful demonstration staged on a state holiday with  reinforced militia detachments--mounted and infantry militia  troops, dogs, OMON [special purpose militia detachment],  internal troops; to close off the streets with trucks which have  been prepared ahead of time, and then to use water cannons, tear  gas, and billy clubs against the demonstrators, as was the case  in last year's May 1 demonstration on Leninskiy Prospect? Or to  open fire on them from all types of weapons, including cannons  and tanks, as in the days of the October tragedy? The document  does not say a single word about the responsibility of the  authorities.    Or else, it contains postulates which cannot help but make  one blush: "The parties proceed from the fact that the entire  political process must be implemented within the framework of  the constitution;" "The parties believe that the highest  officials must maintain an ongoing dialogue with society and  public associations, explain the meaning of the implemented  reforms and specific decisions"... But why not write that the  "parties" must, for example, wash their hands before eating?    Yes, of course, as compared with "Variant 1," some  "progress"  is obvious. The threats of removing "those who do not agree"  from the deputy mandate have disappeared, and certain  "well-known public leaders and leaders of culture" are now  excluded from the list of signatories since, as the deputy from  the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], Yuriy  Ivanov, noted, for the opposition the appearance of some  representative of the mercenary capital beau monde is entirely  inadmissable in this conciliatory commission. But, despite  certain "cosmetic" corrections, the document submitted for  discussion did not bring accord to the deputy corps. Most of the  factions believe that they cannot sign such an agreement.    Naturally, there were also speeches in support of the  document which was being imposed on society--by representatives  from the PRES [Party for Russian Unity and Accord], "Women of  Russia" and "Russia's Choice."    Civil accord in present-day Russia is impossible. That is  the  conclusion drawn by the governing board of the Russian  All-People's Union in its announcement on provision of civil  peace in Russia. This document was distributed by Deputy Sergey  Baburin in the lobby. It has dotted all the i's: "There can be  no accord between those who have gotten rich by plundering their  Homeland and those who, after many decades of honest labor, have  become poverty stricken; between those who have destroyed a  great world power, its economy, army, and spiritual strength,  who for the first time in decades have brought the Russian  people to the brink of extinction, and those who opposed these  processes with all their might. There can be no accord between  those who in the Fall of 1993 performed a state overthrow,  trampling the law and human lives for the sake of their own  egotistical interests, and those who have remained true to the  ideals of Law, Justice and Honor, and who stood up in defense of  the defamed Constitution..."</p>

			<p>921121 FT  21 NOV 92 / Swiss bank chief rejects criticism Mr Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss National Bank, has rejected criticism by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) of the central bank's monetary policy, Ian Rodger writes from Zurich. 'The significant fall in inflation confirms that our way is right,' Mr Lusser said in a speech in Basle. Swiss inflation has declined steadily from a peak of 6.6 per cent in mid-1991 to to 3.5 per cent last month. The OECD said in its annual survey of the Swiss economy, published last week, that the SNB's policy leads to confusion in financial markets about exchange rate and monetary policy objectives.</p>

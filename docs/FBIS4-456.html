			<p>BFN     [Text] Samo Gudo, Mozambique United Front-Democratic  Convergence Party [Fumo-PCDRN] secretary general, has expressed  support for holding Mozambique's first multiparty elections on  the dates set by the president of the Republic, following a  proposal by the National Elections Commissions.    In an interview he granted this morning, the Fumo-PCDRN  secretary general said that election dates are not the greatest  source of concern to his party. He added that the most  important thing is that they be held in October, as scheduled.  Samo Gudo also noted that the setting of an election date will  encourage the international community to make funds available to  the opposition parties.    (David Amuzanda), of the Patriotic Action Front, FAP, also  expressed agreement with the election dates. He conveyed,  however, concern about delays in the implementation of parts of  the peace process.</p>

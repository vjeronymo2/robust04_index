			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Letter: Having both Sir, Why do we all have to spend more and more to be prosperous? In the past we just replaced things as they wore out, and from time to time bought the odd extra new thing or luxury item when we could afford it, and all was well. Now, unless we are all constantly spending more and more, we are told that there is a depression and it is up to us all to dash round to the shops and start buying again. We are told that we need more investment, and that means more savings, and at the same time we must spend more. You cannot have both at the same time - unless perhaps you are an economist?

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: HUNTINGTON PARK;  </P> <P> COUNCIL REVERSES ITSELF; 183 PALM TREES CAN STAY  </P> <P> The City Council has reversed its decision to remove 183 palm trees after  considering the appeal of protesting residents who said the trees hold an  aesthetic value to Huntington Park that will aid in attracting home buyers.  </P> <P> Some of the Canary Island palms have reached heights of 60 feet, and the  council thought the trees were a liability because of falling branches and  maintenance costs. There also was concern that tree roots would crack  sidewalks. A contractor had agreed to pay the city $206 for each palm  transplanted.  </P> <P> The palms were scheduled for removal June 7. But Jerald Russell, a six-month  resident, learned of the action earlier that week and in a few hours organized  his neighbors to attend a City Council meeting.  </P> <P> Councilman Jim Roberts said the council thought its original decision was in  the best interest of the people, but decided to do what the people wanted.  </P></p>

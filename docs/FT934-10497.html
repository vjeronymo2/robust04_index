			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Matisse cut-out comes to auction: Saleroom MATISSE is one artist whose reputation has grown during the art market recession. At Sotheby's in New York on Wednesday 'The Wine Press' sold for Dollars 13.75m (Pounds 9.34m) to the Swiss Bank Corporation. The composition is a cut-out, an experimental work of 1951. Matisse took scissors and snipped out pieces of paper, painted them, and then glued the shapes on to a white support. It combines his skills as colourist, draftsman and sculptor. The cut-outs show him moving towards the experimentalism of the abstract expressionists, and this was the first to appear at auction. Sotheby's auction, of Impressionist and Modern art, its most important of the autumn season, brought in Dollars 48.5m and was over 77 per cent sold by value. However, 18 of the 56 lots were unsold, showing that buyers are still selective. The main casualty was 'Violin et verre', an important 1913 Cubist work by Braque. Among other lots to find buyers was a Renoir of two washerwomen, which sold above forecast for Dollars 4.9m, and 'Liebespaar', a painting by Egon Schiele of two nudes on a bed, which sold below estimate for Dollars 4.6m, in real terms a loss on the Pounds 2.9m it fetched at Sotheby's in Lodnon in 1984. Sotheby's claimed three artists' records, including the Matisse for a work on paper: Dollars 1.2m for a stone sculpture of a kneeling woman by the German artist Wilhelm Lehmbruck, and Dollars 442,500 for 'La Grande Jatte au Printemps' by Emile Bernard, which was much influenced by Seurat's view of the same scene.</p>

National  Assembly Representatives; Mr. (Arsenio Mur), CEPAD [Evangelical  Committee for Development Aid] delegate to Nueva Guinea; Mrs.  Ada Luz Tablada, women's representative in Nueva Guinea; Mr.  (Edwin Berberena); Commander Oscar; Mr. Aquilino Luis Robleto,  president of the Development Centers; Messrs. Members of the  diplomatic corps and international organizations who are with  me; Messrs. Cabinet Members; residents of Nueva Guinea and of  other municipalities who are here with me; Dear Nicaraguan  people:    Thank you, friends of Nueva Guinea, for inviting me to share  this important national celebration with you. We are gathered  here today, 25 February 1994, happy and optimistic, to celebrate  another year of my electoral victory, the victory of the  Nicaraguan people who sought democracy, peace, progress, and the  reconciliation of all Nicaraguans.    On 23 December 1989, during the electoral campaign, I  visited  Nueva Guinea and found that war, repression, and political  persecution were assailing the region. I remember telling you  that national sovereignty only exists where the people are  sovereign, as reflected through free and honest elections. On  that occasion, I also promised you that I would end the economic  crisis and promote production in a country that was bankrupt  both morally and economically.    You are aware that it has been difficult to face the  historic  challenge of rebuilding our economy from the ground up and  rescuing our sacred democratic and moral values. I want to tell  you that I will not rest until I turn over to the next  Nicaraguan who succeeds me in the Presidency a country better  than the one I received, a country where there is clear  socioeconomic growth. Today we speak with pride in Nicaragua,  from north to south and from the Atlantic to the Pacific,  because we are people who are working to consolidate democracy,  peace, and progress.    I want to commend our brothers on the Atlantic coast, who  will hold elections for regional councilmen of the northern and  southern Atlantic coastal regions on 27 February. Our Atlantic  coast, full of ethnic and cultural values and natural resources,  deserves to forge a promising future. All the coastal people  who have the right to vote must now seize the opportunity to  cast their votes and freely elect their representatives. This  is a historic opportunity, because it is the first time  elections will really be held in freedom and democracy on the  Atlantic coast. From their public posts, the elected men and  women must strive to manage rationally the autonomy of the  Atlantic coast to benefit all coastal residents. I want to tell  you that you will receive support from my administration, even  with our current limitations.    This year we are going to begin repairing the Muy Muy-Puerto  Cabezas road and the Puerto Cabezas-Waspam road. We are also  going to rebuild the San Benito-Rama road. We will carry out  the dredging projects and the intercostal canal projects in  Bluefields, as well as the dredging of the international marine  route. We will repair the Puerto Cabezas and Corn Island docks,  as well as the Rama passenger dock and the Bluefields coastal  traffic dock.    Nicaraguans; I have had to exercise patience, hold  dialogues,  and maintain maximum tolerance to carry out my national  reconciliation policies. We gave armed groups opportunities to  join our efforts to protect life and promote productive tasks in  Nicaraguan society. The consequences of war, the destruction of  the means of production, and the shortage of resources to deal  with the demands of production and the creation of jobs caused  some Nicaraguans to devote themselves to committing crimes and  provoking uprisings. This must become a closed chapter in our  fatherland's history. That type of behavior does not lead to  anything good. Instead, it makes us poorer and impedes national  and international investment, which is so very needed for our  country's social and economic recovery.    My government will continue working to strengthen democracy  and to consolidate economic and social progress. In this second  stage of my administration, of my presidential mandate, we are  reorganizing the nation with programs that are largely socially  oriented and that will offer opportunities for work and  production.    Never before in our history have the people, both directly  and through intermediate organizations, been so [word  indistinct] and participated as much in government decisions as  they are doing now. The people's organization has been essential  to my government program because it is the people, in constant  communication with my government, who make this time of peace,  reconciliation, and opportunities for all possible.    We are drawing up new programs which we will call Peace and  Development for Nueva Segovia, Madrid, Esteli, Guaco, Jinotega,  Matagalpa, and the central Zelaya departments. That is why I am  sending able officials, as well as material and financial  resources, to the areas of the country that deserve special  attention. I am sending not only our own resources but also  those of friendly countries and nongovernmental and  international organizations which have not forsaken us. We will  continue supporting the state's reforms through the  decentralization of health services, education, [word  indistinct], tax collection, protection of natural resources, as  well as the development of each one of our communities through  the citizens' participation.    This year, with our own resources and with help from  friendly  nations, we will develop more than 1,600 projects throughout the  country from Guascala to San Juan del Norte and from Somotillo  to Cardenas. With these project we will respond to the demands  of citizens made through the municipalities. In 1994, the  international year of the family, with UNICEF's support and in  consultation with all the municipal governments, my  administration's top priority will be to develop the Mayors'  Friends and Defenders of Children program. The goal of this  program is to reduce infant mortality, school dropouts, and  malnutrition and to provide care for children in difficult  circumstances. This Peace and Development program will focus on  priorities of activating the productive capabilities in those  regions to stimulate greater production and achieve better  economic growth.    We will support production and the producers who meet their  commitments with the banks with more credits in all the regions  of Guaco, Chontales and Nueva Guinea. The National Bank will  reserve 70 percent more credits for the upcoming agricultural  season. My government will continue to support cattle raising  as well as the production of ginger, green beans, and other  products that you have harvested with so much success here.  That is why the National Bank has earmarked more than 200  billion cordobas for producers who meet their commitments in  this region.    Friends of Nueva Guinea, this territory was inhabited many  years ago by men and women from different parts of our nation  who with a great deal of effort formed an iron-clad union  between man and the land.    Thanks to their devotion, farmers and their plots have  become the true symbols of Nueva Guinea.    Nueva Guinea is a national example of determination,  patriotism, organization, and progress. You have capably forged  for yourselves a very secure future, and you have overcome  obstacles to seeking rapprochement among yourselves by  practicing reconciliation without giving in to partisan or  ideological differences.    During my electoral campaign I promised to achieve peace and  eliminate obligatory military service so that tranquility would  be restored in each and every home, and I have fulfilled my  promise. [applause]    Today we are living in peace. Our fellow Nicaraguans have  resumed work on their land and are sources of joy and support  for their homes. The demobilized resistance fighters and  retired Army troops are the best example of reconciliation. The  armed movements that existed in Nueva Guinea at the beginning of  my term have been defeated thanks to the resolve of my  government and the peace commissions in Nueva Guinea. This firm  resolve has made my pledge and the hopes of the men and women of  this lovely municipality come true.    In Nueva Guinea my government has invested in economic  rehabilitation projects for the people affected by the war, the  basic grain program, potable water service, 230 homes, a new  telephone system, anti-cholera treatment, the construction of  600 latrines, and 4,750 desks for a total during my term in  office of approximately 11 million cordobas.    In Muelle de los Bueyes we built a health center, rebuilt  city hall, and built the small market for a total investment of  11,778 cordobas. In El Rama we built sidewalks, a dock at the  port, and rebuilt the market for an investment of 70,000  cordobas. In El Almendro we built a bridge and a community  center at a cost of 72,000 cordobas.    Over the past three years your municipalities have  progressed  significantly. I made an effort to fulfill my pledges to you, my  dear friends, and I have accomplished that. I am grateful to  the international organizations represented in Nueva Guinea for  the valuable support they have given this municipality. I am  especially grateful for the cooperation provided by Spain; our  friends from Worldwide Aid [Auxilio Mundial]; the Governments of  Italy, The Netherlands, and Sweden; and all the organizations  that have worked in these four municipalities.    El Rama, Muelle de los Bueyes, El Almendro, and Nueva Guinea  are sources of constant concern for me. I would like to do more  for these municipalities and make their administration more  effective and efficient so that the budget allotments assigned  to them by my government will reach them on schedule. To this  end I have decided to send a draft bill to the National Assembly  whereby we can fulfill your request and your dream of creating a  new department [applause] with these four municipalities, which  will organize and execute programs for this rich area. I will  await your suggestions to make a reality of this geopolitical  division which, unquestionably, will help us strengthen the path  toward progress in what will be Nicaragua's newest department.  [applause]    For this reason, ever since political polarization occurred  at the National Assembly, I spared no effort in attaining a  minimum consensus among the deputies of the various parties so  we could fulfill another of the pledges made during our  campaign, to amend the Constitution. During the installation of  the National Assembly's 10th session on 10 January, I said I  endorsed the idea of partially amending the Constitution, that I  followed carefully the debates of these amendments, and that,  with due respect for the government branches' autonomy, my  government will effectively contribute to enrich the nature of  these reforms. I expect the Constitution amendments to benefit  Nicaragua. Consequently, the Nicaraguan people should take  advantage of this historic opportunity to attain unity around a  constitution that can help us face big challenges and national  problems in this decade and the next. The Nicaraguan people must  rebuild the country and attain steady economic development,  which will make it possible for us to make significant progress  in the creation of jobs and reduction of extreme poverty.    Fellow Nicaraguans, we are facing big challenges which we  will have to overcome realistically and patriotically, without  populism or demagoguery. These problems include the war sequel,  huge foreign debt, extremely low per capita income, high  unemployment rate, conflicts and tasks related to property  ownership, a marked deterioration of the infrastructure,  ecology, and rapid population growth. Meeting these challenges  requires a small yet strong and agile state, a state that can  regulate, lead, and pave the way, a state that can offset, in  favor of the poorest sector, the effects of any imbalances. We  can only resolve these problems on a medium- term basis with the  support of all social forces coalesced around shared national  objectives.    We need a reformed constitution which can make it possible  for us to advance in an orderly fashion toward a solution for  the country's social and economic problems. Such a constitution  can also reinforce the democratic process. For this reason, I  have followed the situation very closely and talked with the  political forces that have been debating several positions and  proposals to reform our Constitution. To stimulate a national  consensus on these reforms, I will send to the National Assembly  in March a government proposal on the Constitution's reforms.  This will not preclude a continued effort to reach an agreement  among all political forces of the country. We must attain this  consensus to enforce the reforms and their beneficial effect on  the state's institutions. Because the proposed reforms could  harm the state's organization, I am convinced that the proposal  must of necessity rely on the approval of all state branches and  be widely discussed with the country's other sectors. The  constitutional principle of harmonious coordination of the  Nicaraguan state's branches should find their highest expression  in this constitutional reform process.    I am also making a great effort to fulfill another election  promise. I promised that the Armed Forces would be of a  professional nature and would not belong to any one political  party. Despite the many difficulties that my government and the  Army have experienced in the search for a consensus on the new  military organization law over the past few years, I can say  that disparagement, mistrust, and misunderstanding have been  left behind.    The determination and devotion which we have all invested in  this difficult task has led to this law, which renders it  possible to establish a professional, party-free, small, and  friendly Army which will work in harmony with civilian power.  It will be the Army of all Nicaraguans that the great heroes of  our fatherland dreamed of. [applause]    I hope that once we complete the necessary procedures for  passage of the law this promise will promptly become a reality  for the benefit of the entire Nicaraguan nation. The Nicaraguan  people trust in God. We believe in peace, democracy,  reconciliation, and progress. I believe in my people; I believe  in you and I believe in Nicaragua. Therefore, I want you to  know that Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who is a friend to all of  you and president of all Nicaraguans, will continue working  during the rest of her presidential term to improve the living  conditions of all her people.    As I also told you on 23 December 1989, instead of tiring we  must have faith and enthusiasm to build a better Nicaragua, a  peaceful Nicaragua, a land that will be very close to God, with  a noble people who from day to day make an effort to establish  the reign of social justice, peace, and progress in the land  where they were born. Thank you to all of you, my dear friends.  In a little while I will have a few more words for you.  [applause]    I would like to inform all of you, my dear friends of Nueva  Guinea and people of all the municipalities and throughout  Nicaraguan who perhaps have not heard or have not been informed,  of the good news: Yesterday the Armed Forces and the 3-80 Front  signed an agreement with members of my government that ends our  differences. [applause]    This agreement marks the end of the war and ensures that we  will finally be able to achieve the peace for which we have all  yearned. This is particularly important for all Nicaraguans on  this day, 25 February. I congratulate all of the boys for their  patriotic gesture, and I would like to ask all the people who  are with me on this morning, my dear friends, and all the  Nicaraguan people for a round of applause to acknowledge their  patriotic decision to lay down their weapons, (?proving) once  and for all that the peace we have so yearned for is possible in  our blue and white [colors of the Nicaraguan flag] land. May  God bless you all; may God bless all the Nicaraguan people. We  will not falter; together we will continue working for the  well-being of all Nicaraguans. Thank you, and may God bless you  all, my dear friends. [applause]</p>

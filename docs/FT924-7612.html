			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Fuel embargo on Serbia flouted: Queues vanish as petrol tankers violate United Nations sanctions SCORES OF petrol tankers are crossing borders into Serbia in violation of United Nations sanctions designed to end fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the former Yugoslav republic. At the weekend, a stream of lorries plied barely-monitored routes in and out of Serbia and Montenegro, which make up the reconstituted, though unrecognised, Yugoslav federation. They are heading for petrol stations in Serbia, where fuel queues have disappeared because supplies appear now to be plentiful. The UN Security Council is today expected to consider measures to close loopholes in sanctions on Belgrade. It is due to debate a ban on transit through the former Yugoslavia, including strict measures to control shipping along the River Danube and Adriatic ports in Montenegro. The UN imposed sanctions on the rump Yugoslavia, including a trade and oil embargo, on May 31. The sanctions are designed to put pressure on Serbia to end bloodshed in Bosnia-Hercegovina, where Serb-backed forces have taken over large swathes of territory. Road traffic was halted this summer as queues for petrol snaked throughout Serbia. Many petrol stations closed down and tens of thousands of workers were sent on 'forced holidays'. But after five months of sanctions, Serbia has secured fresh supplies through a wide network of black marketeers. Organised crime also appears to be involved in the importing. At least 14 private petrol stations have opened in Serbia in the past two months, all licensed by Serbian authorities. European diplomats believe the renewed petrol supplies has boosted popular morale which will help Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and his ruling Socialists at the polls in elections on December 20. Mr Milosevic vowed recently that 'Serbia will neither freeze nor go hungry. It will not allow state and national interests to be brought into question because of pressure.' The Serbian president is seen by the international community as the chief instigator of the ethnic violence in Bosnia. Tankers bearing number plates from Serb-held cities in Bosnia are daily crossing the border into Bulgaria, Greece and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, returning laden with petrol for Serbia. Western diplomats say petroleum-based products are also being shipped from Romania along the River Danube. They say oil is also being supplied from Russia and the Ukraine. 'Petrol will always get into Serbia,' one lorry driver said at the weekend. Most lorry drivers show falsified documents, according to border police and diplomats, claiming their cargo is bound for Bosnia or destinations beyond the former Yugoslavia. A customs official at Gevgelija, on the Macedonian-Greek frontier, who requested anonymity, said: 'They no longer use the main border crossing but take other routes, at Novo Selo for instance.' At the weekend, snow blanketed the winding mountain road to Kriva Palanka, a mining town in eastern Macedonia near the Bulgarian border. Macedonian border police say that despite its remote location, it is one of many routes used to transport petrol. They say Bulgarian tankers regularly deliver petrol to Serbia despite Bulgaria's call for sanctions to be stepped up. The 100 monitors posted on Yugoslavia's international borders and the western naval fleet in the Adriatic have reported hundreds of violations but do not have the power to intervene, diplomats say. Meanwhile, fighting continues in Bosnia. A UN-brokered ceasefire among Serb, Croat and Moslem military leaders was widely violated at the weekend. Fighting was reported in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and in northern Bosnia as Serb forces launched an offensive on Maglaj, one of the last strongholds of the mainly Moslem Bosnian forces.

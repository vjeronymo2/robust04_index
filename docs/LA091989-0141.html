"We are working  very hard to find a lasting solution which can only involve the sending back to  Vietnam those people screened out," he said.  </P> <P> About 55,000 Vietnamese are languishing in the colony's overcrowded detention  centers. More than 32,000 Vietnamese have sailed into Hong Kong so far this  year.  </P></p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (10): The market hots up - In the US, Frank Lipsius watches the jockeying to gain consumers' attention GINGERLY referring to a relationship that goes back to 1908, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company insists that its advertising review is routine. But since AT&amp;T lost its monopoly on American telephone lines and telephones, its campaigns have taken on new importance. One current Dollars 190m TV advertising pitch for AT&amp;T has gained the embarrassing reputation for being 'confusing'. Even an AT&amp;T executive admitted in print: 'I still don't get it,' referring to the 'i' plan - a broad range of services that neglected to mention that the 'i' stood for 'individual.' Few people knew - even after seeing the commercials - what the services were. For AT&amp;T, giving up the advertising agency it has used since 1908 is just one more petty humiliation being inflicted by its upstart rival MCI (of which British Telecom recently bought 20 per cent for Dollars 4.3bn). MCI has taken about 16 per cent of the market compared to AT&amp;T's 68 per cent, and Sprint's (the third long-distance player), 11 per cent. MCI led the way in offering a reverse-charges service using a toll-free 800 number, only to be followed by AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T has also lagged in touting services, such as discounts, to a customer's most frequently dialed numbers. Such jockeying for consumer attention does not come cheap. The journal Advertising Age estimates that AT&amp;T spent Dollars 329m on measured advertising in 1992, compared to MCI's Dollars 103m and Sprint's Dollars 87m. And while AT&amp;T's advertising fell by Dollars 24m from the year before, both MCI and Sprint increased theirs; the former by almost Dollars 10m and the latter, buttressed by a successful campaign featuring Candice Bergen, the actress, by Dollars 17m. One problem in advertising long-distance services lies in differentiating the product. Besides sales gimmicks through selective discounts, the campaigns emphasise Madison Avenue-inspired 'qualities' such as being able to hear a pin drop on Sprint, or the negligible price difference between AT&amp;T and MCI (negligible, so far as AT&amp;T is concerned). For its part, MCI has run enormous electronic billboards, keeping track of the savings that mount by the second in using its services. These trivial squabbles mark only the beginning of the choices that will be bombarding consumers in the increasingly diversified and competitive telecom market. By the time this particular telecom revolution hits its stride, customers will be seeing more than just a lower long-distance phone bill. After decades of being content with one or two telephones in the house, obsessive consumers can keep themselves permanently available by telephone, while companies can transmit information into a computer which that makes it available around the world as it is being typed. The humble house telephone is probably the first place most people are seeing these technological changes affecting their lives. Subscribers to New York Telephone are being offered services that give them more control over phone intrusions. 'Call ID,' at Dollars 6.50 a month, shows the number of the caller as the telephone rings; 'Call Return,' by dialling three digits, calls back the last number on the line; and 'Repeat Dialling', costing the same as Call Return at 75 cents, keeps on dialling until an engaged number is free. For the technologically literate, the latest fashion is for wireless systems that began with car phones and soon shrank in size, allowing pedestrians and restaurant patrons to have constant telephone companions. More than 12m Americans have signed on to cellular systems - a figure expected to double by the end of the decade. Shadows over cellular's manifest destiny are the new band widths which the US government now intends to auction for a high-frequency digital channel devoted to PCS - 'personal communication services.' PCS combines fax, telephone and modem, for personal and computer-to- computer contact. The bidding for this space has created the only buoyant market in American property - cellular band width. As Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, contends: 'It's the 21st century equivalent of the Oklahoma land rush.' MCI is betting on the new PCS technology because its digital transmission solves the problems of the present generation of cellular service - problems which cause 30 per cent of the customers to drop out every year because of quality, cost or poor service. To make the new short band width work, the PCS network may need transmitters every 500 to 1,000 feet. This would be a daunting investment; it could ultimately cost three competing systems a collective Dollars 22bn to install by the time of inauguration in about 1997. Capital outlays may discourage the faint at heart, but the brave can see that new technologies breed new uses. Thanks to Motorola, the American cellular manufacturing pioneer, even China has 3m people on a paging system which transmits coded messages rather than giving a telephone number, using numbers to mean 'return to office', 'go to post office,' and the like. Businesses in Philadelphia have data entry done in South Dakota as if it were in the next room. In the highly competitive data-transmittal business that includes services from the big long-distance carriers, as well as Cable and Wireless and CompuServe - best known for its on-line information service  -some American data out-sourcing goes to the Caribbean. CompuServe's network services division, with revenues approaching Dollars 400m a year, does the online transmittal of Visa's 600m credit-card transactions and verifications, among its other tasks. As the technological revolution progresses, it will sweep up even its early ally and progenitor, the humble house telephone. Already the new product called 'pda', or 'personal digital assistant', packages computer data and telephone service together. The most advanced of these so far is AT&amp;T's EO, which includes a cellular telephone with the services offered in common with its competitors Apple Newton MessagePad, Sharp Expert Pad and Casio Z-7000. All three have first-generation handwriting recognition. At three times the Dollars 700 cost of the competitors' simpler models, the EO 440 also sends and receives faxes. Combining computer and telephone technologies creates an exciting future. There will be many 'must-have' products among the huge range of possibilities opening to the most adventurous, imaginative and skilled telecom providers.</p>

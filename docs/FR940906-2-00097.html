The IPPS database is a product of IPPS, an integrated personnel and payroll management information system currently under development. The first phase of the system will begin in August 1994. The possibility of adverse effects of this proposal concerning privacy interests of the general public is minimal as the new system combines the information currently held in DOT/FAA 806 and DOT/OST 034 systems of record. A description of the steps taken to safeguard these records is given under the appropriate heading of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  system of records. The changes include amendments to: System number, system name, security classification, system location, categories of individuals covered by the system, categories of records in the system, authority for maintenance of the system, routine uses of records maintained in the system including categories of users and the purposes of such uses, disclosure to consumer reporting agencies, policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system, retrievability, safeguards, retention and disposal, systems managers and address, notification procedure, record access procedures, contesting record procedures, record source categories. The authority for maintenance of the system is 5 U.S.C. 2957 and 5 U.S.C. 2954. The purpose of this report is to comply with the Office of Management and Budget Circular, A&hyph;130, Appendix I, dated July 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "The vacation season  in Crimea has begun." This was how Emil Pain, head of the  conflict forecasting department of the analysis center under the  Russian president, reacted to an ITAR-TASS report about 29  Ukrainian armored personnel carriers appearing on the outskirts  of Simferopol.    In an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent the analyst  noted that the situation around Crimea is getting close to a  critical point. "All the signs of an uncompromising fight for  the integrity of the state are there. But strong-arm methods in  taming separatists proved unsuccessful in Azerbaijan, Georgia,  Moldova, and Serbia alike," Emil Pain said. "But history never  teaches anything," he noted.    Unlike many experts, Emil Pain puts the blame for the crisis  not only on Ukrainian but also on Crimean politicians. He  believes it is possible to speak of the "irresponsibility" of  Yuriy Meshkov's supporters, who could have carried out the  Crimean authorities' policy without a confrontation with Ukraine.    "It was inexpedient to make a decision to change the Crimean  Constitution on the eve of the vacation season, because its  success could have improved the economic situation in the  peninsula," the scientist believes. But he thinks that "Yuriy  Meshkov seems to have forgotten that Abkhazia's beaches are no  worse than Crimea's beaches, and that no one would wish to spend  a vacation in an area of hostilities."    The political scientist stated with alarm that most armed  conflicts have begun with a change in a certain territory's  political status. "This time there should not be a military  clash, because the price to pay for it would be not the future  of Crimea but global security," he said.</p>

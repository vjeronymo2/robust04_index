			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Hurd broke law over Pergau aid, High Court says: Pounds 234m allocation for Malaysian dam project was 'fatally flawed' Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, acted unlawfully in earmarking Pounds 234m from the UK overseas aid budget for the Pergau dam in Malaysia, the High Court ruled yesterday. The court said the grant of aid was 'fatally flawed' because the project was 'economically unsound' and did not promote the development of a country's economy as required by aid laws. The Overseas Development and Co-operation Act says the primary purpose of aid must be the economic benefit of a foreign country or welfare of its people. The ruling was the second defeat for government ministers in the courts in two days. On Wednesday, the Appeal Court ruled Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, had acted 'unlawfully' and 'abused his powers' by introducing a new compensation scheme for victims of crime. Labour said the two judgments demonstrated the government's growing contempt for parliament. Downing Street greeted yesterday's decision with dismay, but dismissed attempts to link it with the judgment against Mr Howard. The government was refused leave by the judges to appeal. The Foreign Office said it was considering whether to apply to the Appeal Court directly for permission to challenge the ruling. Mr Hurd said the contribution to Pergau would go ahead. He said the government would provide the money from elsewhere if the appeal failed. 'We are contractually bound; there are 200 British firms working there,' he said on Channel Four news. 'Unless we have a successful appeal, we will have to find other ways of financing it.' Mr Hurd said the legality of the deal was not questioned when he signed it. 'The courts decide and the law has to be obeyed. Ministers have to take a view on what they can do in the national interest. That is what I sought to to do,' he said. The decision was a victory for the World Development Movement, a lobby group for the Third World, which had argued that Mr Hurd overstepped his powers by allocating aid money to promote trade with Malaysia. Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, promised to provide financial help for the dam in 1989 while negotiating a Pounds 1.3bn arms deal with Malaysia. Mr Hurd authorised the first instalment in 1991 despite advice from Sir Tim Lankester, former permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, that the funding was 'an abuse of the aid programme'. In Malaysia yesterday, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, warned of retaliation if the UK government was forced to drop the Pounds 234m loan. He added that if the loan payment was held up, Malaysia would withhold payment to Balfour Beatty, the British company which is the main contractor on the dam. Mr Robin Cook, shadow foreign secretary, said the judgment 'reveals the Conservative government as incompetent, and so arrogant with power that they broke the limits of their legal authority'.</p>

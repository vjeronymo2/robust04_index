			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / The Soviet Coup - One Year After: History bears down on states of the Union THE DESTRUCTION of a tottering Union was the most important geopolitical effect of the August coup: it now becomes clear how ambiguous the legacy is. For in destroying the shreds of all-Union clothing it stimulated the naked power struggle between and among them, which the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States last December has only moderated. It put Russia in centre stage, and returned its neighbours to their centuries-old dilemma: how to live with the Bear as a neighbour? For the Baltic states, the answer was always clear: assert independence. Yet independence, supported by Russia, is harder to realise than to assert. Relations between Russia and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are much worse now than they were a year ago. The Baltic states demand the rapid pullout of the 130,000 strong forces based on their territories; the Russians promise to do so, but demand time to construct flats for displaced officers. Neither side trusts the other. The sufferers are the Baltic Russians, especially in Estonia and Latvia, where the largest populations are. The new constitutions deprive them of citizenship if they are recent immmigrants, and impose the necessity to learn the native language if they are to keep their jobs. Russian schools and cultural centres have been closed. Resentment and dislike of Russians now has a political expression, and is played upon by politicians. In Moscow, meanwhile, the parliament fumes that the foreign ministry does not protect the rights of a russophone population under pressure. Russians spread throughout the former Union, and the former empire. Their strongholds include Crimea (Ukrainian since 1954), TransDnestr (Moldovan since after the last war) and Northern Kazakhstan (with a large Russian population before the creation of the Soviet state in 1920). Only in the second of these has there been armed conflict, now under a very fragile ceasefire. But Crimea remains a presently muted quarrel between Russia and Ukraine, likely to flare up once more. Most of the other states have developed a position of modified dependence. Belarus last month signed an agreement with Russia hailed by both sides as a return to traditional ties of friendship; it includes a military pact which envisages joint manoeuvres and a measure of joint (that is, Russian) control. The four economically dependent Central Asian states and Kazakhstan have also all signed friendship or co-operation treaties of varying degrees of closeness  - their economies, leaning shakily against the Russian one, need at least a common currency and whatever subsidised energy and other products Russia still provides. The three Caucasian states seem set to return to their old ways, with the two Christian nations, Armenia and Georgia, seeking Russian protection against the 'Turks' (the Moslems) in the third, Azerbaijan. Armenia last week invoked a collective security pact to beseech CIS (that is, Russian) military aid against an advance by Azerbaijan into Armenian territory. Russia did not and will not soon oblige, but it is clear that its continued influence in the Caucasus depends on taking sides. Ukraine remains the central enigma. It was always seen by Russian and Soviet leaders as the indispensable possession for the achievement of superpower status. Relations have recently improved: Presidents Yeltsin and Kravchuk have masked their previous distaste, and at their meeting in Yalta earlier this month called each other 'Boris' and 'Leonid'. But a Ukrainian cabinet minister privately described that meeting as merely an effort to calm western worries. And the deal reached at Yalta, for three-year joint control of the Black Sea Fleet, is fraught with the possibility of misunderstanding. When Ukraine's economy worsens sharply, as it is expected to do in the autumn, Russia is likely to move again to the central role of national bogey. The coup's failure saw Soviet power collapse utterly; Russian power has not expanded to fill the space vacated. Its oil-producing autonomous republics of Tatarstan and Chechenia have both declared a formal independence which they have yet to negotiate in practice. Other republics or regions in Russia, like Yakutia (with diamonds), Komi (gas) and Tyumen (oil) are also claiming authority at least over their exportable resources. This is less an ethnic matter than an effort by the elites who were thrown up by the putsch (or who survived it) to extend their control over a population and resources over which they had hitherto only a titular authority. After a year  - and more  - of looking outward, in particular westwards, the aniversary sees all of the former Soviet states looking inward, increasingly aware that the imperatives of geography and of history are less amenable to transformation than they had bravely proclaimed in the aftermath of August 1991.</p>

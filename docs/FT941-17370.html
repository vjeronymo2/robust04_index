			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Peasant army embarrasses Mexico: The insurrection in Chiapas may alter government policy The attack by up to a thousand armed peasants on four Mexican towns in the southern state of Chiapas presents the government of President Carlos Salinas with an acute political problem. Despite the negligible military threat from the rebels, who were last night reported to be retreating, the uprising comes at a time when the government is keen to project Mexico as a peaceful and stable country ready to become a member of the first world of rich nations. The insurrection offers a very different image, and underscores the social and political difficulties ahead as Mexico joins the North American Free Trade Agreement. The troubles coincide with the beginning of the campaign to elect Mr Salinas's successor this August. If the violence continues, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party's candidate, may have to go further in making social development rather than economic reform the key element of his political platform. The uprising has already led to nearly 90 deaths, and countless more victims have been wounded. The rebels have ceded control of three of the four towns seized on New Year's Day - San Cristobal, Las Margaritas and Ococingo - while reporters visiting Altamirano, which had been held until early yesterday, said they saw no sign of them. Known as the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, the guerrillas declared war on the government on behalf of the country's indigenous people. They said they timed the New Year's Day insurrection to coincide with the formal enactment of Nafta, a treaty they said would be a death sentence for natives. Their fight was for 'work, land, housing, food, health care, education, independence, freedom, democracy, justice and peace'. Most of the rebels are poor Maya natives from the region, although some of the leaders are reported to be from the centre of the country. They appear well-financed and organised, suggesting perhaps links with drug or arms smugglers. The government quickly painted them as radical groups with little popular base or support, and bent on violence at no cost. An official said they were supported by Guatemalan guerrillas and other Central Americans, and had ties to the leftist clergy in the state. However, government critics see the violence as the product of the extreme poverty and repression afflicting Chiapas for centuries. It is by some measures Mexico's poorest state, with lowest levels of installed electricity, literacy and school attendance rates in the country. The state is dominated by political bosses who belong to the PRI, and has one of the worst records of human rights abuses by the police and army. Disputes over land have turned into violent clashes between poor peasants and the rich landowners who control the economy of the state. Last year the Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights, an independent US organisation, accused Mexico's military of torturing indigenous peoples in the state. Other reports by Amnesty International and Americas Watch have catalogued similar abuses. The Minnesota report concluded: 'The lawless practices of the Mexican military have been increasingly tolerated at the highest levels of Mexican government.' The charges were denied by the government-controlled Human Rights Commission, but have long been made by the local Catholic Church, which actively supports the rights of natives. While Mr Salinas's economic reforms have made many Mexicans better off, they have yet to improve the lot of the rural poor, most of whom are found in southern states such as Chiapas. According to the government statistics institute and the United Nations, the number of people living in extreme poverty in rural areas increased from 6.7m in 1984 to 8.4m in 1989 and 8.8m in 1992. During the past four years the government has poured billions of dollars into the Solidarity anti-poverty programme, of which Chiapas has been the biggest recipient. However, this programme has not been able to offset the impact of the removal of agricultural and other subsidies, and the decline in prices of products such as coffee. The opposition to Nafta reflects a widely held view that the south of Mexico is unlikely to benefit as much as the north or the centre. Many Chiapas workers live off corn they produce, or on coffee farms. Under Nafta, Mexico will gradually open up to corn imports, and demand for farm labour is expected by most economists to fall sharply. The government's immediate response to such problems is to pour more money into the state. The social development minister said on Monday the government would establish new programmes to address the problems of the region. It remains to be seen whether such spending will be sufficient, or if a broader political solution to the rights of indigenous peoples is necessary.                        *      *      *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               CHIAPAS STATE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- It is one of Mexico's least-developed and most violence-prone  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- It has only 4 per cent of the nation's population but 25 per cent of its land disputes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- About 30 per cent of its 3.2m residents are illiterate; one in four speaks an indigenous language but not Spanish  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- About 20 per cent of children do not attend school, partly because not enough teachers speak both Spanish and indigenous languages; roads are scarce and bad  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The state has been made even poorer and less stable by thousands of undocumented central American refugees trying to reach the US  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Success in winning converts by both Roman Catholics and Protestants, the latter of whom were encouraged by the authorities in the 1940s to counter Catholic power, has exacerbated tensions: village leaders have expelled thousands of converts, accusing them of undermining Mayan traditions  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Associated Press  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

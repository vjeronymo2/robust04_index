			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Minister broadens contracting-out THE GOVERNMENT yesterday added the management of vehicle fleets and on-street parking to its programme of local authority contracting-out. Mr Tony Baldry, the local government minister, said at a London conference on market testing that the government was proposing that compulsory competitive tendering for these areas should come in on April 1 1995. The same would apply to security work six months later. The additions mark the first broadening of competitive tendering for local author-ities for more than a year. The government plans to introduce the changes ahead of starting competitive tendering in the Pounds 5bn white-collar services area, which will include housing management, information technology and finance. Tendering on some of these will start next summer but contracts will not start until mid-1995. Mr Baldry said compulsion should be the last resort in competitive tendering. 'Local authorities should want to ensure that they get the best value for local residents for the services they deliver without being required to do so,' he added.</p>

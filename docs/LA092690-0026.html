			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT'S PLANS FOR FAST ESCAPE WERE OUT OF LINE;  </P> <P> CRIME: DOUGLAS GIRARD WANTED TO 'BLEND IN' WITH THE CROWD AT A LA VERNE  MCDONALD'S. INSTEAD, HE FOUND HIMSELF SADDLED WITH 20 HOSTAGES.  </P> <P> At the age of 10, Douglas Eric Girard was arrested for stealing a coop full of  pigeons from the roof of a fish market. Like the birds he filched, his criminal  career never quite took off.  </P> <P> "I guess it's true, crime does not pay," he recently told a probation officer,  noting that he has "made enough money to get by but not to get rich."  </P> <P> Even his turn in the spotlight Monday, as the central figure in a 6 1/2-hour  hostage incident, apparently was a result of a botched attempt to elude La  Verne police, authorities said.  </P> <P> An officer responding to the robbery of a children's clothing store saw Girard  and a companion, Frank M. Teresi, get into line at a nearby McDonald's,  investigators said. If the two suspects were trying to blend in, they failed.  Both were heavily tattooed, and wads of money bulged in their socks. Girard,  witnesses said, carried a gun in his back waistband.  </P> <P> Suddenly, the employees were huddling in the basement, customers had hit the  floor and Girard had 20 captives, whether he wanted them or not. He paced,  smoked cigarettes, changed his shirt and shrugged helplessly from time to time  until sheriff's deputies stormed the restaurant shortly before midnight.  </P> <P> No one was harmed. "He never pulled the gun out," said Ramiro Gironas, the  restaurant's assistant manager.  </P> <P> "He's a thief, but not a violent one," said Girard's younger brother, Vincent.  </P> <P> The 32-year-old Girard -- known to his friends as "Dougie" -- has spent most of  his life in and out of youth camps and jails. Police and court records say  Girard and Teresi are both heroin addicts.  </P> <P> Teresi, described by police as the alleged "driver of the getaway car and  possible lookout," is a burly 38-year-old who weighs about 250 pounds and has a  history of several convictions.  </P> <P> He was captured by police in 1983 after accidentally shooting himself in the  leg with a derringer. He pleaded guilty to three counts of armed robbery in  March, 1984, and served three years of a six-year prison sentence, state  officials said.  </P> <P> Girard is a short man, with slicked-back, reddish brown hair, the fourth of six  children. He was born to a mechanic and a housewife in Waco, Tex. The family  moved when he was a youngster to Los Angeles' South Bay.  </P> <P> His mother, Phyllis Hernandez, said in an interview Tuesday that she was  separated from her husband. "We were poor, real poor. We had to live in bad  neighborhoods," Hernandez said. "We did have a roof over our head, but it was  always scrounging."  </P> <P> Vincent Girard said his brother's first brush with the law occurred at age 10.  He was arrested, along with some others, for stealing pigeons from a cage on  the roof of a Wilmington fish market. The charges were later dropped, the  younger Girard said.  </P> <P> Douglas Girard kept stealing bikes and breaking into cars, his brother said.  "All we knew was crime," Vincent Girard said. "Your surroundings make you what  you are. And once you put a kid in jail, that's it. He just gets harder and  harder."  </P> <P> Douglas Girard attended Miller Kilpatrick High School at a county Probation  Department camp in the Malibu hills.  </P> <P> Court records reveal almost annual convictions since 1976 for burglary and  theft of, among other things, televisions, cameras, jewelry and videocassette  recorders. When he was not in custody, a probation report said, he was a  self-employed painter.  </P> <P> In April, he was released on his own recognizance in a Riverside County  burglary case. He was required to stay on 24-hour home detention with his  mother and stepfather in San Jacinto, a small town about 25 miles southwest of  Palm Springs.  </P> <P> He divided his time between his mother's house and that of a friend, Kathleen  Newman, across the street. Girard "was thinking about going to school," Newman  said. "He wanted to . . . just get something going for himself."  </P> <P> In June, he was discharged from state parole. On July 11, he pleaded guilty in  Riverside County Superior Court to one count of burglary. Sentencing was set  for Sept. 17, but Girard did not show up. The judge issued a warrant for his  arrest.  </P> <P> Then Monday, Newman said, she asked Girard to go to the store for her in her  Volkswagen.  </P> <P> He did not return, even though he had promised his mother to clean the bathroom  at home.  </P> <P> Early the next morning, Vincent Girard called his mother into the room where he  was watching television. There was Douglas on the screen, with blood on his  shoulder and a puffy face. His brother had recognized him by a tattoo on the  right side of his neck.  </P> <P> Later, Douglas Girard phoned from jail. "I guess I'm not going to be able to do  your bathroom," he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Jenifer Warren and Eric Lichtblau contributed to this  story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DRAMA IN LA VERNE: A CHRONOLOGY  </P> <P> The sequence of events leading to the arrest of robbery suspects, one of who  terrorized 20 people for 6 1/2 hours at a McDonald's restaurant in La Verne.  </P> <P> MONDAY: 5:20 p.m.-La Verne Police respond to report of an armed robbery at the  Kids Mart clothing store located at 2361 Foothill Blvd.  </P> <P> 5:30 p.m. - Suspects Douglas E.

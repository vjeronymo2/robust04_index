			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> RESTAURANT IN PARK WILL BE DISCUSSED  </P> <P> A city-owned, hilltop restaurant with a 270-degree panoramic view of Orange  County and the Pacific Ocean could sit atop a public park in the East Coyote  Hills next year.  </P> <P> The City Council will hold a public hearing Tuesday afternoon to consider plans  for the restaurant and the layout of the proposed 11-acre Vista Park. The  restaurant would be built on the highest portion of the park, about 40 feet  above the intersection of State College Boulevard and Bastanchury Road.  </P> <P> Plans for the park's design have been tentatively approved by several city  commissions, but the design of the proposed 438-seat restaurant has been a  sticking point among city officials and residents.  </P> <P> In separate meetings this month, the Planning Commission and the Redevelopment  Design Review Committee said the proposed 38-foot-high restaurant was too  massive.  </P> <P> Anaheim-based Summit Restaurant Co. then scaled down plans for its English  country-style restaurant and on Tuesday will bring council members sketches for  a 30-foot-high building.  </P> <P> Summit has a lease with the city to build and operate the restaurant.  </P> <P> "We're trying to design something that will satisfy the citizens of Fullerton  and also create a building that will be a focal point of the community," said  Gary Parkinson, a partner of Summit in the Catch Restaurant in Anaheim.  </P> <P> But an English-style restaurant isn't what some Fullerton residents want to see  as the focal point of the park.  </P> <P> "It will look like an English mansion," said Miriam E. Sheddon, member of a  resident's group called the Coyote Hills Committee. "That doesn't go with a  park; it stands out."  </P> <P> The Coyote Hills Committee, which has about 15 members, wants to see the  planned restaurant blend in more naturally with the park's design.  </P> <P> According to the city's plans, landscaping for the park will consist of  drought-tolerant plants requiring little irrigation and maintenance.

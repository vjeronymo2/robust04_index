			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / France starts to emerge from economic doldrums FURTHER evidence emerged yesterday of the fledgling recovery in the French economy when a survey of small and medium-sized businesses showed that some companies are starting to hire extra staff and to increase investment. Small companies have borne the brunt of France's economic problems over the past year as high interest rates have cut into corporate investment and consumer spending. Until recently the mood of small businesses was unrelentingly grim. But a new survey by the Sofres research consultancy and Credit du Nord bank published in yesterday's La Tribune Desfosses, suggests confidence is slowly improving. The number of small businesses intending to hire new staff rose to 8 per cent, against 5 per cent three months ago. The proportion planning to lay off employees has fallen from 44 per cent to 33 per cent over the same period. Some 17 per cent of companies said they would raise investment. The pressure on the French economy has alleviated slightly since the arrival late last month of the new centre-right government and the subsequent falls in interest rates.</p>

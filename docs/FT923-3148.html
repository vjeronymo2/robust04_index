			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Textile trade rules are attacked TRADE AGREEMENTS on textiles and clothing cost the UK more than Pounds 1bn a year, according to a report published today. The Multi-Fibre Arrangement - rules that specify the amount and types of clothing and textiles to be exported by Third World countries to industrialised consumers - raises prices and reduces competition, says the World Development Movement, the pressure group. Consumers are forced to buy expensive, domestically made clothes while manufacturing is partly shielded from inexpensive competition. In addition, poorer consumers have less choice of cheaper clothing. The report says that the MFA has 'also failed to protect UK jobs. Over 780,000 UK jobs in the textiles industry were lost between 1963 and 1987.' Most were lost through recession, the introduction of new technology and competition from elsewhere in the European Community rather than the Third World. Threadbare. How the rich stitch up the world's rag trade. WDM, 25 Beehive Place, London SW9 7QR. Pounds 3.99.</p>

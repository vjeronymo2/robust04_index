			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Ignatenko, Russian Federation presidential </F> representative in Maritime Kray, and V. Maslakov, director of  Far Eastern plant Zvezda, under the rubric "Official Version":  "The Problem of Radioactive Waste in Maritime Kray Is Not Going  To Be Solved on a Populist Wave"]    [Text] Lately, kray (and not only kray) mass media have  been discussing especially energetically and quite intensely the  problem of utilization of liquid radioactive waste accumulated  by the Pacific Fleet both in its arsenals and at the Far Eastern  plant Zvezda. Unfortunately, a rather considerable number of  these materials are of a clearly populist nature and are not  distinguished by objectivity or a balanced approach. And such  irresponsible statements as "the bay will die and the population  will have to be evacuated," give rise to all sorts of rumors and  conjectures that any time now the end of the world is coming to  Maritime Kray. Residents of the town of Bolshoy Kamen are being  especially subjected to this kind of scare tactics.    Such a frivolous approach to an extremely serious matter not  only does not help solve the problem but also aggravates its  moral and psychological aspects and distracts Maritime Kray  residents from the substance of the matter and the way to deal  with it.    It is true that large quantities of liquid radioactive waste  (LRW) have accumulated in Pacific Fleet arsenals at the Far  Eastern plant Zvezda. TNT-5, TNT-27, and Pinega tankers, as well  as two floating reservoirs of PEK-50 type with a capacity of 100  tonnes, are being utilized for its collection, temporary  storage, and transportation. However, the TNT-5 tanker, which  was decommissioned in 1992, is practically falling apart.    These capacities will be able to accept over the next half a  year about 170 tonnes of LRW. One would think that we still have  a safety margin of six months to take steps in the direction of  creating new capacities for utilization or storage of LRW. This  is not so, however. We do not have this margin, because 170  tonnes of LRW is clearly not enough to fulfill the current  year's state program for ship repair and utilization. Not only  will an important state defense order not be fulfilled, but also  a great number of Bolshoy Kamen residents will be left without  work. Moreover, as specialists point out, it is impermissible to  continue keeping TNT-5 in the plant's aquatic area. Its tanks  contain 794 tonnes of LRW with a total activity of 0.78 curies.  There is simply no solution other than towing TNT-5 outside the  plant's territory and dumping its contents into the sea (which,  by the way, is what other countries that possess nuclear fleets  do). Otherwise, we cannot avoid the serious consequences of the  tanker's depressurization.    It should be emphasized that today the practice of  radioactive waste (RW) disposal at sea in our country represents  the only possible way to ensure functioning of nuclear-powered  ships and vessels. France and England do the same, as a matter  of fact. They have been granted this right, however, under the  International Convention for Protection of Marine Environment in  the Northeast Atlantic Area, which envisages a phase-out of RW  disposal at sea by the year 2018.    In our case, the critical situation with TNT-5 is  exacerbated  by the fact that the Russian Federation government adopted a  decision in the fall of 1993 to ban dumping waste into the sea.  Having imposed the ban, however, it has not made the second  step--offering a solution to the problem. What needed to be done  was to provide our Russian scientists with the opportunity to  implement their versions of LRW reprocessing and allocate the  necessary means for it. This has not been done. As a result, we  have a dilemma: either idle the plants and limit the activities  of the Russian Navy, or violate the government ban and carry out  unauthorized dumping of LRW in the Sea of Japan or other part of  the Pacific Ocean. The former "either" is simply impossible.  This leaves the latter--dumping into the sea.    In our opinion, kray Governor Ye. Nazdratenko, looking into  the root of the problem, made the absolutely correct statement  that in the event the Russian government does not provide  financing for resolution of the problem of LRW storage and  reprocessing, in order to avoid an ecological catastrophe  Maritime Kray authorities will be forced to order a halt in  production resulting in LRW and dump the waste stored at TNT-5  and TNT-27 in specially designated areas of the Sea of Japan, on  the concurrence of the president. This is a very important and  courageous decision, and all Maritime Kray residents ought to  support it.    Now regarding waste reprocessing. The technology for its  utilization is more or less the same. Solid radioactive waste  (SRW)--equipment dismantled from nuclear power generation  systems, such as pumps, steam generators, pipelines, and so  on--are reprocessed with the purpose of reducing their volume  and activity level. SRW is collected in containers and then  buried at disposal sites specially designated and equipped for  this purpose--as a rule, on the territories of countries that  own this waste. These sites must meet a considerable number of  requirements that are in line with both state and international  rules and terms.    There are two options for purification of liquid waste.    One is evaporation. In this case the resulting substances  are  purified water and brine. Brine has a high level of activity,  and therefore is subjected to further reprocessing in order to  reduce its volume and subsequently bury it at SRW disposal  sites. This option has a serious shortcoming--it is very  energy-intensive and is not a good solution in the environment  of constant energy crisis in Maritime Kray.    The second option is water purification through filtration  by  special compounds. The setup itself is simple: an unpurified  water tank, pumps that push the water through filters, a  purified water tank, and a control and automation system.  Servicing this system is quite simple and does not require great  expenditures--in terms of either energy or labor. For reliable  operation it requires six to eight persons for a two-shift  operation.    In our opinion, a temporary and easiest-to-implement version  of this system is installed on a pontoon or a barge. In the  current situation this is the preferable option. Such a mobile  system could play the role of an "ambulance" of sorts--they can  be quickly towed to wherever LRW storage is reaching capacity.    Regretfully, Russia does not yet have a service (which it  should have within the Ministry of Atomic Energy system) engaged  in utilization of radioactive waste--both liquid and solid. The  leadership of the Russian Navy believes that this is not their  problem: The task of the Navy is to ensure defense of the state  at sea. Ship-repair plants, of which Zvezda is one, exist for  the purpose of ship and vessel repair, and reprocessing LRW is  not their specialty. What is the Maritime Kray administration to  do in this situation?    This is a far from rhetorical question; it long ago moved  into the realm of practice. Our Japanese neighbors, having  resolved it long ago, have offered to help. Their systems  operate not only in Japan and not only for purification of LRW  but also for purification of higher toxicity waste.    Russia also has specialists and scientists in the area of  LRW  reprocessing, including in Maritime Kray. What our scientists  offer, however, is only at the laboratory stage. It will take  time and money to organize a competition for the best project  and then implement it. We do not have either.    Therefore we see this potential solution to the current  situation: support Ye. Nazdratenko's proposal to ask Japan,  which is an interested party, to provide monetary aid or LRW  reprocessing systems. Bring Japanese firms into resolution of  these problems, and provide aid directly to Maritime Kray,  bypassing Moscow.    This solution, however, also requires certain time: Japanese  companies estimate that at least six months will pass between  the time financing is provided and the system is put in  operation. While the matter of financing is being resolved in  the Russian "top echelons," however, the clock is ticking  inexorably, and the accumulated LRW will be sitting right in our  lap, in a decrepit vessel. Simple logic brings us back to the  already advanced idea: While talks continue about the system  construction and passions are raging around LRW, we need to dump  this waste into the sea, as was done before the 1993 ban.    As practice and the latest research by specialists show, the  low-activity waste accumulated at the Zvezda plant will have  practically no effect on the ecology of the ocean, whose water  naturally contains metal salts carrying radioactive nuclides.  This is one point. Another is that special areas for waste  dumping are designated quite far from the shore, taking into  account the current, which will quickly dissipate the waste,  practically bringing its radioactivity to a minimum. LRW loses  its negative qualities as ecologically dangerous when it mixes  with the general background of the world ocean. All waste is  stringently documented. And, third, expeditions monitored the  situation at the site of waste dumping. Instrumentation showed  an increased radioactivity of sea water for an hour to an hour  and a half after the dumping. When the LRW dissolved, the water  reacquired its natural background level.    If we calculate the damage to nature during tanker accidents  resulting in oil spills, this damage is far more serious and  dangerous than dumping the same quantity of LRW into the water.    As to construction of a system of waste reprocessing, it  cannot be built in Bolshoy Kamen, which is a densely populated  area. This is the opinion of most Bolshoy Kamen residents; they  do not object--and neither do specialists for that matter--to  using the unfinished complex for LRW storage and processing in  Sysoyev Bay. Enormous money was pumped into this complex back in  the 1960's, but, as is quite common, it was never finished. It  is up to specialists to say what should be done: a new one built  or the already existing one put into operation.    We would like to see us take an united stand in the  resolution of these problems instead of throwing words against  one another at popular referendums and in the press. Today, both  in the kray and in Russia, we cannot be divided into ours and  strangers. The LRW problem is our common problem, our common  trouble.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Van Miert rejects French EU power plan French proposals to alter significantly the European Commission's proposed directive on liberalising the electricity market in the European Union were yesterday described as unacceptable by Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner. Mr Van Miert said the French proposals would be contrary to existing Union rules, partly because they would allow power companies in some countries to preserve a monopoly on imports and exports. He was speaking ahead of a meeting in Brussels today of the council of EU energy ministers which will consider the French 'single buyer' proposals along with the Commission's plan to promote so-called third party access. Third party access would make it possible for power companies to sell electricity directly to industrial power users in another country by giving them access to that country's transmission system. Under the single buyer proposals such deals would have to be conducted through a transmission system operator in the buyer's country. The operator would be responsible for running the system and meeting new demand for electricity. Critics of the single buyer system, including the UK, say the single buyer concept would have little practical impact on increasing competition. Energy ministers will today consider several options, the most likely of which is an inconclusive outcome in which they will order an investigation into whether the single buyer and third party access proposals are compatible. Ministers will focus on proposals for the electricity market. Gas is being given less priority. Mr Van Miert, speaking at a Royal Institute of International Affairs conference in London, said the Commission had a solid commitment to create international energy markets. He said the third party access and other proposals in the directive, first drafted two years ago, went no further than expressing existing rights in Union treaties. He indicated that the Commission would press harder for the liberalisation of the markets through the courts if no progress was made politically. Since the Commission launched its drive to liberalise the energy markets five years ago, it has made only limited progress, with two previous directives having a relatively peripheral effect. In discussions over the current directive, most member states have agreed on introducing competition in generation and on the need to 'unbundle' the accounts of integrated power companies' by separating out production, transmission and distribution costs. However, free market countries argue that the electricity market will only begin to become competitive if third party access is agreed.</p>

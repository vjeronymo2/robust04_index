			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Debts cast a shadow over the Aga Khan: Haig Simonian analyses reasons for a rescue plan at Ciga, the luxury hotels group The Aga Khan, struggling to cut debts at his luxury hotel group, is also running into a string of problems elsewhere in his business empire. These setbacks have cast a shadow over his reputation for shrewd business judgment. The immediate difficulties are focused at Ciga, one of the world's leading prestige hotels groups with 36 hotels in six countries. It is facing the toughest week in its history. In a matter of days, it should sign an agreement with an unspecified Italian investor to sell a 'substantial' slice of the subsidiary owning its properties, once valued at L2,500bn (Pounds 1.2bn). Details have not yet been revealed. But the company is confident the deal will cut debts, now almost L1,000bn including rolled-over interest and a convertible bond issue, to between L350bn and L400bn. That will reduce borrowings to below the level of sales, expected to be around L460bn this year and L500bn in 1993. The breathing space should give Ciga time to consider further steps to reduce borrowing. Even assuming the deal goes through, Ciga's latest tribulations have severely damaged its image and devastated its share price, which yesterday fell 10 per cent to L1,035 - a far cry from the 1991-92 high of L3,413. There are similar, though less acute, problems elsewhere in the business empire of the Aga Khan, who is spiritual leader of 12m to 15m Ismaili Moslems. Losses at Fimpar, the quoted holding company controlled by the Aga Khan and floated in 1987, rose to L65bn last year from L15.3bn in 1990. Meridiana, the Sardinia-based airline which he owns, managed to make a modest L1.3bn profit in 1991 after breaking even the previous year. Aborted plans to set up a rival airline to Iberia in Spain will lead to a loss this year. None the less, the problems at Ciga are the key to the group's weaknesses. They reflect the enormous efforts the Aga Khan's managers have put into expanding the hotel chain. Since its foundation by the aristocratic Volpi family in Venice in 1906, Ciga has been a byword for luxury accommodation in Italy, with a string of five-star 'Palaces', 'Grands' and 'Excelsiors' in cities such as Rome, Milan, Venice and Florence. The company, floated in 1922, came under the Aga Khan's wing in 1985, when he bought the non-quoted financial holding company created by fund manager Mr Oratzio Bagnasco to invest in service sector companies. Ciga was its first - and last - big investment. Ciga's latest problems arise from a mixture of buying expensive new hotels, spending lavishly to modernise many of the remainder, shortly before demand for five-star accommodation started to soften. For the Aga Khan's critics, the problems at Ciga are the legacy of botched decisions based on over-confidence. For the company, the difficulties reflect unusually bad luck which have upset a rational, if ambitious, growth plan. The troubles began in late 1989, when Sige, the Milan-based merchant back owned by the IMI financial services group, pulled out of a deal to lead a rights issue for Fimpar, tha Aga Khan's quoted holding company, on the grounds of deteriorating market conditions. Fimpar's capital increase would have been the first step to a rights issue by Ciga, which would have been wholly subscribed by the parent company. The deal, which would probably have raised around L200bn, was designed to help finance the hotels group's continuing expansion. Since being taken over by the Aga Khan, Ciga had pursued a three-fold strategy of internationalising its largely domestic chain, focusing on the luxury end of the market and diversifying into property. Internationalisation involved buying top-name hotels such as the Palace in Madrid and part of the Imperial in Vienna, as well as others in Paris and Athens, to reduce its dependence on Italy. Concentration took place by selling smaller properties in provincial Italian cities. At the same time, a huge investment programme, costing L450bn between 1986 and 1991, swung into place to raise the standards of the group's famous, but sometimes shabby, properties. Much of the money was spent in Milan. Benefiting from a special zoning amendment linked to the 1990 soccer world cup, which allowed hoteliers to expand their buildings, the company overhauled and extended three of its four properties. Costing around L120bn for the two hotels Ciga owned, rather than just managed, the multi-year project dug into cash flow by cutting room availability while fixed costs remained virtually unchanged. In all, the Milanese works cost L25bn-L30bn in lost revenues. Other surprises pushed Ciga further off course. Diversification, the third leg of its strategy, went sour after permission to develop a huge tract of land in Sardinia was not granted. The failure to win approval was a double embarrassment. It scuppered hopes to inject money into the group by bringing outside investors into the scheme. In terms of image, it embarrassed both Ciga and the Aga Khan, the driving force behind the development since 1962 of Sardinia's rocky north-east coast into the 'Costa Smeralda' - one of Europe's most prestigious and expensive holiday playgrounds. Then came the Gulf war, leading to a drop in travel. Though the market has recovered from the days of early 1991, Ciga remains hit by the economic recession, making businessmen think twice before spending Pounds 200 or more a night for a room. Though now modernised and better value for money than in the past, Ciga's hotels are among the most expensive in the world. To cap it all, Ciga's debts, partly in foreign currencies, have been swollen in lira terms by the September devaluation of the Italian currency. The company estimates the lira value of its borrowings has grown by L50bn as a result. In the circumstances, the plan to cut borrowings comes not a moment too soon, for Ciga and for the reputation of the Aga Khan's business empire.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Light overseas bargain hunting lifts Nikkei EQUITIES gained ground in low volume yesterday, with most investors remaining inactive ahead of next week's expiry of June futures contracts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average rose 121.44 to 18,125.55. It fell briefly below 18,000 in the morning session, to 17,953.33, on arbitrage unwinding, but light bargain hunting by foreign investors and public pension funds lifted share prices and the index reached a high of 18,308.11 in the afternoon. Volume rose slightly from 190m shares to 200m. Dealers and investment trusts focused on short-term trading of speculative theme stocks. Advances led declines by 478 to 425 with 191 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 4.04 to 1,364.58 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.45 to 1082.67. Traders said that institutional investors were waiting for a chance to buy at cheaper levels on the expiry of June futures contracts. Due to the low volume in the September futures and the low price level, the bulk of the arbitrage positions held against June contracts have not been rolled over against their September counterparts. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said that with the expiry for June contracts only one week away, investors expect unwinding to peak next week, presenting a favourable opportunity for bargain hunting. Investors are also waiting for next week's announcement of the Bank of Japan's tankan, or quarterly survey of business sentiment. Mr Robert Feldman at Salomon Brothers Tokyo, forecasts weak figures, since a similar survey conducted by the ministry of international trade and industry indicated that 75 per cent of those surveyed cited poor business conditions. Mazda Motor rose by its daily limit of Y80 to Y521 on dealer buying. Reports that the company had developed recyclable plastic for car bodies spurred buy orders. Other automotive stocks were weak on the year-on-year 12 per cent decline in car sales for May, making this the third consecutive month in which they have fallen. Toyota Motor fell Y10 to Y1,490 and Nissan Motor declined Y14 to Y603. Foreign buying lifted Nippon Express, the leading parcel delivery company, by Y2 to Y706. Investors were encouraged by the company's forecast of a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the current year to next March. Speculative theme stocks dominated trading. Nihon Nohyaku, the agrochemical manufacturer, jumped Y100 to Y1,220. However, Nippon Formula Feed, which originally rose on reports that the company had developed special food for tuna, lost Y3 to Y600 on profit taking. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 0.62 to 20,833.00 in volume of 17.1m shares. Roundup SMALLER markets in the region made most of the running yesterday. MANILA moved up on reports of new oil finds south of the Philippine capital. The composite index climbed 17.93 or a little over 1 per cent to 1,405.72, driven by a 6 per cent rise in the oil sector. Shell's discovery of oil and gas off southern Palawan island followed Saturday's start of commercial drilling at nearby West Linapacan, a major oil find last year. Continued buying from foreign investors took turnover at Manila's two bourses up from 187.3m pesos to 256.05m. NEW ZEALAND came back from a day's holiday to higher profits from the heavyweight blue chip, Telecom, which gained 5 cents to NZDollars 2.15 in unusually heavy volume of 10.1m shares, lifted by heavy buying in the US. The NZSE-40 index closed 9.77 higher at 1,584.64 in turnover up from NZDollars 41.2m to NZDollars 44.6m. TAIWAN's major players stepped up their efforts in small-capitalisation stocks, following their recent sharp falls. The weighted index recovered 12.09 to 4468.94. AUSTRALIA was little changed following news that the economy grew 0.6 per cent in the March quarter, the All Ordinaries index closing 1.9 higher at in turnover up from ADollars 170m to ADollars 225m. Foster's Brewing initially fell 12 cents on news that BHP had appointed receivers and managers to IBI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of International Brewing Holdings which holds a 32 per cent stake in Foster's. But it finally closed up 1 cent at ADollars 2.00. BHP lost 2 cents to ADollars 14.40. BANGKOK turned jittery as the Thai parliament delayed naming a new prime minister, and the SET Index plunged 21.8, or 3.1 per cent to 677.10. Volume was thin, down from Bt3.2bn to Bt2.4bn. SEOUL fell to a new 1992 intraday low, the composite index hitting 564.53 at midday, its lowest since September 1990. It recovered to end at 567.34, only 1.85 lower on the day. SINGAPORE was little changed ahead of a 0.25 percentage point cut in the prime rate by one of the banks after the close. BOMBAY rebounded after restrictions were imposed on on fresh selling. The BSE index ended up 132.59 to 3,133.83.</p>

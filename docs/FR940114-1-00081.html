			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> a. Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute requires that, to qualify for a cancellation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the borrower must be ``unable to complete his or her program''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the school closed. Participants at the San Francisco  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting recommended that the cancellation be available to student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowers who are in attendance at the school at the time the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school closes, or are on a leave of absence or left the school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 60 days prior to the school's closure because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deteriorating conditions at the school. The participants at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New York meeting agreed that students who are registered at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time the school closed should have their loans canceled but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that the benefit also be provided to borrowers who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> left within 90 days prior to the school's closure. Participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the Kansas City meeting endorsed the 60-day time frame but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also recommended that the regulations focus on the date of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announcement that the school is closing if that is earlier than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the actual date that the school closed. Participants at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Atlanta meeting recommended that loan cancellation be provided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students who are in attendance or on a leave of absence at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time the school closed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Prior Payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants at all of the meetings agreed that any payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made by the borrower prior to discharge of the loan should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refunded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> c. Teach-Outs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants at the meetings discussed whether a loan made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a student who is offered a teach-out of the program in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student was enrolled should be canceled. The participants at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Atlanta meeting concluded that a loan should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharged if the student completed a teach-out during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic year for which the loan was made, but that the loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be discharged if the borrower did not take or did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete a teach-out during that time. Participants at the New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> York and Kansas City meetings concluded that a borrower should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the option of whether to accept a teach-out and should have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the loan discharged if the student does not choose or does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete a teach-out program. Attendees at the San Francisco  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting stated that they believed that teach-outs do not work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well in practice and that loans should be canceled if a borrower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not choose to complete the program through a teach-out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> d. Extent of Cancellation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Attendees at each of the meetings also discussed whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans should be canceled only for the academic term for which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower received the loan or whether all loans received for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program should be canceled. Attendees at the Atlanta meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreed that only the loan made for the period in which the school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closed should be canceled. Participants at the meetings in New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> York and San Francisco (and a substantial minority in Atlanta)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that the regulations distinguish between students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrolled in certificate programs and students enrolled in degree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The attendees at those meetings believed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate students were unlikely to be able to transfer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits earned at the closed school and should have all loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> canceled, but that students attending degree-granting schools are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to be able to transfer their credits and should only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive cancellation of the loan for the period in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school closed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> e. Process and Documentation Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary be responsible for notifying the guaranty agencies when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a school closes and that the agencies would be responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifying the lenders of the loans eligible for cancellation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The attendees at that meeting also recommended that collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity be suspended on the affected loans and that public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service announcements be used to notify possibly affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students but that the students not be required to complete any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications or paperwork to prove their entitlement. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attendees at the Atlanta meeting also recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary or a State agency be responsible for determining that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school has closed and that the agencies would notify the affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lenders. The attendees at that meeting also recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower not be required to provide documentation and recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that credit bureau reporting be suspended during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation of possibly affected loans. Attendees at the New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> York meeting recommended that the date of a school's closure be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the applicable State licensing authority and also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that the student not be required to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation of eligibility for cancellation of the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Discharge of Loans for Borrowers Whose Eligibility was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Falsely Certified by the School <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 437(c) to the HEA also provided that loans will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> canceled for borrowers whose eligibility to borrow was falsely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified by the school. The specific issues described below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were discussed in connection with this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> a. Definition of ``False Certification''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants at the San Francisco meeting recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department's regulations provide that the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations should be considered ``false certification:'' a school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifies an application for a borrower who is not eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because he or she does not have the ability to benefit from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training offered; there is fraud by the school in completing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifying the loan application or the school cashes checks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without the borrower's endorsement; or the school submits an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorrect budget, wrong expected family contribution, or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information vital to the determination of the borrower's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility. The participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the definition of ``false certification'' include forged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> checks, falsification of the student's program eligibility or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility for a particular loan amount, and falsification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the borrower's signature. Participants at the New York meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that the Department define ``false certification'' as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the situation in which the school falsely certifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is an eligible institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

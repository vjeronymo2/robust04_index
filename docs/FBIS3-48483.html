However,  Northeastern Asia presents a different picture from that of  Europe, and military expansion continues. The question is, what  sort of measures should Japan take for its national defense in  view of such circumstances? This series of articles examines the  situation on the forward defense perimeter in search of a  departure from an unwarranted sense of "peaceful  well-being."  <H5>  Launching of Missile Without Advance Warning </H5>   "It appears your country launched a missile into the Sea of  Japan. It is regrettable that the launching took place without  any prior notification."    When it became clear in mid-June that North Korea  (Democratic  People's Republic of Korea) had launched the Nodong-1  medium-range missile towards central Japan, unpublished  activities took place at the Japanese Embassy in Beijing. The  above quote is from a telephone call made by then-Minister  Kunihiko Makita (currently secretary to the prime minister) to  Counselor Pak Tok-kyun of the North Korean Embassy. Routine  procedures called for contacts with North Korea through the  Beijing embassies in the absence of formal diplomatic relations  with the latter.    When missiles are launched in open seas around Japan, the  general assembly resolutions of the International Maritime  Organization of which North Korea is a member require advance  notifications to the Japanese Government in order to provide for  safe navigation of ships. Based on the advance notification, the  Maritime Safety Board issues navigation warning advisories  indicating the maritime zones at risk. Even the former USSR gave  the Maritime Safety Agency five days advance notice of  launchings. The reason for such measures is that no ship desires  to become the target of missiles without advance warning.  However, in the recent launching, North Korea took no advance  notification actions whatsoever.    Counselor Pak interrupted just as Mr. Makita continued, "We  are concerned with your country's development and export of  missiles," and arbitrarily cut off the telephone call as he  said, "Japan is forever making remarks of that nature."    A country that is completely lacking in the will to observe  international rules possesses a 1,000-kilometer ballistic  missile that is able to reach all regions of western Japan. The  question is, what measure should be taken in response to this  situation.    Officials of the Japan Defense Agency clarify Japan's air  defense system as follows:    Once Nodong-1 is launched, it reaches its destination in  about seven minutes. During that flight time, air defense  centers of the Air Self-Defense Force [ASDF] located in four  places such as Sayama city, Saitama Prefecture, must detect the  missile and direct and execute interception.    However, the 28 radar sites of the ASDF located throughout  Japan are not capable of detecting missiles launched from the  Korean peninsula or the flight patterns of objects in outer  space. The reason is that they were designed to track such  targets as aircraft and missiles in the inner atmosphere. They  have no choice but to respond to attacks from outer space by  using radar to barely capture objects as they reenter inner  space at the tremendous speed of about Mach 10.    In the event that North Korea develops a missile capable of  reaching the Japanese capital of Tokyo and targets it, the  mission of initial interception will be assigned to the ASDF air  defense missile squadron at Takeyama in Yokosuka. The reason for  this assignment is that the nationwide six-location, 24-unit air  defense missile system is so roughly structured that it will  allow enemy missiles to slip through the network. The  surface-to-air missiles (SAM) known as Patriots assigned to air  defense missile squadrons at Takeyama will be able to intercept  missiles above Shinagawa 10 seconds before they reach their  targets. Even if the Patriots succeed in intercepting their  incoming targets, the situation will pose a frightening one in  which debris will fall into the heart of the Tokyo metropolitan  area.    Moreover, Patriots currently assigned are designed to deal  with aircraft and "are not designed to cope with incoming  missiles approaching from a very high, almost vertical angle,"  according to Shigeru Hatakeyama, administrative vice minister of  defense. Patriot II improved missiles used by the U.S. Forces  during the Gulf war are capable of intercepting, to a degree,  such high-angle missiles, according to Administrative Vice  Minister Hatakeyama, but actual deployment is not expected until  1996.  <H5>  Situation Exceeds Limits of Self-Defense </H5>   Although Colonel Sumio Hirai of the ASDF First Air Defense  Missile Group points out that, "The current version of the  Patriot could be used, if incoming targets could be intercepted  by radar systems. However, we must rely on the United States for  initial detection capabilities. The ultimate question is, how  much intelligence would the United States be willing to supply  the SDF units?"    A key strategy for intercepting Nodong-1 is the theater  missile defense (TMD) system proposed as a joint development  project to Vice Minister Hatakeyama by U.S. Under Secretary of  Defense Deutsch in the latter part of September. This strategy  calls for reconnaissance satellites to detect launchings of  enemy missiles and to relay the intelligence to earth where  intercepting missiles would be launched from such facilities as  Patriot missile launchers, Aegis naval ships, and tactical  ultra-high-altitude air defense systems.    TMD poses such bottlenecks as 1) exercise of collective  defense rights which is not sanctioned by the Constitution; 2)  inconsistency with Diet resolutions calling for the peaceful use  of space; and 3) price tag of 1 trillion yen.    However, the situation is such that it exceeds the limits of  case-by-case defense rights. Moreover, Japan has, in reality,  forfeited its option to develop a full-scale intelligence  capability. In passing the "resolution for peaceful use of  space," it decided not to possess spy satellites. Japan has  entrusted the United States with its national defense through  intelligence supplied by U.S. military satellites.    The question is whether Japan will join in a regional  defense  system or develop an independent satellite system. Nodong-1 will  force Japan to conduct a fundamental review of its defense  policy.  <H5>  Proposals by 200 Individuals To Change Japan </H5> <H5>  A Proposal for a Crisis Management and Early Warning System </H5>   Comments by Satoshi Morimoto, Senior Researcher, Nomura  General Research Center    North Korea's objective for launching its medium-range  ballistic missile Nodong-1 has not surpassed the realm of  speculation, but it is conceivable that they merely wished to  demonstrate the vulnerability of Japanese security and  diplomacy. Accordingly, there is the possibility that North  Korea will use Nodong-1 as a lever in conducting future  diplomacy.    In the middle of June, the then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Kono  announced the missile launching. I believe that the government  made that announcement to signal to the general public a warning  that there is a need to take a more serious stance concerning  threats from North Korea, but if Japan should react in a more  serious way, it would be playing into the hands of North Korean  strategy. Japan must take military threats seriously, but it  must not be intimidated into falling prey to its threats.    TMD research should probably be carried on as a Japan-U.S.  joint project. However, the question remains as to whether the  government has the determination to overcome problems concerning  the system, such as 1) legal issues, 2) huge costs, and 3)  military effectiveness and costs versus the end product.    However, if one were to ask if TMD alone could save the  nation from threats, the answer is no. I believe the more  serious issue facing the nation is the lack of a crisis  management system.    As for the question of what Japan should do if a threat  arises before the deployment of TMD, it has no answer. The  government would be highly irresponsible if it were to inform  the general public of a threat without the answers to such  questions.    Threats such as those posed by Nodong-1 cannot be handled by  Japan alone. We must structure a regional early warning  intelligence system operating not only for the sake of Japan,  but northeastern Asia as a whole.    The prohibition concerning the exercise of collective  self-defense rights is a mere legal formality. National security  in the true sense cannot be attained unless we surpass and  overcome the limitations of collective self-defense rights in a  military sense in responding to the threat of ballistic missiles  and nuclear weapons of a sophisticated nature.    It is probably important that we visualize the unexpected  and  develop a substantial system and enhanced capabilities to  respond expeditiously to situations as a nation.    Warranting special attention is the potential for emergency  situations in the post-cold war era of a scale less than war  such as massive movements of refugees and a threat to maritime  navigation owing to territorial disputes in the South China Sea.  There is a need to conduct preparatory training on a national  scale and to make advance preparations for interministry  procedures. We must not shun such tasks as undesirable  governmental missions.    [Satoshi Morimoto] Born in Tokyo in 1941.

Ever since South Korea established offshore  territorial boundaries extending 12 nautical miles or 22  kilometers offshore in 1953, South Korea has posted a patrol  ship inside the 12-nautical-mile line, while Japan has posted a  similar ship just outside the line, creating a tense  confrontation at times.  <H5>  Confrontation of Tensions </H5>   Captain Yoshiro Kanetomo, 51, of the patrol ship "Wakasa,"  which had patrolled the waters around Takeshima for two and a  half years and was reassigned to duty at the Tamano Maritime  Safety Region since October 1993 cannot forget what happened one  day in May 1993.    It was just past 2000 hours, when the Wakasa reached waters  just beyon the 12-nautical-mile line near Takeshima.    Suddenly, the crew noticed a ship in the dark approaching at  a very high speed. The lights on the ship differed from those  found on a freighter or fishing vessel. Captain Kanetomo sensed  an inexplicable fear from the rapidly approaching ship.    When the approaching ship was one kilometer away, the  wireless radio received an inquiry asking "Unknown ship  [identify yourself]." The Wakasa replied, "This is the Wakasa, a  Japanese patrol ship. What are you?" The approaching ship then  responded in a stern voice, "Korean Navy. What are you doing  here?"    The Wakasa replied, "We are patrolling Takeshima, Japanese  territory."    The South Korean naval ship responded, "This is not  Takeshima. It is Tok Do. Do not approach; it is a South Korean  island."    After completing this tense exchange of words, the two ships  confronted each other with floodlights at a distance of 500  meters. The purpose was to mutually confirm the nationality and  name of the vessels. The tense confrontation lasted for a few  moments and then the South Korean naval ship made a U-turn into  its 12-nautical-mile territorial waters.    "Since darkness of night makes identification of the  opposing  ships difficult, we tend to become tense. In any event, we make  a special effort not to create trouble in and around Takeshima."    As indicated by this statement by Captain Kanetomo, the  Japanese Government's basic stance on the Takeshima issue is  that 1) it will seek a peaceful solution, and 2) it will not  take any controversial actions.    The Takeshima issue finds its origin in the establishment of  the Rhee Line and the inclusion of Takeshima in 1952 by  President Rhee during a vacuum created by the suspension of  Japanese rule under the provisions of the Occupation Memorandum  of 1946. After a series of incidents including the removal of  Japanese territorial signs and shootings at patrol ships, South  Korea used military force to occupy Takeshima in 1954.    Later, in connection with the signing of the Japan-South  Korea Basic Treaty in 1965, foreign ministers of both nations  left the issue open for resolution through peaceful means by  stating in the official documents exchanged concerning  settlement of disputes, "Disputes between the two nations shall  be resolved through diplomatic channels. In the event such  efforts fail to produce resolutions, the matters shall be  subjected to mediation."  <H5>  South Korea Permanently Stations Security Forces </H5>   However, despite the foregoing agreement, South Korea  permanently stations about 14 guards and has built lookouts,  barracks, concrete pillboxes and steel guard towers on  Takeshima. During an October 1992 session of the South Korean  National Assembly, Naval Chief of Staff Kim Chol-u revealed that  a study is underway to install a radar base to cope with patrol  ships of the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency.    The South Korean Government is dedicating itself to  establishing a record of effective control over Takeshima by  granting a fishing boat to a fisherman family which relocated to  the island and implementing a forestation project.    In the meanwhile, Japan has no choice but to table issues  concerning Takeshima before the South Korean Government. During  the June session of the regular meeting of the Japan-South  Korean conference, then-Foreign Minister Kabun Muto stated,  "Takeshima is a territory of Japan from both historical and  international law perspectives. It is very regrettable that it  is occupied by South Korea." In response, South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu asserted, "Tok Do is inherently South  Korean territory."    According to sources at the Northeast Asia Bureau of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese Government cannot  allow itself to alter its assertion for territorial rights and  it will continue to repeat its position no matter how much it  offends the South Korean Government, thus causing the Japanese  Government to refer to the Takeshima issue at each annual  session of the regularly scheduled foreign ministers conference,  but one cannot deny that the exchange is akin to a ceremony in  which one side makes an assertion and the other side disregards  what is said.  <H5>  Possibilities for Peaceful Resolution Are Nil </H5>   Relative to a peaceful resolution, Japan is unable to  approach Takeshima which is its inherent territory and the  continuing militarization of the island by South Korea  demonstrates that it has no intention of becoming a party to  peaceful settlement. Even Foreign Ministry officials admit,  "Frankly, there is no prospect of a peaceful resolution."    According to government sources, it is probably true that,  in  reality, "territorial issues can be settled only through brute  force. But, Japan does not possess that option nor do such  measures have any significance."    However, the question arises, should Japan totally neglect  an  issue over which it has no meaningful countermeasure? Military  sources point out, "The issue of the Senkaku Islands which China  asserts is part of its territory could have a delicate effect on  the Takeshima issue. The reason is that, if China should move to  exercise effective control, Takeshima has demonstrated that  Japan is unable to take any countermeasure." The same military  source adds, "As long as Japan is unable to take countermeasures  in response to the exercise of effective control, it must think  in terms of how it can prevent the exercise of such control."    Captain Kanetomo points out, "The problem is that the  Japanese people have very little awareness of land and sea-  based territorial rights. One wonders how many people are aware  that a Japanese island is being occupied." Takeshima which is  about to be consigned to oblivion symbolizes the fragility of  the national defense system.  <H5>  Chronology of Takeshima </H5>    -  February 1905--Japanese Government declares its intention  to exercise territorial rights by issuing the Shimane Prefecture  Notice To Incorporate Takeshima Into Shimane Prefecture (Oki-gun  Gokamura Oaza Hisami Aza Takeshima).    -  January 1952--South Korea established the Syngman Rhee Line  and  made Takeshima (Tok Do) a part of South Korean territory.    -  June 1954--Internal Affairs Department of the South Korean  Government announces that the Maritime Police Forces will be  stationed in Takeshima.    -  September 1954--Japan makes a cabinet decision on a plan to  submit the question of title to Takeshima to the International  Court of Justice and proposes to the South Korean Government by  note that the matter be presented to the court.    -  October 1954--South Korea rejects the Japanese proposal.    -  June 1965--Japan-South Korea Basic Treaty is signed.

Footnote on Takeshima Takeshima is located 157  kilometers northwest of Shimane Prefecture's Okishima and  consists of two small islands called Higashijima and Nishijima  and surrounding reefs. Total area is 0.23 square kilometers,  about the size of Hibiya Park. It is known as a treasure trove  of seafoods such as abalone and turbo.    In ancient Japanese history, Takeshima was known as  Matsushima and was managed by the Otani and Kawamura families of  the Hoki clan (Tottori) which had been granted the islands from  Japan's feudal government during the initial stages of the Edo  era. On the other hand, South Korean Government documents of the  Rhee era in 1696 assert that a historical fact exists wherein An  Yong-bok forced Japanese to evacuate from Takeshima.  <H5>  Proposals by 200 Individuals To Change Japan </H5> <H3>  Present to the General Public Options for Defense  Capabilities </H3>   Comments by Toshiyuki Shikata, Visiting Researcher,  World Peace Research Center    Now that we have entered the post-cold war era, even nations  which once relied on military force are attempting to abandon  their reliance on physical force for pursuit of their national  interests. These moves illustrate that other nations are  following the example set by Japan.    However, the quantitative levels maintained by Japan for its  defense capabilities are unparalleled in the world in terms of  their ultra-pacifist characteristics. It is not feasible to make  any quick reductions. I believe an appropriate defense  capability would call for the elevation of current defense  capabilities and efficiency and the attainment of a small-scale  elite military force.    Military capabilities are maintained to cope with the  unexpected and it is most ideal that they are never committed to  actual use.    The Self-Defense Forces [SDF] are dedicated to training. As  an example, gunnery technicians serving on combat tanks spend  their time working to shorten the time required to launch a  projectile when a target is detected.    However, SDF personnel face their severest professional test  in observing the theory that non-use of defense capabilities is  the ideal military situation. In other words, there is a need to  give them the opportunity to show that their professions serve a  meaningful purpose. Such opportunities are probably offered in  connection with major natural disaster relief projects and UN  peacekeeping operations (PKO).    However, I would like the general public to be aware that  SDF  personnel can serve effectively in emergencies only because they  have been committed to routinely serve with honor and respect.  They would be useless if they were treated without respect and  as so much extraneous freight.    On the other hand, it seems that individuals among SDF  personnel complain of their low ranking in society. But SDF  personnel can enhance their societal standing only through their  own efforts.    SDF personnel are strong collectively, but are very fragile  when performing as individuals. It appears they suffer from the  misconception that they lose their identity as individuals as  part of a collective organization.    SDF personnel rarely take courses at evening extension  courses at universities even when given the opportunity.  Officers are given the opportunity to work for master's degrees  at the graduate level. The ideal situation provides for the  integration of capabilities as a group based on individual  strengths.    As long as intelligence is made available at an early stage  and reserves can be mobilized during emergencies, it would  probably be acceptable to minimize peacetime military forces.  However, if intelligence resources are available only on a  minimal, delayed basis and emergencies must be encountered  suddenly, we probably need to maintain a certain level of  military capability even during peacetime.    We should probably ask the general public which option it  wishes to choose. The government should explain the available  defense formats and levels and allow the general public to  select the appropriate option.    [Toshiyuki Shikata] Born in 1936 in Shizuoka  Prefecture.

The fisheries  cooperatives operate independent patrols in self-defense because  of the unending illegal operations of South Korean fishing  vessels.  <H5>  Situation Finally Produces Casualties </H5>   "At the present time we are not operating protective patrol  ships. South Korean fishing vessel operators know this and come  to poach in our waters in droves. They took all of 300,000  abalone that we had planted in the waters."    Shigeyoshi Inuzuka, age 48, chief of general affairs at the  Nagasaki Prefecture Tsushima Fishing Cooperative located at the  northern end of Tsushima, an island located near the  international boundary, drooped his shoulders in dismay. South  Korean fishing vessels violate the 12-nautical-mile (22  kilometer) limit under cover of darkness and poach frequently in  Japanese waters.    Yoshio Sawamura, chief of the Fisheries Policy Department of  the Federation of Fishermen's Cooperatives comments, "The  situation continues to worsen as over 90 percent of South Korean  vessels take such actions as deliberately concealing their true  identity."    According to figures confirmed by the Fisheries Agency,  South  Korean fishing vessels committed 1,181 violations as of the end  of August this year, exceeding prior-year comparable-period  figures by 170. Illegal operations include 1) violation of  territorial waters, 2) violation of Japan-South Korean fisheries  agreement, and 3) violation of Japan-South Korean Fisheries  Independent Control Measures; 220 of the violations took place  at Tsushima.    The Maritime Safety Agency has assigned two patrol ships and  the Fisheries Agency has assigned one surveillance ship, but it  is difficult to cover all of the coastline at Tsushima, which is  about twice the size of Biwa Lake.    The Kamitsushima-cho Fisheries Cooperative initiated  protective policies in 1985. However, on 25 July 1992, a  much-feared casualty was recorded.    Before daybreak on that day, radar operated by the fisheries  cooperative detected what appeared to be illegally operating  South Korean fishing vessels four kilometers off Tsushima.  Sixty-year-old Captain Takeyoshi Ogi of the six-ton protective  patrol vessel Hayate operated by the fisheries cooperative moved  immediately to the scene of the illegal operations.    The mission of the protective patrol ships is to quickly  detect illegal operations of South Korean and Chinese fishing  vessels and to report such violations to the Maritime Safety  Agency.    At 0300 hours, Ogi informed the fisheries cooperative, "I am  currently pursuing a large South Korean trawl-net fishing boat.  The waves are beginning to grow higher." That was to be his last  message. The Izuhara Maritime Safety Agency station at the  southern tip of Tsushima dispatched the patrol ship Tatsugumo in  response to information from the fisheries cooperative. However,  the Hayate had already disappeared from the scene of the  violations.    The Hayate was a small plastic boat and there was no way it  could deal with a 150-ton trawl-net fishing boat. Concerned  individuals gathered at the fisheries cooperative worried about  Ogi's fate. At 0530 hours, a South Korean fishing vessel  discovered the capsized, unmanned Hayate.    When towed to port by the South Korean vessel, the Hayate's  propeller was so damaged that it retain none of its original  shape. Captain Ogi is still unaccounted for. According to the  Maritime Safety Agency, "There is a strong possibility that the  propeller of the Hayate became entangled in the steel wiring  released from South Korean fishing vessels during their  high-seas operations."    According to the Nagasaki Prefecture Fisheries Department,  protective vessels total six for Tsushima and Ikishima as a  whole. In December 1993, the Kamitsushima-cho fisheries  cooperative will replace the Hayate with a new eight-ton  protective patrol vessel.  <H5>  Living Together With Danger </H5>   Department chief Inuzuka appeals for increased law  enforcement, saying, "If we exercise vigilance through the use  of protective patrol vessels, there is an undeniable decrease in  poaching incidents. However, protective patrol vessels handle a  dangerous mission."    "We have appealed to the South Korean Consulate in Fukuoka  for corrective action, but we see no signs of improvement. We  would like to see the South Korean Government appear at the  scene of the violations to enforce the law."    The foregoing statement was made by the Japanese Government  at the conference of director general of the Japan-South Korea  Fisheries Ministries held at the Ministry of Agriculture,  Forestry, and Fisheries at the end of August 1993. However, the  South Korean Government simply replied, "We understand. However,  the violations are limited in number."    The Maritime Safety Agency has the authority to apprehend  fishing vessels that violate territorial waters. However, the  agency, in reality, has pretty much thrown in the towel when it  comes to fishing vessels violating the Japan-South Korea  Fisheries Agreement. This agreement provides that, in  extraterritorial waters, only law-enforcing ships of the  violating ship's nation can enforce the law relative to such  ships (principle of the ship's flag). According to the Maritime  Safety Agency, the Japanese Government can only "take pictures  of the violations and report them to South Korea." All we can do  is wait for South Korean law-enforcement vessels to arrive on  the scene.    In view of these circumstances, the Federation of Fisheries  Cooperatives is holding a rally in Tokyo on 26 October to adopt  a resolution seeking across-the-board enforcement of a  200-nautical-mile territorial demarcation line.  <H5>  Cautious About Establishing a Framework </H5>   Currently, Japan has established a 200-nautical-mile  fisheries zone, but has not applied this principle to waters  around South Korea and China. When the 200-nautical-mile law was  implemented in 1977, similar demarcations for the two countries  were withheld because both nations had not established  200-nautical-mile territorial rights and disputes were pending  concerning territorial rights over Takeshima and Senkaku Islands.    The Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives seeks establishment  of a new framework, saying, "Internationally, the  200-nautical-mile system has become a routine matter and coastal  nations control the situation based on their fisheries  jurisdictional rights, but jurisdictional and law-enforcement  rights relative to South Korea and China are limited to the  respective territorial waters." Already, in the North Pacific  region, Japan, the United States, Canada, and Russia have  approved fisheries treaties and agreements in which mutual  action is taken to inspect and capture vessels that engage in  illegal operations.    However, according to the Fisheries Agency, "South Korea is  cautious about forming a new framework." No effective  countermeasure is available to Japan.    Department chief Inuzuka appeals, "The government should  consider why it is necessary to operate protective patrol  vessels." The existence of protective patrol vessels exposes the  reality that the government is incapable of protecting the  livelihood and safety of coastal fishermen.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Violations by South Korean Fishing Vessels                                |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year          |Hokkaido      |Sanin/Hokuriku|Kyushu        |Total         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1988          |61            |237           |1,880         |2,178         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1989          |24            |507           |1,629         |2,160         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990          |20            |256           |1,174         |1,450         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991          |33            |111           |825           |969           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992          |25            |228           |827           |1,080         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993          |7             |465           |709           |1,181         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

Current independent regulatory measures are to be implemented  between 1992 and December 1994. They include such measures as  shortening the time allowed for operation of South Korean  trawling vessels in waters off Hokkaido and establishment of  zones off western Japan where South Korean trawl-net vessel  operations will not be allowed and subjected to guidance and  enforcement of the prohibition. Even the Japan-China Fisheries  Agreement and measures to be taken in waters covered by the  agreement as approved in 1975 are based on the principle of the  ship's flag. There are no agreements that cover waters  surrounding Japan.  <H5>  Proposals by 200 Individuals To Change Japan </H5> <H5>  It Is Only Logical To Protect One's Territorial Waters </H5>   Comments by Shigeo Hiramatsu, Professor, Social Science  Department, Kyorin University    Relative to China's efforts to increase its naval forces in  recent years, there is the viewpoint in Japan that, "as a  military force, they are still limited and do not pose a threat."    For sure, much of China's naval weaponry is outdated and  lags  in terms of technology, but the problem is that its naval forces  are large enough to wage war on their own. In terms of  antisubmarine patrol capabilities, the Japanese Maritime  Self-Defense Force [MSDF] is top level, but cannot wage war  because it lacks attack capabilities.    The Chinese Navy possesses attack weapons such as bombers,  land combat units, and nuclear submarines. It poses a  substantial threat to surrounding nations with limited military  capabilities.    China asserts that all seas surrounding its continental  regions are "Chinese seas." In the territorial waters law which  it implemented in 1991, it declared that the Japanese territory  known as the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea is Chinese  territory.    China is using its naval power as a backdrop in making  advances in the South China Sea. The South China Sea is part of  Japanese sea lanes, where its tankers navigate on a daily basis.    However, the Japanese Government persists in assuming a  passive stance. When China claimed the Senkaku Islands as part  of its national territory, Japan merely lodged an oral protest.    Ever since 1991, repeated incidents have taken place in  which  Japanese fishing vessels have been attacked by unidentified  ships which are believed to be of Chinese origin, but Japan has  failed to take any effective countermeasure.    Such unidentified ships have also victimized merchant ships  of Russian registry, but Russia has dispatched naval ships and  have demonstrated that it will not hesitate to exercise military  action if additional attempts are made at obstruction of safe  navigation. The result of such Russian actions was that China  apologized by admitting, "China was responsible for two of the  four incidents."    If an appropriate protest is lodged, even China responds. It  is very improper to take a weak position because, "We might  offend the other party." There is a need to say that which is  proper and demonstrate one's presence as a nation.    However, the Maritime Safety Agency is limited in its  capabilities by the attitude that any deployment of the MSDF  would violate the Constitution. As a result, no Japanese  Government agency has the authority to control unidentified  ships. Japan must first come to grips with this problem.    Seas encompassed by the 200-nautical-mile economic water  zones cover 3.86 million square kilometers or close to 10 times  Japanese national lands. The expanse equals an area which ranks  seventh behind Russia.    It would be logical for Japan to protect those national seas  in its role as a nation.

Defense expenditures are subject to an  annual yearend debate on budget cuts, but the situation at the  SDF installation level is a truly sad picture--one gets the  impression that relevant officials have engaged in defense  budget debates based on impractical theories in disregard of the  real situation.  <H3>  Over 30 Percent of Facilities Have Existed Since the Old  Japanese Military Days </H3>   Pre-World War II facilities still exist in the SDF. More  than  30 percent of the maintenance facilities and warehouses used by  the GSDF were built by the former Japanese military forces.    In the evening of 5 January 1993, the GSDF 5th Division  garrisoned at Obihiro-shi in northern Hokkaido was hit by major  tremors of the 5.0 magnitude as part of the 7.8 magnitude  tremors which centered around Kushiro Island. The earthquake was  similar in intensity to the 7.9 magnitude tremor which hit  during the Kanto plains quake of 1924.    Colonel Shuichi Ishii, 52, commander of the Obihiro Garrison  Operations Unit, worried about whether the maintenance  facilities and wooden buildings built 50 years ago could  withstand the intensity of the tremors. Those facilities were  converted from the former hangars and mess halls that were built  in 1940 to house Japanese Air Force units.    Fortunately, no damage was suffered, but Colonel Ishii wore  a  complex expression as he confessed, "The old Japanese military  structures were durable. If they had been destroyed, we would  have had the opportunity to replace them."    SDF policy calls for demolition and replacement when wooden  structures are 30 years old, and the age limit for concrete  structures is 50 years, but, in reality, the situation reflects  very little progress. Even in the area of living quarters, which  enjoys the highest of priorities, nearly 60 percent or 2.11  million square meters should be demolished and replaced, but  only 36 percent will have been replaced by fiscal year 1993.    Maintenance facilities which are used to service the newest  of equipment are comparatively new and have heating systems, but  all others are scheduled for future replacement. Six percent of  the facilities consist of buildings built during the Meiji era.    The vehicle maintenance facility that was an old Air Force  hanger concerning which Colonel Ishii was worried in connection  with the earthquake is used to inspect and maintain 150 pieces  of self-propelled howitzers and trucks of the Fifth Artillery  Regiment of the Fifth Division. It covers 3,600 square meters of  floor space and is the largest such facility at that particular  garrison.    Akira Takai, chief of the custodial branch of the Garrison  Operations Unit sighs as he admits, "The only repair to the  building was the replacement of the metal roofing in 1971.  November during winter months in Obihiro brings -20  Centigrade temperatures in the evening and mornings. But we  don't have a heating system."    That situation forces the 70 or so maintenance personnel who  work in the building to warm themselves at the single jet burner  in the middle of the plant as they go about performing their  maintenance tasks.    Maintenance personnel confess, "We wear gloves for warmth,  but when we handle tiny precision parts we are forced to use our  bare hands. In 30 minutes, our hands begin to freeze. We  alternate between the jet heater and the work station. That  means reduced efficiency and a higher exposure to the potential  for accidents."    Another factor which exacerbates the battle with poor  working  conditions are the 10 pigeons that cohabit the building. The  maintenance personnel work hard to polish and shine the  equipment, but once they suffer a hit by "pigeon droppings" from  the rafters, they have no choice but to repeat their polish and  shine details.    Maintenance personnel explain, "We have mounted netting at  the entrances to prevent the pigeon invasion, but we cannot  avoid opening the doors during the day to bring sunlight and  fresh air into the building."    The 5th Division has developed a plan to completely rebuild  two-thirds of the maintenance facility and to install a heating  system, but the cost would be 870 million yen. According to an  officer of the unit, "We've pleaded for budget approval in  fiscal year 1994, but there's no telling what will happen in the  face of the defense spending restraints."    Growth in defense spending was limited to 3.8 percent in  fiscal year 1992, the lowest level since fiscal year 1960, and  it was cut further in fiscal year 1993 to 1.95 percent.    In December 1992, the Mid-Term Defense Program [MTDP] for  fiscal years 1991-1995 totaling 22.75 trillion yen was reduced  by about 580 billion yen to 22.17 trillion yen. The MTDP had  placed greater emphasis on the construction of rear-area support  systems such as living quarters for SDF personnel over frontline  equipment such as combat tanks and destroyers.  <H5>  Failure To Act May Lead to Personnel Shortages </H5>   Estimated budget requests for defense spending approved in  August 1993 for fiscal year 1994 reflect a 1.95 percent  increase, the lowest level since the ceiling system was  installed in 1961.    Moreover, since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa issued a  decision saying, "I ask that the growth in defense spending be  restrained within the level approved for the initial fiscal year  1993 budget," the JDA and SDF personnel were demoralized by a  sense of frustration. The prime minister in the middle of  August, stated in connection with the MTDP review by JDA key  staff officials that, "I believe appropriate action is being  taken in terms of the general public's viewpoint," and clearly  enunciated his posture whereby defense spending cuts are a  matter of basic policy.    Joint Staff Council Chairman Tetsuya Nishimoto at a luncheon  with Prime Minister Hosokawa at the Prime Minister's Residence  in the middle of September made a strong appeal for the manner  in which SDF personnel of an invisible nature were quietly and  assiduously engaged in training and the performance of duties,  but there is no telling how well the prime minister appreciated  his dissertation.    Midlevel officers of the 5th Division reveal, "There is the  opinion that one must endure all situations as long as he is a  member of the SDF, but such an attitude poses obstacles to  personnel recruiting goals. There are plenty of jobs available."    One wonders how Prime Minister Hosokawa as the supreme  commander of the SDF will reconcile defense budget restraints  and national defense objectives.  <H5>  Breakdown of Defense Spending </H5>   Defense spending in fiscal year 1993 will total 4.6406  trillion yen, representing 6.4 percent of the total general  account fiscal spending budget. The breakdown includes 1) 42  percent for personnel and subsistence, including personal pay  and subsistence allowances; 2) 23 percent for equipment  purchases such as combat tanks and destroyers; 3) 16 percent for  maintenance expenses such as education and training; 4) 10  percent for base countermeasures expenses such as support for  U.S. Forces in Japan; 5) 4 percent for maintenance of  facilities; and 6) 3 percent for research and development. The  estimated budget for the next fiscal year will be 4.7311  trillion yen, reflecting a cut of 17.9 billion yen to 900  billion yen for frontline equipment such as combat tanks and a  45.8 billion yen increase to 1.8290 trillion yen for rear-area  equipment.  <H5>  Proposals by 200 Individuals To Change Japan </H5> <H5>  A Japan-U.S. Framework for Security Is Indispensable </H5>   Comments by Mr. Ryohei Oga, Former Chief of Staff,  MSDF    Trends in Southeast Asia are of foremost concern in greeting  the post-cold war period. Nations such as China and India can  now easily obtain military equipment and are in the process of  reinforcing their navies and air units.    However, Japan must coexist with the Southern nations in an  amicable manner. How Japan does this is a matter of politics.    Ten years ago, a civilian symposium was held and an  Indonesian researcher listed "threats from Southeast Asia." He  mentioned domestic communism as the number-one concern; next was  China which lurked in the background of domestic communism;  third was the then-USSR; and fourth was rearmament by Japan.  When I asked, "What do you mean by rearmament?" he replied, "A  case in which Japan abandons the Japan-U.S. security arrangement  and enters into rearmament after revising the Constitution." In  response, a scholar from Thailand retorted, "We are now  conducting a debate premised on the Japan-U.S. security  arrangement. You are completely off track relative to your  comments."    At that moment I became keenly aware of the fact that the  Japan-U.S. security system served as a basic framework for  actions by Japan. When one considers security for Southeast  Asia, it is important that Japan continue to act within the  framework of the Japan-U.S. system and that Japan confine itself  to that framework.    What I wish to appeal here is that we give consideration to  the very founding of our nation. The question arises, can we do  without defense capabilities? No nation in the world can survive  without such capabilities. All nations have a mobilization  capability. If one were to question the mobilization  capabilities of Japanese reserve SDF personnel, the matter would  be problematic. Our nation has never given serious thought to  this question.    Ever since the Yoshida cabinet days, the nation has given  birth to the basic concept that we have a "military unit without  combat capabilities" and "an SDF that is not a military unit."  The Legislation Bureau of the cabinet stubbornly refuses to  change these concepts.    Even though the JDA assumed a flexible posture in  considering  UN PKO activities, all efforts to coordinate with the  Legislation Bureau ended in an argument of principles. It was  even concluded about the use of weapons that they could be used  only for self-defense and during emergency evacuation  operations. The opinions of the Legislation Bureau were binding  in all cases.    Although we should settle the argument about naval ships by  merely saying, "SDF vessels are recognized as naval ships under  international law," we end up with the interpellations saying  that "SDF vessels are not naval ships." I believe the coalition  government should engage in a thorough internal discussion  concerning this situation.    However, I hope the Hosokawa government will not do that  which is unnecessary. We will have problems even in connection  with the review of the MTDP if a cabinet which partially refuses  to recognize the SDF engages itself in the task.

At end of  World War II was a Navy lieutenant senior grade as a chief  torpedoman on a Type 202 submarine. After engaging in the  movement of troops back to Japan and minesweeping operations  after the war, entered the MSDF in 1952. Served as director of  the Operations and Plans Department, MSDF; commander of a fleet  escort force; commandant, Ominato District, and chief of staff,  MSDF, and retired in 1980. Served as consultant to Japan Radio  Company until May 1993.  <H5>  [22 Oct 93 p 6] </H5>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Proposals by 200  Individuals To Change Japan   <H5>    We Are Speaking of a Situation That Differs From Defense </H5>  Budget Cuts in Europe and the United States    Comments by Shigeru Hatakeyama, Administrative Vice  Minister for Defense    Although we should not target a specific nation in  formulating "basic defense capabilities," it is probably true  that the former USSR served as the backdrop for developing the  Defense Program Outline in 1976.    If one were to think that Japan no longer needs a defense  system because of the collapse of the USSR, that is wrong.  Rather, there is a proliferation of situations such as the  modernization of the Far Eastern Russian Forces, development of  nuclear capabilities and extension of missile ranges by North  Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), and modernization  of military forces in China, making a distinction among  principal problem areas very difficult.    A situation whereby one is forced to develop capabilities to  be responsive to a variety of situations makes for a rather  difficult position. For a nation such as ours which was  dedicated to a defensive posture, focusing on a single target  was an easy matter. In the future, individual problem areas may  be of a lesser magnitude, but we must concern ourselves with a  greater number of problem areas.    We have already initiated a review of the Defense Outline,  but I believe once the review is completed, we must next make a  series of quantitative decisions. We are now in the process of  formulating a new philosophy.    The United States, Great Britain, and Russia are in the  process of reducing defense expenditures, but they are in the  process of withdrawing from global roles and discarding that  which has become extraneous, while Japan was never a part of the  global pattern. It is a matter of considering the defense issue  from a totally different perspective. The situation in Asia is  such that there is no collective security arrangement and,  exclusive of the Philippines, various nations are increasing  their defense budgets by two-digit percentages.    Japan should probably continue into the future its policies  relative to dedicated defensive systems, the three principles of  nuclear weapons, and three principles on export of weapons as  national policies, but defense of these pacifist principles will  entail costs.    We must establish an intelligence system because production  of weapons solely for domestic consumption is costly and because  we are not permitted to initiate attacks. I believe those who  need to be concerned are not aware of this fact.    The Gulf war served as one vehicle for deepening awareness  of  the SDF. We cannot overlook the fact that the debate surrounding  the failed UN PKO bill had the effect of enhancing the general  public's appreciation of the SDF. The SDF gained recognition  both domestically and internationally for its role in executing  the minesweeping operation and the UN PKO activities in  Cambodia. Great reliance is placed on the SDF for operations in  support of domestic disaster situations.    I believe the SDF will gain recognition for its efforts by  gathering a record of executing such projects.    [Shigeru Hatakeyama] Born in Tokyo in 1937.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Highlights" of government policy statement read by Prime </F> Minister Jozef Moravcik to the National Council on 12  April--recorded]    [Text] Esteemed Mr. President, esteemed Mr. Chairman of the  National Council, esteemed Deputies, ladies and gentlemen:    In the history of the nation and in the history of the  state,  there are periods reminiscent of crossroads. I am convinced  that, at this very moment, we find ourselves precisely at such a  place. And it is precisely at this moment that it is important  to speak the truth and give things their correct names.  Otherwise, we might lose our direction at this crossroads.  That is why it is important to think over what we are being  told so that we do not succumb to passions that could lead us to  disastrous conflicts. What we need is healthy judgment, so that  we are not turned into a tool of demagoguery.    We must say this to ourselves to explain why it is we, this  government, who are here, why we thought it necessary to change  the government in the middle of an election term. It is not  something extraordinary in the history of European  parliamentarism. However, it is not something that happens very  often. I believe very strongly that it needs to be explained  before we start assessing this government's policy statement.    To start with, I would like to talk about something  personal.  When I think about public affairs, I often think about what  happened in November 1989. At that time, I was with my students  at the Comenius University in Bratislava. I can still feel  their resolve to change the current state of affairs, their hope  and faith in the future. I identified with their feelings. I  promised myself then that I must not let them down. This moral  obligation is for me the highest criterion in my political  activity, as well. It is more important than belonging to a  political party or to a movement. I am trying to say that there  are and must be in politics values that are above political  parties and that political parties must respect. Otherwise, our  Constitution will yet again become a formal document.    These are values that an overwhelming majority of the Slovak  population agreed on at the end of 1989. The stability and  prosperity of advanced Europe is built on these values. We have  identified these values as protection of a citizen's rights and  freedoms, protection of his right to own property, and the  democratic management of public affairs. There is no need to  think of other methods. Other methods lead to stagnation. We  are in the center of Europe. If we invent other rules and other  principles of arranging the state and society, we will only harm  ourselves.    I would like to discuss one problem whose explanation is  very  important for our future. It is the problem of the Movement for  a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], which won in the election two  years ago but was not able to maintain power. The question  emerges: Is this only an internal tragedy of this movement, or  is it a fact that can be generalized and from which lessons can  be drawn for all? I am convinced that the demise of the HZDS is  not only a question for this movement but also touches upon many  aspects of the main issues of our young state and concerns the  reason for the existence of this government.    Every political party is composed of people who give it its  form, direction, and aims. It is from this point of view that  the HZDS at the time of the election and the HZDS today are two  different entities. The key personalities that formed it in the  beginning either left the party or were expelled from it. It  lost a significiant part of its electoral base. These  pronounced changes could not but be reflected in the composition  of our parliament. Eighteen deputies left the HZDS club, and  others are considering this. The original club of the Slovak  National Party [SNS] has also fallen apart, which is also  connected with the development of the HZDS.    We often ask the justified question of why they did so.  Some reply that it was treason, personal interest, changing  sides for reward, as is the case with football clubs. All this  is a fabrication. It is used, above all, by those who want to  hide in this way their share of guilt. The reality is more  unpleasant than that.    Let me point to my personal experience. In the last election  campaign, together with Michal Kovac, Roman Kovac, Milan Knazko,  Rudolf Filkus, and Lubomir Dolgos, I did not tell our voters,  the voters of the then HZDS, that we were trying to win them  over to be able to carry out the privatization for our benefit  and for the benefit of our party followers, that, with their  help, we wanted to build a state party. We promised them  something completely different. We told them we wanted  democracy, cooperative, nonconfrontational politics--that is,  cooperation with the other political parties, better social  security, a better sense of security, high-quality performance  in office, and so on.    From the point of view and experience of today, we have, in  fact, introduced them to these things because reality has  developed differently for two years after the elections.    For instance, what explanation can Deputies Meciar,  Keltosova, and Tothova offer to their electorate about the fact  that, as Cabinet members, they voted in favor of a decision by  which, within the framework of privatization, they have  literally donated 1 billion korunas to private individuals--I am  speaking about the transfer of shares of the VSZ [East Slovak  Ironworks] to a private company. Is this what they promised the  citizens?    There are more questions we can and must ask. Is it in  harmony with the democratic principles of executive power to  finance a party's newspaper with state money--that is, using  money from taxes paid by all of the citizens? I am speaking  about the REPUBLIKA daily. We would not find something like this  in any democratic state.    Is it right to use taxpayers' money to organize a  referendum,  the aim of which is to be one party gaining seats they have lost  in parliament?    Did those who voted for the HZDS expect the prime minister  to  strictly demand from his ministers that they appoint HZDS  members to head personnel departments and control bodies at all  ministries?    I am mentioning all this so as to ask a more fundamental  question: Is the preservation of democracy guaranteed by a  political party or by the deputies' conscience? No party can be  or is the supreme authority. If we go along with the HZDS's  proposal to subordinate a deputy's conscience to the party will,  we will sow a seed in our parliament that might grow very fast  into a one-party system.    We are quite often told by the HZDS that it is the only one  capable of forming a functioning government, that its chairman  is the only one capable of managing public affairs at this time.  We must be very alert when hearing such voices and not  underestimate them in any way. We have previous experience in  the period when one party declared itself exceptional. Both  Stalin and Brezhnev were, for instance, convinced that no one  could replace them.    To achieve stability in our state, we need stable political  parties that will secure the permanence and continuity of the  democratic process. Much, therefore, depends on the future  development of political parties in Slovakia. It is necessary  to pay proper attention and take note in which parties and  movements malice is spreading against certain groups of  citizens, which parties and movement have built their profile on  excessive worshipping of one person, from where confrontational  attitudes and demagoguery are ensuing, being perceived as  fundamental methods of the political struggle. It is not  possible to cooperate with such political parties. They do  exist, but they belong to the margins of the political spectrum.    It is exactly in this connection that I would like to stress  the importance of the current government coalition. This  coalition proves that effective cooperation between political  entities of different political orientations is possible also in  Slovakia. These parties have come to understand that they must  place the state interest above their differences of opinion.    At this stage, the future of Slovakia is being decided for  a long time ahead. It is therefore necessary to bring together  Slovakia's whole creative potential right now. To achieve that,  we will have to create favorable conditions, an atmosphere of  peace, understanding, and willingness to cooperate. This means  that we need the national and civic reconciliation for which the  president of the Slovak Republic appealed in his speech to this  parliament--which has been recalled in this parliament by a  prominent Slovak personality, Cardinal Tomko--and the need for  which is, as a memento of Svatopluk twigs [fable in which  Moravian ruler Svatopluk told his sons to stay together because  a group of twigs bundled together is stronger than the total of  the individual strengths of each twig], ever present in our  history.    This government coalition is offering such an atmosphere and  the concentration of creative potential.    Ladies and gentlemen, another very important and repeatedly  debated issue is the relation between the emergence of our  independent state and the development of our statehood. I do  not want to lead a discussion on who deserves credit and to what  extent for the fact that Slovakia is an independent republic or  to belittle or exaggerate the merits of individuals or political  parties, even though legends always surround such historic  events. In a way, these issues already belong to the domain of  historians.    It is beyond doubt that Slovakia's independence is a great  challenge for us, an opportunity to gauge our own ability and  strength and to prove our viability. At the same time, it  brings great responsibility toward this generation as well as  future generations, whose life-styles we are predetermining  today. Most of all, it is important what foundations we lay for  statehood, what we leave to the coming generations.    The resposibility for this is equally shared by all who live  and have decided to live in this country, regardless of how they  have assessed the emergence of an independent state, whether  they were in favor or against. This has to be understood  especially by those who would like to differentiate between  greater and lesser patriots, who claim that words published in  one Slovak paper are more Slovak than those published in another  Slovak paper. If we go on differentiating like this, we will  lose our republic. Slovakia is our homeland.    It is home to Slovaks and members of many other ethnic  groups  who have been living in Slovakia for centuries. We have proved  our maturity also by being able to create a peaceful atmosphere  for the coexistence of citizens of different ethnic backgrounds.  This is of great value, and we must not lose it by nurturing  national intolerance, which is alien to our character.    Slovakia's borders have been determined by international  documents. Anyone who questions the borders in order to whip up  nationalist passions is harming Slovakia. Confirmation of the  borders, including the borders with the Republic of Hungary,  should be the basis for establishing mutual trust. We would  thus make a major and important step on the path to historical  reconciliation.    The principle of searching for enemies both at home and  abroad cannot be used to consolidate Slovak statehood. This is  a path leading to conflicts that need never occur and that  impoverish us.    Ladies and gentlemen, the demise of the HZDS and the SNS as  ruling parties, their inability to maintain policy unity, and  their inability to cooperate with other political parties were  the direct cause of the recent political crisis. These parties  bear the political responsibility for the fact that there have  to be early parliamentary elections. The HZDS, especially, or  what remains of this movement was unable to cope with the  responsibility with which it had been vested by those who cast  their votes for it in the election. The movement has exercised  power in a way that has put off some of its members and  discredited the movement itself in the eyes of the majority of  this state's citizens. Its activity resulted in doubt being  cast on our credibility in international relations and led the  country to economic collapse.    Under these circumstances, the only possible solution to the  long-lasting political crisis in Slovakia was the setting up of  a broad coalition government. However, after the collapse of  the political power that emerged from the election, only a new  election can bring a more permanent solution. The proposed  policy statement presented by this government is an alternative  that can secure such a solution for Slovakia.    With this statement, I am presenting to you the draft of the  government policy statement for your consideration, and I am  asking you to support it.</p>

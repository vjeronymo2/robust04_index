			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / London Tecs make joint call for more money LONDON needs a significant increase in its government-funded budgets for training and business support if the capital is to lead Britain out of recession, according to a report published yesterday by the capital's nine Training and Enterprise Councils. The Tecs said training of young people and unemployed adults in London had been historically underfunded compared with other regions. Tecs required an increase of between 40 per cent and 60 per cent, or an extra Pounds 45m to Pounds 68m. The report by Coopers and Lybrand, the management consultancy, is the first big exercise in collaboration between Tecs to analyse and explore a regional issue. Its costings were dismissed by Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, who said there were errors in the report. Mr David Dickinson, chairman of London East Tec, said in response to the minister's criticisms that the report was based on all the information that was publicly available. He added that if the government disputed the figures it should make its internal costings available.</p>

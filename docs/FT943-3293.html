			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Czech coffee 'cartel' fines The Czech economic competition ministry has imposed 'significant' fines on two local coffee market leaders for using what it calls cartel-style tactics to raise domestic coffee prices. The ministry has started legal action against the Czech Coffee Union (CKS), an industry lobby group, and two of its members, Tchibo Praha and Balirny Douwe Egberts, accusing them of co-ordinating a policy of gradually increasing prices. In July, the CKS asked domestic producers to raise coffee prices by 10 per cent monthly to fall into line with the general surge in world prices caused by two severe frosts which ravaged plantations in Brazil. Local packager Balirny Douwe Egberts, a subsidiary of Dutch-American firm Douwe Egberts, increased its prices by 10 per cent at the start of July, as did the local market leader, German retailer Tchibo Praha. According to the ministry, domestic coffee prices have now increased by more than 50 per cent since the CKS issued its request. Between them, Balirny Douwe Egberts and Tchibo Praha are reported to hold 75 per cent of the Czech coffee market.</p>

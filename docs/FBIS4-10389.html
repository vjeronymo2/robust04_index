Brazilian and Chilean Foreign Ministers Celso Amorim and  Carlos Figueroa signed the "Agreement on Promotion and  Reciprocal Protection of Investments" at the end of the Rio  Group meeting held in Rio de Janeiro on 22 March. The agreement  seeks to create favorable conditions for intensifying bilateral  economic cooperation, and especially for granting fair and equal  treatment to investors in the respective countries. (Santiago  ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 23 Mar 94 p 7)    The Chilean trade balance registered a $101.3 million  surplus  in February, with exports at $737.2 million and imports at  $635.9 million. The cumulative surplus for the year's first two  months was $68.6 million, compared with the same period in 1993  when there was a deficit of $220.7 million. (Santiago  ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 4)    The Central Bank reported that the GDP increased 6 percent  in  1993, and that the sectors that contributed most to the economic  growth were construction, with 14 percent; commerce,  restaurants, and hotels, 8.7 percent; transport and  communication, 7.9 percent; and financial services, 7.1 percent.  (Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 24 Mar 94 pp A1, A12)    The Consumer Price Index stood at 1.1 percent in March.  Accrued inflation so far this year stands at 2.5 percent. The  hike in public utility rates, coupled with an increase in school  fees, caused the inflation rate to exceed the estimates for the  first quarter of the year.

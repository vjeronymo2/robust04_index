			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Schwarz-Schilling quits as German telecoms minister MR Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the German minister of posts and telecommunications, resigned from the government yesterday, sharply criticising its failure to act more forcefully in the ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslavia. He also accused his government colleagues of failing to give him wholehearted support in negotiations on reforms to privatise the German postal and telecommunications services. Privatisation has been held up by failure to reach agreement with the trade unions and opposition Social Democrats on changes needed to the German constitution to enable the state sale to go ahead. He attacked the government - and by implication Chancellor Helmut Kohl  - for getting bogged down in negotiations within the ruling coalition, and proving itself incapable of action on key political issues. The resignation will embarrass Chancellor Kohl in his struggle to show his government is coming to grips with the problems of looming economic recession and the soaring costs of German unification. However, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, a member of the cabinet since Mr Kohl came to power in 1982, was expected to be ousted in a reshuffle at Christmas or in the New Year. Some observers believed he was simply choosing to resign with dignity, rather than be forced out. Mr Schwarz-Schilling's negotiating position in the privatisation talks with the unions and SPD had weakened since he was expected to go in the reshuffle. A new minister might be able to push the process ahead more swiftly. Mr Schwarz-Schilling's resignation coincided with an appeal from the German Chamber of Trade and Industry (DIHT) to break the deadlock on postal reform. The resignation follows reports that Mr Schwarz-Schilling lost his temper at last week's cabinet meeting because of the government's apparent inability to take more effective action in Bosnia-Hercegovina to protect the local population from Serbian attacks. He admitted yesterday saying that he was 'ashamed to be a member of a cabinet which simply does nothing'. Mr Kohl retorted that no one was compelled to remain a member of the government. Mr Schwarz-Schilling said at a press conference in Bonn it was a nonsense that German naval ships on patrol in the Adriatic were forbidden from taking part in actions to stop and search suspected arms smugglers. At the same time, he sharply criticised the UN arms embargo as it affected Bosnia-Hercegovina, saying it simply exacerbated the unequal conflict with the Serbs.</p>

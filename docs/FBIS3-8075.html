What is the reality in which the Croat-Moslem federation  should exist.    In the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  local Croats and Moslems have over the past year been waging a  war whose brutality exceeds all previous conflicts in this  region. This is why it is difficult to believe that such  opponents will so easily and simply agree to forget everything  and start anew.    In its first reactions on Thursday morning, Moslem Sarajevo  radio cited its Mostar correspondent who said that, after  everything, life alongside the Croats in this city will not be  possible.    Both the Bosnian Croats and Moslems have already carried out  ethnic cleansing in territories they control, while the property  of those who managed to survive and flee to other parts of ex-  Yugoslavia, has almost completely been destroyed. The  agreement, however, calls for all to return home.    Under the agreement, a single Croat-Moslem army will be  created from the existing officer ranks, while all foreign  armies, including the U.N. troops, will withdraw from the  territory of the Croat- Moslem federation.    All further comments about this are unnecessary.    The agreement also fails to say which territories are in  question and it is assumed that the Serb side will give up to  the Moslems what was promised.    However, promises were made within the European Union's plan  for the division of Bosnia into three ethnic states, so that  this assumption, as well as the entire agreement, were made  without consulting the Serbs.    Washington's concept is to create a dual state and thus  enable the Moslems to preserve, even partially, the unity of  Bosnia- Herzegovina, to extend their territories, to secure  access to the Adriatic Sea and set up a strong negotiating (even  possibly military) block against the Serbs in the forthcoming  talks.    Since the sponsor of the agreement, the United States,  interprets it as a path towards a peace solution, one wonders  what stand will the Serb side take.    Initial Bosnian Serb reactions are that the agreement is  acceptable in general, but only if it is not aimed against them.    It remains to be seen whether the Serbs will agree, as is  hardly likely, to enable the creation of the Moslem-Croat  federation in whose forming they did not take part.    The only logic in all this would be that the West is  interested in linking up with the Moslem territories in Bosnia,  via Croatia and its sponsors, and thus isolating it from  possible fundametalist influences of the Islamic countries.    This then gives rise to the question who is the real friend  of the Bosnian Moslems, who are of Slav origin.    The Washington agreement has primarily defeated the Moslem  idea on the unity of Bosnia by linking them, via the Croats, to  the influential Catholic church and opening up the road towards  the loss of the Moslem ethnic and cultural identity.    It is now being revealed that only the Bosnian Serbs wanted  a  Moslem state and were only ones who were not opposed to it.    Basically, all agreements are good if they aim for peace,  but  the Washington one has slim chances since it eliminates the key  factor -- Serbs.</p>

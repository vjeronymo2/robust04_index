			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Gardening (A Taste of Chelsea): A fine French sense of Chelsea deja vu - Robin Lane Fox travels to France to pick up some early tips for the UK's top show LAST WEEK, I watched while horticultural punters scrambled for the latest line in copper labels; floral prizes had already been bestowed by the jury; as the rain intensified, we rushed for the tents and afterwards, a familiar column of middle-aged customers headed towards the car park, lugging irises in polythene to the boots of their Renaults and Peugeots. Yet Chelsea Flower Show begins on Tuesday and public tickets have already sold out. Have I beaten the crowds by telepathy? Have I dreamed in anticipation, erasing those outdoor gardens of cedarwood designed by the Daily Express? Next week, I will be visiting Chelsea with a cosmopolitan sense of deja vu: I have prepared myself with a work-out at the flourishing new show in France. Ten years ago it started at Courson, about 30 miles west of Paris where the grounds of the Chateau had been ably gardened by three generations of the Fustier family. A share in the property had passed to Helene and her banking husband, Patrice, but neither knew anything about gardening, except that it seemed to be dreadfully expensive, especially when the main rhododendrons died of drought in that frightful year of 1976. They approached the Association des Parcs Botaniques de France in 1983 and proposed a flower show for members in the Chateau's grounds. Innocently, they agreed to one nurseryman's last-minute request that exhibitors should be allowed to sell plants. The association was not altogether prepared for over-the-counter trading behind the green cloth, but 200 members turned up and enjoyed the experience. With modifications, the experiment was repeated, making particular strides in 1986-7 and attracting valued support from Britain's Royal Horticultural Society. It now takes place twice yearly, in May and October, and although the Association still attends with pleasure, its members now comprise only a fraction of the visiting public. Last week I watched while more than 20,000 paying customers turned up during three days to an agrarian style of car park which would reassure any visitors to an English village fete. Tenting is limited; the staging is vraiment rustique; exhibits are not massed or shown off a la Chelsea and there are no restrictions on buying plants from them on the first day. The proceeds from Chelsea go towards subsidising the RHS's other shows. Last week Courson's proceeds went to the Societe's Bills for maintenance, a private initiative in a country where the Societe National d'Horticulture let the chance of a Gallic Chelsea slip during its past 150 years of sleepy existence. Courson is no Chelsea and my French informants assured me that they hope it will never lose its French style. Nonetheless, some of Chelsea's own exhibitors now cross the Channel in vans for this prelude, from Clifton Nurseries through Blooms and Scotts to Glebe Cottage Plants. What happens when French and English meet? In the sunshine the French can enjoy the English and their open-air eccentricities: mature women in macintosh jackets discourse on Alpine plants, while the younger generation were breast feeding in track suit trousers beside family exhibits of rare trees. The show has a wonderful feel of informality and weekend market which has still not been lost in its huge success. It also has the openness and personal enthusiasm of the Fustiers and their staff who deserve to make a proper return on a yearly investment of time, love and not less than FFr1m (Pounds 120,000). For me, the rencontre refutes lazy expatriates who always complain that they cannot buy decent plants in France and that anything desirable has to be brought from England with the accompanying problems of forms and Customs. From June 1, plants from approved nurseries can circulate across the Channel without further bureaucracy: my first thoughts among the rustic tables were that England has the status of a horticultural Taiwan. On French stands Fuchsia versicolor was selling for Pounds 18, Lavatera Barnsley for Pounds 17 and a clematis for Pounds 20, at the exchange rate for the debacle of Golden Wednesday. Standard box trees were on offer at up to Pounds 400. I am not sure which is cause and which is effect, but until the Single Market, serious gardening from French tree and shrub nurseries has been a minority's possibility, pre-supposing enormous riches. Even at the herbaceous level, a common plant such as Geranium macrorrhizum from a first-class French nursery sells for more than a plant of the new, rare and lovely blue Corydalis flexuosa, driven over from Devon in the back of Carol Klein's nursery van. Beyond question, French gardening is being pulled together. For the Fustiers, one delight of Courson is the emergence of remote nurserymen whom the show has drawn into the open. Aimez-vous old-fashioned roses? Try Boureau from the Ile de France which sells 500 varieties, including musk roses as elegant standards. Best of all, try Grillot near Lyons, 'Rosieristes depuis 1829', describing itself as 'archaeologists of the rose' across five generations which make Vita Sackville West look like a brief comet in the sky. Preferez-vous Meconopsis? Try the Lemonniers in Normandy, whose owners describe to me their list of more than 25 varieties, many of which I would never expect to find in a seaside climate. What about betilla striata or the incredible Hebe Hulkeana? Try Dino Pellizaro down in Provence, whose list results from 20 years' keen plant-finding and is ignored by Brits who go south to escape the lawn. We have all made jokes about those frightful red Salvias in the parterres of French chateaux: the tables are now turned, if you know where to look. To my eye, and ironic pleasure, the best sight of the show was the exhibit of Salvias by Yves Herve and his partner at La Foux Nursery. Together, they have collected and exhibited wild Salvias from Brazil to the Middle East, most of which I had never seen, although the family is red-hot news in English container-gardening. Last year, the nursery took a small display to the Hampton Court show, but I now realise that this display was only an appetiser. These wild Salvias, like expatriates, thrive in the hotter areas, especially in the south. Is there a wide and growing base for these plant lists among French gardeners themselves? Since 1992, there have been two equivalents to our Plant Finder, of which the better one is co-authored by Anita Pereire and published by Hachette. Like the new open frontier with British nurseries, these lists will raise the public's awareness of the possible. Scotts of Somerset is already supplying wholesale to big Parisian garden stores, including Cedre Rouge. In the last three years, we have passed the point when the French were best left to accessories and their most stylish jardins were imaginaire. On the Wells and Winter accessories stand the presiding presence of Sir John Wells told me that on two days, takings already compared favourably with his entire haul from Chelsea. Fifteen thousand garden labels had been bought, and French good taste preferred green labels to white ones. As yet, clients have not graduated to sophisticated needs like his caps for plant-stakes to blunt them and avoid eye injuries. French customers, he found, were much more decisive, unlike those little old ladies at Chelsea who fiddle around among his flower prints and end up buying nothing. Ten years ago, the Fustiers never dreamed they would have a show whose jury included the top names in European gardening and which pulled in 20,000 visitors. In 1992, the RHS awarded a Veitch Memorial Medal to Patrice Fustier which he would be the first to share with his wife and fellow pioneer from a position of ignorance in 1983. For gardeners in France the show catalogue is an essential index and a visit in May or October will transform attentive minds' ideas of their scope and supply. In the shadow of Chelsea, English gardeners would probably prefer to stay put, although curiosity is rewarded and a visit can be combined with a leap into early summer in the enchanted grounds of Paris's great haven, the gardens at Bagatelle. All of us must wish the Fustiers continuing luck with the weather. During 10 dry years, their Courson show first revealed what French sources were growing in modest isolation: the English invaders will merely serve to enlarge it. Was it true, I asked Patrice Fustier, that two nursery persons had met at Courson, fallen in love and married? Perhaps, he replied, and if so, we will be exhibiting the hybrids soon at Courson too. As you follow the flow signs in Chelsea's matchless Main Tent, you may find it hard to imagine that in the scrimmage of this Flower Show, anyone has ever had time for romance.</p>

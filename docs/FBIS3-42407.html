Shirokorad: "With Missile and </F> Projectile"]    [Text] "Are there systems similar to the American  ADATS [Air Defense Anti-Tank System] in our Armed Forces?    " S. Kurganov (Kemerovo Oblast)"    The 2S6M "Tunguska" Self-Propelled Air Defense System, the  first domestically-produced air defense system with the 2K22M  missile-gun complex, entered the inventory at the beginning of  the 1980's. Batteries consisting of six of these systems provide  the air defense of motorized-rifle and tank regiments.    Initially, let's examine the missile portion of the air  defense system. Eight launchers with 9M311 missiles housed in  canisters are mounted on it. The missile is 2,562 mm long,  weighs 42 kg, and has a 9 kg fragmentation-continuous rod  warhead. Its maximum speed is up to 900 meters per second [mps]  and its average speed is 600 mps. It is capable of destroying  aircraft (helicopters) that are flying at speeds of up to 500  mps. Missile firings are conducted in place or from a short halt  when the target is within visual range. It has a semiautomatic  radio command guidance system with manual target tracking and  automatic placement of the missile on the sighting line based  upon signals that are transmitted via a radio channel. The  warhead has a proximity fuze with an operating radius of five  meters.    Two 2A38 30 mm twin-barrel automatic guns that were  developed  under the leadership of V. Gryazev make up the artillery portion  of the air defense system. The rate of fire of one automatic gun  is 1,950-2,500 rounds per minute. The automatic gun operates on  the energy of powder gases that are eliminated from the barrel  channel through special vents. Cooling of the barrel is carried  out using water that is circulated in the barrel jacket.  Reloading of the automatic gun is pyrotechnic and manual (in the  event a projectile becomes jammed). For the former, there are  three pyrotechnic cartridges per automatic gun.    The "Tunguska's" chassis is a GM-352 that was manufactured  by  Minsk Tractor Plant. Right now Ulyanovsk Mechanical Plant makes  it. A transloader vehicle on a KamAZ-43101 motor vehicle chassis  is attached to each of the self-propelled air defense guns. It  transports eight missiles and 32 boxes with projectiles for the  automatic air defense guns, it has a crane, a machine for  loading and to couple and uncouple cartridge belts, and radio  communications equipment.    The "Tunguska" air defense mount is certainly an effective  system. But you must keep in mind that it destroys only airborne  targets. At the same time the United States, jointly with  Switzerland, has developed the ADATS air defense-antitank  missile system, the missiles of which can destroy aircraft at a  distance of up to eight kilometers and at an altitude of five  kilometers and any tanks at a distance of up to eight kilometers  with a shaped charge-fragmentation warhead with a 900 mm  armor-piercing capability. Missile guidance is by laser beam.

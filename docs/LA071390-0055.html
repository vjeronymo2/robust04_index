			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARDLY STODGY, THIS THRIFT HAD UZIS, ENGLISH BUTLER;  </P> <P> S&amp;LS: PROBES OF COLUMBIA S&amp;L AND ITS FORMER CHIEF, THOMAS SPIEGEL, ALSO  UNVEIL BOMB SHELTERS, BODYGUARDS AND JETS.  </P> <P> Many strange tales have surfaced in the nation's thrift debacle. Those of  Columbia Savings &amp; Loan and former chief executive Thomas Spiegel may top  them all.  </P> <P> Take Spiegel's obsession with security. Columbia's still-unfinished  headquarters building in Beverly Hills comes equipped with two anti-terrorist  bomb shelters. A $9-million hangar at the Van Nuys Airport built for Columbia's  corporate jets included an electronic map that showed recent terrorist activity  throughout the world.  </P> <P> Spiegel and his family at times had 19 security personnel protecting them, some  assigned to "chase cars" loaded with automatic weapons that would trail Spiegel  whenever he rode through the streets of Beverly Hills. Columbia collected an  arsenal of weapons that included more than 100 rifles, shotguns, assault  weapons and Uzi submachine guns, prompting some executives to joke that the  thrift's deposits were insured by "Smith &amp; Wesson and Uzi" and to suggest  that its name should be changed to "Colombia Savings &amp; Loan."  </P> <P> The James Bond-like security measures, extraordinary by any corporate  standards, are just a few of the eye-popping details about Spiegel's 13-year  reign at Columbia that are only now surfacing. The revelations, the result of  an internal investigation, a government probe and interviews with former  Columbia employees, portray a thrift where spending ran amok. The allegations  are especially ironic in view of the fact that Columbia for years boasted in  television commercials that surveys showed it was the best-managed savings and  loan in America.  </P> <P> Columbia was lionized as an example of deregulation unshackling S&amp;Ls.  Chicago real estate deal-maker Sam Zell once said that "if the entire S&amp;L  business had been run by guys like Tom Spiegel, then this country would be a  couple of hundred billion bucks richer."  </P> <P> But civil allegations filed last week by the federal Office of Thrift  Supervision accuse Spiegel of using the thrift -- and its taxpayer-insured  deposits -- as his personal piggy bank.  </P> <P> "This is a case of great importance. In money terms, it is the largest case,"  said Harris Weinstein, chief lawyer for the OTS.  </P> <P> All told, regulators allege, Spiegel went on a $19-million spending spree that  included such abuses as buying the guns, taking personal trips on Columbia's  corporate jet, extensive use of Columbia-owned condominiums in Wyoming, Utah  and California, and even buying $7,840 in Michael Jackson concert tickets.  Regulators are seeking $24 million from Spiegel, including a $5-million fine.  They also are seeking to bar him from the thrift business for life.  </P> <P> Papers filed by the OTS last week show a bizarre tug of war between Spiegel and  Columbia's current management over the $55,000 in guns. Of the approximately  100 guns, Spiegel allegedly is refusing to turn over 55, including four rifles,  18 revolvers, 24 automatic pistols and nine shotguns. Forty of the guns are  missing.  </P> <P> Spiegel denies the allegations and vows to fight them. In a statement, he said  he is being made a scapegoat by inept federal regulators. He accuses them of  conducting a "trial by press release" without allowing him to tell his story.  </P> <P> Spiegel, 44, has declined to publicly address the specific charges. He declined  to comment for this article. In a recent deposition he refused to answer  questions.  </P> <P> But New York criminal defense lawyer Robert G. Morvillo, who represents him,  said the expenditures will be shown to have been made for legitimate business  purposes. Morvillo said the government also is ignoring the fact that, at the  time most of the expenditures were made, Columbia was one of the nation's  strongest and most profitable thrifts.  </P> <P> As for the security measures, he said, Spiegel was one of the nation's most  visible and highest-paid executives at the time, so such concerns were  justified. Finally, he said, some Spiegel expenses were legitimate, but may  have lacked proper documentation.  </P> <P> "Whenever you get a guy who was as busy as he was, you rely on other people to  get the paper work done. I can't say the paper work in all cases got done, but  the spirit in which he conducted himself was at all times proper," Morvillo  said.  </P> <P> Much is riding on the Spiegel case. Thrift regulators have elevated him to the  big leagues of alleged S&amp;L abusers -- with the likes of Charles H. Keating  Jr., former head of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, and David L. Paul,  former head of CenTrust Bank in Miami.  </P> <P> Also, the Spiegel charges come as regulators are being criticized for moving  too slowly against S&amp;L abusers, although Weinstein denied that the  criticism influenced the timing of the Spiegel announcement. The OTS  investigation could lead to criminal charges against Spiegel. Morvillo said he  believes that the agency's findings have already been forwarded to prosecutors  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Columbia, still controlled by Spiegel and his family, is hanging by a thread to  independence. Its net worth was wiped out over the past year after it suffered  $1 billion in losses in its risky junk bonds. In the 1980s, the bonds made  Columbia, the biggest buyer of junk bonds among thrifts, wildly profitable.  </P> <P> Columbia's only hope of preventing a federal takeover is selling its bonds.  This Monday, it will formally accept bids from eight prospective buyers for the  bonds, worth about $3 billion now. The list, outside sources familiar with the  transaction said, include several well-financed groups, including the New York  banking firm Bankers Trust; Loews Corp.; the Pritzker family of Chicago; a  group led by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce; the Los Angeles financial  services firm Broad Inc., and one group that includes the investment firm  Odyssey Partners, banking giant Citicorp and the Wall Street firm Salomon Bros.  </P> <P> Columbia Savings was formed in 1974 by Spiegel's father, Abraham, who still  serves as Columbia's chairman. Thomas Spiegel, Abraham's second son, became  president and chief executive in 1977.  </P> <P> In the early 1980s, Columbia, like most thrifts, faced the prospect of going  out of business because high interest rates meant it paid more for funds than  it got back in return by making loans. But deregulation in 1982 allowed thrifts  to place taxpayer-insured deposits into nontraditional investments such as real  estate and junk bonds.  </P> <P> Spiegel figured that he could attract deposits from sophisticated Wall Street  investors by paying exceptionally high rates, then invest the money in junk  bonds to earn an even more exceptional return. This "spread" between the two  rates for a while made Columbia a money machine.  </P> <P> Forbes magazine at one point published a statistical-based survey that called  Columbia the top-managed thrift in the nation. Columbia made that claim the  cornerstone of its advertising campaign.  </P> <P> The key influence on Spiegel this time was Michael Milken, the former Drexel  Burnham Lambert junk bond whiz whom Spiegel met at a party. Columbia became one  of Drexel's best customers, and Spiegel and Milken became close friends.  </P> <P> The relationship extended to a partnership formed to buy a luxury Gulfstream  IV, and build the airplane hangar at Van Nuys. Spiegel frequently used the jet  to fly to Palm Springs 100 miles away for weekend getaways at a Columbia  condominium in Indian Wells that he is alleged to have used exclusively. He has  claimed the trips were to check on a Columbia development project in Indian  Wells.  </P> <P> In another case, Spiegel allegedly spent $250,000 having Columbia's jet sent to  London to fetch him and take him to Switzerland. He has claimed that the jet  brought annual reports and slides to potential Swiss investors. In one case,  regulators assert, Columbia designated a condominium in a ski area of Wyoming  for the exclusive use of Milken and his brother, Lowell.  </P> <P> In 1985, when Columbia was among the nation's most profitable thrifts, Spiegel  earned a staggering $9 million -- nearly 20 times what other major thrift chief  executives earned. Spiegel's huge paychecks irked regulators, who forced him to  give back $600,000 of his $3-million bonus in 1988. Regulators last week filed  actions to force him to give back the remaining $2.4 million, saying Columbia's  lackluster profits that year did not warrant such a bonus.  </P> <P> It was about this time that Spiegel apparently began showing concerns about his  security. Some acquaintances believe that Spiegel may have felt vulnerable to  attacks by anti-Semitic groups because of his family's support for Jewish  causes. He and his wife Helene each took shooting lessons, and inventory  records of Columbia's guns show that many were kept in safes in Spiegel's  Beverly Hills home.  </P> <P> As Spiegel rode the junk bond wave, his political influence grew. He gave  generously to politicians. Former House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced)  resigned after disclosures about a $50,000 Spiegel-arranged loan that allowed  him to buy a $100,000 junk bond. And Abraham has long enjoyed close ties to  Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> As Columbia's profits grew, spending was lavish. Columbia employed an English  butler and a martial arts instructor. It rented a Beverly Hills apartment for a  relatively low-level assistant who balked at relocating here from New York,  picking up the tab when she wanted to fly home.  </P> <P> According to government papers, Spiegel spent $2,205 on tips alone during two  trips to Europe in 1988 and 1989, and ran up a $2,197 hotel and room-service  bill for a four-night stay for him and his wife at London's Dorchester Hotel in  1987. Other alleged expenditures of Columbia money included $4,876 for towels,  $5,290 for Pratesi cashmere throws and $738 for two cases of wine.  </P> <P> Some former Columbia executives say Spiegel often gave expensive gifts to  clients or business associates. The Michael Jackson tickets, they say, were  given to investment bankers or business school graduates that Columbia was  recruiting.  </P> <P> But OTS attorney Weinstein says the alleged expenses were for the personal  benefit of Spiegel and his friends, not for any corporate purpose.  </P> <P> Bonuses were generous as well. Last year, Columbia lost nearly $600 million.  Still, it paid top executives $4 million in bonuses, including one executive  who received $1.2 million even though his job -- to arrange financing deals --  was rendered moot by federal legislation last year.  </P> <P> Then there was Columbia's new corporate headquarters, a $55-million white  elephant that has been behind schedule and plagued by huge cost overruns. In  addition to the bomb shelters, the office featured limestone walls,  stainless-steel floors and two kitchens, one to have been used by Spiegel and  another for his father.  </P> <P> To outsiders, the thrift was run by a group of seven relatively young  executives, dubbed "partners," who worked as a team. In reality, Spiegel called  the shots, frequently unnerving executives with his unorthodox style.  </P> <P> One management method Spiegel used frequently was something former executives  jokingly called an "est" style, referring to the self-help Erhard Seminars  Training theories popular in the 1970s. Inspired by a company psychologist used  by Drexel, Spiegel would ask an employee to confide in him what he or she  thought of another executive. He then would share those comments with the  executive he had asked about. Former executives say it caused bitter feelings  among many, who thought it was divisive and promoted back-stabbing.  </P> <P> Those in Spiegel's favor clearly wielded more power. Those who did not left  under bitter terms. That happened when Spiegel attempted to discipline Columbia  and turn it into more of a traditional thrift by hiring banker Lawrence K. Fish  in 1988 as his second in command. Fish lasted less than two years, resigning  last fall.  </P> <P> The public story was that Fish quit because in reorganizing Columbia he had  effectively eliminated his own job. But company insiders say Fish alienated the  other partners. In one case, Columbia's real estate head exploded when Fish  questioned the need to buy about $25,000 in computer equipment. Ultimately, top  executives bypassed Fish, who found no support from Spiegel. Fish, who did not  return calls seeking comment, now heads troubled Bank of New England in Boston.  </P> <P> About the time Fish resigned, three things happened that put Columbia and  Spiegel in the jam they are in today.  </P> <P> Congress passed last year's massive thrift-reform package, requiring S&amp;Ls  such as Columbia to sell their junk bonds in five years. Ironically, junk bond  guru Milken sensed a shift in the political winds and urged Spiegel to sell the  bonds well before the thrift bailout bill passed.  </P> <P> At the same time, the junk bond market collapsed. Because Columbia had to sell  its bonds, accounting rules required it to recognize its bond losses  immediately.  </P> <P> But junk bonds weren't Columbia's only problem. Some were due to bad deals.  Columbia sunk $70 million into the Hyatt Newporter in Newport Beach, which it  is trying to unload now. Real estate experts believe Columbia will be lucky to  get half that price. In addition, Columbia faces major losses on problem office  developments in Orange County.  </P> <P> As Columbia's losses mounted, Spiegel's spending habits came under scrutiny.  When Fish left, two senior executives initiated an internal investigation.  Ironically, it was Spiegel who tipped off regulators about this internal probe;  that in turn prompted the government to launch its own investigation.  </P> <P> In November, Spiegel's top executives told him he should resign. They feared he  might be indicted for his role in buying bonds from Milken, and that regulators  might seize Columbia if he didn't leave. Spiegel stepped down at the end of  December, but remained as a consultant. He later cut virtually all of his ties  to Columbia.  </P> <P> Junk bonds have recovered part of their values in recent weeks. Columbia could  conceivably sell them at a healthy price and even regain its solvency if it  gets attractive bids next week. That would at least save taxpayers from having  to bail out the thrift.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, government actions against Spiegel could take years. In any event,  it's unlikely that Spiegel will be taking any shopping sprees soon. Most of his  spending these days is on lawyers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE UNRAVELING OF COLUMBIA SAVINGS  </P> <P> 1985  </P> <P> Thomas Spiegel receives $9.03 million in compensation, making him the  third-highest-paid corporate executive in the United States and the  highest-paid savings and loan executive in the history of the industry.  </P> <P> After two years of fighting regulators who called the payment "unreasonable,"  Spiegel was allowed to keep the money. But his salary would be subject to  review by outside experts in the future to ensure that it is not excessive.  </P> <P> Although his salary was much less in subsequent years, Spiegel continued to be  the industry's best-paid executive.  </P> <P> 1987  </P> <P> Feb. 3: Columbia Savings posts peak earnings of $194 million in 1986 --  primarily because of its investments in junk bonds -- prompting Forbes magazine  to rate the company as the best-managed major savings and loan in the nation.  </P> <P> Oct. 28: Citing the stock market crash, Columbia says it stands to lose $25  million in the fourth quarter of 1987, the first sign of trouble at the company  that advertised itself as a rock-solid financial institution.  </P> <P> 1988  </P> <P> May 11: Losses on securities sales resulting from writedowns in its bond  portfolio contribute to a 95% dive in first-quarter earnings from the same  period in 1987.  </P> <P> 1989  </P> <P> May 27: Former House Majority Whip Tony Coelho says he will resign rather than  face a House probe into his personal finances. Coelho failed to disclose a  $50,000 loan from Columbia used to help purchase a $100,000 junk bond on Thomas  Spiegel's recommendation.  </P> <P> Sept. 28: A federal grand jury in Los Angeles opens a criminal investigation  into the personal finances of Mayor Tom Bradley, including his association with  the Spiegel family and Columbia Savings.  </P> <P> Dec. 31: Thomas Spiegel resigns as chairman, chief executive, president and  director of Columbia. Spiegel had been president and chief executive since  1977.  </P> <P> 1990  </P> <P> March 12: Edward G. Harshfield is named chief executive.  </P> <P> March 14: Harshfield announces plans to sell the thrift's $3.5-billion junk  bond portfolio.  </P> <P> April 1: Columbia Savings says it is insolvent, after losing $575 million from  October, 1989, through February, 1990. The thrift had posted losses of $591  million for 1989.  </P> <P> July 5: The Office of Thrift Supervision files civil charges against Thomas  Spiegel for improperly diverting $19 million of the thrift's funds and seeks a  $5-million fine from Spiegel for "recklessly and knowingly" causing loses to  Columbia Savings. Regulators also want Spiegel to repay an additional $2.4  million plus interest of his 1989 $2.8-million bonus, saying the bonus was  unjustified. Spiegel had earlier returned $600,000 of his bonus to Columbia.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

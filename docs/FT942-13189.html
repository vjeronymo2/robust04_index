			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Gerstner sees profits at IBM this year International Business Machines expects to be profitable this year, after three years of heavy losses, Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive, told shareholders yesterday at the computer company's annual meeting in Toronto. Unlike last year's annual meeting, when Mr Gerstner faced an audience of angry shareholders calling for the resignation of the board of directors, this year's shareholder gathering was a more friendly affair. 'While I'm not writing a pledge in stone, I can tell you that barring the unforeseen, we are planning on being profitable in 1994,' he said. 'We're not in a position to blow the horn and declare victory. But I think it's safe to say the funeral dirge is over.' Mr Gerstner said that IBM would continue to cut costs and that the company still planned to reduce its workforce by about 35,000 people by the end of 1995. 'I still believe . . . that's about the right number given current assumptions about future business conditions,' he said. Having achieved two consecutive quarters of profitability, 'cultural change is one of my highest priorities', Mr Gerstner said. 'When it comes to a results-oriented corporate culture, we're not there yet - by a long shot,' he acknowledged. 'I believe (IBM) we have been the victims of 'success inertia',' he said. 'Things went so well for so long - we were so profitable, so highly regarded  -that we stopped running hard.' Using a sports analogy, Mr Gerstner likened IBM's situation to that of a team that scores lots of points early in the game. 'They call it sitting on a lead . . . you start playing conservatively and you frequently lose that lead - and the game - to fast and hungry opponents.' Last week, IBM's share price jumped by almost Dollars 6 to Dollars 58 3/8 when the company announced first-quarter results including an unexpected 6 per cent rise in revenues to Dollars 13.37bn and much higher than expected profits of Dollars 392m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Lawyer Magda Montiel from Miami by </F> Zenaida Costales, no date given -- recorded]    [Text] Upon her return to Miami, Cuban emigre Magda  Montiel, who met with Commander in Chief Fidel Castro following  the closing of the Nation and the Emigre Community conference  last weekend, is confronting the ire of Miami's terrorist  cliques.    [Begin recording] [Costales] Lawyer Magda Montiel has not  committed any crime, yet is the target of harassment and threats  from the far right of the Cuban emigre community of Miami. All  she has done is participate, in her fatherland, in a conference  between emigres and representatives of the Cuban Government.    [Montiel] The things we have heard are things neither one of  us could have ever imagined. Not only that, I cannot go out. We  are constantly under police protection.    [Costales] Have you been given the protection you requested?    [Montiel] Yes. We are under continuous police protection at  office and at home. I am not able to go out. There have been  protest rallies even in my neighborhood. I cannot go out.    [Costales] What are you planning to do?    [Montiel] I do not know what I can do. I am living from  moment to moment but it is constant, the bad news, and protests.  Yesterday, I was unable to leave my office.    [Costales] Have you been able to make it to your house?    [Montiel] Yes. But I cannot even tell you where I am.    [Costales] I understand. How is your family, so far?    [Montiel] Okay, so far.    [Costales] Magda, tell me something, from a judicial point  of  view, can anything be done?    [Montiel] No. They get permits to hold the protests, and  there are the calls, threats, bomb scares, and all my employees  resigned.    [Costales] We were aware that something had happened, we got  news, and know that the far right has intensified their attacks  and have made lists of people for the simple act of coming to  Cuba. We are aware of this. This is why we call you to know how  you are doing and what has happened. We are, of course, against  that.    [Montiel] There are certain hours when the telephone calls  never stop, the insults, bomb scares, and ugly, ugly upsetting  things. It is a constant torture to have the telephone ringing  off the hook and not be able to go out, and having to have  bodyguards and police protection, and worrying about the  children and the fear of sending them to school. No one should  have to live this way.    [Costales] Of course, not. That is unfair. We agree with  you.    [Montiel] What I am telling you is barely the surface. You  can not imagine. I guess in a few days they will find something  else to do and perhaps the situation will get somewhat calmer. I  am a prisoner. I cannot go out.    [Costales] Magda Montiel cannot be harassed by the simple  fact of visiting Cuba. Makes sense? That is what I think.    [Montiel] That is what I am saying. For me, the irony of the  whole affair is that you turn on the television to see Nixon's  funeral where he is being treated as a great hero and see me  portrayed as a traitor. I keep telling myself: My God, I have  not been caught buying cocaine, or killing anyone, or molesting  children. What is going on?    Zenaida, the most important thing is that I have kept my  dignity and position. I have not sold out. There are people who  have told me to ask for forgiveness to save my family. Others  have told me to say that as a lawyer I had a case I was trying  to solve and that is why I acted so. I have maintained my  position and may God decide. Hopefully, it will have a peaceful  ending, and my children and I will not be harmed.    [Costales] We are aware that you have remained firm because  we have heard certain things. All we can say is that we keep you  in our thoughts and are tracking the news. We will call you  again. We trust everything will come out fine.    [Montiel] Thank you very much. So long.

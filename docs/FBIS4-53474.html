			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Kim Hye-won] </F>   [Text] The arrival here of the first group of five North  Koreans who have fled logging camps in Siberia, Russia,  yesterday was an event that sheds light on many new aspects of  future inter- Korean relations. By arranging the settlement of  the North Korean refugees here for the first time, the South  Korean government is showing to the world its active involvement  in matters related to North Korean refugees. The measure also  indicates Seoul's will of not remaining a mere observer in the  human rights issues of Pyongyang.    At the same time, by taking an initiative in bringing home  the North Korean defectors, the Seoul government has weighed  itself down with many new burdens. Firstly the government  should take steps to ensure that the North Korean defectors  successfully adapt themselves to life here. More important is  the establishment of a comprehensive, consistent policy to deal  with the problems of the North Korean defectors until  reunification. An increasing number of North Koreans are  expected to seek refuge in the South as life in the Communist  country becomes tougher due to its sagging economy. An exodus of  North Koreans to the South cannot be ruled out if the political  system there becomes seriously unstable.    Most of all, the Seoul government is required to financially  prepare itself for increasing numbers of North Korean refugees  here. Under the current law the government provides various  kinds of support for resettlement of North Korean defectors,  including financial help. But when their number increases to  hundreds, thousands or beyond, it will be virtually impossible  for the government to take responsibility for all the North  Korean defectors. Unofficial counts say up to 2,000 North  Korean escapees are already living in China alone.    Several problems concerning the North Korean loggers in  Russia are also to be resolved. Government officials say some  170 workers have fled their camps in Siberia and 90 of them have  expressed their intentions to resettle in the South.    Seoul has already announced the repatriation of all the  applicants but their plan hardly seems plausible at the moment.  The Moscow government is known to allow only North Koreans with  permits for residence in Russia to leave for Seoul in order to  avoid any friction with North Korea over the issue. But this  restriction diminishes to a considerable degree the original  purpose of repatriating the North Korean loggers.    Under domestic Russian laws, this permission is given only  to  foreigners who are married to Russian citizens or those who have  stayed in Russia for over two years. The applicants need to  present passports to confirm their nationality. Political  considerations also affect the screening of applicants. Most of  the five North Koreans who arrived here yesterday belonged to  this category. But most North Korean escapees in Russia do not  hold residence permits as they usually failed to carry passports  when they left the logging camps. The camps keep the passports  of workers to prevent them from fleeing. South Korean officials  admit that those who do not qualify for Russian residence  permits are the ones who really need to come to the South.  Those who have already obtained permission are not in a need to  hurry to the South as they have led a comparatively stable life  in Russia, they say. The officials refused to give details on  how many of the five North Koreans who came to Seoul on the day  hold residence permits and how many do not. But it is presumed  that one or two do not have permits.</p>

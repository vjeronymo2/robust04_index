			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / British Rail plans for passenger's charter criticised SOME passengers suffering late or cancelled trains will be worse off under new compensation arrangements announced by British Rail yesterday. The biggest beneficiaries of the long-awaited passenger's charter will be Network SouthEast commuters, many of whom will get discounts of up to 10 per cent on season ticket renewals if their lines fail to meet performance targets. Other passengers, however, are likely to find that compensation arrangements are either the same or less generous than those available under the unpublicised and arbitrary system already in existence. Refunds will only normally be considered when trains are more than an hour late; cash refunds will be replaced by vouchers, normally worth 20 per cent of the fare paid; and there will be no right to compensation for overcrowding, breakdowns in train heating or other service failures. Under the old system, local managers had discretion to hand out cash or travel vouchers in any circumstances where a passenger took the trouble to write in and complain about unpunctuality or poor service. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, said the charter was an important step forward in raising standards of service for rail passengers. But the plans unleashed a stream of criticisms from consumer organisations, opposition parties and trade unions. The Consumers' Association, which is backing High Court actions by seven passengers against let-out clauses in BR's Conditions of Carriage, said the charter was virtually worthless. 'Vouchers and petty discounts, to be used only in certain circumstances and given grudgingly under a complex system of exemptions and conditions, go nowhere near far enough,' said Mr John Beishon, the association's director. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, labelled the charter a con trick. 'It will do nothing to improve quality on the railways and will be shown to be a damp squib for passengers,' he said. Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, said the aim was to improve services by giving managers achievable performance targets. 'Faced with the choice of compensation for delays and cancellations, or a better standard of service all the year round, there is no doubt that our passengers would opt for better service,' he said. 'Our aim is to give them that better service.' The charter's main innovation is a system of compensating commuters who at present have little or no opportunity to claim for frequently recurring shortfalls in performance. From May, figures will be made available at all staffed stations every four weeks showing performance over the last year. If targets are missed by more than a certain margin, discounts for season ticket renewals will be automatically triggered. Those wanting to claim for disruption to individual journeys will pick up forms at stations. It is estimated that the cost of compensation will rise from Pounds 7m for the financial year just ending to Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m a year under the new scheme because of a sharp increase in the number of claims. Mr John Welsby, BR's chief executive, said the increase was equivalent to 0.5 per cent of BR's annual fare revenue. Late arrival at rail charter ball, Page 9 Editorial comment, Page 16</p>

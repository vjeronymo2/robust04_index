			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Bank warns on end to mortgage help Any move to withdraw income support on mortgage interest payments would wipe Pounds 4,500 off the value of the average home, UBS, the investment bank, warned yesterday. The cost of income support payments to cover mortgage interest rose to Pounds 1.2bn last The government has already started to curtail the scheme, initially by imposing a ceiling of Pounds 150,000 on mortgages which qualify for support. In April this ceiling was reduced to Pounds 125,000. UBS estimated that repossessions would rise by 13,000 a year if income support were removed entirely, causing house prices to fall 7 per cent across the market.</p>

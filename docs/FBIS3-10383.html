[Begin journalist Antonio Carlos Silva recording] At the  official residence of La Guzmania here in La Guaira, 30 km from  Caracas, the presidents of Brazil and Venezuela, Itamar Franco  and Rafael Caldera respectively, released a joint communique  this afternoon, confirming the two countries' political  willingness to give new impetus 4o their bilateral relations.  As part of this effort, they decided to form a bilateral  commission, chaired by the foreign ministers of the two  countries, to raise common issues. This commission will form  work groups to design projects in the electrical, highway,  hydrographical, mining, iron and steel, and environmental fields.    The presidents of Brazil and Venezuela proposed that the  ministers involved in the commercial area speed up the  preparations for signing an economic accord.    They discussed the Brazilian proposal to create a free trade  zone, without excluding other current regional integration  mechanisms, and decided to continue their talks on this issue.    The two presidents also proposed discussing ways to increase  Brazilian purchases of Venezuelan oil. They agreed to promote  efforts to develop the border areas, especially the Indian  communities.    The joint communique was released at 1230 today after a  two-hour meeting between the two presidents.    Presidents Itamar Franco and Rafael Caldera had lunch  together and President Itamar Franco then had a free afternoon.  He is scheduled to return to Brasilia on 5 March. [end  recording]    President Itamar Franco confirmed that by converting wages  into URV's [Real Value Units], they will not lose their value.  Therefore, he believes that the mechanism proposed by Congress  for adjusting wages against inflation is unnecessary.    Following the release of the joint communique, President  Itamar Franco held a news conference during which he criticized  the activities of oligopolies in Brazil and expressed hope that  Congress will improve the provisional measure as far as  oligopolies are concerned. Concerning wage policies, he asked  that the negotiations be conducted at the ministries and the  respective business sectors [camaras setoriais].    President Itamar Franco said the government has nothing to  hide. Therefore, there is no reason for the workers to strike  when the authorities are open to dialogue. The president added  that if the workers demonstrate that the wages are actually  losing their value, the government will obviously take this fact  into account.    Itmar Franco noted that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso's departure from the government, if it occurs, will not  hurt the management of the economic program that interests the  entire country, not just the government.</p>

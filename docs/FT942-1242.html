			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Aden suffers worst barrage Northern Yemeni forces pounded the southern city of Aden with the heaviest artillery barrage of Yemen's civil war yesterday as the south called for sanctions to force the north to stop the attacks, Reuter reports from Aden. Shells crashed into Aden's northern suburbs of Mansoura and Sheikh Othman at a rate of one a minute in the evening after a brief afternoon lull. Residents said that, for the first time since the war began on May 4, almost all Aden's residential areas were being bombarded by northern forces, which are trying to crush the south's bid to secede from a united Yemeni state. Aden's population was estimated at 350,000 before civil war broke out. It has grown to over 400,000 as refugees fled into the city.</p>

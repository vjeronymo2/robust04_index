			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis said today that the  Greek Cypriot side insists on a discussion of the substance of  the Cyprus issue. Kliridhis made the above statement during a  news conference with 13 Turkish Cypriot journalists at the  presidential palace. The president expressed the view that the  UN secretary general does not intend to submit a second package  of confidence-building measures. He also said that he expects  that in his letter to the two sides the secretary general will  say that immediately following the confidence-building measures  there must be talks on the substance of the Cyprus issue.    Replying to a question on whether there will be a new  package  of confidence-building measures for Morphou following the  implementation of the proposed measures, President Kliridhis  said that after the agreement on the measures, there will be a  discussion on the substance of the Cyprus issue. President  Kliridhis said that, according to the Butrus-Ghali map, Morphou  must be on the Greek side. He added that this is an issue that  must be discussed in the substance of the Cyprus issue because  the territorial aspect will not be solved through the  confidence-building measures.    Replying to a Turkish Cypriot correspondent's question,  President Kliridhis rejected the claim of AKEL [Restorative  Party of the Working People] General Secretary Dhimitrios  Khristofias that he is bluffing on the confidence-building  measures. Kliridhis said that the policy of bluffing does not  lead anywhere.    Asked whether he believes that the Cyprus problem can be  resolved during his term in office, President Kliridhis said  that if Ankara and [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas have  decided that it is the time for a solution to the Cyprus issue,  they have the right man to negotiate with. Kliridhis said that  he does not meet officially with Denktas, as the Turkish Cypriot  leader insists continuously, because the UN secretary general  has not proposed such a meeting. In order to have a meeting with  Denktas, he said, certain topics on the confidence-building  measures must be arranged first. He added that he does not  refuse to have social meetings with the Turkish Cypriot leader.    Following their meeting with President Kliridhis, the  Turkish  Cypriot journalists visited the Um Haram mosque in Larnaca.  Earlier they visited Omeriye mosque, which is in the old part  of Nicosia.</p>

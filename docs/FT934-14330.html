			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Speaker vote goes Bhutto's way THE nomination yesterday of Mr Yusuf Raza Gillani as speaker of the lower house of the Pakistani parliament, the national assembly, has strengthened Ms Benazir Bhutto's attempt to become prime minister again. Her nominee won with a comfortable majority over his rival, Mr Gohar Ayub. The voting confirmed Ms Bhutto's lead over Mr Nawaz Sharif, her arch rival, whose PML (Pakistan Moslem League) party was backing Mr Khan. Ms Bhutto's PPP (Pakistan People's Party) won the largest number of seats in the elections, but needs support of independents to form a majority. 'The results of the prime minister's elections will be even better. We are confident of carrying most of the parties with us,' said Mr Farooq Leghari, secretary general of the PPP, after yesterday's results. The PPP is expected to gain the support of independents affiliated to neither of the two parties. However, the two sides are still locked in battle for control of Punjab, the biggest and wealthiest province.</p>

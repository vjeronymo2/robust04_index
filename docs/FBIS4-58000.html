			<p>BFN     [Text] "The Cairns Group will continue functioning but with  goals, and because there are no schedules we must take the  priorities on the basis of the problems that crop up. But we  have determined everything that refers to the implementation and  schedules contained in the final document of the GATT's Uruguay  Round." This was said by Pedro Saravia, our country's  livestock, agriculture, and fisheries minister, when he  evaluated the 14th [Cairns Group meeting], which ended on 20 May  in Montevideo, as "very positive."    It is his opinion that "there are a series of signals  throughout the world that indicate that the group must continue  its functions," in addition "it must have the capability of  answering immediately" because "the first Cairns Group meeting  took place after the signing of the Marrakech document."    Saravia reaffirmed: "The work that was carried out was very  important as an element of pressure, and it was a way in which  criteria were unified, thus we can convey to the major powers a  very different position from the one they already have." But  the Cairns Group's functioning "is informal and has its  limitations."    The minister considered: "The illegitimacy that world trade,  meaning subsidies and dumping [preceding word in English], were  some of the factors on which we have had to work, and in one way  or another they now are being felt."    Undoubtedly these are not the only elements, "but the world  and the great powers have had to cede some things, including the  fact that they have had to sit down and discuss new budgets, and  even though the dismantling will take place within 10 to 15  years, it can be considered very positive."    Saravia stated that even with these ups and downs, the  Cairns  Group "countries have played a very important role."    The minister, who was the meeting's host, said that during  the meeting "the code of conduct was not debated, but everything  pertaining to honesty and loyalty regarding procedures was  debated."    Although it has no legal status and does not have the means  to act as a referee in controversies that can crop up in the  trade sector, "the positions that emerged within the group's 14  member countries are a counterweight when there is a business  deal with distortions."</p>

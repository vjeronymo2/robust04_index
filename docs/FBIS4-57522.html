			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luis Vasquez Merino from the "Early Morning" </F> newscast]    [Text] There was violence in San Luis Potosi yesterday.  Thirteen urban transportation buses were burned and 10 cars  destroyed when autonomous University of San Luis Potosi students  clashed with bus owners and gang members.    The incident started in the morning when the students, led  by  their leader (Ramon Puron Cir), seized about 20 public  transportation buses and kept them inside the university campus  to protest the large number of people killed by buses and the  humiliating treatment afforded users.    The bus owners, accompanied by gang members, stoned  buildings  and cars owned by professors and burned a car. The students  responded by burning 10 [figure as heard] of the seized buses.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Our stand is to hold  talks and do our best to ensure that they pay for the damage,  which is quite considerable. Things like this should not happen  at a university. [end recording]    All this transpired as public forces watched from a nearby  street but did not intervene, arguing that they could not  violate university autonomy.    The Red Cross treated at least 12 people, most with minor  head injuries. Governor Horacio Sanchez Unzueta, who marked his  first year in office yesterday, said the violence was provoked  by people not affiliated with the university. He added that  this incident will be fully investigated and those responsible  will face the full force of the law.</p>

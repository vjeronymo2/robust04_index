			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiu Qi: "Forum Says Trade with South </F> Korea Looks Bright"]    [Text] Trade relations between China and South Korea are  looking bright, participants at a forum concluded yesterday.    The Sino-South Korean economic co-operation seminar held in  Beijing outlined an optimistic trading future between the two  neighbours.    "The economic exchanges between the two countries play a key  role in promoting the overall development of Northeast Asia,"  said Yi Hyon-chae, former prime minister of South Korea.    Lee added that South Korea is eager to strengthen  co-operation between the two sides on the basis of mutual  benefit.    The government, he said, encourages more enterprises to  invest in China and is willing to transfer technology to the  mainland.    Zheng Dunxun, President of China Chemicals Import and Export  Corporation, said the two economies can benefit from trading.    South Korea mainly exports capital-intensive products to  China such as automobiles, ships and electronic goods, while it  imports labour-intensive goods like raw materials, crude oil and  cereals from China.    China has become South Korea's third largest trading partner  and South Korea is the fourth largest recipient of Chinese goods  (not including shipments through Taiwan and Hong Kong).    Last year, trade volume between the two was $8.22 billion, a  63.5 percent rise over the previous year, Zheng said.    China National Chemical Import and Export Corporation  established a branch office in South Korea in 1992, one of the  first Chinese enterprises to do so.    Since then, 36 Chinese companies have set up branches in  South Korea. And almost 100 South Korean firms have offices on  the mainland.    Through last September, the eastern neighbour invested $1.5  billion in the mainland in 2,153 projects.</p>

The sources told AL-SHURUQ that al-Bid was not sure about  the  security measures. In fact, people close to him said openly  that al-Bid had great fears that he would be a victim of a  carefully concocted assassination attempt. The second reason is  that if al-Bid went to Ta'izz, he would find himself in a  hostile atmosphere. The reason for this is not President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih but the ulema, who are known for their support  for President Salih. Despite all the recent developments, the  ulema still regard al-Bid as a socialist and communist.    Whatever the reasons behind al-Bid's boycott of the meeting,  the failure of the Ta'izz meeting has exacerbated the Yemeni  crisis. President 'Ali Salih acknowledged this when he warned of  "serious pitfalls facing Yemeni unity" which was realized on 22  May 1990.    The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has made a meeting between  the Yemeni president and the vice president conditional on the  implementation of the YSP's 18 points, despite the fact that the  General People's Congress had earlier approved those 18 points.  This means the YSP does not plan to make any concessions and  that al-Bid is deliberately seeking to "humiliate" 'Ali Salih to  corner him and drive him to adopt positions and measures which  al-Bid probably would like to see happen without himself taking  the responsibility of declaring or adopting such measures.    Informed Yemeni sources told AL-SHURUQ that the telephone  call between al-Bid and King Husayn of Jordan after canceling  the Ta'izz meeting has left the door open to hold a meeting, but  in a neutral venue outside Yemen and after complying with new  conditions set by al-Bid.</p>

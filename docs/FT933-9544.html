			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Risk and Reward: Directors' stock options packages under scrutiny Hundreds of otherwise conservative corporate boards of directors have blundered into the derivatives arena, writing options on millions of dollars of the corporation's own stock. Then, like the world's worst traders, the directors fail to account for the options liability on the corporate balance sheet or take any steps to hedge the options exposure. Shareholders, in the language of options traders, are left naked. In the trading room of an investment bank, this behaviour would be viewed as wildly speculative and irresponsible. In the corporate arena, it is an accepted, and expanding, practice. Corporations, seeking to design executive compensation plans with built-in performance motivations, routinely grant generous stock options packages. When the options are exercised, new shares are issued, diluting shareholder equity. Mr Carl Levin, a US Democratic senator from Michigan, calls it 'stealth compensation'. Since US accounting rules don't require corporations to charge the options liability to earnings, many directors view options as a 'free' way to boost compensation packages. Options compensation proliferated during the 1980s. Many of those perks had eight to 10-year durations, and when US income tax laws changed in 1992, some high-profile executives grabbed headlines with options exercises. Mr Michael Eisner of Disney, for one, took several hundred million dollars in gains from options exercises in December. The company issued stock to meet his call. The late Mr Steven Ross of Time-Warner was given a lucrative option on 7.2m shares of the company's stock in 1990. Analysts say they are still exercisable by Mr Ross's estate, and are now valued at more than Dollars 50m. Smaller companies, particularly high-technology firms, may have a surprisingly large percentage of stock exposed to options compensation. Although determining options exposure from a company's annual report is difficult, an estimated 17 per cent of Compaq computer, for example, is tied up in options. Typically, a corporate's options exposure is far smaller, but cannot be viewed, as it often is by corporate boards, as insignificant. Mr Graef Crystal, Emeritus Professor at the University of Southern California at Berkely, and an options benefits consultant, says: 'The danger of this is that any commodity that is undervalued is usually over-consumed. The biggest barrier to proper accounting for executive options, and for proper hedging, is the perception that options have no value.' The Federal Accounting Standards Board is on the verge of requiring companies to reduce their reported earnings by the value of their stock options. This, many analysts fear, would remove a valuable executive incentive tool. Options traders and institutional investors, however, believe the issue is not accounting rules, but proper management of the options position. Equity options specialists at Swiss Bank Corp and at Salomon Brothers say that shareholder liability to executive options could be easily managed by an offsetting call purchase. In other words, if Disney wished to grant an executive the right to buy 1m shares at Dollars 37 each any time during the next five years, Disney, at the same time, would buy calls on its own stock from a market-making dealer for the same quantity, duration, and strike price. The offsetting calls would limit shareholder exposure to the executive's bonus package to the cost of the options premium, should Disney's stock price rise. Dealers estimate the cost of the offsetting option, given the five-year life, would amount to about 25 per cent of the share price. The dealer-issued calls, if exercised, are non-taxable to the corporation, reducing costs. 'Corporations have a hard time with valuing their own options, but we are willing to make a market for them anytime,' one options trader notes. 'An executive looking after his own interest will be unwilling to spend millions up-front (for a call premium) to protect shareholders from a liability that may be five or 10 years down the line, even if the options exposure could run into hundreds of millions of dollars.'</p>

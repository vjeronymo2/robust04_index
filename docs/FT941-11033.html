			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Fightback starts against tobacco advert controls The Advertising Association today starts a fightback against proposals circulating in Whitehall for tighter controls - including tax penalties - on tobacco advertising. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is expected to announce this week plans for a fresh round of talks with tobacco manufacturers on voluntary controls. The government had hoped to announce tighter controls before parliament debates a private member's bill, put forward by Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley, which would outlaw almost all tobacco advertising on health grounds. The bill is to be given its second reading on Friday. But Mrs Bottomley has been unable to win cabinet agreement for a package of controls - including a ban on poster advertising - drawn up by the Department of Health . The cabinet appears to be divided over the issue, with some ministers backing an advertising ban while others believe a ban would impinge on personal freedom and reduce revenue from tobacco taxes. Mrs Bottomley is believed to be considering whether the government could finance an advertising campaign to ram home the dangers of smoking, particularly to young and female cigarette buyers. An alternative proposal being mooted is a scheme to prevent manufacturers from offsetting their advertising costs - about Pounds 60m a year - against profits. The Advertising Association, the umbrella group for both clients and practitioners in the industry, says that a ban or the introduction of financial penalties would be a 'frightening prospect'. A document being sent to all MPs argues that an advertising ban would not reduce consumption. Potentially more effective measures, such as improving health education, restricting smoking in public places and raising prices, would be expensive or unpopular, it says, while 'advertising is an easier target'. The association is also accusing Italy, Portugal, France and Spain of being top of a 'liars' league' of European Union member states in favouring an EU-wide ban on tobacco advertising. It says these countries argue for a ban on health grounds but are in fact acting to keep out foreign imports to protect state-owned industries.</p>

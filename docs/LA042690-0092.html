			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> 'Nasty' Found Obscene in Ohio: "As Nasty as They Wanna Be," the sexually  explicit album by the Miami-based rap group 2 Live Crew, is too nasty for  Cincinnati. According to a decision reached Wednesday by the Hamilton County  Vice Squad, the controversial million-selling album was deemed a violation of  Ohio obscenity statutes.  </P> <P> When police visited the five stores in the county that carried the album, only  one of them had the uncensored version. The store promptly removed the album at  the police's request. There was no hearing or court proceeding involved in  naming the album obscene, only a decision by Sherriff Simon Leif, who was  involved in the recent controversy over the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit in  Cincinnati, and the vice squad.

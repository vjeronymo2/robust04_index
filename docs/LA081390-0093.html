			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE CUTS' HUMAN TOLL;  </P> <P> JOBS: FOR LAID-OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS, FINDING NEW WORK IS BUT ONE PROBLEM.  LOST SAVINGS AND HOMES AND OTHER FAMILY PROBLEMS HURT, TOO.  </P> <P> The wave of defense industry layoffs in Southern California is costing  thousands of people far more than their jobs. Self-esteem, savings, homes and  family tranquility are among the first things to go.  </P> <P> Laid-off workers might have to leave the area to find comparable work, and  those who stay may be forced into lower-paying but more stable jobs. Even  finding jobs in such fast-growing fields as computer programming, health care  or law will not be easy for many workers who face months or years of retraining  to make a career move.  </P> <P> Even though thousands have already lost their jobs, the worst is yet to come as  once-paternalistic employers tighten their belts and chop payrolls in response  to the slowdown in military spending.  </P> <P> Nearly 20,000 California aerospace and defense industry workers had lost their  jobs by the end of 1989, and another 20,000 will be added to unemployment rolls  this year, according to various estimates. The ranks of unemployed should rise  to 110,000 by 1994, according to DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting firm.  </P> <P> Major layoffs announced this year include 2,700 jobs at Northrop at facilities  in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, 8,000 at Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach  and 2,000 at Lockheed, mostly in Burbank. Lockheed will lay off an additional  4,500 workers during the next few years as the company transfers military  projects from its Burbank plant to facilities in Georgia.  </P> <P> "This is not a good time for this to be happening," said David G. Hensley, who  studies the California economy at the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. "We  see no booming sector. We just don't see any industry that could absorb people  -- whether they could transfer skills or not."  </P> <P> The collapsing fortunes of the defense and aerospace industries have left  workers feeling trapped.  </P> <P> "It's going to be hard because everybody is laying off -- Rockwell, TRW,  Hughes, Lockheed, Northrop," said Brenda Brown, a 33-year-old Carson resident  who lost her $13-an-hour job at Douglas Aircraft at the end of June. Brown, her  husband and son plan to rent out their brand-new home and move in with her  mother until she gets a new job.  </P> <P> "I don't have a (college) degree, and I'm up against people with degrees making  $7 an hour," Brown said. "What kind of future is there for me?"  </P> <P> For Brown and unemployed workers like her, companies and communities have  responded with a series of job fairs, resume and job-finding workshops and time  off with pay to search for new work.  </P> <P> In El Segundo, the Aerospace Human Resources Network, a public-private joint  venture created to fill aerospace job openings during the boom years, now  dedicates itself to helping unemployed employees find work in any industry.  </P> <P> But as the number of unemployed grows, the search for jobs will become more  heated, and some firms have come under pressure to reduce benefits to departing  workers. Douglas Aircraft, for instance, gave the first wave of laid-off  workers 60 days off with pay to find other work. Those laid off in the second  round in June were not so lucky, having to remain on the job. "We needed the  hands," a company spokesman said.  </P> <P> Searching for a new job will be relatively painless for some workers -- such as  computer programmers and secretaries with easily transferable skills, say  economists. Many blue-collar machinists or highly specialized engineers,  however, could face a long wait in the unemployment line.  </P> <P> "The fastest job growth has been in the service sector," said Steve Weiner,  acting principal economist at the Southern California Assn. of Governments. But  "there is a question of the transferability of aerospace skills to those  industries. That would probably be very difficult."  </P> <P> The region's growing pool of unemployed talent has made it fertile territory  for head hunters. Recruiters for Seattle's Boeing Aircraft -- which is still  hiring because its commercial airliner business is booming -- temporarily set  up shop in Long Beach to interview laid-off workers.  </P> <P> Boeing is taking back to Washington state lifelong Californians such as Martha  Collins, a 42-year-old Burbank native and former Lockheed planner who was let  go in March.  </P> <P> "It's so depressing here, and it keeps getting worse," said Collins, who will  be accompanied by her husband but will leave behind two grown daughters. "I  just look at it as a good opportunity and as a fresh start."  </P> <P> Aerospace and defense industry workers have learned to live with uncertainty --  even in good times -- as government contracts ended, commercial projects were  completed and workers were laid off until the next program was up and running.  </P> <P> The uncertainty was made bearable by fat paychecks and lucrative benefits, such  as company-paid technical training and college tuition, that allowed workers to  enjoy the good life even in pricey Southern California. But now, with peace  breaking out in many places around the world, long-term prospects for defense  industry workers are bleak.  </P> <P> Paychecks from Hughes Aircraft paid for Radu Marian's home near the water in  Redondo Beach and for trips to New Zealand and the Caribbean. But last July,  after working 16 years in the defense industry, the good life ended for Marian,  an electronics engineer, with the arrival of a layoff notice.  </P> <P> The 39-year-old Romanian immigrant has no health insurance, has fallen behind  on child-support payments and cannot afford to pay for his daughter's college  education. In a desperate bid to earn some cash, Marian took out a newspaper ad  offering his services as a handyman. The only response was from a Manhattan  Beach family who paid him $250 to build a bicycle storage shed.  </P> <P> "I am extremely surprised that I would take this long to find a job," said  Marian, whose childhood interest in science and space exploration had led him  to work in the defense industry. "It's a source of great concern. I have to ask  the question, how long can I sustain myself or if I can ever go back to work?"  </P> <P> The industry's relatively high salaries have haunted laid-off employees as they  are forced to consider lower-paid work. Former Douglas worker Jeff Sherman  dropped by a state employment office only to be told that "they have mostly  low-paying jobs. I was almost making $16 an hour. I'm rather leery of working  in aerospace again. However, it is a very high-paying industry."  </P> <P> But with each day out of work, the pressure to bring money home and accept  marginal jobs intensifies.  </P> <P> "We are eating into our reserves," said Thomas Asada-Grant, a 38-year-old  training executive at Northrop until he was laid off in May. "We are taking  money out of our children's savings accounts. We broke into an IRA. At the end  of August, I will have to take anything."  </P> <P> Former defense workers are turning to the commercial side of the aerospace  industry for relief from the government-dependent defense sector. But even  these workers have found that switching sides is no guarantee of protection  from industry turbulence. Douglas Aircraft, a builder of passenger jets, was  forced to retract job offers to former defense workers after the recently  announced reorganization of its corporate parent, McDonnell Douglas Corp.  </P> <P> "The tragic thing is a lot of the commercial high-tech companies don't want  anything to do with the aerospace and defense engineers," said Sandy Lechtick,  president of National Recruiters in Canoga Park. "The commercial world is 180  degrees different from the defense world. We've been able to get engineers in  the door. But we are told repeatedly that any resumes that are defense-oriented  are trashed."  </P> <P> Wynne Thursby, a 47-year-old engineer who managed a military satellite project  for OAO Corp. in El Segundo before being laid off in March, is trying to find a  similar job in the commercial side of the industry -- with little success. "The  problem is there are not enough commercial satellites," she said. "You're  fighting panic. You don't want to take a job just because it's a job."  </P> <P> Many workers say they no longer want anything to do with aerospace, either the  commercial or defense segments. "I'm basically looking for jobs in the state,  federal and county governments -- something more stable," Brown said. "I know I  will take a drop in pay, but at this point in my life, I'd rather do this and  be secure than go through another layoff."  </P> <P> Some find that they do not have much chance of remaining in the industry, even  if they wanted to. At age 64, Sol Fink, another laid-off Lockheed worker, holds  little hope of finding another aerospace job. But the onetime Fuller Brush  salesman says he and his wife cannot get by on the $300 monthly pension he will  receive after 11 1/2 years with Lockheed.  </P> <P> "I'm going to try all the different aircraft plants," said Fink, who  constructed plumbing on aircraft mock-ups. "But they can look at my gray hairs  and say that I'm overqualified. They are going to go for the younger ones."  </P> <P> Looking for work has become an almost full-time occupation for many. "My job  right now is to find a job," Thursby said. The Culver City resident keeps  copies of her resume handy, as well as a date book where she records phone  calls and letters sent to potential employers. When she is not filling out job  applications or visiting aerospace job fairs, she works part time for friends  in the accounting department of their small company.  </P> <P> "It helps keep you from getting depressed," said Thursby, who borrowed against  her retirement funds to stay afloat until she finds another job. If she stays  at home, she said, she feels "that nobody wants to talk to me anymore, that  nobody wants me anymore."  </P> <P> Combatting feelings of loneliness and uncertainty is a common trait among  out-of-work aerospace employees.  </P> <P> "Every now and then you do panic," said Norman Gilbreath of Westwood, who was a  software engineer at TRW before losing his job. "You get these tremendous  insecurities. The hardest part is knowing you are nearly the only person who  cares about what happens to you."  </P> <P> Besides triggering insecurities, the layoffs have changed and strained family  relationships. Asada-Grant now stays home to care for his two infant daughters  and has tried preparing meals from scratch to cut the cost of prepared foods.  His wife, Keiko, has become the sole breadwinner with her job as a translator.  </P> <P> "I have become a househusband," said Asada-Grant, who worked for Northrop as a  training executive. "My kids see me a lot more. My wife says they seem  happier."  </P> <P> But tensions run high. Many discussions of family problems big and small turn  into arguments linked to his unemployment, Asada-Grant said. "We have horrible  arguments. You sit down and strangle each other for 20 minutes, and then you  make up. Until I get a job, this pattern will recur."  </P> <P> There is a slight chance that the family's turmoil might come to an end soon.  Asada-Grant is due to hear whether he has gotten a new job -- as a public  school math teacher.  </P></p>

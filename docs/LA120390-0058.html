			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE;  </P> <P> LAMB'S PLAYERS' HOLIDAY SHOW ANOTHER WINNER  </P> <P> Smooth and easy.  </P> <P> Kerry Cederberg Meads' newest script for the "Lamb's Players Festival of  Christmas" -- the name always given for Lamb's Players Theatre's annual and  usually new Christmas play -- goes down like a glass of unlaced eggnog: thick,  sweet and creamy.  </P> <P> Don't look for anything challenging, cynical or ironic here. But like a good TV  sitcom writer, Meads, who has written eight new scripts for the 13th annual  "Lamb's Players Festival of Christmas" (five have been repeated), has developed  a deft hand at keeping the laughs and tear-jerk sentiment flowing.  </P> <P> All "Festival of Christmas" shows have this much in common: they are set on  Christmas eve (the year and the place can be anywhere), they work in a full  sampler of Christmas carols, they deal with Christmas and the Christmas spirit,  and they are designed to leave audiences with a warm and fuzzy feeling.  </P> <P> In this year's show, set on Christmas Eve, 1952, an amateur singing group from  Dubuque, Iowa, wins a spot on a live television broadcast in New York City much  to the television director's dismay. When all of the director's stars, guest  stars and supporting cast are snowed out, the amateur singing group ends up  doing the entire show solo.  </P> <P> And because "A Festival of Christmas" always has a happy ending, no one should  be surprised when -- surprise -- the amateur group does a terrific job. One of  the female singers becomes an overnight sensation. The other female singer,  given the chance to leave her job as a checkout girl at the Piggly Wiggly in  Dubuque for a starring spot on this series, turns it down because she doesn't  want to leave Dubuque or her boyfriend. And nearly everyone else finds their  true love and the true spirit of Christmas in the course of the show.  </P> <P> And because Meads does such a top-notch job at leavening the cliches with  nearly nonstop verbal or visual humor (just try not to laugh at the commercial  jingle with three of the actors playing a giant dancing toothbrush and two  dancing teeth), she gets away with it. The direction of Robert Smyth, Lamb's  artistic director, is similarly sure -- moving quickly from punch line to punch  line in Act I, slowing the pace to lard the jokes with the required messages,  morals and Christmas sentiment in Act II.  </P> <P> Many in the audience even pulled out their handkerchiefs and cried when one of  the characters made an impromptu speech about missing her father who was off  fighting in Korea. With many local families missing a husband, son, father or  brother in the Persian Gulf this holiday season, this scene may well have  struck a responsive chord.  </P> <P> The acting is usually a dependable pleasure at Lamb's, where the company relies  upon a year-round ensemble and guest artists familiar to the company. This  cast, which adds a few talented newcomers, is no exception.  </P> <P> As the amateur singing group, Deborah Gilmour Smyth, Tom Stephenson, Leigh  Scarritt and Arthur Morton, do a terrific job as the rubes overwhelmed by their  big break in the big city. Gregory Adams is delightfully oily as the show's  singing star, Steve Fairfield, a man passionately in love -- with himself.  Darlene Trent is sweetly overbearing as the commercial sponsor's wife whose  bright-eyed ideas drive the theater director (a spluttering, anxiety-wracked  David Cochran Heath) to distraction. Ted Deasy has some choice moments as  Frankie, the beaten-down technical manager who, when pushed to the breaking  point by the director, gives back some of his own -- with interest.  </P> <P> The cast's voices are lovely and do well by the dozen Christmas songs in the  show. Vanda Eggington, who is credited with composing some memorable melodies,  provided the excellent musical direction and many of the arrangements.  </P> <P> Mike Buckley did the simple, satisfying set design and Veronica Murphy Smith  gets the nod for some of the outrageously funny costumes -- dancing sugarplums  and, of course, that marvelous toothbrush and teeth.  </P> <P> But one of the most remarkable elements in this production is the show's  demonstration of how well Lamb's knows how to give its audience just what they  want. By the time this review appears, tickets will only be available for five  of the remaining 33 performances: the Dec. 18-21 matinees at 2 and a Christmas  Eve performance Dec. 24 at 7:30 p.m. Yes, even the 10 a.m. Saturday  performances are already sold out.  </P> <P> That's because most "Lamb's Players Festival of Christmas" fans don't sit  around waiting for the reviews. Even when the script is brand new, like this  one, they know what to expect. And once again, they won't be disappointed.  </P> <P> "LAMB'S PLAYERS FESTIVAL OF CHRISTMAS"  </P> <P> By Kerry Cederberg Meads. Director, Robert Smyth. Musical direction, Vanda  Eggington.

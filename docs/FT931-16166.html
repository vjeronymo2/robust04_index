			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Letter: Separation of private and public medicine may be answer in London Sir, Peter Draper's views on the Tomlinson report ('Look to consultants for NHS efficiency', January 5) are shared by most of those who have considered its analysis and recommendations in any detail. The crucial point is that primary care facilities in the capital are desperately in need of upgrading, but this should be done on its own merits and not be dependent on running down the hospital sector. The views of general practitioners are particularly relevant here as they, with patients, are supposed to be the main beneficiaries of Tomlinson. Their response indicates that they reject the assumption that London is currently overprovided with hospital beds, see the necessary improvement in general practice as needing time as well as a lot of money, and think that by revealing unmet need those improvements may increase rather than reduce the requirement for hospital beds. The latter part of Dr Draper's article gets on to less familiar ground with his argument that consultants are the key factor in efficiency of hospital bed usage, particularly the amount of time they actually spend on their NHS commitments. Although this point has not hitherto received a great deal of publicity in the non-medical press, there is no doubt that consultant absence can lead to delay in discharge from both in-patient bed and out-patient clinic. The Kings Fund report that Greater London consultants earn more from private work than from the NHS is even more startling when it is realised that about half of all consultants are on whole-time contracts and are officially limited to earning not more than 10 per cent of their NHS salary from private medicine. There has been considerable movement in recent years towards blurring the edges between private and NHS. Perhaps Tomlinson (and Draper) have provided the stimulus to rethink this and consider whether separation, at least in the capital, might not be more appropriate and cost-effective.

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (16): Towards greener Games  -Environmental issues / Plates and eating utensils at the Olympic village are made from potato starch. Mixed with food scraps, they can either be fed to pigs or used to form garden compost A bird sanctuary was the environmental turning point for the Lillehammer Games. In the early planning stages of the Olympic projects, 'green' protestors seemed to oppose virtually every scheme that the Organising Committee put forward. Then the proposed siting of the Hamar Olympic Hall close to the bird sanctuary became an issue. Lillehammer Olympic Organising Committee (LOOC) chief Mr Gerhard Heiberg says he had a feeling at the time that it was going to be better to join the environmentalists rather than to fight them. 'I asked them to co-operate with us at every stage and consider the ecology and the environment before we got to fighting over specific plans and drawings,' recalls Mr Heiberg. That was three years ago but it turned out to be an inspired move. In the case of the bird sanctuary, the Hamar Hall was built on the same site, but the entire building was rotated through 180 degrees. This meant that the doors faced away from the nesting grounds, thus minimising the disruption as spectators used the building. 'Since local authority planning permission had already been given, we could have ignored the lobbyists' concerns,' says Mr Osmund Ueland, the LOOC's environmental director. 'But the solution was satisfactory to all sides. The conflict led to a constructive dialogue with environmental groups. 'Our goal since then has been to influence the decision-making process ahead of time, instead of dealing with conflicts and protests afterwards.' Throughout the construction phase of the Lillehammer venues, enormous attention has been paid to the impact on the area's visual amenity. The two ski-jumps in the Olympic park are a break with tradition in that both launching ramps are well below the level of the surrounding pine trees. From the town and the highways approaching Lillehammer they are barely visible - except, of course, when floodlit at night. The soil and rock blasted from the mountain has been used to create natural spectator amphitheatres around the run-out zones. At the bobsleigh and luge tracks near Hunderfossen, 15km from Lillehammer, even greater care was taken when building the concrete chutes, more than a kilometre long, that meander down the forested mountainside. In Norway there is no tradition of either sport and traditionalists were reluctant to see a native forest virtually felled to provide a facility alien to the region. Building companies signed contracts accepting penalty clauses of up to NKr50,000 a tree if they were to fell even one more pine than the plans directed. The consequence is that from the judging area at the finish of the runs - where the competitors hurtle past at up to 120kph - the bulk of the circuit is completely invisible. Many spectators for the cross-country and biathlon events will take to the forest and watch the event from the trackside rather than a grandstand. Many  -and Lillehammer's mayor Mr Audun Tron is one of them - will obtain permits to build a camp in the woods and stay several days. Around a gapahur - a simple shelter made from branches - and cooking over a campfire, the mayor and numerous others like him will commune with nature. And afterwards, they will remove all their rubbish. Technology is helping to ease the environmental impact of the thousands of athletes and media who will stay in Lillehammer. Plates and eating utensils at the Olympic village are made from potato starch. Mixed with food scraps, they can either be fed to pigs or rotted down to form garden compost. Several plates have already been eaten in the cause of publicity by LOOC officials and pronounced edible, if less than delicious. During the Games, specially marked bins for sorting refuse will sprout throughout Lillehammer and 150 Team '94 volunteers will be encouraging spectators and others to dispose of their refuse in an ecologically sensible manner. During the biathlon, competitors will fire an estimated 8 tonnes of lead bullets from their rifles. Behind the targets, specially designed machines will collect the lead before it can leach into the soil. Some environmental issues are less visible to the naked eye - energy consumption, for example. Engineers have proved adept at meeting new demands. In Grovik, 40 minutes' drive to the south of Lillehammer, the Olympic Cavern Hall has been blasted inside a mountain. Many of the early round ice hockey matches will be played here. The naturally constant temperature inside the rock keeps heating costs at less than half those for comparable venues. Environmental protection clauses have been included in contracts between LOOC and all of the official sponsors - including international members of the TOPIII programme. Kodak is adapting the laboratory where as many as 5,000 rolls of film a day are likely to be processed, to produce fewer toxic chemicals. Coca-Cola has been busy developing environmentally friendly disposable cups. Xerox has its own ecologically-tested plan for the re-cycling of paper, chemicals and toner containers during the Games. Already, almost every LOOC publication comes on recycled paper. None of these measures has been ignored by the Olympic movement. When Sydney won the right to stage the summer Games in 2000, the International Olympic Committee asserted that the success of the bid had been in part due to its concern for the built environment around Sydney Harbour. Olympics president Juan Antonio Samaranch and his officials are alert to every nuance that affects the public perception of Olympism. Environmental concerns now figure so large with the public around the world that the IOC has joined the chorus. Since Sydney's success and the eco-blessing of the Olympic movement, virtually every city planning to bid in the next decade has been visiting Lillehammer to carry out an environmental audit on its own plans. It is plain that henceforth only the Green will inherit the Games. 'We have tried to achieve a third dimension in the Games. Sport and culture are already in the charter and now we want to add the environment,' says Mr Ueland. He is pleased with the positive reaction from both the IOC and the world at large, stressing that there is a new perception of the Olympics to be gained  -as a force for environmental effort in the host city. 'We must never forget that the Olympics are an international gathering of peoples; a unique opportunity to exchange ideas, ideals and understanding between different cultures,' says Mr Ueland. He believes that the IOC will place codified environmental demands upon future Olympic organisers.</p>

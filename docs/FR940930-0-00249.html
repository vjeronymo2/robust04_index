			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  William J. Franks, Jr., Director,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Science Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 96456, Room 3507 South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agriculture Building, Washington, D.C. 20090&hyph;6456.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Telephone (202) 720&hyph;5231.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Executive Order 12866 and Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has determined that this rule is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Budget (OMB).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Effect on Small Entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that this action will not have a significant economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Regulatory Flexibility Act (U.S.C. 601&hyph;612). The fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided for in this rule reflect a minimal change in the costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently borne by those entities which utilize certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory services. The rule is designed to provide usual and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable fees for laboratory testing that are consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs in time and resources to ensure adequate funding of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory operations of the Science Division.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 9, 1993, the agency reorganization of analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing under the Science Division and schedules of laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees were published as a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (58 FR 42408&hyph;42448) after receiving only one comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal. The fee schedules became effective immediately and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were devised to have a single fee for the same test rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessing separate laboratory fees for different commodities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The dairy product laboratory fees for 35 tests or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combinations of tests that were listed in former regulations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 CFR 58.44 were increased by large percentages in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 9, 1993 final rule. As a consequence, the dairy industry indicated that it is burdened with testing fees that cannot be assimilated into current purchasing contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The single test laboratory fees for other commodity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products did not change as significantly as test fees for dairy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. Prior to the final rule implementation, the dairy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing fees had been revised only slightly since November 2, 1977 (42 FR 57301). The heavy volume of laboratory testing of dairy products in the early 1980's associated with Commodity Credit Corporation purchases diminished the need for periodic fee increases. However, the workload for laboratory testing of dairy products was reduced greatly beginning in 1986. In addition, the dairy testing fees were carried over and not revised from 1988 to 1993 while the Agency prepared a consolidated regulation for laboratory services within the Science Division and updated fees. Consequently, when the new fees were placed in effect, the dairy industry faced substantial increases in testing fees. In response to the various objections generated among dairy processors, and after further consideration of the matter, the agency temporarily restored the dairy testing fees to the applicable charges and hourly rate in effect on April 17, 1989. An interim final rule reducing testing fees was published and effective on May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24318). That rule amended 7 CFR parts 58, 91, 93, 94, 95 and 98. It provided a 30-day comment period which ended June 9, 1994. Only one comment was received recommending that the flavor fee be adjusted and made specific to dairy products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

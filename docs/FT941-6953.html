			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / As They Say In Europe: Life is exotic in the modern Sparta 'Why are public services in Britain so bad compared with France?' asked Monique Villa, who runs the London bureau of Agence France Presse. 'Is the difference in taxation so great?' Such is the stuff of debate chez Morgan. (On the agenda was not only a comparative study of systems of public administration, there was also consideration of the development of the Florentine aesthetic and whether British MP's are worse than others at keeping their trousers on.) As a share of gross domestic product, the French government takes 25 per cent more in tax than does the British. Maybe things will change when the British are hit by April's rises. But will Britain's public services be as efficient as France's? Clearly not. That made me think. The efficiency of a public service is judged by the standard of service to the consumer. So British Rail is inferior. So Britain's health service is worse than the French, where waiting times are unknown and hospitals are fully staffed. But in Britain 94 per cent of all health bills are met by the state; in France the figure is 77 per cent, so the French pay extra as 'consumers.' And health spending absorbs a far lower share of national resources in Britain than it does in France. Among the results is a shorter life expectancy for the British - 1 per cent shorter. But maternal death rates are lower. British Rail may seem user-unfriendly but, in terms of exploiting its resources, it is a world leader. Track and rolling-stock use is something foreigners come to marvel at. It has not produced a catastrophe to compare with the computerised booking system for the French high-speed trains. What exists in Britain is a de facto utilitarianism. A basic service is provided at a marvellously low price, in tax terms. This is reflected in comparative UN criteria on the quality of life: Britain ranks only just below France and the Netherlands. What is missing is what Monique saw as those little touches that make people feel better. They do not appear in the utilitarian calculus but they are highly valued by ordinary people. The economic cost of late-running public transport systems, of a six-month wait for a hip replacement, of a shortage of nursery school places, may not be all that great. But full provision in such areas adds to national well-being. Britain is a sort of latter-day Sparta. The government does nothing to make people feel better, British public services are a form of hardship. But in economic terms they are amazingly cost-effective. As I pondered these conclusions, I saw the fifth in a series of articles in Le Monde on Europe's great cities. Last weekend the paper had a go at London. The concern was architecture (I can already feel English readers cringing in anticipation of the steady raining of superior Gallic blows on vulnerable Anglo-Saxon heads.) 'English architecture of the post-war years and up to the 1960s was of a singular quality compared with continental output,' began one paragraph menacingly. Surprisingly, what followed was not a stream of abuse, but an account of how things had improved in recent years. The writers liked Chelsea hospital and the new international terminal at Waterloo station. One observation ran: 'The Thatcher years, having opened the doors to the angels and demons of savage liberalism, everything which smacked of state intervention or of a strong local collectivity was banished.' But British experts stressed that this was always so, London always grew by private initiative. (By comparison Paris was destroyed by Haussmann more than 100 years ago in a grand project which uprooted and destroyed whole communities). The writers were intrigued at the way the government had eventually been forced to intervene in the case of bankrupt Canary Wharf and build a metro link to the beleaguered development to the east of the city. So it is that London offers 'no simple logic but rather an ensemble of minimalist characteristics.' There are no safeguards for zones of architectural interest, only for individual buildings. But on the other hand consultations with the people are 'far more extensive and demanding than on this side of the Channel,' said Le Monde's experts. The title of the piece was 'die-hard eclecticism' which really sums up Britain. Not only London, but the social and physical infrastructure of Britain grows incrementally. No grand projects, just tinkering with the system. France is created from the ground up. It works better, costs more but does it represent a better use of resources? As Monique tells young recruits, for all the above, and other, reasons: 'If you want to see a country that is very near and really exotic, go to England.'

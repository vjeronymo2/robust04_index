			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Outokumpu to raise FM750m by share issue Shares in Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, fell yesterday on news that the Finnish mining and metals group plans to raise about FM750m (Dollars 145m) via an international offering of shares and a warning that there would be a loss in the last four months of this year. This would be alleviated by a gain of FM270m from the sale, completed in October, of its 96 per cent interest in the OM Group, a US speciality chemicals company. In the first eight months a fall in the value of the markka helped the group report a profit of FM133m, a substantial turnround from the FM62m loss for the same months of 1992. Outokumpu now intends to offer 12m new A shares and lead managers, S G Warburg, Merrill Lynch International and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, might lift the total to 14m.</p>

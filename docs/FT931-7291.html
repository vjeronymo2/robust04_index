			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Technology: The quest for Know-How - Claire Gooding continues a series on getting the most out of software by looking at a UK firm's in-house computer system which stores a wealth of expertise There was a time when a solicitor at Linklaters &amp; Paines, the London-based firm of lawyers, would go walkabout, consulting colleagues in a search for knowledge. Now, the partners in the corporate department and their assistants beat a path to one small room. Surrounded by yellow hanging files and piles of paper waiting to be processed, a single terminal opens the door to Know-How. This is the in-house term for a system embracing paper and computerised information which stores a wealth of expertise. Information gained from experience is often the most valuable, but it is also difficult to handle. 'There was a time when the principal sources of information were a walk along the corridor and the partners' lunch room,' recalls Barry Dean, director of training and Know-How. Finding the relevant facts is now easier. Unlike many computerised systems, Know-How provides a swift route to retrieving facts, rulings and opinions. The key to this is that the hard work is done by humans. The people refining the information before its entry into the computer system are as experienced, and in some cases more so, as those posing the questions. The custodian of the terminal has become expert at refining the questions asked so that the computer can search efficiently for the right elements. Know-How's computerisation is based on software called Kinesis Total Recall, which uses powerful formulae to retrieve online information, both historical and contemporary. 'A large part of our work is market-driven. The sort of information our lawyers need can't be encapsulated in published material. As part of what we do is to turn things around quickly and to be up to date, we want to capture the changes as they occur,' says Dean. Some information is comparatively easy to find and available to anyone using Linklaters' library. No full-text retrieval system is likely to make books redundant, nor will the firm ever entirely want to abandon the stroll in search of an expert. Know-How has set out to formulate and make accessible a wealth of internal information. The map references to such information previously existed only in the heads of experienced solicitors. Now, documents are analysed before data entry by experts who predict how they are likely to be of use in the future and encapsulate carefully-coded keywords in the text. Dean refers to the Know-How systems as an 'experience bank', containing information on all forms of client work. 'The first cry is, 'Has anyone done this previously?' It's the identification of the problem that's often the most difficult task,' he says. Jeremy Parr, a solicitor in the corporate department who regularly uses the system, makes it clear the computer is no oracle holding all the answers. 'The role of a lawyer is not just to answer legal questions posed by the client, but to advise whether a proposal is legally viable. The approach should always be, 'What is the right question?'' Julie Mackeonis runs the Corporate Mainstream Know-How System, known as Cormaks. She provides the human link between Cormaks - the first and best-established of the Know-How systems - and its users, dividing her duties between answering queries - between 20 and 30 daily - and various administrative tasks. 'People will come with a broad question. It's a case of narrowing it down, trying to find the right terminology to retrieve the right information,' she says. 'Typically, the information on the system is used to shed light on new situations and interpret them in the light of previous experience,' says Dean. It is the experience factor that is important. The money spent on the computer system pales into insignificance next to the investment in human expertise. Linklaters has appointed 'information principals' whose job is to analyse and index the hard-copy material. In the case of Cormaks, the analyst is Alison James, a qualified lawyer, who now works at home with a terminal linked to the London-based system, a classic example of 'teleworking'. The Know-How index contains letters of advice on previous transactions and situations, opinions of counsel and internal memoranda. It is vital that the people indexing the data and deciding what should go into the system should know as much as the people using it. If James is the architect of the information, Mackeonis, who has no legal training but some City experience, is very much the curator. Her role is to know her way around the system and to filter questions so that only sensible requests are made of the computer. Dave Hall, another information curator who works in the Cormaks room, has become such an expert on the system that he is able to do some of the pre-entry analysis himself. Cormaks is not Linklaters' only Kinesis-based retrieval system. Others serve the regulatory practice dealing with the Financial Services Act and further Know-How services are soon to be converted to the Kinesis software. The human filtering process only takes place for Know-How. Solicitors at Linklaters are used to having a terminal on their desks for referral to precedent documents. Corporate mainstream staff also keep close track of actual stock market transactions. To get the initial Kinesis systems up and running, Know-How has, for the time being, been kept entirely separate from the mainstream computing facilities. Precedent and practice manuals are frequently updated from the current Know-How wisdom. As Parr explains, the system makes available a combination of market practice, past and present and internal experience. However, Parr and Dean repeatedly stress that Know-How is only raw material from which to fashion answers. It cannot take over the 'thinking' part of the job, where the skill is in interpretation. What it can do is to ensure the right raw material is readily accessible. Its other virtue is the ability to provide in-house expertise that is not available elsewhere. The system's effectiveness relies in part on people knowing it exists, and valuing it enough to make voluntary submissions of information. All Linklaters' trainees receive introductory training. When trainees move on to another part of the firm where the computerised Know-How system is not yet operating they miss it badly, a measure of the system's success, says Dean. The benefits of the system are summed up by Parr. 'It makes the job easier, gives me a greater sense of security, enables me to respond more quickly and more helpfully to our clients. In short, it allows us to provide a better, more competitive service to our clients.' Dean has reservations about making the system more sophisticated as he believes neat packaging might discourage hard thinking. 'The documents are indexed in precise and accurate ways for retrieval. Kinesis has enabled us to deliver high-quality information in a way that we couldn't before. In the old days, it was all there in the bulging files, but nobody knew how to get at it.' BUZZWORDS FULL TEXT RETRIEVAL is a database in which an index of every significant word enables the user to make instant and ad hoc searches of gigabytes of data. FTR requires an enormous volume of disk space. TELEWORKING means working at home with a terminal linked to the office.</p>

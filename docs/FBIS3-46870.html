It is one of  our country's international land border gates. Attending the  grand opening ceremony were leading officials from the  Vietnamese provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, and Quang  Nam-Da Nang, and Savannakhet Province in Laos. Also on hand was  the acting Lao consul general in Da Nang.    The upgrade of the Lao Bao-Ban Den Savan border gate to an  international border gate comes in response to the aspirations  of the two peoples, especially the residents of Quang Tri and  Savannkhet Provinces. This move will create many favorable  conditions for communication along Highway 9. The new  international border gate will also play an important role in  promoting economic development based on the advantages of  Highway 9.</p>

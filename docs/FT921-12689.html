			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: AT&amp;T falls 21% in fourth quarter AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph, the largest US long-distance telephone carrier, yesterday reported a 21 per cent fall in its fourth-quarter net profits to Dollars 635m (Pounds 350m), or 48 cents a share, compared with Dollars 809m, or 64 cents, a year ago. However, that drop included a one-time action, knocking 14 cents a share off earnings, to reduce the book value of AT&amp;T's investment in the Italian holding group Compagnie Industriali Riunite. Without that, earnings per share would have been 62 cents. Revenues were little changed at Dollars 11.94bn, against Dollars 11.88bn. All the figures include NCR, the large US computer manufacturer which AT&amp;T acquired last September to give critical mass to its own ailing computer operations. While the recession was blamed for lower product sales, long distance and financial services operations improved. AT&amp;T's sales of products and systems dropped 7 per cent to Dollars 4.4bn. There was a particularly large drop - 19.4 per cent to Dollars 1.08bn - on the computer side, which the company said reflected general industry weakness. However, NCR reported record orders for the quarter, showing customers were enthusiastic about new models it had introduced during the year. Revenues for AT&amp;T's phone service business rose 6 per cent to Dollars 5.3bn, on calling volume up nearly 6.5 per cent. For the full year, AT&amp;T's net income was Dollars 522m, or 40 cents a share, after taking Dollars 4.2bn of restructuring and other charges.</p>

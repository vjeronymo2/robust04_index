			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIANS DIVIDED ON IMPACT OF IRAQI MOVE;  </P> <P> OCCUPIED AREAS: SOME ARABS FEEL THE INVASION DIVERTS ATTENTION FROM THEIR  UPRISING.  </P> <P> The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has caused sharply mixed emotions among  Palestinians in the occupied territories, as well as divisions of opinion over  whether President Saddam Hussein's lightning strike last week will further or  hinder the cause of Palestinian independence.  </P> <P> Some Palestinian leaders feel squeezed by the Iraqi move because it diverts  attention from the Palestinian intifada, or uprising, and it backs up Israeli  warnings against creating a Palestinian state.  </P> <P> But Palestinians are united in criticizing the United States' call for an  economic embargo against Iraq, which they see as hypocritical.  </P> <P> Doud Kuttab, a prominent Palestinian commentator in East Jerusalem, put it this  way: "In four days, President Bush has gained worldwide support against the  Iraqi invasion. But 23 years have elapsed since the Israeli occupation of the  West Bank and Gaza, and Israel still counts on economic and moral support from  the West."  </P> <P> According to Kuttab, the Palestinian masses strongly support Iraq's President  Saddam Hussein, who is widely known by his first name in the Middle East.  </P> <P> "The gut feeling on the street," he said, "is mostly favorable to the invasion.  People had little hope that Kuwait's Sabah family would really help liberate  the Palestinians. To them, Saddam is an Arab patriot -- and a strong one --  willing to use oil as a political weapon.  </P> <P> "At the same time," he said, "intellectuals have mixed feelings: Some worry  that the invasion will only direct attention away from the Palestinian-Israeli  conflict and will justify Israel's procrastination in dealing with the issue."  </P> <P> Saeb Erakat, a professor of political science at An Najah University in Nablus,  said he believes that ordinary Palestinians have been stirred by the sense of  change generated by the Iraqi president.  </P> <P> "People are happy that Saddam has shaken up the Arab world," Erakat said. "The  feeling is that Israel cannot be forced into a peace process unless it is  deterred by political changes in the Arab world."  </P> <P> The Iraqi invasion comes as the 2 1/2-year-old Palestinian uprising appears to  be running out of steam, and with the peace process on hold, according to  Kuttab, "people think this may get the Palestinian issue moving again."  </P> <P> Newspapers that support the Palestine Liberation Organization generally  supported the Iraqi invasion, as did Al Quds, the independent Jerusalem paper.  </P> <P> But other newspapers, and ordinary Palestinians, have begun to express concern  about the 300,000 Palestinians who work in Kuwait -- in the oil fields, in  commerce and in government -- and about the $100 million or more they send home  every year. These people are a major source of support for relatives in the  occupied territories.  </P> <P> Many Palestinians remember the discrimination they experienced in Kuwait, where  they found that even second-generation Palestinians could not obtain  citizenship or residence papers, only working permits.  </P> <P> The Palestinians have no love for the ruling Sabah family of Kuwait. The  Sabahs, they complain, have provided more funds for the rebels in Afghanistan  than for the Palestinian cause.  </P> <P> Palestinian leaders are calling for an early settlement of the situation in  Kuwait. In East Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini, a leading Palestinian activist,  urged "both sides to stop fighting and solve the conflict in a diplomatic way."  </P> <P> Radwan abu Ayyash, president of the Arab Journalists' Assn., said the Iraqi  move has diverted attention from the Palestinian problem and added, "I call on  our Arab brethren to stop all acts of war and seek peaceful means to solve  their conflicts."  </P> <P> Saleh Abdel Jawad, head of the history and political science department at Bir  Zeit University in Ramallah, said the Palestinian position has suffered at the  expense of Israel because of Iraq's action.  </P> <P> "The invasion has resulted in support for Israel's position," he said. "It  showed that the Palestinian position is not the main problem in the Middle  East, and showed Iraq as an aggressor.  </P> <P> "Israel will exploit this invasion in order to consolidate its position. Even  before the invasion, I hinted at the negative impact of (Hussein's) statements  against Israel, which Israel exploited very well. (Hussein) has also created an  uncomfortable situation for the PLO and the Palestinians, at a time when they  don't need to be a party to inter-Arab differences."  </P> <P> Jawad said he is worried about the future of Palestinians working in Kuwait and  the money they send home, since their well-paying jobs could be taken over by  trained Iraqis.  </P> <P> "I think the Palestinians in Kuwait," he said, "will lose this independence,  and their cultural and financial wealth, in favor of the regime in Iraq."  </P></p>

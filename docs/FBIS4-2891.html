			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 14 (XINHUA) -- A total of 26  personnel were killed in today's incident in which two U.S. Army  helicopter were shot down by two U.S. fighter planes in Northern  Iraq, the chief of staff for European Command said.    General Richard Keller told reporters at a hook-up news  briefing in the Defense Department that there were 26 aircrew  and passengers involved in the incident and "we have no reports  of survivors."    "This total includes 15 U.S. personnel, three Turkish  officers, one French officer, two British officers and five  Kurdish passengers," said Keller who is in the European theater  command center where he has been monitoring the events of this  tragedy.    The incident took place at about 35 miles north of Irbil in  Iraq at about 0735 GMT today.    One F-15c aircraft fired one AIM-120 Amraam missile, and the  other F-15c fired one AIM-9 Sidewinder missile downing the two  UH-60 helicopters, Keller said.    He noted that at the time of the incident, the F-15c  aircraft  were conducting a routine patrol of the northern no-fly  exclusion zone.    The U.S. helicopters were mistakenly identified as Iraqi  Hind  helicopters, he added.    "We are in communication with our search and rescue team at  the crash site at the present time," Keller said, "two aircraft  with 26 remains in fact have departed that site" for a Turkish  air base at Diyarbakir tonight.</p>

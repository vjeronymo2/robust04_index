			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: LAS sold to building society FOLLOWING the sale this week of Life Association of Scotland to Britannia Building Society, the average investor must be wondering whether there will soon be any independent life insurance companies left in Britain. The answer, according to industry analysts, is that yes, there will be, but there will be far fewer of them and those that remain will be the industry giants or those which specialise in niche products. With the acquisition, Britannia, which through its branches and estate agencies has roughly 250 outlets, says that it now has the largest retail financial services operation of any UK building society. By all accounts, the acquisition of LAS came not a moment too soon for the Edinburgh-based life insurer, owned for the past 25 years by Internationale Nederlanden. According to data from Standard and Poor's, which now rates the financial strength of life insurance companies, LAS has been facing difficulties. Its so-called free-asset ratio, broadly defined as the excess of assets over liabilities, had fallen to just over 7 per cent at the end of 1991. The minimum excess set by insurance industry regulators is 4 per cent and S &amp; P, in a recent report, noted that the very high costs of acquiring new business were placing further strains on capital. Thus, for policyholders, news of a new parent with capital to inject should be good news. Britannia has declined to say exactly how much it is paying for LAS, but it does intend to inject some Pounds 25m in fresh capital into the new subsidiary over the next two years. How that money will be deployed is not yet clear. If it is used to build up LAS's unit linked businesses, the effects are likely to most help new policyholders who could reap the benefits of lower overheads. Indeed, Britannia cited LAS's unit linked product line as one of the most attractive aspects of acquiring the insurer in the first place. Its existing operations feature so-called with profits policies which smooth investment returns to investors over time. ING had last injected capital into the unit several years earlier in a largely unsuccessful effort to boost sales by developing a direct sales force. John Heaps, chief executive of Britannia, said much of that 'cold-calling' sales force will be relocated to branch offices, cutting the cost of each additional sale.</p>

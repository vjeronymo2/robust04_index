			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Dunedin Income net assets up 10% Net asset value at Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust rose 10 per cent, from 542.2p to 596.5p per share, over the 12 months to January 31. Net revenue amounted to Pounds 6.92m, down from Pounds 7.91m last time, for earnings of 21.75p (24.87p) per share. Directors attributed the decline to dividend cuts in the trust's equity portfolio and lower levels of interest on liquid funds. The final dividend is held at a proposed 17p for a maintained total of 25.4p; the distribution requires a transfer of Pounds 1.16m from reserves.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The House of Councillors on  Wednesday [22 June] passed into law a product liability bill  designed to protect consumers from accidents caused by defective  products.    The law, which will go into effect next June, will be the  first of its kind in Japan.    The law was passed by the powerful House of Representatives  June 15.    In the course of debates in both chambers, a total of 16  appendixes were attached to the bill to ease the burden on  consumers seeking compensation in proving a product is defective.    Under the present system, consumers are required to prove  negligence on the part of producers.    The new law leaves the decision on whether a product is  defective up to the court.    Products covered by the law include medicines such as live  vaccines and blood agents.    Manufacturers must now work out new measures to cope with  future legal action taken by consumers seeking damages and  compensation, industry officials said.    Consumer electronics makers have moved to consolidate and  realign their in-house legal and intellectual property  protection departments, they said.    Similar moves will be taken by pharmaceutical makers, they  said.    The officials said medium and small enterprises have held  seminars to get acquainted with the new law.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose David Guevara M.] </F>   [Text] The same way David confronted Goliath, yesterday,  several of our manufacturers rejected giant Mexico's most recent  proposals to small Costa Rica in an attempt to reach a consensus  on a free trade agreement. That is what producers said when LA  NACION asked them, by telephone, about their position regarding  the Mexican Government's offer on such items as vehicle  exchange, cocoa, candies and marmalades, dairy products, palm  oil, and textiles.    Regarding vehicles, the northern nation asked our  authorities  to allow the sale of vehicles here, which they manufacture, with  hefty tax reductions. This would be Ford, Volkswagen, and  Chrysler vehicles, among others. Alfredo Levi, BMW manager in  Costa Rica, said: "What is good for John must also be good for  Peter." Therefore, he has proposed to the government to design  an equitable formula so importers of vehicles from other nations  are not harmed.    As far as cocoa is concerned, Mexico proposes that only  merchandise produced from Mexican and Costa Rican supplies be  exempt from taxes. According to Belisario Ardon, director of the  Cocoa Marketing Company, this exemption should not be based on  this criteria, rather, it should depend on the nation where the  cacao grain undergoes a substantial transformation.    The northern negotiators also offered to open their borders  to Costa Rica products, like candy and marmalades, which are  manufactured solely with sugar that has the same price as in the  United States. Ardon recommends our government not give into  this demand as this would imply surrendering a significant  differential in value. He noted: "It would be equal to  surrendering our advantage."    Mexico wants dairy products to be excluded from the  agreement. Nevertheless, Jose Pattoni, manager of Dos Pinos  diary, stated this company is very interested in the Mexican  market, specifically to sell liquid milk. He suggests -- in case  this chapter were included in the treaty -- Costa Rica exchanges  "what Mexico does not produce for what we do produce."    Regarding palm oil by-products, Mexico would allow us to  export these with tariffs, which would be eliminated at the end  of five years, on the condition we purchase their soy bean  products with no tariffs. Rudy Venegas, industrial marketing  manager of Numar Company, said it would be fair to implement an  agreement without any type of tariff for both sides.    Rodrigo Arguedas, sales manager of INTEX [expansion  unknown],  categorically rejected Mexico's offer to purchase an initial  quota of 350,000 colones of Costa Rican textiles the first year  the agreement is implemented. He said: "Costa Rica is capable of  exporting 150 million colones worth of textiles every year, but  we could begin with an allotment of 75 million colones."</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> The Craft and Folk Art Museum will be moving down Wilshire Boulevard to take up  rent-free residence at the May Co. while awaiting its new home in a multiuse  complex to be built on the Miracle Mile. The museum will close at its present  location next Friday, opening this fall at the nearby May Co. (at Wilshire  Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue) where it will have about twice as much gallery  space on the store's fourth floor, said museum director Patrick Ela. The new  complex is scheduled to be completed in 1992. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADVICE TO WOMEN ON GETTING FAIR SHARE FROM THE DIVORCE SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> Both "You're Entitled!" and "Getting Your Share" authors lay bare common  mistakes women make, many of them rooted in emotional factors:  </P> <P> * Phone calls made angrily to a husband's family, friends or co-workers may  provide him with information that can be used against her later.  </P> <P> * Talking about finances with a husband during divorce proceedings, or agreeing  to "think about" any offer he makes, increases a woman's vulnerability, says  Sidney DeAngelis. Men think they have driven a wedge between their wife and her  lawyer, he says, and assume they can ignore genuine negotiation attempts.  </P> <P> * Listening to threats that he will bankrupt the business and leave her with  nothing if she doesn't sign a settlement offer can kill a woman's chances of an  equitable agreement forever.  </P> <P> * Dating him during litigation is dangerous, say Lois Brenner and Robert Stein,  since it often leads to the weakening of the woman's confidence and resolve.  </P> <P> * In both books, women are repeatedly cautioned to hold their emotional cards  out of view and are reminded of the likely consequences if they don't. The man  they are divorcing is no longer a friend, the authors stress, and must be  viewed as a business deal gone bad.  </P> <P> A business deal, they add, that has the potential of affecting their lives  negatively for years to come.  </P> <P> Women who read the books shouldn't be too quick to assume that, with the new  tactical information they have been given, they are automatically going to get  their financial due. DeAngelis said that he currently is at work on another  book, this one directed toward men.  </P> <P> "It's called, 'You're Entitled, Too.' " AURORA MACKEY  </P></p>

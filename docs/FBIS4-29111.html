			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Articles in three installments by ASAHI SHIMBUN political </F> reporters; Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Etsuya Saito, Seiki Nemoto: "Hata  Government Heading for Vortex of Realignment"]  [30 Apr 94 p 2]    [Text] "The trend of the times cannot be halted. It has  progressed beyond my expectations."    Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] spoke thus during the selection of a successor to Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. A political upheaval occasionally  moves beyond the expectations of politicians. For Ozawa, who  revolved the stage in a drama of a series of political changes  from the previous prime minister's announcement of resignation  to the inauguration of the new Hata cabinet, the withdrawal by  the SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] and the fall (of the  administration) to a minority ruling coalition were undoubtedly  unexpected evolvements as well.    Ozawa's initial strategy was to link the Hosokawa cabinet's  departure to act 2 of political reorganization. His plan was to  destroy the framework of the "LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]"  versus the "non-LDP" that divided the ruling parties and the  opposition and to marshal together a new political force by  attracting a portion of the LDP and the SDPJ rightwing with  Shinseito and Komeito in the center.  <H5>  Non-LDP Exposes Limmitations </H5>   The framework of the "non-LDP" forming the coalition  administration had already exposed its limitations during the  midpoint of the Hosokawa government.    In February [1994] the people's welfare tax concept  initiated  by Shinseito and Komeito was withdrawn due to opposition by the  SDPJ and Sakigake [Harbinger]. The liberalization of the rice  market and the political reform-related law also faced a  "crisis" because of resistance by the SDPJ Diet members.  Dissatisfaction was expressed by Shinseito that "under the  present coalition framework, a policy evolvement with mobility  is impossible." Meanwhile, the SDPJ also intensified its  distrust of Ozawa et al for their "strongman tactics."    Regarding the selection of Hosokawa's successor, Ozawa tried  his luck at "changing the coalition makeup." Support for former  deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe was  his trump card. His calculation was as follows: The SDPJ splits  over support for Watanabe and its leftwing bolts from the  administration. The gap is filled by deserters from the LDP.    Against this shakeup by Ozawa and his aides, the SDPJ braced  itself to resist by uniting with Sakigake party and a portion of  the DSP [Democratic Social Party] to which the SDPJ drew closer  by its response to the people's welfare tax concept. The moves  in search of a marshaling of "social democratic/liberal" forces  including a portion of the LDP surfaced, and talk of an  "LDP-SDPJ coalition" based on "an eye for an eye, and a tooth  for a tooth" viewpoint was heard within the SDPJ.    The contradictions within the coalition  administration--i.e.,  distortions between combinations of the political parties and  policies, and differences in political methods--suddenly emerged  with Hosokawa's resignation announcement. Each party definitely  sensed the coming of "act 2 of reorganization." However, given  the sudden resignation notice, every party was caught  unprepared. An agreement by the coalition ruling parties to  maintain the coalition framework and unified support for Hata  constituted a kind of "political ceasefire." "The real battle  comes two months from now." This was the view of the executives  of each party.  <H5>  SDPJ Rightwing Also Breaks Away </H5>   However, the formation of the "Kaishin" [Renovation] new  faction in the lower house raised unexpected tremors within the  political circles. As the Shinseito executives admitted that "we  underestimated the SDPJ," Ozawa had apparently never dreamed  that it would result in the SDPJ's secession from the  administration, forcing the Hata administration into the  position of a minority government.    The greatest miscalculation was probably forcing secession  by  the SDPJ rightwing forces that had been the most aggressive  supporters of the coalition. Even General Seceretary Wataru  Kubo, who had taken pains to maintain solidarity with the  coalition parties in the face of attacks from the SDPJ leftwing,  vented his anger at the surprise formation of the new faction by  stating: "There is a limit to my patience."    The leaders of the SDPJ who left the government are already  making contacts with the leaders of the LDP and Sakigake party.  Their mottoes are: "Let us protect the principles of democracy"  and "let us be antifascists." Criticism of Ozawa's tactics thus  continue.  <H5>  Encirclement by LDP-SDPJ </H5>   Contrary to the spliting of both the LDP and the SDPJ  envisioned by Ozawa, an ironic twist is in the making of an  "anti-Shinseito and anti-Komeito encirclement" by the LDP and  SDPJ that have sustained the 1955 political system. However,  major LDP-SDPJ differences concerning the basic policies of  foreign affairs and defense remain, and there is a lack of  realism in their cooperation. Their sole unity may exist in  their joint struggle for an early dissolution of the lower house  and a general election.    There are also serious internal circumstances in the  coalition administration following the SDPJ's separation. There  is fear within Shinseito and Komeito of a decline into a  minority administration, and criticism within the DSP bursting  forth against Chairman Keigo Ouchi who proposed the formation of  the new faction. The Japan New Party is also affected by a  fallout among its members.    With the inauguration of a minority administration resulting  from the SDPJ secession, what is the future direction of  political realignment? Will the formation of a policy-oriented  framework which is seen as a "temporary ceasefire" revive  itself? Without anyone seemingly convinced of it, the  realignment drama moves on to the next act.  <H5>  [1 May 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] LDP President Yohei Kono used the term "tactics"  four times and the term "high-handed" three times in his short  statement. "The high-pressure, high-handed tactics of Shinseito  does not represent the inherent posture of parliamentary  democracy."    It was on the morning of 26 April [1994] when the SDPJ  rejected the newly formed faction "Kaishin" [Rennovation] and  was asked by reporters for its thoughts concerning its secession  from the coalition administration. Although he mentioned no  names, it was clear that Kono's barbs were aimed at Shinseito  General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, the man behind Prime Minister  Hata.    Kono had previously maintained that "what Ozawa has in mind  is only how to retain his position of power." He once warned  Michio Watanabe, who had indicated his desire to join Ozawa in  seeking government rule, saying: "The man you are trying to join  hands with is trying to destroy the LDP."  <H5>  Strong Reaction Against Tactics </H5>   "Pro-Ozawa" or anti-Ozawa?" The axis of the opposition which  caused confusion in the political situation until the  inauguration of the Hata cabinet was, more than anything else,  "Ozawa's tactics and orientation." The sudden formation of the  new faction "Kaishin" among the ruling parties by Ozawa et al  led to the SDPJ's decision to leave the coalition is found in  the tactics rather than in the confrontation over ideas and  policies.    The SDPJ has become an opposition party. The possibility of  an "LDP-SDPJ union" is also mentioned. However, there is no  reason to expect that a "joint struggle" based on reaction  against Ozawa's tactics alone will continue forever. There are  many Dietmen within the LDP who also support the policies  advocated by Ozawa--for example, his debate for a "ordinary  nation" that will welcome international contribution in military  actions. The LDP executive branch has tended in the past to  avoid frontal argument against Ozawa's policy contentions. It  stems from the fear that, if it intrudes, policy distortions  will inevitably surface and could invite the party to split  again in seeking solutions.    "The LDP has remained intact merely as a `ruling party' but  with disparate ideas. After it lost its ruling power, those who  could no longer tolerate the situation slipped away to join the  administration parties. Unless some steps are taken soon, the  party will only weaken."    Thus spoke an executive of the LDP's Mitsuzuka faction in  self-derision while watching LDP deserters form the new party  "Mirai" [Future] and the Liberal Party.    Being anti-Ozawa per se cannot constitute an axis for  reorganization. Ideas and policies that form a "nucleus" are  necessary to create a full-fledged framework. In that context,  it was the aggregation of the "social democratic/liberal" forces  that nebulously took form.  <H5>  Aggregation of Liberals a Difficult Task </H5>   On 27 April [1994] in a room at the National Diet Library,  the following dialogue took place between Hiroyuki Sonoda,  secretary general of Sakigake, and Wataru Kubo, secretary  general of the SDPJ.    [Sonoda] It is risky to join the LDP in its present state.    [Kubo] The SDPJ shares the same view. We prefer to emphasize  cooperation with Sakigake party.    [Sonoda] In order to do so, the SDPJ must change  drastically.    [Kubo] We understand that.    The six ruling parties and the LDP control about 200 seats  respectively in the lower house. In contrast, the SDPJ and  Sakigake together hold only about 90 seats. It sounds good to  say that they hold the casting votes, but one false step could  plunge them into oblivion in a whirl of reorganization. The key  may be said to depend on whether they will be able to use the  experience of the Hosokawa administration as a stepping stone  and set a direction based on `realpolitik.'    The question is whether the "social democrats and liberals"  can display a clear policy on such issues as the direction of  welfare and obligation amid tax system reform and the  relationship between the Constitution and interntional  contribution. Rengo Chairman Yamagishi, who adopts a posture of  support for the SDPJ, have any clear convictions, either. There  is even a possibility that they will simply remain "reactionary"  in opposition to the actions of Ozawa et al.  <H5>  Watanage Is Unconvinced </H5>   "Policies of the LDP and Shinseito are virtually identical.  The shifting alignment of the political parties should have  inherently depended on their policies."    It is reported that Watanabe, who ended up staying within  the  LDP, still gripes about his indeterminate feelings to the  members of his faction.    Watanabe's abandonment of his decision to leave the LDP and  the SDPJ's split from the coalition have further clouded the  direction of political realignment. Political parties and Diet  members must determine their positions before making their next  moves. Will it be the "eradication of distorted policies" or  "pro or con stance vis-a-vis Ozawa's methods?" The tide toward  realignment also involves a quarrel over opposing axes.  <H5>  [2 May 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] It was the forming of a new faction "Kaishin" that  plunged the Hata administration into a minority ruling party.  However, there was a foreshadowing event. Secretary General  Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito had thrust a "dagger" (Komeito  Secretary Geneneral Yuichi Ichikawa) called "policy" in the face  of the SDPJ that heated tensions to the boiling point.    On 18 April [1994] when policy discussions among the  coalition ruling parties faced rough sailing, Ozawa met Hata at  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and told him: "I will do it. We  may become a minority party. We could perhaps become an  opposition party. Is that all right with you?"    The slogans of "political reform" and "non-LDP" that united  the Hosokawa administration faded, and basic policy differences  among the parties can no longer be kept secret. Meanwhile,  Japan-U.S. economic relations and the issue of nuclear weapons  development by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea [North  Korea] are approaching dangerous waters for Japan's diplomacy.  Unless its policies are solidified, the "Hata administration,"  which may be regarded as its final trump card, will soon find  itself a blind alley.  <H5>  All-Out Emphasis on U.S. Relations </H5>   In the policy discussions, Ozawa strongly demanded an  inclusion of specific responses to the Korean Peninsular problem  including "emergency legislation." He refused to compromise on a  hike in the consumption tax rate, giving the continuation of the  tax reduction measure which had become a public half-promise to  the United States as his premise. Providing the backdrop was his  posture of an all-out emphasis on the U.S. relations and  cooperations when he said: "After the Cold war, as long as Japan  keeps relations with the United States as its axis, our tasks  concerning national security and economic policy are clear."    For Ozawa, the policy problems are problems of content as  well as problems of decisionmaking process.    The Hosokawa administration as an "eight-horse carriage"  ranging from the Shinseito to the SDPJ with different  backgrounds has paid a high price for political coordination.  The government's response has been on the defensive, and the  Gulf war experience of being viewed coldly by the international  society flashes through Ozawa's mind. It is not surprising if he  thought that the Hata administration cannot cope unless its mode  of operation is changed 180 degrees and a Shinseito-led  leadership is established.  <H5>  Outlook of a "Ordinary Nation" </H5>   In fact, this also constitutes the heart of the "political  reform" envisioned by Ozawa.    Because of the introduction of the "political  party-oriented"  single-seat constituency system, the LDP-SDPJ "dango" politics  under the 1955 political system and the LDP's "total mainstream  faction" politics will be rejected with power concentrated on  the prime minister and speedier political decisionmaking as  principal aims. The outlook for the future is a Japan that  transcends "one-nation pacifism" and becomes a "ordinary nation"  actively involved in the world in security terms.    Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita explained the  "essense" of LDP politics in a recent lecture. "I highly  evaluate the postwar role played by the SDPJ. In our policy  choices, it would be just right if we implement three years from  now what the SDPJ says."    Meanwhile, in the "Ozawa-style politics," the desire is seen  to realize in a purer form the policies which the LDP was  compelled to advance in increments while paying consideration to  the SDPJ.    The fact that Koji Kakizawa, who was appointed foreign  minister soon after leaving the LDP, immediately advocated a  change in the government's interpretation, contending that "the  exercise of the right of collective defense is not permitted by  the constitution," may be considered as an indication (of  Ozawa's style). The kind of assurance that the 1955 system  offered to the people, for better or worse, does not exist there.  <H5>  Spreading Rumor of a Government Change in June </H5>   However, the SDPJ's split from the coalition immediately  pushed the policy evolvement, which was targeted by Ozawa and  embraced by Prime Minister Hata in terms of its direction, into  a murky zone. In the political circles, a view is rapidly  spreading that the Hata administration will last at best until  the passing of FY94 budget and "a change in government in June"  is publicly rumored.    At a press conference after his inauguration, the prime  minister indicated his strong desire for a breakthrough in  Japan-U.S. relations. However, a powerful administrative base is  indispensable to change the economic structure through a  continuing large-scale tax reduction and deregulation, which are  decisive factors for trade surplus reduction, including a rein  on the bureaucracy. There is also deep apprehension that how far  the prime minister is being seriously considered as the  counterpart in negotiations by the United States, which feels  uneasy about the Hata administration's future.    There is a strong view that the confused political situation  will continue for several months, with hints of a dissolution  and a general election. Meanwhile, there are no signs of  business recovery, improvement of Japan-U.S. relations has  stalled, and the situation in the Korean peninsula is fraught  with tensions.    The price paid by the prime minister and Ozawa is enormous.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN) -- NATO Secretary General Manfred  Woerner has strongly defended the alliance's air strike against  Serb positions near Gorazde. "I cherish the hope that the new  determination that can be seen in the United Nations and in us  will not fail to have the appropriate effect on the Serbs,"  Woerner said on the Cologne private television station RTL on  Monday evening [11 April]. He expressed the expectation that  this would push the peace process on further, "If possible at  the negotiating table."    With regard to Russian criticism, Woerner added that one  could not start hours of consultation in the Security Council  "to realize after days that we should really have taken action,  but it was unfortunately impossible and now the people are  already dead." The current consultation mechanism "should also  satisfy Russian requirements." The NATO secretary general  pointed out that the UN resolution under which the alliance was  acting was "fully supported by Russia."</p>

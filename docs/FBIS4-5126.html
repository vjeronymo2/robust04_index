			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Lubbers: 'Relationship With Jakarta </F> Now Mature'"]    [Text] "The new relationship between the Netherlands and  Indonesia, which is no longer based on development aid, is  better than the one wich existed before 1992." This was stated  by Prime Minister Lubbers in Jakarta last Tuesday, after a  meeting with President Suharto. "A development relation can be  useful at a specific point in time," Lubbers said, "but at a  certain moment, it is better to renounce this relation."    During his talks with Suharto, it became clear to Lubbers  that relations between both countries had become more mature and  better since Indonesia announced in 1992 that it no longer  wanted development aid from the Netherlands. Relations between  both countries are now based rather on various forms of  cooperation which are profitable to both countries.    According to the prime minister, providing development aid  is  a temporary phase in a relationship, which must be abandoned at  a certain moment. He found it an interesting idea that the  Indonesian Government is presently considering to establish  development relations with some African countries. These  countries might, for instance, learn from the way in which  Indonesia handled birth control.    Lubbers also announced that he welcomed the Indonesian  Government's wish that Queen Beatrix would pay a state visit to  the country. The prime minister refused to elaborate on the  question whether such a visit should take place in 1995. During  that year, Indonesia will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of  the proclamation of the independent republic. Netherlands India  veterans claim, however, that the fiftieth anniversary should  not be celebrated before 1999, because the formal transfer of  sovereignty did not occur until 1949.</p>

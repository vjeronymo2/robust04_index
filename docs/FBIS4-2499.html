			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 10 (XINHUA) -- A housing  construction project is now in full swing in north China's  Tianjin city in an effort to let more low-income families move  into better apartments and more than 750 households with housing  difficulty have already moved into new homes since mid-March.    According to an urban housing official, the city government  earmarked 100 million yuan to build a number of living complexes  last year.    These houses were mainly sold at a price rate 30 percent  lower than market prices to urban residents who have an average  living space per capita of less than four square meters.    As part of the project, the design of these apartment  buildings stresses practical, multi-functional living facilities.    This year, another three million square meters of such  housing will be built in urban areas, the official said.    Talking about the rebuilding and repair of old and dangerous  houses, the official said, more than 83,000 homes in Tianjin  have benefited from such projects since the year 1987.    Together with the newly-built apartment houses, the city's  average living space per capita now has jumped to 6.9 square  meters from 3.3 square meters in 1978, although this is still  much lower than the country's urban average.    While focusing on expansion of average living space, the  official said, the city also has made great efforts to improve  the living environment.    Every newly-built living complex or living quarters now is  equipped with fine water, heat and electrical supply facilities,  he said.    Emphasis has also been placed on green land as part of  housing planning. In one living complex with a population of  51,000 residents, for example, the average per capita area of  green space reaches 1.76 square meters.    "We cannot let the common residents March into the 21st  century in shabby and dangerous homes," said city Mayor Zhang  Lichang.    Following the countrywide campaign to improve the living  conditions of low income families, the municipal government also  framed a better-off-housing program last year.    It planned to spend three years or more to build more than  10  million square meters of apartment houses equipped with advanced  living facilities.    And within the coming five or seven years, nearly 10 million  square meters of dangerous and shabby housing in the downtown  area will be replaced by new houses and new financial and  business centers.    At the same time, about 25 million square meters of new  housing would be added, and the average living space would reach  eight square meters, the urban housing official said.    The program has started to take effect. The design work of  four living complexes has already been completed and ground has  been broken for the construction of 1.65 million square meters  of housing this year.    According to the official, an estimated investment in the  better-off-housing project totals about 15 billion yuan.    To attract more funds, both domestic and overseas, the city  government will improve the management of land for housing  construction. And the building materials will be supplied at  government-set prices.    The same preferential policies will be offered to overseas  investors, according to the official.    In 1993, overseas investment in housing construction reached  700 million U.S. dollars.    And the amount the city received in the first two months  this  year topped 500 million U.S. dollars.    According to an urban construction planning official, the  better-off project is a comprehensive one involving the  residents' views on living style, their real income and many  other management problems of urban development.    And Tianjin is ready to take measures to reform the current  housing system and further expand the real estate market in  order to quicken the pace of the housing drive.</p>

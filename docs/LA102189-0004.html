			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTE DAVIS' BIOGRAPHER  </P> <P> Following the death of Bette Davis earlier this month, still another Hollywood  legend was taken from us. Only days later, her biographer and friend, Whitney  Stine, passed away at his home in Palm Springs.  </P> <P> Stine was a walking encyclopedia on Hollywood and was always willing to share  his time and knowledge with anyone who was intrigued enough to pull up a chair.  Fortunately, I was one of those individuals. Listening to him talk about Bette,  Lauren Bacall, Joan Crawford and Tallulah Bankhead, I began to feel I knew them  myself.  </P> <P> His books on Hollywood ("Mother Godamn," "Stars and Star Handlers") and romance  ("Liberty," "Jewel of the Klondike") are richly instilled with both his  adulation and his respect for the film industry.  </P> <P> STEVE WERBLUN, Saugus  </P></p>

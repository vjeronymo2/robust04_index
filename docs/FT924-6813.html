			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Unigate declines to Pounds 42m THE UK recession's impact on the food industry hit Unigate's first-half profits which fell from Pounds 43.3m to Pounds 42m at the pre-tax level. However, the group expects to maintain profits for the full year at about the Pounds 92.9m reported for the fullyear. A slightly lower tax rate meant earnings per share dipped to 12.6p (12.7p). The interim dividend is held at 5.7p. Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive, said he was concerned about the future of the milk industry in the UK. The Milk Marketing Board is to be abolished, and Mr Buckland said that whatever replaced it should not be allowed to become a non-statutory, unregulated, monopoly. Sales were 2.4 per cent higher at Pounds 958.7m but a squeeze on margins cut operating profits to Pounds 39m (Pounds 43.3m). Mr Buckland said that extra advertising and promotion to support the group's brands had cost Pounds 3m in the half. Associated company income rose from Pounds 5.9m to Pounds 7.7m, as the group's stake in Nutricia, the Dutch food business, was increased from 30 to 33 per cent and its profits rose 12 per cent. Interest fell from Pounds 6m to Pounds 4.7m, despite a higher level of debt of Pounds 135.3m (Pounds 129m) at September 30. This is a seasonal peak, and borrowings are expected to fall by the year-end, helped by the receipt of Dollars 75m (Pounds 50m) from the sale of the US cheese business. Operating profits from UK dairy activities fell from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 12.4m. Unigate has given up some supermarket business where prices were too low. Fresh foods, such as cheese and dairy desserts, saw profits down from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 7.3m. The meat companies suffered a drop from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 300,000 as higher pig prices hit the bacon side. The US restaurant chains increased profits from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 8.4m, while the Wincanton distribution side rose from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 7.3m. Vehicle sales profits rose to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 1.7m). COMMENT Unigate's policy of concentrating on its food activities may look odd in a period when its non-food side produced nearly all the growth. But in the longer term it should prove the right strategy so long as new management can improve the margins. Its refusal to supply supermarkets with milk at unprofitable prices is some encouragement, though it assumes that other suppliers will be shaken out. In other areas though, margins have clearly been sacrificed. Assuming Unigate can reach last year's profits, the prospective p/e of 10.5 is still below the market, while the yield on a maintained dividend is just above base rate. The shares are worth hanging on to.</p>

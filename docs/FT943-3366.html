			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Chubb Security sells French lossmaker Chubb Security, the electronic alarm and locks group, has sold its lossmaking French alarm business, Chubb Securite, to its French rival, Ecco Securite, for FrF26m (Pounds 3.2m), writes Richard Wolffe. The sale is part of a long-term strategy to shed unprofitable companies and target markets in east Asia and Australia. Chubb Securite, which had an annual turnover of about FrF60m last year, is understood to have incurred in the region of FrF3m for the year to end-March. Chubb is halfway through a four-year plan to raise its share of the Pounds 7bn world security market from 9.5 to 11.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirna Lozano; from the "Notivision" newscast] </F>   [Text] Brian Atwood, special envoy of the U.S. Secretary of  State, has said his country's economic aid to El Salvador may be  made contingent upon the investigation of illegal armed groups  by the Joint Group. Commenting on the matter, Presidency  Minister Oscar Alfredo Santamaria said it would be a mistake on  the part of the United States to restrict aid to El Salvador.    [Begin Santamaria recording] It must help other countries,  but it seems to me that making this sort of assessment is a  little premature. I think the United States has so much to win  or lose in Latin America it will not establish conditions for  certain actions that someone must carry out. I think that to  continue the U.S. policy on aid or cooperation would be a grave  mistake. [end recording] Santamaria said the U.S. Government  must understand that the work by the Joint Group is based on  confidentiality.    [Begin Santamaria recording] The reference framework stated  it was an investigation based on confidentiality. The commission  cannot divulge a series of breakthroughs or partial results it  may have achieved at some time. Therefore, we must also look at  this from that standpoint. In other words, this is not a matter  of not wanting to report. Instead, the work carried out by this  commission has been in some way protected so that, by  withholding it from the public, they will be spared from any  difficult situation. Consequently, the other thing the U.S.  delegate is referring to .... [pauses] nobody can force anybody.  I already said every country is sovereign. [end recording]  Atwood also said the United States will continue supporting  the country regardless of the government that may be elected in  the next elections. For the presidency minister, the decision  by the Clinton administration on the matter is part of that  country's sovereignty.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Technological Innovation Is the Only </F> Alternative for Japan"]    [Text] The white paper on finance titled, "Financial and  Economic Trends for 1993," issued by the Bank of Japan on 2 June  [1994] provides an easy-to-understand analysis of reasons for  the extended economic sluggishness and provides an outline of  future economic recovery.    Despite having implemented economic stimulous measures  totaling 45 trillion yen in four stages, difficulties have been  encountered in placing the economy back on the road to recovery.  The questions are why and what remedial action is required? The  "white paper" provides an effective response to those questions.    Causes for the protracted recession include stock  adjustments  associated with capital investments, housing investments, and  consumer durables. Further, balance sheets of firms that used  debt to purchase land and buildings at inflated prices during  the bubble economy and of banks that issued such loans have  deteriorated because of the collapse of the bubble. The adverse  effects of such asset deflation are a widely mentioned topic.    An important aspect of the "white paper" is that it lists as  a third factor in the extended recession the structural  adjustment of Japanese industry. The structural adjustments have  been required by a change in the international competitive  environment led by the explosive growth in China's manufacturing  capabilities and rise in U.S. manufacturing productivity.    China, whose labor rates are two percent of those in Japan,  is now becoming the world's factory. Mass production technology  for high-tech products, which was once considered Japan's  specialty, is in the process of being transferred to Asian  nations including China. Such changes are forcing Japanese  industries to undergo structural adjustments calling for  specialization in technology intensive products.    The white paper's analysis stating that the future economic  recovery will be slow in tempo is of a persuasive quality when  one considers the two obstacles of balance sheet adjustments and  structural adjustments. The principal role that government  should play as a matter of policy would be to assist in this  structural adjustment in the private sector and to establish  efficiency in providing government services to minimize the  burdens associated with the pending aging of society.    Viewed historically, effective measures that could be taken  by advanced industrialized nations in competing with rapidly  growing developing nations include devaluation of currencies,  protectionism, and technical innovations. However, lessons  learned during the economic depression of the 1930's rule out  the use of protectionism. Many advanced nations have made  efforts at modest currency devaluations, but the yen continues  to be strong. Moreover, Japan cannot afford to abandon  principles of free trade.    Accordingly, preservation of economic vitality in Japan in  the 21st century will require technical innovation of a  considerable scope.    The core of technical innovation must consist of an  information revolution. The white paper suggests that the key to  structural adjustments is a bold relaxation of government  regulations.    Concurrently, the government must take action to improve  immense inefficiencies associated with administrative services  through the use of information revolution. In March [1994], U.S.  President Clinton announced a plan to reduce the federal work  force by 270,000 in five years. They say that congressional  hearings are held daily on how to combine information and  administrative reforms.    A requirement is the systemic improvement of Japan as a  whole. We must increase efficiency in industrial, social, and  administrative systems and build a new type of welfare state.  Preservation of old systems combined with a shot in the arm will  not solve our problems. We must learn our lessons from a history  of economic failure and high welfare nations where the people  lost incentives to work.    Desirable is that central and regional government employees  deal with restructurings in a manner similar to that undertaken  by the private sector to attain revolutionary improvements in  efficiencies in the area of government services.    Deregulation will represent the core of all required  actions.  Common access to information based on optical fiber networks  will probably provide for significant increases in efficiency.  Administrative reform is not limited to manpower reductions.</p>

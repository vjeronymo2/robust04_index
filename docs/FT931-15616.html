			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Letter: NHS and cost of consultants Sir, I would like to thank Dr Draper ('Look to consultants for NHS efficiency', January 5) for acknowledging the important role of independent hospitals in providing facilities in London. In fact, the King's Fund report acknowledged that the proportion of elective surgery taking place in independent hospitals is at least 33 per cent. At a time when the government is emphasising choice for patients, one in five of London's population is so doing in opting for independent healthcare. Why should Dr Draper wish to restrict consultants' choices? It could be that he raised valid points for discussion; however, could the National Health Service afford to pay consultants the market rate which would more than double the NHS medical consultants' bill? In fact, independent hospitals are subsidising the NHS by allowing consultants to achieve their earnings expectations and significantly contributing to the health of the capital. Barry Hassell, chief executive, Independent Healthcare Association, 22 Little Russell Street, London WC1A 2HT</p>

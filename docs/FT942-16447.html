			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Lift-truck maker Lancer Boss calls in the receivers Lancer Boss Group, one of the UK's biggest privately owned manufacturing companies and the last big UK-owned producer of lift trucks, called in receivers over the weekend. The move was prompted by a disagreement between the company's German unit, Steinbock Boss, and its German banks over expansion plans. The banks withdrew their support for Steinbock, leaving the unit with no option but to go into receivership. Receivers were also called in to the protect the British companies, although Lancer Boss is likely to continue operations if - as expected  - it is sold. The move ends 37 years of control of Lancer Boss by the founding brothers and owners, Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw and Mr Trevor Bowman-Shaw. The probable sale of Lancer Boss is likely to generate intense interest among rival lift-truck manufacturers and could herald a new round of consolidation in the lift-truck industry. Lancer Boss, based in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, has annual sales of about Pounds 180m, 1,200 employees worldwide (including 700 in the UK) and one of the widest and most modern product ranges in the industry. Sir Neville yesterday said: 'I hope the group is welded back together again, although it will be under new ownership.' He said a receiver was appointed for Steinbock Boss after its banking group, led by Bayerische Hypo-Bank, withdrew its support from the Moosburg-based producer which Lancer Boss bought in 1983. Later on Friday, in order to protect the British companies in the Lancer Boss group, Sir Neville asked British banks led by NatWest to appoint a receiver for several British subsidiaries. Mr Allan Griffiths of Grant Thornton has been appointed receiver and, with a team of 20 people, has spent most of the weekend at the company's offices in Leighton Buzzard. Sir Neville is believed to have been planning to link up with a non-German company, possibly Komatsu of Japan. However, the German banks may have wanted Steinbock to link with Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck producer, which is ranked third biggest in the world. Lancer Boss had pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.7m on sales of Pounds 200m in the year ended April 1993, but was expecting to report a big loss for the following year. Mr Griffiths said he had no doubts that Lancer Boss would be sold as a going concern, but he still has to clarify the status of Steinbock Boss's receivership. Lancer Boss is expected to hold a press conference today to outline its position. Let-down for lift-truck, Page 8 Observer, Page 15</p>

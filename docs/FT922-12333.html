			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions Warning Talbot calculated head depth wrong READERS should note that this week's tally of sales and purchases is considerably shorter than the original version. The very high level of sales in particular caused us to raise the dealing size threshold from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 40,000. Nevertheless, the column still provides an accurate reflection of the heavy bias towards selling in the run-up to the general election. Given the result however, next week may well see a sharp reversal in that trend. Kevin McDonald, chairman of Polypipe, sold 4.8m shares at 86p in July last year and was last week prompted to sell a further 1m shares at 113p. Polypipe is one of the few building material companies to have weathered this recession and the share price performance has certainly reflected that. Shares in City Centre Restaurants, owners of the Garfunkels chain, have almost doubled since the dark days of early 1990, but over that period earnings have stood still. Phillip Kaye, the chief executive, has sold 2m shares at 59.5p leaving himself with 6m shares. The sale by Paul Ellis of 1,222,000 shares in Crown Communications arose solely out of personal financial commitments.

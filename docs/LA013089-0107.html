			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> OC: FEW CAN BUY, REALTORS SAY  </P> <P> Only 14% of Orange County families could afford the typical house in December,  down from 16%, according to the California Assn. of Realtors.  </P> <P> The association said a family needed an income of $75,318 to afford a  single-family resale house at the median price of $237,114. The monthly survey  excludes new homes, which are even more expensive, on the average.  </P> <P> Heavy demand pushed housing prices through the roof last year in Southern  California, until even affluent Orange County now has a severe shortage of  affordable housing.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the trade association estimated that slightly more California  families statewide could afford a house in December. That improvement -- 23% of  families compared to 21% in November -- was the first in nearly two years.  </P></p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Elgar's Dream On Sunday at the Barbican The Dream of Gerontius received a welcome dusting-off. Ever since its premiere in 1900, Elgar's masterpiece has been a repeated victim of the 'English Choral Tradition'; many of the finest interpretations have come from outside that tradition and taken a broader view of the music, whose roots are firmly in the mainstream late-Romantic idiom. Few English conductors are better qualified to approach the work from that direction than Colin Davis, who brought vast operatic and symphonic experience to what may well have been his first Gerontius. With a trio of soloists not normally associated with Elgar, and the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus on splendid form, Davis was able to take a 'new' look at the piece. It emerged as a giant symphonic poem for soloists, chorus and orchestra'significant, since Elgar never termed it an 'oratorio'. Davis's approach was clear right from the Prelude, in which some of the orchestral textures took on a surprisingly diaphanous glow. He also revealed a feeling for Elgarian rubato, a barely perceptible give-and-take in tempo rather than the mannered gesture that all too often disturbs the music's flow. He filled in dramatic detail without unsettling the broad sweep of the music. Tempos were generally relaxed, except in the viscerally exciting Demon's Chorus, which for once sounded properly demonic. Elsewhere, the chorus excelled itself with controlled, still singing. All three soloists supplied the almost operatic dimension the composer sought. Thomas Moser was a full-toned Gerontius who, after a slightly tentative start, sounded like Elgar's 'worldly man'. ('I've not filled his part with Church tunes and rubbish but a good, healthy full-blooded romantic, remembered worldliness,' wrote Elgar.) Anthony Michaels-Moore sang eloquently in his two roles, his baritone slightly roughened by a cold but nevertheless imposing. As the Angel, Anne Sofie von Otter - a refined mezzo far removed from what has become the 'gallon-jug' tradition of this music - sang with radiant warmth rather than fervour. This is new territory for von Otter and her voice is perhaps a little light for some of Elgar's thickly-scored climaxes, but throughout her part, and especially in the Angel's Farewell - over which Davis lingered magically - she maintained her poise. The projected Philips recording with Davis and these forces will be a valuable addition to the Gerontius discography.</p>

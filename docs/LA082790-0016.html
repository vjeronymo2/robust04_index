			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Bandit Stops News: WLS-TV in Chicago returned to broadcasting Sunday after  nearly nine hours of dead air caused by the search for a pizzeria bandit who  slipped into the station's building.  </P> <P> It was "business as usual" for the ABC station once it resumed broadcasting at  7 a.m. after three searches of its location failed to locate the gunman,  General Manager Joe Ahern said. The station was evacuated just before  Saturday's 10 p.m. newscast. The gunman, suspected in a robbery Saturday of a  Chicago pizzeria, was fleeing police when he entered the building housing the  studios. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

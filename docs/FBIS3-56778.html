Some 800 meters of the main trunk line were  put out of action, the bridge over the Kura River was destroyed,  and the back-up pipeline was badly damaged. As is known, as a  result of the earlier acts of sabotage, no gas has been pumped  to Armenia since 18 December. Experts believe that it will be a  month before the gas pipeline is back in service, since the  approaches to the damaged area have been mined. The Armenian  side is blaming a subversive group from Azerbaijan for the  sabotage.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ONE GIANT LEAP;  </P> <P> DAN PINTO'S RECOVERY FROM NEAR-FATAL ACCIDENT CULMINATES IN ONE OF TOP JC VAULT  MARKS IN STATE  </P> <P> October, 1987. Dan Pinto drifts in and out of consciousness in the emergency  room at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, his head and back aflame  with pain. In a moment of clarity, he can make out the sorrowful faces peering  down at him. Sisters and brothers he hasn't seen for a while. Other members of  his Granada Hills family. And the face of a stranger, a priest, giving him last  rites.  </P> <P> March, 1989. Pinto stares down the runway during warm-ups for a track meet at  Santa Monica City College. He rolls the shaft of a fiberglass pole in his  hands, then he barrels toward the pit, plants the pole and clears 14 feet. The  vault itself isn't remarkable -- or even better than his high school best --  but to Pinto and those who know him, it confirms a remarkable fact: 18 months  after a devastating accident, Pinto is alive and well and, incredibly, vaulting  again.  </P> <P> "It's pretty amazing he can even walk, let alone pole vault," says Fred De La  Vega, Pinto's track coach at College of the Canyons.  </P> <P> After a drunken driver plowed into Pinto's motorcycle and dragged him 165 feet,  there was doubt whether he would even live. The back of his head was crushed,  his brain was hemorrhaging, his back was broken and his left knee "was  destroyed," Pinto says. During rehabilitation, he says, "Two of my eight  doctors said I wouldn't be able to play any sport again. And they still don't  think it's a good idea."  </P> <P> But Pinto, the youngest of six children, had two things going for him at the  time of the accident: He was young (19 then) and he was in excellent shape  because of a six-hour-a-day training regimen. Like most head-trauma patients,  however, his comeback would be frustrating, painful and measured in agonizing  fractions.  </P> <P> Pinto was driving south on Sepulveda Boulevard returning from the '87  homecoming football game at Alemany High, his alma mater. He was on a new Ninja  1000. "It was so beautiful, and I was so cool, not wearing my helmet," he says  with sarcasm. He pulled into the left-turn lane and stopped to let oncoming  traffic go by so he could turn on Mayall Street. But the driver of the Ford  Bronco behind him kept going and "went right over me," Pinto says. The driver  -- convicted twice previously of drunken driving -- had a blood-alcohol level  that was twice the legal limit, Pinto says.  </P> <P> Pinto spent more than a month in the hospital. His weight dropped from 160  pounds to 125. He had searing headaches and petit mal seizures. He couldn't  sleep. His speech, memory and learning ability were impaired. He was trussed up  in braces "from head to toe" and couldn't walk if he wanted to. His hand-eye  coordination was severely reduced.  </P> <P> "In therapy they had me make these little models that a kid should have been  able to do," Pinto says. "I hated it. It was so frustrating. I couldn't do it.  I couldn't even remember a single-sentence direction."  </P> <P> Six months after the accident, Pinto was discharged from physical therapy and  was able to get around without braces. "They were restrictive, uncomfortable  and embarrassing when people backed up behind you on the stairs," he says.  Nearly a year after the priest performed the last rites, Pinto signed up for  classes at COC despite lingering physical and mental problems. His equilibrium  was affected if he stood up quickly and his memory was still faulty.  </P> <P> "In class, it was hard to get the information from the board to my notebook,"  he says, "but all my professors were very understanding."  </P> <P> Even today -- although he has a 3.2 grade-point average -- thoughts don't flow  spontaneously and he often has to search for the right word in conversations.  </P> <P> "I usually have to think ahead on what to say," he says. "And it takes more  time and patience to study."  </P> <P> During the early days of his recovery, Pinto would often have vivid, surreal  dreams about pole vaulting. It had been his event ever since his freshman year  at Alemany.  </P> <P> "My coaches reeled me in and said 'You're just going to pole vault,' " Pinto  says, referring to Alemany track coaches Randy Smith and Dave Carlson (who  helped coach him at COC this year). In Pinto's junior year, he won the Southern  Section 2-A Division championship with a vault of 14-6.  </P> <P> Despite discouragement from his doctors, Pinto walked into De La Vega's office  last spring and signed up for the track team.  </P> <P> "I knew what he did in high school and I knew about the accident, but I didn't  know the details," De La Vega says. Pinto was purposely evasive about the  severity of his injuries. "I didn't want Fred to mother me," he says.  </P> <P> But once De La Vega found out, "I was really careful with him," he says. Which  upset Pinto. "Fred is an L. A. County fireman and he knows all about the kind  of injuries I had," Pinto says, "so he started mothering me, cutting back on  practice, things like that. We had a conflict but it blew over fast. Fred just  had to let me be me."  </P> <P> Once Pinto began working out at the track, he was surprised at how quickly  everything came back. "It was like riding a bike," he says. But he didn't try  his first vault until the meet in Santa Monica. "I felt good," he says, his  soft voice filled with enthusiasm. "Nothing hurt. I put it up and went over.  It's just in my blood."  </P> <P> How far has he come back? A few weeks ago, he vaulted 15 feet, which was the  fourth best junior college vault in the state this year. Although he didn't  qualify for the state JC championships ("Pole vaulting is a head-trip sport,"  he says, "and I put too much pressure on myself."), he feels he can clear 16  feet by the end of the summer.  </P> <P> De La Vega concurs. "I think he really can," the coach said, "but he's got to  work on two or three mechanical things."  </P> <P> Pinto says that his accident has given him a deeper appreciation and  understanding of life. "Even as bad as I was, I was the most fortunate person  in my head-trauma class," Pinto says. To give something back, he is considering  changing his major from economics to special education.  </P> <P> Pinto, who has been invited to vault for a U. S. team at a meet in Tahiti this  summer, plans to attend a four-year college -- possibly USC or Cal State  Northridge -- and "become an NCAA champion."  </P> <P> Then there's the 1992 Olympics.  </P> <P> "I'll be in my athletic prime then," he says, adding, "I set extremely high  goals for myself."  </P> <P> Anybody else with such large dreams would be considered a cockeyed optimist  but, as Pinto showed in the emergency room, he can't be counted out.  </P></p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Steady Eddie is getting ready: Peter Marsh on runners in the race to head the Bank of England MR EDDIE George is not so much knocking on the door marked 'Governor' at the Bank of England. He is already halfway through picking the lock. Mr George, 53, has been deputy governor since 1990 and has worked for the Bank for 30 years. He has a cast-iron reputation for understanding financial markets and has the trust of many in the government and the City. But while the self-effacing Mr George is probably the front-runner to take over after the retirement of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton next year, his selection is by no means assured. Mr George's lack of charisma may count against him; he is not a fluent public speaker, and dislikes publicity. As an archetypal backroom operator, he has a streak of deviousness  - an attribute highly important in the Bank's approach to financial markets, but which might be less appreciated in the top post. Also, his reputation could be dented by the results of the inquiry by Lord Justice Bingham into last year's Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal. Mr George was a key person at the Bank of England involved in the supervision of BCCI. Any hint in the Bingham report, expected by the summer, that Threadneedle Street was at fault could rebound on him. The chain-smoking Mr George joined the Bank as an economist soon after leaving Cambridge. In between, he had a short spell in Berlin, working for British intelligence. During this period, Mr George learnt fluent Russian  - an ability useful in the Bank's dealings with eastern Europe. While Mr Leigh-Pemberton has a mainly ambassadorial role, Mr George is in charge of the Bank's day-to-day operations. These include advising the Treasury on economic policy, banking and markets supervision, and acting as a semi-official cheerleader for the City. 'Nothing important happens at the Bank without Eddie pulling the strings,' says one insider. Although outsiders may know little about Mr George, inside the Bank he is said to be extremely forceful. A former associate says: 'Eddie is an achiever; he likes to be in control.' Another insider says: 'It's surprising how many Bank decisions are reversed in the quiet of the deputy governor's room.' This non-collegiate approach to decision making is said by some to be a product of Mr George's lack of outside experience. One former government official says of Mr George: 'He is too much of an insider (for the governor's post). You want someone who can come to the Bank with a fresh eye.' Such considerations could tip the decision about the top job towards one of the other contenders. Also expected to be on the shortlist are Sir David Scholey, chairman of the SG Warburg investment bank; Sir David Walker, departing chairman of the Securities and Investments Board; Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of Barclays Bank and former Treasury permanent secretary; and Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank. But where Mr George scores highly is in his preoccupation with controlling inflation. Although this is part of the job of being a central banker, Mr George is 'evangelical' about this point, according to one associate. In the past, this has led to differences of opinion with Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury and another great survivor of UK economic policymaking. In early 1988, when Sir Terry was advising Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, Mr George was an important voice at the Bank urging the Treasury to tighten monetary policy in an effort to reduce the inflationary effects of what became known as the 'Lawson boom'. According to one account, Mr George at the time told Mr Leigh-Pemberton he should resign if Mr Lawson failed to listen to the Bank's strictures. The Treasury did finally tighten policy  - but it was too late for Mr George's liking. When Britain cut interest rates by 1 percentage point when joining the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990  - to capture headlines before the Conservative party conference  - Mr George helped draft a controversial letter sent by the Bank to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister. This argued  - in unusually forceful tones  - that the rate cut would unsettle financial markets. On both these occasions, history has shown that Mr George's instincts were correct. Whether he can meld the qualities he showed then of deftness and intelligence with the more outgoing role which would be required in the governor's job will be a question exercising his fan club in the months ahead.</p>

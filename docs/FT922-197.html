			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Royal Mint puts a price on Europe the Royal Mint has issued 35,000 gold 50p pieces to commemorate Britain's presidency of the European Commission. The gold version costs Pounds 375 and weighs 26.32 grammes. Shoppers will have to make do with a lighter version, in cupro-nickel, the alloy used in the present 50p pieces. Perhaps in an effort to mirror the EC itself, the meaning of the design on the reverse side is less than immediately apparent. Its freelance designer, Ms Mary Milner Dickens, won an international competition to design the coin. Her 50p depicts the 12 EC capitals as stars on a conference table. The criss-crossed lines represent the national interconnections formed by the completion of the single market in 1993. More confusingly, around the table are 12 cubes, intended to represent member states' seats, although some appear to be less firmly under the table than others. 'It was purely to make an interesting design on the face of the heptagon, to make it look good and to fill the space in an interesting way,' Ms Milner Dickens said yesterday. 'I don't expect everyone to like it; they never do.' Mark Wickens, creative head of Wickens Tutt Southgate, the London design agency, said: 'I think it's awful. It's over-complex. There are the stars of Europe and the seats, 24 elements on a coin just one inch high. 'Quite a lot of British coin design is pretty good, there's a classic simplicity that makes the coins look like they are worth the money they represent. With this . . . it's almost lowest common denominator styling. Very bland.'</p>

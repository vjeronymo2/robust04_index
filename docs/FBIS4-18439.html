			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of President Suleyman </F> Demirel]    [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has stated that the  consistent and determined policies of NATO since its  establishment play an important role during the last years  regarding the great, historical changes taking place in Europe.  In a message he issued for the 45th anniversary of the NATO's  establishment, Demirel stated that NATO is still the main  guarantee regarding the security and defense of member countries.    Demirel pointed out that the historical developments of the  last couple of years created an optimism within public opinion  and international political circles that peace and stability  would be achieved in a short time. However, Demirel added, not  before long a sad and realistic picture replaced this optimistic  mood. This sad and realistic picture was created by the threats  to Europe and its environs. These threats included policies  based on annexing territories, ethnic separatism, and clashes  which emerged from minority issues. Demirel indicated that all  the countries are in agreement that NATO, which took significant  steps toward applying itself to these new conditions, will play  an important role in establishing and perpetuating peace and  stability.    Commenting on the NATO-Turkey relations in his message,  Demirel said: Turkey's joining NATO in 1952 was an important  step taken as part of Turkey's national foreign policy since its  establishment. Within this understanding and awareness, Turkey  has become a secure and trustworthy alliance fulfilling -- with  great sacrifices -- the responsibilities stipulated by the  alliance. Turkey always placed solidarity to the alliance in  the foreground. Turkey will continue on the same understanding  and approach.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Labour attacks sell-off profits Profits of nearly Pounds 5m made by two directors of a privatised company were yesterday condemned by the Labour party. The directors of Clydeport, the Glasgow Docks Company, saw their Pounds 75,000 shareholdings soar when the firm applied on Wednesday for admission to the Stock Exchange for flotation next month. Clydeport, which operates the ports of Glasgow, Greenock and Ardrossan and the Hunterston terminal on the Clyde, was privatised in 1992 in a Pounds 26m staff buy-out. The flotation plan brought about 100 employees total profits of Pounds 13m. Placing, Page 24</p>

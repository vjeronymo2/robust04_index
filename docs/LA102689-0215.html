EUROPE AID  </P> <P> Aid to Poland and Hungary will be delayed and perhaps killed by a Republican  attempt to inject capital gains tax reductions into the aid debate, Senate  Majority Leader George J. Mitchell said today.  </P> <P> "Obviously the capital gains issue has nothing to do with aid to Eastern  Europe," the Maine Democrat told the Senate. "Obviously the only effect can be  to delay and perhaps kill aid to Poland and Hungary."  </P> <P> He called the GOP's decision to inject capital gains into the aid debate one of  a series of "unwise and almost baffling" steps that President Bush and the  Republicans have taken.  </P></p>

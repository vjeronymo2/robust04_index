			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Brussels clears aircraft link-up THE European Commission has approved a German-Dutch alliance to build regional and commuter aircraft, 18 months after turning down the proposed Franco-Italian takeover of de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer, in the same sector. The acquisition by Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of 51 per cent of Fokker, the Dutch manufacturer, was assessed on the same basis as the de Havilland decision but posed no competition problems. However, it could open the way for a possible four-way link-up to build regional and commuter jets and turbo-prop aircraft with Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. Both bid unsuccessfully for de Havilland in 1991. That is still the only deal to have been outlawed under the EC's 1990 merger rules. The October 1991 decision caused political uproar in France and Italy. The main argument within the Commission was over the definition of the market for commuter aircraft. But the companies and governments also argued that Europe needed a strong manufacturer if it was to hold its own in the world market. Dasa, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, has invited Aerospatiale and Alenia to take a minority stake in Fokker in due course. A spokesman for the German company admitted yesterday that such a deal would pose much greater competition problems than the Dasa-Fokker link-up. Using the same criteria as in the de Havilland case, the Commission decided the turbo-prop activities of Dasa and Fokker did not overlap. Dasa does not manufacture jets directly, and, although it is part of Airbus, Brussels decided the link would not significantly reduce competition.</p>

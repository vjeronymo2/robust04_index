			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by correspondents S. </F> Kolosova, Igor Porshnev, and others]    [Text] The Duma's Speaker Ivan Rybkin has denounced as  vicious the Baltic governments policy of violating the rights of  ethnic minorities. The formation of states for just one  privileged ethnic group has always involved violence, he said to  a group of Russian journalists who accompanied a Russian  parliamentary delegation on its official tour of Germany June  15-19.    He reported that the issue on human rights in the Baltic  states had been repeatedly raised during the visit. "Russian  lawmakers believe it's inadmissible to connive with the flagrant  violation of the civil rights of ethnic minorities in the Baltic  republics, and the influence of Germany on this matter could be  significant," he remarked.    In his words, although ethnic Russians, in fact, make up the  majority of the populace in such Estonian towns as Kohtla-Jarva,  Narva, and Sillamae, they have no representatives in parliament.  Nor do they have any say in local decision making.    He reported that the German side had voiced some anxiety at  the Russian peace-keepers deployment in Abkhazia and Karabakh.    In his view, there is no reason for trouble since Moscow's  decision was prompted by direct requests from the Georgian,  Armenian, and Armenian legislatures "to disengage the warring  factions. "We cannot stay aside", he stressed.    At the same time, he noted that Russia could control these  states by slashing credits for them. He recalled that at a bill  had been passed to limit credits abroad (the bulk of them to CIS  countries) by 400 million dollars this year. "The figure means  decimated credits. We do not want to finance war even  indirectly," he said.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway's crude output forecast to rise 20% NORWAY's CRUDE oil production could reach 3m barrels a day in 1996 or 1997, a 20 per cent rise over present levels, according to the energy and industry ministry. The minority Labour government's long-term programme sees crude output peaking in 1996 at 2.5m barrels a day. But Mr Gunnar Myrvang, state secretary of the ministry, said according to latest oil company reports, it seemed that level could be achieved by 1994. 'In view of this and because of the potential for improved oil recovery and prolonged plateau production from fields, I would, as an optimist, not be surprised if Norwegian oil production increased to 3m barrels per day in 1996-97,' Mr Myrvang said.</p>

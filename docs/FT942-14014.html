			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / IMF to consider new stand-by credits for Russia The International Monetary Fund, which this week provided a controversial Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) loan for Russia, is preparing to discuss further financing later this year. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF's managing director, said yesterday the Fund expects to begin negotiations to provide Russia with a new stand-by credit after the government in Mos-cow has put forward the main elements of its 1995 budget. In the immediate future, Russia will begin negotiations with western creditor countries in the Paris Club to reschedule its official debt. Russia has borrowings of Dollars 84bn of which 75 per cent is owed to official creditors. Mr Camdessus said a Paris Club agreement, combined with the Dollars 1.5bn IMF loan for Russia that was released this week and loans to be provided by the World Bank, will complete Russia's external financing needs for this year. According to a senior US Treasury official, negotiations on the new IMF stand-by facility could start early in the autumn, while the World Bank should provide more than Dollars 1bn in the 'next couple of months' to finance projects in Russia's energy and financial sectors. At a press conference in Washington yesterday, Mr Camdessus strongly defended the IMF's decision on Wednesday to approve the Dollars 1.5bn loan in support of the Russian government's economic reform and stabilisation programme. He said the Fund had been able to approve the loan because Russia had produced a pragmatic programme it would be able to implement effectively. In particular, there had been a 'spectacular change' in the Russian monetary policy since last July. He said that a few months ago, the IMF had the impression that Russia had no monetary policy, no such thing as a budget and that it was going down the 'dangerous slope' of protectionism. However, Russia now had a 'very tough' monetary policy with very high real interest rates. The central bank had ceased distributing subsidised credits. Institutions were in place to push down inflation, he said. Russia's budget deficit, although still too high, was being cut, Mr Camdessus said. It is expected to fall to 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year from 8 per cent in 1993. The impact of derivatives trading on pushing up long-term interest rates will be discussed by finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries on Sunday, a senior US Treasury official said yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Banking Superintendent Gustavo Roosen by </F> Carlos Croes; place and date not given]    [Text] Many people asked me what was Gustavo Roosen's role  as the president of the Republic's "super commissioner" for  financial problems. I decided to ask Gustavo Roosen directly.  This was how the interview developed.    [Croes] What has happened?    [Roosen] We thought that with peace in this large area, the  others would ease up a bit, but this has not been the case. It  did not work out this way. The situation has become very  complicated. I hope my familiarity with the financial sector and  the relations I developed as president of the Central Bank of  Venezuela will allow me to find an agreement that will change  our current image, which has been nefarious to the confidence of  account holders and users of the intermediation system. This  situation has led us to figures of such magnitude that it really  should worry all Venezuelans.    [Croes] What is your role?    [Roosen] Look, basically, I would say I am a facilitator.  The  moment one thinks one has a task that is different from other  government institutions, one is condemned to failure. There are  four government tasks that have to prevail in time and two of  them have been bolstered in the recent Bank Law: the General  Bank Superintendency and Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking  Protection Fund]. I would say the first point of agreement has  to be with all sectors, including the financial ones in this  case, to strengthen the government's supervisory ability, which  has been the true cause of this problem. The second is a  thorough reorganization of Fogade to allow it to capitalize  appropriately, justify its accounts with the Central Bank, and  balance those accounts in the public deficit.    [Croes] What does this reorganization imply?    [Roosen] The Public Credit Law has not been implemented. All  the subsidies have been awarded through advances on future bank  contributions. The Public Credit Law has to be implemented for  Fogade to capitalize efficiently and for those documents to be  placed in the banking sector. Those Fogade documents [words  indistinct] in the system, will attenuate the impact of the  advances made on the Central Bank where they appear as insolvent  balances accruing interest. Fogade's financial structure now has  to be reorganized with the help of experts and with a bit of  backing by this superintendency. I also hope other Venezuelans  of goodwill will help. In addition, the rest of the banking  sector must lend its support by providing top-notch executives  that will allow us to harmonize the administrative councils of  the banks that are being subsidized. The reports on the  distressed banks, which are to be issued by those councils, will  determine if they are to be reorganized or liquidated. Up to now  the group of people who have been helping in the Banco Latino  case have dedicated entire days, the Holy Week holidays, and  more to this endeavor. We have to strengthen this work with  people from other banks as this will give the group a much more  heterogeneous character.    [Croes] Now from the information that you have, do you think  there are banks in this group that can recover?    [Roosen] I don't know because the information I have is very  contradictory. From Fogade I received a report in the evening,  and we were discussing these things at Miraflores. It is  presumed these banks still maintain more or less 40 percent of  their base of deposits. We believe this is not even true, based  on comments in hallways, cocktail parties, and funerals, which  is where people learn about things in Venezuela, but there is no  accurate information. Therefore, any speculation on my part  would be inappropriate.    [Croes] Don't the papers they have given to Fogade to  support  those contributions have important economic backing?    [Roosen] I cannot evaluate a situation based on assumptions.  I am under the impression they have given out so many papers,  they must be delivering papers that do not have a partial value  of 100 percent. I personally think--my intuition tells me--I do  not know today that the level of subsidies is such a number and,  therefore, the disbursement of the portfolio should be so much.  Already the loan portfolio that is most difficult to recover  must be disbursed to Fogade as a guarantee. Thus, those holdings  cannot have the same value as "top loan portfolios" ["lomito"].  By now, it must have different kinds of portfolios and that, of  course, represents in the end a problem those banks will have to  account for in their reorganization processes. Now, if the  reorganization shows there is a possibility the bank will float,  that it can be effectively managed, well, let us hope for this.  However, I am afraid some of them will not have....    [Croes] What is the solidarity agreement?    [Roosen] It is a solidarity agreement on the financial issue  particularly. It must determine the support bases required from  the rest of the banks; the intermediation mechanisms that could  be used to replace the zero-coupon bond, totally or partially.  What kind of cooperation will be asked from the rest of the  banking sector in terms of human resources; what type of  structure must we implement to organize Fogade financially; what  kind of foreign support must we seek to give meaning to the  spirit, purpose, and objective of the Bank Law regarding the  supervision or autonomy capacity of the Superintendency. These  would be needed bases to achieve consensus that could make  progress tomorrow in a meeting with a group of bankers. This  could perhaps crystallize Sunday in some kind of agreement  establishing the intention to make specific things, restoring  confidence, and ending this pattern that led us to a crisis.    [Croes] What specific things, for instance?    [Roosen] In addition to the reorganization of Fogade and the  Superintendency, those specific things are the on-loan transfer  of top-notch executives to create administrative boards at the  assisted banks, the search for alternatives such as treasury  bills to sell financial surpluses, the objective discussion of  interest rates, the current margin of intermediation and how to  tackle them. Others are the level of delinquent loan portfolios  that may exist in a bank, in all banks, and what are the  possible solutions. These should be the basis of the agreement  to deal with the situation we are faced with today.    [Croes] Those banks have, in fact, undergone intervention.    [Roosen] Those banks, if you will, have been nationalized.  They have not undergone intervention because, Carlos, that is a  very specific legal word.    [Croes] Of course. They have been nationalized. However, the  question I keep asking myself is if all of these banks are  salvageable or if all of them are liquid? What are we going to  do about this...are we going to continue spending money?    [Roosen] I cannot give you an opinion on something of which  I  am not aware. I am under the impression, if my intuition is  accurate, that some of the banks might be salvageable through  mergers, some of them may have critical assets of their own to  survive and others may have no other alternative but liquidation.    [Croes] What is your perception of the system's situation in  general?    [Roosen] My perception is that it is lethargic; on the one  hand, you have subsidies [auxilios] and on the other, the zero  coupon bonds, which have eliminated financial intermediation in  the country.    [Croes] But what would the banks do without the zero coupon  bonds?    [Roosen] I would prefer at any given time to seek a  concerted  effort regarding the issuance of treasury bonds that would give  the state the liquidity to undertake public projects or pay  debts so the economy will begin to move again, instead of  uselessly sterilizing money at a rate of 54 percent at the  Central Bank.    [Croes] Is that not what is currently saving those banks  that  are totally inactive because of the productive apparatus's  recession?    [Roosen] Suppose for a minute that you could update all of  the treasury bonds, which have fallen behind and that the banks  agree to purchase the treasury bonds as a mechanism for  placement of their excess cash; the treasury bonds are intended  to foster investment or public spending, right? While the zero  coupon bonds are intended by definition for sterilization at the  Central Bank and will serve no purpose at all.    [Croes] This means you would replace the zero coupon bonds  with the treasury bonds?    [Roosen] That is one example.    [Croes] Is the atmosphere within the government appropriate  for that plan?    [Roosen] I believe so.    [Croes] Does the post of commissioner entail special duties?  Are they established in any decree?    [Roosen] They are not established. I told you at the  beginning of our conversation that in my opinion the  commissioner should be a person who will facilitate the unity of  the four state institutions that are in charge of financial  matters, who will have a nonfinancial, nonbanker view of the  interior of the financial institutions, who will attempt to  achieve certain basic agreements...a course of action to regain  confidence in the system.    [Croes] How is Banco Latino doing?    [Roosen] Very well. Truly very well. The final great test  came on 20 April when, as you may recall, we opened the Liquid  Assets Fund in which we had 147 billion bolivares in deposits  and from which we expected a considerable flight of money  prompted by uncertainty. Contrary to international experience,  however, that was not the case. People came in to renew their  accounts, they closed some of them, but the following day's  compensation rates were quite modest compared to the withdrawals  we expected.    [Croes] Have withdrawals by people who had less than 10  million bolivares stopped?    [Roosen] That situation has totally normalized.    [Croes] What percentage of the deposits remains?    [Roosen] I cannot say exactly, but it is very high. I had  even said publicly that international experience shows that up  to 40 percent of the deposits would be lost. I do not have our  figures but I would say that very little of the deposits were  lost.    [Croes] When one sees, for example, a document from the  General Bank Superintendency which states that there are  subsidized banks that have lost 14 times their capital...how can  a bank like that be saved?    [Roosen] No. I do not see how their current shareholders can  believe so...unless these gentlemen are willing to bring in 14  times their capital and reincorporate it here. I am looking at  this from the viewpoint of something similar to what the Banking  Superintendency did; the state takes over the losses, saves the  shares that can be recovered, and then sells them.    [Croes] It would take the place of all the shareholders?    [Roosen] Of course, from my viewpoint that is an obvious  condition.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Recession blamed for decline at Goode Durrant GOODE DURRANT, the mini-conglomerate with interests in van hire, property and motor dealerships, reported a 32 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.8m in the half year to October 31. Turnover fell from Pounds 97.8m to Pounds 90.6m. Northgate, the group's commercial vehicle hire business, was the only UK operation to improve its performance, contributing a fifth of sales, but 79 per cent of operating profits. Earnings per share were 2.3p (3.5p). The interim dividend is maintained at 2.15p. Mr Michael Waring, chief executive, said the depth of the recession took its toll on the equipment hire, property, and motor distribution divisions. GDM Finance, the South African trading finance subsidiary, improved profits despite difficult local conditions. There were signs of improving economic activity in the UK - from larger numbers of customers in car showrooms to now-steady levels of van and equipment hire, and the group's successful sale of a small office block in Blackburn in December - but they were 'too tentative' to have much effect on the results. The group continued to focus on 'liquid asset management' and was addressing ways of moving out of the property business. Last year saw a Pounds 6.27m exceptional provision for property and land-bank write-downs, which tipped the group into the red. Mr Graham Perrins, a director of Winnedeal, the South African company owned by the Nash family which has a 25 per cent hostile stake in the group, said the results were disappointing. The group was paying the price for expensive acquisitions in the past, which had led to large goodwill write-offs. Winnedeal would like to see management take a 'more pro-active' approach to restructuring the business.</p>

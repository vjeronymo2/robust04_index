			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRYING TO HOLD THE HIGH GROUND;  </P> <P> HOMES IMPERIL LAGUNA KNOLL  </P> <P> For generations of residents, the highest knoll overlooking Laguna Beach has  offered breathtaking views of the city below, the Saddleback Valley and  mountains, and the sunset behind Santa Catalina Island.  </P> <P> But that may change.  </P> <P> If development plans proceed, a 7-acre mound of the highest peak in Laguna will  be flattened to make way for houses.  </P> <P> The knoll, 1,031 feet above sea level, is scheduled for grading within the next  2 months to make room for 36 tract homes planned by M.J. Brock &amp; Sons Inc.  The Laguna Hills company bought the land in 1987 for $3 million from the Laguna  Beach Unified School District.  </P> <P> Although plans for grading and construction have been approved by the City  Council, the Planning Commission and the California Coastal Commission, nearby  residents are putting up a fight.  </P> <P> "My kids used to play up there," said Tallie Parrish, who spent 20 years  raising her three children in the area. "They made roads for their little  Matchbox toys and then when it rained, they went up there and rolled in the  mud. It was great fun for them. For everyone."  </P> <P> Said Carolyn Wood, who has lived a few blocks from the knoll for 22 years:  "Losing the knoll means losing the spirit of Laguna Beach. It's one of the main  attributes that makes Laguna Beach and living up here special."  </P> <P> The knoll sits above the Top of the World neighborhood and the larger  development of Laguna Heights, and is encircled by Alta Laguna Boulevard and  Tyrol Drive. The mound is dotted with jagged rocks and small craters created by  years of erosion.  </P> <P> About two dozen residents who oppose the grading formed the Top of Laguna  Conservancy -- also known as TLC for the Environment -- last December in an  effort to save the knoll. The group has already filed two lawsuits challenging  the Coastal Commission's approval of a tract map for the site and is  considering a suit to overturn the City Council's approval, spokesman Wayne  Ybarra said.  </P> <P> With support from several environmental organizations in the city such as the  Laguna Greenbelt, the Laguna Canyon Conservancy and Village Laguna, the  </P> <P> group hopes to stall the grading process and persuade the developer to consider  alternatives.  </P> <P> "We're trying to get a better project for the land," Ybarra said. "Less grading  -- to the extent of preserving the knoll -- fewer home sites and custom homes.  </P> <P> "The issue of the knoll is more than just a neighborhood issue, it's citywide;  lots of people in the city use the knoll and the property around it," he said.  Nearly 25,000 people live in the city.  </P> <P> The school district sold the property to raise money to renovate its four  schools, Supt. Dennis M. Smith said.  </P> <P> Smith said that to make up for a revenue decline caused by a drop in school  enrollment, the district decided in 1981 to sell 20 acres of land that includes  the knoll. The district drafted a tentative tract map that called for  dedicating 13 acres to the city for a public park and subdividing the remaining  7 acres into 36 home sites. The plan was approved by the city's Planning  Commission in 1985, and M.J. Brock bought the land in 1987. The City Council  added its final approval of the plan last November.  </P> <P> Only late last year did residents realize that the knoll would be lost, Ybarra  said, when the developer told the council how much grading would be necessary  and that the dirt would be spread near the rim of a nearby canyon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Flat as a Pancake'  </P> <P> "At the time the city was first reviewing the tract map there was not an  awareness by people of the damage to the knoll," he said. "We thought the  houses would be built around the knoll, but to chop it off and make it as flat  as a pancake, we didn't know that."  </P> <P> Some residents argue that dumping the leftover soil in the canyon will destroy  its natural state. But City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said the canyon slope will  be reshaped and replanted.  </P> <P> Les Thomas, a division manager for M.J. Brock, said that after the knoll is  graded it will stand at 1,013 above sea level and about 20 feet above Alta  Laguna Boulevard. Thomas said the company is also planning to erect an  "alternative knoll" in the city's designated park site to try to maintain part  of the view. The new area will continue to be the highest point in the city, at  1,015 feet above sea level.  </P> <P> "At this juncture, the (housing development) project has been approved for a  few years now," Thomas said.  </P> <P> "I understand that residents in the area have disagreements about the property  and we're trying to work with their suggestions," Thomas said. "But the  construction for the houses will begin," he said.  </P> <P> Ybarra said TLC members would be willing to talk with M.J. Brock officials  about ways to improve the existing development plan. "There's room for  improvement and working together," he said. "Any minor change could help the  knoll and the area for the better."  </P> <P> One of the group's plans is to have custom homes built on the land -- instead  of tract homes -- so the city can retain its unique architecture and style.  "Tract homes would rob the city of its character," he said. "If anything, leave  us with that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prices Still to Be Set  </P> <P> Thomas said M.J. Brock officials plan to integrate some custom homes into the  development, but are uncertain if all 36 homes will be custom built. He said  sales prices are yet to be determined, and he declined to estimate what a  typical house would cost. The company has not received approval for its housing  designs from the city's design review board and will not begin construction  until approval is received, he said. However, he added that the plans for  construction and grading are final.  </P> <P> Mayor Robert F. Gentry said that council members wanted to preserve the open  space but decided that development of the knoll was necessary.  </P> <P> "The sale had to go through for the school district to improve its schools,"  Gentry said. "We have to think of the students as well as the land."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCR DIRECTOR SAYS ARTS IN COUNTY NEED UNIFIED VOICE  </P> <P> Recent controversies in Costa Mesa over artistic freedom were aggravated by the  lack of a countywide arts organization, David Emmes, producing-artistic  director of Costa Mesa's Tony award-winning South Coast Repertory theater, said  here Saturday.  </P> <P> The absence of a countywide arts council, which would give a stronger, unified  voice to the local arts community, contributed to "a lack of understanding"  among Costa Mesa city officials last July when they approved hotly contested  arts-grant restrictions, said Emmes, speaking on a panel at a meeting of arts  leaders from throughout the state.  </P> <P> "Looking ahead, we must be very active in communicating on a local level about  the importance of the arts and why we do what we do," Emmes said.  </P> <P> Saturday's panel, titled "The Fight for Freedom of Expression," was held at the  Biltmore Hotel as part of the annual convention of the California Confederation  of the Arts, the state's largest arts advocacy organization. About 100 people  attended the discussion, opened by choreographer Bella Lewitzky, head of the  Los Angeles modern dance company that bears her name.  </P> <P> "The battle (for freedom of expression) is never won and one that may never  rest," said Lewitzky, who has sued the National Endowment for the Arts over its  requirement that recipients of 1990 grants pledge not to create or present  obscene artworks.  </P> <P> SCR, a recipient of Costa Mesa arts subsidies, was pushed into the nationwide  furor over public arts funding when a Costa Mesa resident charged that the  troupe had used city funds to distribute flyers urging support of the NEA,  under fire by conservatives for funding allegedly obscene or sacrilegious  works.  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa City Council found that no city money had been used to produce  the flyers, but nonetheless imposed grant restrictions, forbidding the use of  city money for obscene works, as well as for religious or political activity.  Arts experts say they are unaware of any other city or county in the country  that enacted similar restrictions as a result of the NEA debate. The national  controversy over arts funding is expected to continue in light of recent  legislation that bars NEA support of work that violates "general standards of  decency."  </P> <P> Hoping to strengthen and centralize the local arts community, Orange County  arts officials have been working to form a countywide arts council. They  suffered a setback earlier this year after the Orange County Board of  Supervisors virtually shut the door on any substantial funding for such an  alliance.  </P> <P> A somewhat similar coalition in Long Beach, the 8-year-old Public Corporation  for the Arts, has long been active in the sort of public awareness efforts that  Emmes advocated through an Orange County arts council, said panelist Cynthia  MacMullin, director of the FHP Hippodrome Gallery in Long Beach.  </P> <P> "We've solicited the support of the (Long Beach) City Council and it has been  very supportive in the NEA battle," MacMullin said.  </P> <P> Panelist Bruce W. Davis said that the Arts Democratic Club in San Francisco has  gained local politicians' support. In the last election, four out of five  supervisors endorsed by the club were elected, said Davis, club vice president,  as were all of the three school board members. In addition, "every single  person up for judicial posts and the college board had to come for our  endorsement," he said.  </P> <P> "The power of the arts to move society, to move people, frightens politicians  -- it scares them," Davis said.  </P> <P> Panelist Jane Sharp, a board member of the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse, admitted  that playhouse officials had been "extremely naive" to stage the satiric play  "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All To You" shortly after imposition of the  Costa Mesa arts-grant restrictions.  </P> <P> Christopher Durang's caustic satire, labeled as "anti-Christian bigotry" by  local residents, reignited the city's arts-funding flap and offered the first  test of the new Costa Mesa grant policy. The playhouse, a community theater run  mostly by volunteers, also receives city funding.  </P> <P> "It's no pleasure to admit we were stupid enough not to know we'd cause such a  ruckus," Sharp said after the meeting. She stressed that she spoke as an  individual, not for the playhouse board which did not have enough time to  prepare a statement because it had been invited only Tuesday to speak.  </P></p>

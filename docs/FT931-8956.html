			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Southern Electric in flexible work deal SOUTHERN Electric, the privately-owned utility, yesterday agreed a flexible working pattern with its 5,000 employees which it believes is the first of its kind among the main UK utilities. Mr Henry Casley, chief executive, said the agreement 'broke the mould of 40 years of traditional nationalised industry thinking' with the help of the 'positive and constructive attitude of the staff and the trade unions'. The five unions, in return for a 2.9 per cent pay rise and one-off lump sum payments averaging Pounds 200, have accepted the phased introduction of a six-day working week over the next 18 months and a big reduction in voluntary overtime which costs the company Pounds 10m a year. The deal is expected to set an example for other privately-owned utilities and follows the end of national pay bargaining which covered the electricity supply industry for 40 years. The company said the deal would increase productivity by as much as 25 per cent. It would help to produce annual pay savings of at least Pounds 15m by the mid-1990s. Mr John Peach, area negotiator for the Electrical section of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said it was a 'tough' agreement and he was 'not ecstatic about it', but at a time of recession it was acceptable. The workers accepted the deal in a secret ballot by 58 per cent for to 42 per cent against. Mr Peach stressed the company had promised job security and no compulsory redundancies. At present workers work a 37-hour week from Monday to Friday over an 8am to 5pm working day, with voluntary overtime. Their new 37-hour week will be applied flexibly over a 12-hour working day from 8am to 8pm Monday to Friday and 8am to 5pm on Saturdays. Premium payments will continue for work outside those hours and on Sundays. All restrictive practices and demarcation lines are to be abolished and the number of grades cut from 29 to 11.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Western Mining findsnew gold deposit Western Mining Corporation, one of Australia's largest mining groups, said yesterday it had discovered a gold deposit in the vicinity of its Kambalda/St Ives nickel-gold operation in Western Australia. The deposit, named Redoubtable, lies beneath shallow lake sediments on Lake Lefroy at Kambalda. WMC said the deposit was modest. Evaluation drilling was under way. However, the Melbourne-based company added that the potential existed for an open-pit resource of about 1m tonnes, at a grade of four grams per tonne. Mr John Ralph, chief executive of CRA, the Australian mining group in which RTZ of the UK holds a 49 per cent stake, is to retire on June 24 - four months earlier than announced. CRA has outlined succession plans. Mr Leon Davis, CRA's mining director, takes over as chief executive. Mr Ralph will become a non-executive director and deputy chairman. Mr Ralph's retirement 'follows review and discussion to ensure there will be no negative effect on the company'.</p>

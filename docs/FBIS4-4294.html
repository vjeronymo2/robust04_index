			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Cai Cheng, vice chairman of the National </F> People's Congress Law Committee, conducted by unidentified  reporter on 26 April; place not given: from the "Report on  Current Events" program]    [Text] Dear listeners and friends:    China has always attached great importance to the protection  of intellectual property rights [IPR]. It has now established  an effective protective network following more than a decade of  hard work in reform and opening up. In an interview with a  reporter on 26 April, Cai Cheng, vice chairman of the National  People's Congress Law Committee, revealed that China will soon  formulate specific provisions to punish copyright infringement  crimes, in order to further curb and punish acts which infringe  intellectual property rights.    He said: China will strengthen intellectual property rights  protection in external economic and technological trade  activities. It will focus on formulating laws and regulations  that stipulate border-control measures on products which  infringe such rights, and enhance the customs authorities'  functions in protecting intellectual property rights and  stopping rights-infringement products from leaving the country.  Regarding law enforcement, China will soon give prominence to  and consolidate law enforcement forces at all levels that are  involved in copyright protection, so as to guarantee the  effective enforcement of copyright laws.    He said: Intellectual property rights administrative and  law-enforcement organizations may jointly investigate and handle  major and important cases with science and technology, economic,  cultural, public security, and industrial and commercial  departments. Since August 1993, Beijing Municipality, Shanghai  Municipality, Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen city have  successively established judicial courts for intellectual  property rights. Cities such as Guangzhou, Zhuhai, and Shantou  are also making plans to establish similar courts which  specialize in trying intellectual property rights cases.  Recently, seven departments, including the CPC Central  Committee Propaganda Department, State Planning Commission, and  the State Administration for Industry and Commerce issued a  joint document urging quality control over compact discs and  laser discs, as well as strict investigation and handling of  copyright piracy cases.    Cai Cheng stressed: China will vigorously strengthen  supervision and inspection over law enforcement on intellectual  property rights. It will plan nonperiodic joint inspections by  relevant departments on progress made by all localities and  departments in enforcing intellectual property rights laws,  focus on inspecting major rights-infringement cases, and  exercise supervision over and solve problems arising from  failure of certain localities to strictly enforce laws, and mete  out stern punishment for rights-infringing acts.    He said: The state will fully bring into play non-government  forces such as associations related to science and technology,  and economic and cultural fields, as well as special social  groups and socialized service organizations that are involved in  intellectual property rights. It will guide them toward  launching all kinds of legal consultations and services on  intellectual property rights. At the same time, the state will  also establish a group of organizations to provide legal  services related to intellectual property rights, in order to  help parties concerned investigate and collect evidence against  rights-infringement acts, and to help settle rights-infringement  disputes through legal means. It will turn these organizations  into capable assistants of law enforcement agencies in  intellectual property rights protection.    Citing examples, he said: Acting on behalf of the British  (?Hezzelin Snow) Company this March, Beijing (?Zhongcheng)  Intellectual Property Rights Protection Company, China's first  and only civilian-operated intellectual property rights  protection company, extensively investigated and collected  evidence against a certain chemical product factory in Chaoyang  city -- which falls under the jurisdiction of Shenzhen -- in  Guangdong Province for producing imitation (?Hezzelin Snow)  soap, and reported the relevant situation to the local public  security organ. The factory was instantly closed down, and  (?Hezzelin Snow) was prevented from suffering major economic  losses. The Beijing company won praise from the British company.    Cai Cheng said: China put in place an intellectual property  rights system not long ago. As such, different degrees of  intellectual property rights infringement will exist. However,  China is earnest and serious about intellectual property rights  protection. China has established a relatively intact legal  system. It has also joined international organizations and  treaties such as the World Intellectual Property Organization,  Paris Convention on Protection of Industrial Property, Madrid  Agreement Concerning International Registration of Trademarks,  and Berne Convention on Protection of Literary and Artistic  Works.</p>

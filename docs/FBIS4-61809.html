			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, 7 May, BNS -- A deepening tendency to  arm-twisting and attempts to implement the "near abroad" concept  are becoming apparent in Russia, Deputy Chancellor of the  Estonian Foreign Ministry Raul Malk said in a comment on the  statement Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev made on Friday  [6 May].    Grachev told reporters in Moscow Friday that 2,500 Russian  troops will remain in Estonia until the problem of Russian  military retirees is solved. The minister also declared Russia  may bring additional troops into the Baltic country to defend  its military facilities there.    In Malk's opinion, Grachev's statement clearly conflicts  with  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the  United Nations documents about the withdrawal of Russian troops  from the Baltic states.    "Grachev's statement is a direct challenge to the authority  of international requirements. By threatening Estonia with  stopping the troop pullout and bringing in more military, the  Russian defense minister verified Moscow's strengthening  attempts to force its will on other states and international  organizations," Malk told BNS.    Malk attached great importance to Grachev's timing of his  remarks to coincide with the 19th round of Estonian-Russian  troop withdrawal talks.    "It can be regarded as an attempt on Russia's part to  pressurize Estonia to make concessions. On the other hand, the  statement of the Russian defense minister can be considered as  giving up ironing out problems through negotiation," Malk said.    The Foreign Ministry deputy chancellor expressed the opinion  that the states, which observe without protest the growth of  power policy tendencies in Russia, assume a "heavy  responsibility."</p>

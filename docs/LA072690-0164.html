			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY ADVISES AGAINST PLAN FOR A MALL AT TOWNE CENTER  </P> <P> An upscale shopping mall in the Towne Center redevelopment area would have  little chance of success, because the department store business is slow and  there are not enough high-income residents to support such a mall, a marketing  report indicates.  </P> <P> Forty of Towne Center's 125 acres near the Artesia Freeway had been earmarked  for what the city called a "high-end" mall, with a Neiman-Marcus or a Saks  Fifth Avenue to attract a Mercedes-Benz crowd.  </P> <P> If the council accepts the consultant's conclusion and scraps the mall idea, it  must find another use for the land and another way to satisfy its desire for  higher sales tax revenues. The council will discuss the analysis and the future  of Towne Center at its meeting Wednesday.  </P> <P> A hotel recently opened at the Towne Center and the city's Community Arts  Center is under construction. Office buildings are slated to cover most of the  property, which is in the center of the city.  </P> <P> The way to increase sales tax dollars, marketing analysts said, is to  concentrate on the city's existing mall, Los Cerritos Center at the south end  of the city.  </P> <P> Los Cerritos Center is in a position to become what the analysts called a  "powerhouse" mall, one that attracts volumes of shoppers by virtue of its size  and variety of retail outlets. Currently the center is in competition with the  nearby Lakewood Mall of about the same size, the report said.  </P> <P> The single-story Los Cerritos Center could be expanded by adding a second level  and by decking the parking lots, the market report suggested.  </P> <P> Some council members doubted that a second mall in Cerritos could be successful  and hired Economics Research Associates to conduct the market analysis.  </P> <P> Among the skeptics was Mayor Ann B. Joynt. She said this week that the analysis  tells her the city should not move too quickly to develop the 40-acre parcel  but wait until the best possible proposal comes along.  </P> <P> Joynt pointed out that the consultant termed the parcel extremely valuable  because it has freeway visibility and its own access ramp on a major east-west  traffic artery.  </P> <P> During her campaign last year, Joynt said she believed the city should turn its  attention to upgrading Los Cerritos Mall, lest it lose its competitive edge in  the area.  </P> <P> "The super mall," Joynt said, "is becoming more and more the location for  success and the small mall is having a tougher time competing."  </P> <P> Unlike some cities, Cerritos can afford to go slow on development because it  has ample tax revenue from Los Cerritos Center and the nearby Auto Square. The  city has a budget surplus this year of about $20 million.  </P> <P> The department store industry is currently in a state of financial turmoil, the  market analysis contends. "Too many department store operators are competing  for a slow-growth market, and discounters and specialty retailers continue to  provide strong competition."  </P> <P> As examples of the turmoil, the analysis pointed out that Macy's has decided to  delay its expansion into Southern California. The analysis also cited the  collapse of the Federated Department Stores chain, which owns Bloomingdale's.  </P> <P> In addition, it takes affluent shoppers to keep the more upscale department  stores in business, according to the report.  </P> <P> "Support for very high-end specialty retailers (such as Neiman-Marcus, Saks  Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's) is a very narrow market niche," said the  study.  </P> <P> While the population within a four-mile radius of Cerritos has solid  middle-income buying power, there is not a high percentage of households that  have yearly incomes of more than $75,000, the study said. It takes households  with that sort of income to support the more expensive department stores.  </P> <P> According to data presented in the market study, the number of households  within a four-mile radius of Cerritos with incomes over $75,000 is 11.2%.  </P> <P> By comparison, around the Fashion Island mall in Newport Beach, the percentage  is 18.3%, the study said.  </P> <P> "The Cerritos . . . area is heavily family oriented, resulting in a lower per  capita income," the analysts said. "This means that there are relatively fewer  single people who tend in some markets to be more fashion conscious and spend  more."  </P></p>

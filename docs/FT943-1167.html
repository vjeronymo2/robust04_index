			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / BR shuts down Continental freight service British Rail has closed a subsidiary set up to provide a container service to continental Europe because it failed to find a buyer in the private sector. Haulmark European Transport was established two years ago to provide a door-to-door service between European destinations. Containers were shipped by road to a rail terminal or port and then con-tinued their journey by ferry or through the Channel tunnel. The company was put up for sale in March but failed to attract an acceptable bid, either from outside or from its own management. Industry sources said this was an indication of tough competition in the transport sector, particularly in the growing field of road-rail transport. Railfreight Distribution (RfD), the BR subsidiary which runs services to the Continent, was unable to keep Haulmark going because there would have been a conflict of interest between its own 'wholesale' activities, running full trainloads, and Haulmark's operation, selling space on indi-vidual wagons, the company said. RfD denied that Haulmark had failed financially although freight industry sources said the company was understood not to be making money. When it was put up for sale earlier this year it had turnover of Pounds 12m and employed 19 people at its offices in Woking, Surrey. Staff numbers have since fallen to 11 and they will be found alternative employment in RfD.</p>

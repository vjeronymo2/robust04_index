			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Lords blow to Tory police plans Mr John Major's Back to Basics campaign for a return to traditional values was in trouble again last night after the Lords refused to accept a key element of the government's law-and-order programme. The latest blow, which follows repeated disclosures about the private lives of Conservative MPs, came as the Lords debated compromise proposals from Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, on the troubled police and magistrates courts bill. The government believed it had neutralised Lords opposition earlier this month when Mr Howard withdrew plans to take powers to appoint police authority chairpersons, and agreed to greater flexibility in the size of authorities. The concessions, intended to nullify claims that the government was undermining the independence of the authorities, would have allowed local councillors to maintain a majority on most authorities. The compromise was welcomed by Lord Whitelaw, the former deputy prime minister, who emerged as the bill's most influential critic during its second reading debate last month. However, the government withdrew the compromise after it became clear during yesterday's committee stage debate that enough Conservative rebels remained to defeat the government if the proposals were put to a vote. Peers on all sides said the home secretary's insistence on retaining the power to appoint up to five police authority members would leave authorities open to too much government intervention. Mr Howard said he would 'reflect' on the renewed criticism in the Lords, but indicated that he might try to reinstate the compromise proposals when the bill moves to the Commons later this year. 'The House of Commons has not yet had an opportunity to have its say, and I am confident that we will have its support,' he said. The failure of the compromise is a serious blow to Mr Major, who has identified law and order as a significant element of Back to Basics, launched at the Conservative party conference last October. But in Moscow last night Mr Major refused to allow the continuing Back to Basics controversy to disrupt his Russian trip. At a press conference he confined his answers to foreign policy issues. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said the government's law-and-order programme had 'descended into shambolic farce'. In addition to the reverses on police authorities, the government has been forced to water down changes to the appointments procedure and terms of employment for magistrates' clerks. Mr Howard's other law-and-order measure, the criminal justice bill, has also been the target of criticism from Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

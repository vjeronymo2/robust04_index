			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / A loss of nerve in mid-flight: The French government's climbdown in the Air France strike could prove costly The government of Mr Edouard Balladur, faced with its first serious industrial dispute since taking office in March, quickly climbed down from the brink. The withdrawal of Air France's controversial cost-cutting plan on Sunday night was aimed at preventing the escalation of a strike that had paralysed the loss-making airline for the past week. The prospect of today's 'Black Tuesday' industrial action, with unions at Air France's domestic subsidiary and the Paris airport authority planning to join forces with striking ground staff, fuelled fears of a winter of public sector discontent. It forced the government to promise that a new recovery package for the airline would be negotiated over the next three months. The declaration was quickly followed by the resignation of Mr Bernard Attali, the airline's chairman, who had drawn up the plan to cut 4,000 jobs by the end of next year and reduce overtime pay. He had argued that the measures were crucial for the group's survival. The government's concession on the plan and Mr Attali's departure should help defuse the conflict at the state-owned airline after today's strikes. But Mr Balladur and his colleagues may find the costs greater than the benefits. The problems at the airline are being shelved, not solved. More significantly, the dispute highlights the dilemma facing the Balladur government as it seeks to restructure French industry and privatise public sector groups, while trying to prevent social unrest in the face of an unemployment rate of 11.7 per cent and rising. The events at Air France represented the first significant test of how the government would respond to this dilemma. Its reaction is the clearest evidence so far that unemployment and the consequent threat of industrial strife are creating a barrier to reform that the government is unwilling to breach. This is implicit in the government's justification of its decision. 'We cannot save Air France while clashing with all its employees,' said Mr Bernard Bosson, transport minister. 'Because we must have social peace, we must change the plan.' But by backing down in the airline strike and abandoning the cost-cutting plan, the government may find that its hand is weakened in its pursuit of industrial restructuring. The case could encourage other unions to press their causes through industrial action and complicate, rather than ease, the implementation of economic reforms. Even at Air France, social peace is far from guaranteed. While the unions that spearheaded the protests said they might return to work tomorrow, Air France, which suffered losses of FFr3.8bn (Pounds 440m) in the first half of the year, remains in urgent need of restructuring. Mr Bosson has said that the 4,000 job cuts in Mr Attali's plan are still necessary, although he believes they can be implemented without involuntary redundancies. But delicate negotiations will be required if a repeat of the unrest is to be avoided. The appointment as chairman of Air France of Mr Christian Blanc, former head of RATP, the French capital's bus and metro authority, could work both ways. A friend of the Socialists, including their leader, Mr Michel Rocard, he has a reputation as a tough manager and a penchant for reform, which he practised widely at RATP. For their part, public sector trade unions said yesterday that they were satisfied with what they described as a 'first victory', but warned that they would continue to press their case against cuts in pay and overtime rates in negotiations with the transport ministry. There are grumblings of public sector discontent elsewhere, too. The Confederation Generale du Travail, the left-wing union group which was at the forefront of the Air France dispute, has called for a day of protest on November 18 against job cuts. This is expected to hit France's railways and several public sector companies, including Aerospatiale, the aerospace group, Snecma, the aero-engine manufacturer, and Groupe Bull, the computer group. Disgruntlement is also evident in the postal service and at France Telecom. A one-day strike on October 12 drew wide support from workers at these groups, reflecting fears of job cuts and opposition to government plans to reform employment laws. For the moment, the risk of widespread public sector unrest appears limited, partly because of continuing divisions among different unions. Several union groups, including Force Ouvriere, the radical federation that is prominent in the Air France dispute, have indicated that they will not participate in the November 18 protests. And at the weekend, the government reached agreement with four public sector unions over pay for civil servants. The deal, which gives civil servants a pay rise of 5 per cent for the next two years, avoids a potentially damaging impasse. The events at Air France, however, have given France's trade unions a boost. 'Yes, it is possible to win,' said Force Ouvriere in a statement. 'The employees are victorious.' Moreover, the rise in unemployment, forecast to exceed 12 per cent by the end of the year, will continue to provide fertile ground for disputes. But faced with a growing budget deficit - targeted at FFr317bn this year - and the need to prepare public sector companies for privatisation, the government urgently needs to improve the efficiency of state-owned industry. It cannot afford to support loss-making state enterprises indefinitely. Without substantial reform, including job cuts, it will also be difficult to find buyers for the state's industrial assets. The case of Air France, which is one of the 21 publicly owned groups slated for sale, illustrates the difficulty in striking a balance. But there are other cases too. The government is anxious to sell the loss-making Groupe Bull as quickly as possible to ease the drain on public sector funds. Earlier this month it was forced to inject FFr7bn into the group to cover its accumulated losses. To restore the group to profitability, however, will require cutting at least 2,500 jobs, according to industry observers. For the moment, the government's dilemma is eased by the fact that the groups which will begin the privatisation campaign are in relatively good health. Banque Nationale de Paris was successfully sold earlier this month. Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, and Elf Aquitaine, the oil and gas group, which are next on the auction block, should also enjoy smooth sales. But the scale of the problems at Air France, Groupe Bull and other public sector groups such as Thomson-TCE, the consumer electronics group which is also losing money, requires remedies to be implemented quickly. Mr Balladur can take some solace from a number of encouraging factors. The threat of industrial disputes is restricted largely to the public sector. Mr Francois Perigot, head of the French employers' federation, points out that the number of strikes in the private sector has fallen to the lowest level since 1945. Recent economic indicators have also suggested the end of recession, and hence rising unemployment, could be in sight. Industrial production figures released last week showed a rise of 1.3 per cent in July and August over June, while housing starts in the third quarter increased by 8 per cent. Last week's interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank allowed France to follow suit. Even with the government's optimistic scenario of a recovery from the fourth quarter of this year and 1.4 per cent growth in gross domestic product next year, however, the effect on unemployment will take time to feed through. Economists in Paris estimate it will take two or three quarters after the economy starts to recover before the rate of joblessness will stabilise. Industry chiefs will continue to press for cuts in staff, and unions will resist. Air France is unlikely to represent Mr Balladur's final journey to the brink. On the evidence of that dispute, he seems unlikely to take the bold steps required to withstand the threat from unions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dhespoina Dhasenaki: "Seeking the Centrists"] </F>   [Excerpts] Many call them "the centrists" for the sake of  brevity, but stress that they bear no relation to the  traditional political center. Others call them "the middle  ground" because their profile reflects the image of the average  voters. However, almost all admit that these are the voters who  give the victory to the party they choose. This is why they are  the "prize to win" among parties.    What makes them attractive is mainly the fact that they are  increasingly in evidence. The last poll conducted by the ALKO  organization after the elections (from 5 to 12 December among  1,200 voters over age 18 residing in the Attiki basin) shows  that about one in four voters (24 percent) are on the same wave  length. Moreover, they are the voters on whom the final outcome  usually depends.    Poll results are characteristic: some 77 percent of this  group of voters chose the Panhellenic Socialist Movement  [PASOK]. A total of 12.1 percent voted for Political Spring and  only 8 percent went with the New Democracy [ND].    The ALKO research also confirmed the "move" by showing that  among ND voters who went over to PASOK in the last elections,  59.5 percent belong to the group that calls itself "centrist."  The corresponding number who went over to Political Spring is  10.8 percent. The "success story" of this type of voters within  the parties' political strategy offices is therefore not at all  strange.  <H5>  What They Believe </H5>   They call themselves "centrists," but also distance  themselves from ideologies. They want "lower tones" in politics,  consider quality-of-life issues very important, do not reach  early political conclusions and ask for an economic policy as  realistic as possible.    According to ND deputy Y. Karatzaferis, "they are the voters  who elect a government." "In the last elections, they gave the  victory to PASOK," agrees K. Karamanlis, responsible for  political planning in the ND, who emphasizes that the importance  of this group of voters as far as political strategy is  concerned rests on the fact that it is loose and more easily  movable. PASOK deputy D. Beis even calls them "snipers," since  "they first criticize the government and the opposition and then  decide for whom they will vote." [passage omitted]  <H5>  "Middle Ground" </H5>   Karamanlis chooses a different terminology. "We are not  talking about the center. This is a term selected by pollsters  to facilitate their task. We could talk about a `middle ground,'  even if this is an oversimplification."    According to K. Skandhalidhis, minister of the Aegean and  member of the PASOK executive bureau, "this is a combination of  social groups coming from different starting points: the new  technological and economic strata, groups who choose their  position strictly on the basis of their economic situation and  are constantly becoming larger in recent years, a segment of the  undecided voters, and large strata of the new generation who are  not inspired by the general situation of the political system."    Karamanlis separates them into two basic subcategories:  "Older persons from 35 to 45, who in the past belonged, to a  great extent, to the wider leftist space, but are presently  maintaining a critical stance, and younger persons unrelated to  parties who are generally apolitical."  <H5>  The Majority </H5>   The "middle ground" is also the result of the demographic  profile of this group, which apparently resembles the profile of  the general population: a few more women than men (53 percent  compared with 47 percent), a few more people 55 to 64 than in  the general population, a few more individuals with an  elementary education (31 percent compared to 24 percent).  However, if we add the percentages for all ages under 55, there  are more younger individuals.    Meanwhile, what do these voters say about the group? Despite  considering themselves "centrists," when asked what the nature  of economic policy ought to be, they answer that it should be  "far from ideologies." However, if pressed to choose an economic  policy, they opt for a socialist system (33 percent), with only  5 percent choosing a market system.  <H5>  With Maturity </H5>   This guarded stance is also apparent when they are asked  what  they think of the government's economic measures. Some 43  percent answer that it is still too early to judge, while 42  percent say that they trust it.    However, their opinion becomes even more apparent when they  are asked to prioritize the country's problems. Even if they  list them in the same order as the general population,  differences in the degree of interest are telling. The so-called  middle ground seems to be more interested in issues of health,  insurance, education, and quality of life. Respondents who see  themselves as "centrists" selected the economy as the most  important problem (79 percent), followed by foreign policy (57  percent), health/insurance (52 percent), education (45 percent),  quality of life (29 percent), public administrtion (10 percent),  institutions (8 percent), culture (5 percent), and  decentralization (4 percent).</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Fujimori wins support in dissolving Congress PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori's decision to dissolve Peru's Congress, with the backing of his joint chiefs of staff, appears to have won broad popular backing, according to reports from Lima yesterday. But for parliamentarians and political analysts the move strengthened fears that Mr Fujimori intends to install a civilian-military dictatorship. Peruvian Prime Minister Alfonso de los Heros announced he and his entire cabinet were resigning in what appeared to be a protest, according to local radio. Coming only weeks after a failed coup in Venezuela, Mr Fujimori's crackdown has revived doubts about the strength of democracy in Latin America as a whole. Justifying his action in a surprise late-night TV broadcast, Mr Fujimori accused legislators of trying to block free-market reforms and failing to take tough measures against terrorists and drug-traffickers. He suspended the constitution and ordered detention of opposition leaders, including former President Alan Garcia, while troops were sent to guard radio stations and newspapers, and tanks patrolled streets in the capital. Mr Garcia was reported to have evaded arrest after a tip-off. The suspension of the constitution brought international condemnation. The White House said it was 'a regrettable step backwards' for democracy and US aid to Peru was put under review. Repeating recent criticism of Peru's legislature and judiciary, Mr Fujimori said 'chaos and corruption' were shackling government attempts to achieve 'the objectives of national reconstruction and development'. His campaign against Congress appeared to have struck a chord among the Peruvian people and in the streets there were expressions of support for him and no signs of resistance. The president said he would call a national referendum to create a 'new legislative structure' but gave no date. Cambio 90, the party created by Mr Fujimori when he began his 1990 presidential campaign, has long been in disarray. With only 27 representatives in the 180-seat lower house and 12 in the 60-seat senate, they are no match for the opposition, even when, rarely, they are united. Parliamentarians have become increasingly opposed to a president they deem authoritarian, who consistently vilifies them. After 20 months of austerity, debilitated left-wing parties are gathering strength. The poor have seen no reward for belt-tightening and businessmen are becoming disenchanted with ultra-liberalism that has left them unprotected as never before. Lacking a broad base, Mr Fujimori has drawn ever closer to the military. In decrees last November he gave them a freer hand in the 11-year-old war against Sendero Luminoso, the Maoist guerrilla group. Stephen Fidler in Santo Domingo adds: The first apparent effect of the US review of financial assistance to Peru was postponement of two loans totalling Dollars 221m from the Inter-American Development Bank. The loans were due to be signed yesterday at the bank's annual meeting in the Dominican Republic. The bank said only that signing of the loan accords, meant to encourage reform of Peru's investment regime, was delayed for 'technical reasons'. Any decision by the US to suspend assistance could put in jeopardy a complicated arrangement designed to bring Peru out of arrears with the IMF and other international financial institutions. If this happens, Peru's financial position would worsen significantly, jeopardising Mr Fujimori's economic reform efforts.</p>

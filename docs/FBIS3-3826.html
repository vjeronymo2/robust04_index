Hata met with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in  the morning and later held talks with his Russian Counterpart  Andrey Kozyrev. He also met with state Duma (lower house of  parliament) Chairman Ivan Rybkin in the afternoon.    Discussing the outcome of his talks with Russian leaders in  the final day of his visit, the Japanese minister confirmed that  the two sides had agreed to promote economic cooperation.    Japan will grant Russia a credit of 200 million U.S. dollars  through the export-import bank for the construction of a  fiber-optic communication line between Moscow and Russia's far  eastern city of Khabarovsk.    Hata told Russian leaders that Japan will aid Russia in  creating a number of training centers for market reforms in  Moscow and the Far East, and for developing oil and gas fields  on the Sakhalin shelf.    He also said that Japan, together with the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development, will establish a 50 million  dollar fund for aiding Russia's medium-sized and small  enterprises.    Moreover, the two sides agreed in principle to hold defense  and security exchanges, stressing that cooperation between Tokyo  and Moscow will have a "favorable impact" not only on the Asia  Pacific region, but also on the rest of the world.    Both sides shared the views on the current "alarming  situation" caused by the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula,  and said they stand for making the region a nuclear-free zone.    After their meeting, both Hata and Kozyrev told reporters  they had "detailed and constructive talks on a broad spectrum of  bilateral problems and some international issues, "stressing  that Japan and Russia have developed "very good relations."    However, the long dispute over the northern territory issue  was only touched upon and no progress was made.    "We do not avoid discussions on these problems," Kozyrev  said, adding that these issues will be thoroughly discussed at  future meetings on the basis of the "Tokyo declaration" signed  during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October.    The Japanese minister pointed out that in order to improve  bilateral relations it is necessary to conclude a peace treaty  and resolve the territorial dispute as soon as possible.    He called for a step by step advance toward a settlement of  the territorial dispute.    Chernomyrdin told Hata during their morning talks that  Russia  "will not act with haste" in handling this dispute, left over  from the Second World War.    The four islands were occupied by the Soviet troops towards  the end of the war.    "One way or another we will move towards the signing of a  peace treaty between our countries," the Russian premier stated.    Before leaving Russia, Hata also agreed to set a date for  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to Moscow.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Mobile phone groups to cut prices VODAFONE, the cellular phone network operator, yesterday announced new prices in an effort to bring mobile telephones to the masses. The move followed a similar initiative by Cellnet, its main rival, aimed at opening up a new market of non-business users. The two groups, which dominate the UK market, are hoping to transform the cellular phone from an expensive businessman's gadget to a more everyday consumer item. The new prices aim to attract customers who would like to own a mobile phone for occasional use, but find the connection and line rental charges too high. Vodafone expects the market for mobile phones to grow from the current 1.3m users to 7m - half of them non-business users - by the turn of the century. Starting in October, Vodafone will offer a 'low cost' service with a reduced connection charge of Pounds 30, compared with the current Pounds 50, and a monthly line rental charge of Pounds 15, down from Pounds 25. Cellnet is introducing a similar option from November. Vodafone's call charges under this service, however, will be higher than under its present tariff. The peak rate will be 54p per minute within the M25 London orbital and 46p per minute elsewhere. The off-peak rate is 15p per minute in all areas. These rates compare with Vodafone's current rates of 33p per minute within the M25 at peak times - between 7.30am and 9.30pm, Monday to Saturday - and 25p elsewhere. Off-peak rates are 10p anywhere. Cellnet's nationwide peak rate charge under its new offer will be 50p per minute and 20p off peak. Under its existing tariff, peak calls cost 33p per minute within the M25 and 25p per minute elsewhere. Off-peak calls are 10p. Vodafone is pricing handsets at Pounds 249 compared with current retail prices of anywhere from Pounds 800 to Pounds 200. Cellnet's will also be priced under Pounds 300. The new pricing scheme is intended to attract people who do not plan to make frequent calls on their mobile phones. The higher call charges mean that anyone making at least one call a day during peak hours is better off staying with the current scheme, Vodafone says. Both companies expect the new prices to attract a large number of new customers. Cellnet estimates it will have 200,000 new customers in the first year. The mobile phone market has been hit by recession, and competition is expected to increase with the launch next year of radio-based personal communications networks and the progressive introduction of telephones using GSM, a digital standard agreed by 17 European coun-tries.

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Canadian utility finances turbines deal through FSC HYDRO-QUEBEC, the Canadian power utility, has become the first company outside the aircraft industry to finance a capital equipment purchase through a US Ownership Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC). The Montreal-based utility used an FSC - a complicated form of tax-sheltered leveraged lease - to acquire four gas turbines, worth USDollars 90m, from General Electric of the US. The participants declined to give precise details and terms of the turbines deal, which was concluded just over a month ago. The idea was the brainchild of Babcock &amp; Brown, a New York investment bank, and CCG Equipment, an equipment-financing company based in Barbados. CCG's shareholders are a number of US and Canadian financial institutions, including Confederation Life of Toronto. Capstar Partners, a New York-based boutique run by a group of former investment bankers, acted as Hydro-Quebec's financial adviser. FSCs first made their appearance two years ago, and have subsequently become a popular vehicle for foreign airlines to lease US-made aircraft. Some 75 to 100 FSC deals are expected to be completed this year. The main difference between an FSC and a lease is that the former requires a sale outside the US. A Foreign Sales Corporation, which functions as a subsidiary of a US company, is usually incorporated in an offshore tax haven. Financing is provided jointly by equity investors and lenders. The equity participant benefits from lease payments as well as the straight-line depreciation of the asset on its books. The lender is paid a negotiated interest rate. In the case of the Hydro-Quebec turbine contract, the equity investor is a subsidiary of the Bank of New York. CCG Equipment provided the debt finance. Mr Claude Germain, Hydro-Quebec's director of financing management, said the savings were enough to cover the unusually high legal and manpower costs and still produce an 'interesting' saving compared with other forms of finance. Hydro-Quebec turned to an FSC as part of a strategy to diversify its funding sources.</p>

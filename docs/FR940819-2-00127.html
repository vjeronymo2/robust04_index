During this audit, the licensee identified four missing strontium-90 (Sr&hyph;90) reference sources of approximately 14.8 megabecquerel (400 microcurie) each. The licensee conducted an extensive physical search for the sources and reviewed all radioactive material permits issued to other organizations at Brooks AFB. When the disposition of the Sr&hyph;90 sealed sources could not be determined, the licensee reported the loss of the four sealed sources to NRC by telephone on September 22, 1993. The licensee informed NRC that the United States Air Force (USAF) Inspector General would review this incident. The licensee suspected that the sources had been inadvertently discarded and transported to a sanitary landfill. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee evaluated possible radiation exposure to members of the general public and concluded that unless the sources were removed from the container, the radiation levels from the sources would be near background level. Furthermore, unless a deliberate effort was made to open the source capsules, an individual handling the sources would receive less exposure than allowed by regulatory limits for the general public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cause or Causes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _During 1991, the timeframe during which the sources were apparently lost, a number of individuals were responsible for the radiation safety program at Brooks AFB. These individuals were temporary or part-time Radiation Safety Officers (RSOs), and had extensive, temporary duties at other sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results of the USAF Inspector General's investigation determined that ``programmatic issues started to plague radiation safety at Brooks AFB after the dismantling of the base/clinic program and the inception of additional duty RSOs.'' The report explained that in 1986, the radiation safety function and responsibility was transferred to the base clinic at Brooks AFB. Almost simultaneously, a Joint Military Medical Command (JMMC) was established and the base clinic became a part of JMMC. JMMC was a medical command established to service all branches of the Armed Forces in the San Antonio, Texas, area. With this action, the radiation safety program was managed by an organization that was not responsible to any management level at Brooks AFB. Furthermore, the report stated that JMMC dismantled the clinic's radiation safety program, and ``requested that all organizations previously under the clinic's program establish and run their own radiation safety program.'' Exacerbating the problem was the appointment of the additional duty RSOs, who had ``limited to general knowledge of radiation safety,'' and no directives or other guidance to assist them. Additionally, ``the additional duty RSOs received little management oversight after they had been appointed to the RSO position.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The investigation concluded that from 1986 through 1991, there had been a lack of commitment to management oversight, and a serious disregard for radiation safety issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Licensee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _In 1991, Armstrong Laboratory was placed under a new Air Force Command. The Command committed to increased management oversight of the radiation safety programs. Additionally, physical inventory procedures were revised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _NRC conducted an inspection (Letter from Dwight D. Chamberlain, Acting Director, Division of Radiation Safety and Safeguards, NRC Region IV, to Lt. Colonel Joseph J. Donnelly, chief of USAF Radioisotope Committee Secretariat, forwarding Inspection Report No. 030&hyph;28641/93&hyph;10, Docket No. 030&hyph;28641, License No. 42&hyph;23539&hyph;01AF, dated January 19, 1994) at Brooks AFB on December 21, 1993, to review the circumstances associated with the loss of licensed material, after receiving a written report from the licensee on December 10, 1993. NRC also held an Enforcement Conference with the licensee on February 3, 1994, to review the findings of the inspection and to determine enforcement action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 11, 1994, NRC issued a Notice of Violation (Letter from L.J. Callan, Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, to Department of the Air Force, USAF Radioisotope Committee, forwarding Notice of Violation, Docket No. 030&hyph;28641, License No. 42&hyph;23539&hyph;01AF, dated February 11, 1994) for violations involving (1) a failure to secure licensed material and (2) failure to include in one USAF permit a requirement to conduct a periodic physical inventory of all licensed materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These violations were categorized as a Severity Level III and a Severity Level IV, respectively (Severity Level I through V range from the most significant to the least significant, respectively). No civil penalty was assessed because of the Air Force's discovery of this violation and the promptness and comprehensiveness of the corrective actions. The licensee has responded in writing to the Notice of Violation and no additional actions are required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 94&hyph;5&blank;Medical Brachytherapy Misadministration at the University of Cincinnati in Cincinnati, Ohio <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a therapeutic exposure to a part of the body not scheduled to receive radiation can be considered an abnormal occurrence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date and Place <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _January 7, 1994; University of Cincinnati; Cincinnati, Ohio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nature and Probable Consequences <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _On January 14, 1994, NRC was notified by telephone of a misadministration involving a leaking iodine-125 (I&hyph;125) brachytherapy implant seed. On January 7, 1994, 16 I&hyph;125 seeds, each ranging from 370 to 1110 megabecquerel (MBq) (10 to 30 millicurie [mCi]) activity, were implanted in the brain of a 30-year-old male patient. Following the explant procedure on January 14, 1994, the licensee identified radioactive contamination in the surgical room and bathroom used by the patient. Personnel from the licensee's radiation safety office identified the contamination to be I&hyph;125 and confirmed that at least one seed was leaking. Further analysis by the licensee determined that one seed was damaged during the implant procedure by a surgical staple. The seed originally contained 758 MBq (20.5 mCi) of I&hyph;125 and, based on an assay of the explanted source, the licensee estimated that the loss was approximately 74 MBq (2.0 mCi). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thyroid monitoring of the patient's visitors and hospital employees involved in the care of the patient was performed by the licensee. One of the licensee's employees was determined to have received a committed dose equivalent to the thyroid of 50 microsievert (&mu;Sv) (5 millirem [mrem]). In addition, a visitor was determined to have received a committed dose equivalent to the thyroid of 540 &mu;Sv (54 mrem), or a total effective dose equivalent of 160 &mu;Sv (1.6 mrem), which is less than the annual limit for members of the general public of 1000 &mu;Sv (100 mrem). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Through patient monitoring, the licensee estimates that approximately 5 percent of the free I&hyph;125 was taken up in the patient's thyroid. (In a normally functioning, unblocked thyroid, approximately 25 percent of the free iodine would be taken up in an individual's thyroid.) The licensee estimates that the uptake would result in a radiation dose to the thyroid of approximately 300 centigray (300 rad). The licensee does not expect any adverse medical effects to the patient as a result of the misadministration. An NRC medical consultant concluded that the non-radioactive iodinated contrast agent used during an imaging procedure performed on the patient prior to the implant blocked the absorption of the I&hyph;125. He also concluded that exposure to the radiation levels described has resulted in an increased probability of developing thyroid tumor(s) in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Arts: The Game of Love and Chance - Theatre The title of Pierre Marivaux's play is teasingly misleading. There are delectable games of love in The Game of Love and Chance, but the only chance is the accident of birth. The upper middle class may pose as servants, and vice versa, yet in the end no-one marries beneath or below their station and the servants know their place. The production at the Cottesloe, in a sparkling new translation by Neil Bartlett, looks like Pirandello with a touch of Noel Coward. The Italian connection is not surprising: Marivaux (1688-1763) belonged to the Italian rather the Comedie Francaise wing of the Paris theatre. He rejected the more formal approach of Moliere, wrote mainly in prose and went in for knockabout. Where he foreshadows Pirandello is in playing games with illusion and reality. Noel Coward is thrown in as a bonus. Stefan Bednarczyk, as the bachelor brother Maurice, even looks like him. He does a lot of languid piano-playing. The period is Coward, too: the men in elegant dressing gowns, the women constantly smoking, often with cigarette-holders. At least one reference in the text is a direct parody of the famous line in Private Lives: 'Funny how eloquent cheap emotions can be,' goes the new version. The coup de theatre, however, is something quite different. It consists of making Silvia, the principal girl, look a good deal older than one would expect. Here is a triumphant performance by Maggie Steed. It is no disrespect to her to say that she looks as if she has been in her upper thirties for several years. In presenting her as a mature woman Bartlett, who also directs along with Mike Alfreds, adds immeasurably to the feeling that sometimes surfaces above the comedy. It is much more interesting to watch an older, experienced woman fall in love than a strip of a coquette. Unless I imagined it, Ms Steed's achievement goes beyond that. She looks younger, with fewer lines on her face, when she is playing the society woman she is than when she is posing as her maid Lisette. Then she appears slightly haggard, bowed down by the troubles of the world. Is this a social comment on the poor? Possibly, for The Game is a very social play in which the prevailing hierarchy is never seriously challenged by the participants. Take just two examples. Silvia, acting as the maid though with the audience knowing precisely who she is, explains that she could certainly marry the man she believes to be a chauffeur, if he were higher born and rich; otherwise not, however much she loves him. The chauffeur-suitor, after revealing that he has both those attributes, tells her that a man in his position could not possibly offer more than to be faithful to her as his mistress. Only at the end does he decide he can marry beneath himself, which fittingly turns out not to be necessary. There is a delightful, and totally related, sub-plot of two servants posing as master and mistress. Played by Caroline Quentin and Marcello Magni, they too make it to the altar, or at least to the final champagne. If the plot in general sounds complicated in print, it is ever so simple on stage. Besides, Ms Steed in particular frequently steps out of it and makes her own comments to the audience. A minor criticism might be that Peter Wingfield as the suitor looks a bit young for her, almost as if he was just down from say Cambridge, but perhaps that is part of the fantasy. Pirandello would have loved it. The production is mounted jointly by the Cambridge Theatre Company and Gloria in association with the RNT. It owes a lot to Bartlett's liberal translation. In repertory, Cottesloe, Royal National Theatre, (071) 928 2252</p>

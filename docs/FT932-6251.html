			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Veba may seek listing in US VEBA, the German energy-based conglomerate, is on the verge of selling its US plastics business, Huls America, shareholders were told yesterday. The group is also seriously considering following the example of Daimler-Benz and seeking a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. However, there is 'no hurry,' Mr Ulrich Hartmann, Veba's new chairman told the annual meeting. The proposed disposal of the plastics operations to an unnamed buyer follows similar rationalisation moves by other German chemicals and plastics manufacturers which have suffered heavily from the effects of recession and international over-capacity. Veba's chemicals divisions recorded an unspecified loss in the first quarter of this year, in which group net earnings fell 13 per cent to DM201m (Dollars 123.16m) and pre-tax profits dropped 7.2 per cent to DM513m. While group sales fell just 1.4 per cent to DM16.5bn, turnover on chemicals for the quarter were 7.6 per cent lower at DM2.49bn. A 3.4 per cent increase in volume sales of electricity pushed turnover in this sec-tor up to DM3.43bn and earnings also rose, the company said. Oil sector profits fell mainly because of a 'marked loss' from petrochemicals. Turnover was lower in trading, transport and services but earnings were unaffected. Veba said its earnings per share would not show as a big a fluctuation as overall profit due to dilution effects of new shares. The number of Veba shares will rise by 2.6m to 48.8m by the end of this year.</p>

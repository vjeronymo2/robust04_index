			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Top insolvency watchdog plans 3-yearly checks The largest of the UK's newly created bodies for regulating insolvency practitioners plans to examine all 1,200 professionals under its charge in the next five years. It also plans to inspect every active insolvency practitioner - about three-quarters of the total - every three years, it said yesterday. The details were revealed by Miss Kay Linnell, who was appointed chief executive of the Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit on Monday. The unit will take responsibility for monitoring the practitioners licensed by the Insolvency Practitioners Association, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and the members outside Scotland of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland. The three bodies, which retain control of licensing and disciplining their members, respectively hold three, four and one seat on the board. They will pay a contribution to the unit based on their number of practitioners. Miss Linnell said she planned to hire two support staff and about eight inspectors, who would examine about 100 practitioners each year. She said the unit would consider basic compliance with regulations, subjective areas such as whether litigation should have been commenced, and wider topics including fees charged. 'Our motto is to be firm but fair,' she said. The unit was set up after monitoring by the government insolvency service found a high proportion of practitioners failing to meet legal obligations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Deric Henderson, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Britain's refusal to clarify aspects of the Downing  Street peace declaration was preventing Sinn Fein from  completing its examination of the document, party president  Gerry Adams said tonight. The Irish government's willingness to  do so underlined the absurdity of the Prime Minister's refusal,  he claimed.    Mr Adams asked: "Why can John Major not follow Albert  Reynolds' lead on this issue? This would allow Sinn Fein to  conclude our process of consultation and consideration of the  document. Without such necessary clarification, it is extremely  difficult for us. Demands that we do so in the absence of such  clarity are unreasonable and a cause of suspicion in an already  difficult climate."    Mr Major and Mr Reynolds are due to have talks in London  next  week, a week before Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin  which will be dominated by a debate on the declaration.    Mr Adams hinted tonight that there will be no announcement  on  a decision whether to accept the December 15 agreement. It  would be counter-productive to set deadlines because of what he  claimed was Britain's "obstructionist attitude."    The Sinn Fein president said a confidential letter from Mr  Reynolds, outlining the Republic's interpretation of the  declaration, would allow a more informed evaluation of the  document and how it could be developed in an overall peace  process.    The role and influence of the Dublin government was central  to the peace process, but a lasting peace could not be achieved  without British cooperation.    He added: "The British government should provide  clarification. The lines of communication are still there to be  used. It is Mr Major who is refusing to move forward."    Mr Adams is to be invited to return to America to head a St  Patrick's Day parade through San Francisco, it was disclosed  today.    The United Irish Societies, an umbrella group of Irish  American clubs and organisations, has also invited SDLP leader  John Hume, Sinn Fein said.    And three IRA men who escaped from Ulster's Maze Prison  would  act as honorary Grand Marshalls for the March 17 parade.</p>

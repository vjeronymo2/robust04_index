			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> BARRICADED VAN NUYS MAN KILLS HIMSELF  </P> <P> A barricaded man who shot at police when they surrounded his Van Nuys house was  found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound today after the city's  armored battering ram was used to crash into the residence to end a lengthy  stand-off, authorities said.  </P> <P> The gunman, Gary Snyder, 45, was found dead about 6:30 a.m. in the home at 7500  block of Decelis Place. About three hours earlier, police used the tank-like  ram vehicle, which is ordinarily used during raids on fortified drug houses, to  hit the house several times, leaving all but one rear bedroom of the small  house destroyed.  </P> <P> Police said Snyder was found under debris in the living room and appeared to  have killed himself with a shotgun. Lt. Warren Knowles said it was unclear  whether Snyder shot himself as the ram was hitting the house or before the  vehicle was used.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Screaming for Help  </P> <P> Knowles said the incident began about 8:45 p.m. Wednesday when officers  investigated a report that a woman had run from the home screaming for help but  was chased down by Snyder and forced back inside.  </P> <P> Because neighbors told the officers that Snyder was known to have guns and had  fired them in the house before, they used a patrol car's loudspeaker to order  everyone in the house to come out. Two women and a man came out but Snyder  refused.  </P> <P> The Special Weapons and Tactics team was called to the scene and nearby homes  were evacuated while streets were closed. After lengthy attempts to get Snyder  to surrender, officers shot tear gas into the house. Police said Snyder then  fired 10 shots but no one was struck.  </P> <P> At 3 a.m., the motorized battering ram ram struck the house, crashing  completely through the living room area. The vehicle repeatedly backed up and  struck again along the front of the house.  </P></p>

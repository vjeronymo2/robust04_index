			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA BARBARA SHOWS FULLERTON HOW TO KEEP A LEAD  </P> <P> Perhaps mindful of what happened in their own arena last month, UC Santa  Barbara clamped down on its lead against Cal State Fullerton Thursday night and  didn't let go.  </P> <P> The Gauchos, leading by seven points with 3:33 to play, hit 12 of 13 free  throws down the stretch in a 75-70 victory over Fullerton in Titan Gym.  </P> <P> When the teams played in Santa Barbara last month, the Titans had an 11-point  lead with 2:20 remaining, and then folded, missing six free throws in a row  down the stretch and in overtime. Santa Barbara outscored them, 21-2, and  walked away with an eight-point overtime victory.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara (17-6, 10-4 in Big West Conference) came into Thursday's game  having won eight of its last 10 games, with the only losses to Nevada Las Vegas  and New Mexico State, both by two points.  </P> <P> Fullerton (12-11, 6-8) lost at home for the first time this season, breaking a  13-game home winning streak that started last season.  </P> <P> Led by Cedric Ceballos' 27-point, 21-rebound performance, Fullerton again gave  Santa Barbara trouble for a while. The Titans had a 41-38 lead in the second  half after consecutive fast breaks led by Ceballos, who rebounded and then took  control of the break himself, finishing one with a three-point play and dishing  off on the other.  </P> <P> But Santa Barbara's Carrick DeHart came back and settled things, hitting three  three-point baskets in less than three minutes to pull the Gauchos ahead by  eight points, 51-43, with nine minutes left.  </P> <P> DeHart finished with 20 points, and Eric McArthur, the nation's leading  rebounder, had 16 points and 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> Gary Gray's 25-point performance, twice his 12-point average, was the key for  Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Fullerton's Mark Hill, who had played the worst game of his career against  Santa Barbara last month, did worse than that this time, going one for 11 and  scoring a career-low three points.  </P></p>

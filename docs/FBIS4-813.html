			<p>BFN     [Text] The right honorable prime minister, Dr. Ntsu  Mokhehle, today appealed to the Basotho nation to be calm over  the tragic death of the late deputy prime minister, Mr.  Selometsi Baholo. Addressing parliament this morning, the prime  minister said he had received reports on the attack and murder  of Mr. Baholo and the abduction of four other cabinet ministers.  The matter was reported to the Council of State, which met  under the chairmanship of His Majesty King Letsie III.    A delegation of four people were sent to the Makoanyane and  Ratjomose barracks to investigate the condition of the four  ministers and safeguard their lives. They were also to try to  determine the causes of the crisis. The ministers were released  last night and provided with tight security at their homes. Dr.  Mokhehle congratulated the delegation on the excellent work they  did. Dr. Mokhehle said he met members of the diplomatic corps  and explained the situation to them.    The prime minister said he had received a special message of  solidarity from the Commonwealth secretary general, Chief Emeka  Anyaoku, who also promised two envoys to Lesotho to help in  investigations into the causes of the present crisis. The  envoys are Mr. Max Gaylard and Dr. Moses Anasu. Dr. Mokhehle  told the house that arrangements for Mr. Baholo's funeral were  being made. He expressed his deepest sympathy to Mr. Baholo's  widow and family, to His Majesty the king, the government, and  the people of Lesotho over the sad loss. The prime minister  also briefed members of the senate on the same issue.</p>

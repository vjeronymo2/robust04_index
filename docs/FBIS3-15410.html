			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As we have already reported, yesterday at Government  House, Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov had a meeting with  representatives of various parties and movements of Kyrgyzstan.  It dealt with questions of the economy and ways of getting out  of the current situation -- and the situation is truly  excessively grave -- especially in industry. All major  factories are working under capacity, almost standing idle. For  example, the Lenin machine-tool works, the Frunze machine-tool  works, EVM [computer company] and others are operating at only  20-25 percent capacity. People working at these factories are  being forced to take indefinite leave. Agricultural production  is also falling in the Republic. Now the main reliance is on  private farming and joint agricultural enterprises with foreign  firms. This is already happening in Moskovskiy Rayon. The  prime minister replied to all the questions of those invited.</p>

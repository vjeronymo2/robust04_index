			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A.'S GOT THE BLUES;  </P> <P> MUSIC: A FESTIVAL FEATURING THE GREATS WILL REIGN OVER THE SOUTHLAND FOR A  WEEK. IT WILL OFFER DIVERSE STYLES PLAYED AT VENUES THROUGHOUT THE REGION.  </P> <P> Everybody understands the blues  </P> <P>  -- Ray Charles  </P> <P> Ain't it the truth. If you've ever been down, sad, miserable or otherwise out  of sorts, then you've had the blues.  </P> <P> Getting rid of the blues can be as simple as listening to the blues, one of the  oldest American song forms and musical styles around.  </P> <P> "If you're feeling low, the blues picks you up like a spirit," says John Lee  Hooker, the veteran guitarist/singer who won a 1989 Best Traditional Blues  Grammy for his rendition, with Bonnie Raitt, of "I'm in the Mood."  </P> <P> Blues lovers and other enthusiasts can get their fair share of a wide variety  of the blues from Benson &amp; Hedges Blues, a weeklong festival of free and  ticketed blues performances that begins tonight and roars on until Sunday.  </P> <P> Blues greats Hooker, B.B. King, Dr. John and Stevie Ray Vaughan, along with  many Los Angeles area musicians -- Doug MacLeod, Bernie Pearl and Jimmy and  Jeannie Cheatham among them -- will take part in the festival, which will  feature shows at area venues from Banger's in Tarzana to Marla's Memory Lane in  Los Angeles. The event is highlighted by a concert by King, Hooker, Joe Cocker,  John, Vaughan and Irma Thomas at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa on  Saturday. That concert is also a benefit -- $1 from each ticket sold will go to  Shelter Partnership Inc., an umbrella organization that aids a variety of  groups that work with the homeless in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The celebration, which is produced by George Wein's Festival Productions, kicks  off tonight with five "Stormy Monday" shows in nightclubs across Southern  California, including guitarist MacLeod at Reuben's in Redondo Beach, singer  Dee Dee McNeil at Cafe Lido in Newport Beach and singer/guitarist Roy Gaines at  Moody's in the downtown L.A.'s Sheraton Grand Hotel.  </P> <P> This year marks the first time Los Angeles is a site for the festival, which  debuted in St. Louis, Atlanta and New York in 1988 and will be held in five  cities in 1990. "We chose Los Angeles because of its heritage in the rhythm and  blues field," says Jane Yusko, manager of the festival for Benson &amp; Hedges.  </P> <P> The recognition is a long time coming as far as Johnny Otis is concerned. Otis  has been an integral part of the Southland's R&amp;B scene -- which he defines  as a mixture of "blues, jazz and gospel" -- since the mid-'40s.  </P> <P> "We've been grossly overlooked in terms our contribution to the history of  rhythm and blues. Los Angeles was the one of most important and earliest  incubators of R&amp;B," says the man who discovered such artists as singers  Charles Brown and the late Esther Phillips, and who is perhaps best known for  his 1958 hit, "Willie and the Hand Jive."  </P> <P> Indeed, from the mid-'40s to mid-'50s, such artists as pianist Floyd Dixon,  guitarists T-Bone Walker (composer of "Stormy Monday Blues"), Lowell Fulson and  Pee Wee Crayton, saxmen Louis Jordan and and Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson and  singers Big Joe Turner and Big Mama Thornton (who wrote "Hound Dog") either  made Los Angeles their home or worked here extensively. They often performed in  the Central Avenue area, long renowned for the presence of jazz giants like  Charlie Parker, Dexter Gordon and Art Tatum, but a showcase for many blues and  R&amp;B musicians as well.  </P> <P> Bernie Pearl, who produces the annual Long Beach blues festival in September  and who, in association with Festival Productions, helped coordinate talent for  this week's festival, says that while the blues scene here has rarely hit the  heights of the '40s and '50s heydays, things are looking up.  </P> <P> "It seems like we've reached a stage where blues is an accepted part of the  (music) scene, whereas a few years ago, it was unusual to see blues acts,"  Pearl says. "And a lot of local artists like (harmonica player) James Harman  and (guitarist) Phillip Walker also tour out-of-town often."  </P> <P> And if blues is on the rise in the Southland -- clubs such as the Music  Machine, the Grand Avenue Bar and St. Mark's spotlight blues regularly -- it  seems its appeal is also on the upswing on a national and international basis.  </P> <P> "The blues are hot," says Hooker, whose "I'm in the Mood" was originally a  Number One R&amp;B hit in 1951. "They're being appreciated the way they should  have been appreciated a long time ago. Young fans are coming out and everywhere  I go it's a sell-out."  </P> <P> Younger artists like Vaughan and Robert Cray are in the spotlight, spreading  the blues word. "People like Stevie Ray turn their audiences on to men like  B.B. King, Albert Collins or whoever, and it really helps," says Mac Rebennack,  also known as Dr. John.  </P> <P> The Louisiana-born Rebennack has his own reasons for the enduring, although not  always highly commercial, presence of the blues on the American popular music  scene. "It's real," he says. "Anyway you chop it up, you can't dodge this  thing. Either you get real and you deal with it or you just melt. The blues is  crucial chronic music. It's like six by six -- as serious as death."  </P> <P>  Other events on tap are the "Boat Full of Blues," a cruise around L.A. harbor  with Pearl, John Mayall and Floyd Dixon, departing from Pier 93C, San Pedro, on  Friday, 8 p.m., (213) 426-4616; an evening of rare blues films screened by  archivist Mark Cantor at the Laemmle's Monica Fourplex in Santa Monica on  Tuesday, 7:30 p.m., (213) 394-0741; a seminar on the "Art of Blues  Songwriting," with Johnny Otis, Dixon, and others in Kinsey Auditorium,  Exposition Park, Los Angeles, on Saturday, 11 a.m., (213) 450-8859; and a  tribute to the "Women in the Blues," with Clora Bryant, Ms. Bright Eyes, Mickey  Champion and more at the Palace, Hollywood, Sunday, noon, (213) 462-6031. The  latter three events are free. For complete festival information: (213)  396-2797.  </P> <P> </P></p>

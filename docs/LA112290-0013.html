			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT: JAMMING FOR BURN FOUNDATION  </P> <P> The Scene: Tuesday night at the China Club in Hollywood, at an all-star blues  jam to benefit the Alisa Ann Ruch California Burn Foundation. China Club  co-owner Danny Fried hosted the evening for the group, which provides burn  care, prevention and education throughout the state.  </P> <P> Who Was There: The Kal David Band backed up a rotating lineup of guest stars  including Eric Burdon (of the Animals), Mickey Dolenz (of the Monkees), Herbie  Hancock, Rick James, Robby Krieger (of the Doors), Donny Osmond, Johnny Rivers,  "Married . . . With Children" star Katey Sagal (who was once a backup singer  for Bette Midler) and Ron Taylor.  </P> <P> Dress Code: The invitation specified "dress: optional," but most guests elected  to wear clothes. For women, the prevailing look on the club scene is still a  dress that fits tighter than panty hose, with bust line cut as far south as  feasible and hem raised as far north as legal.  </P> <P> Fashion Statement: One man wore a string of puka shells (the first recorded  sighting of them since the Bicentennial). Other people were wearing the  ultimate functional fashion accessory for rock clubs -- wads of cotton stuffed  in their ears.  </P> <P> Noted: Like their East Coast counterparts, L.A. club-goers strive to look like  they don't get home until after sunrise. Not that they want to look like they  don't go to the gym; when the ubiquitous black leather jackets come off, men  and women alike display the kind of designer biceps that New York club-goers  sneer at.  </P> <P> Quoted: "Milli Vanilli couldn't be here, but they sent a tape," said master of  ceremonies Bobby Collins. (Let the Milli Vanilli jokes begin.)  </P> <P> Overheard: "I never stay up this late. I've got a child and I'm usually in bed  by 8," said one woman, whose black miniskirt and suede boots would not cause  her to be confused with Donna Reed.  </P> <P> Money Matters: Reserved tables for six went for $1,500, but $50 was all it took  for general admission.  </P> <P> Triumphs: Performance artist Danny Dent took the stage for what he called his  "Two Fisted Art Attack." Wielding four brushes in each hand, he painted a  10-foot portrait of John Lennon in under 12 minutes. The club sensibly covered  the whole stage with sheets of black plastic before he began.  </P> <P> Glitches: The show was scheduled to start at 9 (in musician time that  translates to 10:30-ish). According to club management, the flu bug bit several  performers scheduled to appear, including Melissa Manchester, John Goodman, and  Thelma Houston.  </P></p>

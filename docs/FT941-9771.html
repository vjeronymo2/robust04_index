			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Bank Bad debts have fallen at Lloyds Bank, but it is evidently still uneasy about the lingering impact of recession on its customers. Queens Moat, among other corporate banking surprises, caused it to draw fully on that division's 1992 general provision. Now it has made a Pounds 70m general provision to cover latent problems across the group as a whole. General provisions amount to 0.7 per cent of customer advances, compared with only 0.4 per cent five years ago. Lloyds may be right in expecting aftershocks from the recession, but a broader issue is at stake. Should banks which have suffered undreamt of loan losses in the last few years, use better times to stock up on general provisions? The question must interest those like Barclays which have been particularly badly hit. The conventional objection is that this is mere smoothing of profits. Yet the existing system - whereby banks book profits for a loan over several years and then suddenly write down the principal when it goes sour - also distorts the true earnings picture. The real difficulty lies in finding an objective measure of the actual risk of default to prevent managements from using general provisions to manipulate profits. As to Lloyds' operating profits, they present a familiar picture. Strip away the benefit to net interest income from the Argentine back interest payment and the increased securities gains, and there is little sign of organic growth. That dividend increases are insufficient compensation explains why Lloyds has underperformed the banking sector by 24 per cent over the past year.</p>

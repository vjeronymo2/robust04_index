			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / International Medium-Term Note Issues: European market rises strongly as focus shifts from US THE economic conditions which favoured the world's bond markets in 1991 also proved a turning point for the international medium-term note (MTN) market. After years of languishing in the shadow of the US medium-term note market, the European market rose strongly in 1991, with new programmes up from Dollars 31bn in 1990 to Dollars 42bn. Last year, the substantial shift of investors' funds out of the US into Europe created a dearth of fixed-income European assets forcing investors to look again at the MTN market, which they had shunned on the grounds of illiquidity. At the same time, the liberalisation of regulations governing MTN issuance in a number of European currencies facilitated the creation of supply in a range of currencies. At the same time as investor interest in MTNs grew, borrowers were becoming increasingly keen to lock in longer-term funding, in an effort to extend the maturity profile of their debt, and diversify their sources of funding. Many borrowers had been reluctant to set up MTN programmes, because they were unwilling to assume the start-up costs while uncertain whether they would be able to issue a reasonable volume of paper. Once significant investor interest appeared, cost savings available in the market proved enticing, particularly for borrowers with regular but smallish funding requirements which suited the markets ability to absorb small tranches of notes. The MTN market has largely usurped the position formerly held by the private placement sector of the Eurobond market, as it has proved a cheap and convenient channel for structured deals - that is, notes designed to fit the specific requirements of a given investor. In particular, a substantial portion of MTNs have been placed in Japan. However, straightforward issuance is expected to increase due to growing supply from banks and companies. Many banks which do not have programmes are waking up to the notion that the market could provide an opportunistic means of funding. They are not prepared to pay floating-rate interest above Libor, in order to tap the FRN market, and access to the Eurobond market has become trickier. The sterling market, which has been rather slow to evolve since its opening in 1990, was boosted by the creation of programmes by four UK building societies, led by the Halifax. But the sterling market has not had the benefit of Japanese demand, and the investor base remains narrow. Among other key programmes last year, Abbey National raised its Dollars 1.5bn programme to Dollars 5bn, and now has around Dollars 3bn of notes outstanding globally, around half in Europe. In August, IBM International Finance launched an Ecu2bn MTN programme. Although a number of Ecu-denominated programmes have been set up, the volume of Ecu paper has been limited because of oversupply of Ecu bonds.</p>

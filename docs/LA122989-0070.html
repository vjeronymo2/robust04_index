			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS GIRLS' TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> PALMDALE'S COUPLAND THROTTLES PALMISANO  </P> <P> Identify the player:  </P> <P> Power forward. Wears goggles. Plays for a team that has won several league  championships during the 1980s.  </P> <P> James Worthy, perhaps?  </P> <P> Try Nicole Coupland, 5-foot-10 senior forward for the Palmdale High girls'  basketball team.  </P> <P> Coupland gave a defensive performance worthy of recognition Thursday night,  shutting down Thousand Oaks' Michelle Palmisano in Palmdale's 52-46 win over  the Lancers (7-5) in the Thousand Oaks tournament.  </P> <P> Palmdale (11-2) moves into Saturday's championship final against Westlake.  </P> <P> Thursday's meeting was the third this season between Palmdale and Thousand  Oaks, and the Lancers are once, twice, three times a loser.  </P> <P> The sharp-shooting Palmisano, who had 39 and 21 points in the two previous  defeats, scored a game-high 20 this time but was made just five of 15 attempts  from the field under duress from Coupland and the double-teaming Falcons.  </P> <P> Palmdale never trailed after taking the lead late in the first period. The  Falcons, who forced 29 turnovers, led, 29-20, at halftime and, 40-30, after  three periods.  </P> <P> But led by a determined Palmisano, who scored eight of her points in the fourth  quarter, Thousand Oaks made a late charge, closing to 48-44 on a jump shot by  the sophomore guard. But that's as close as the Lancers could get. Palmdale got  two free throws by Kim Schielke and a layup by Coupland to pull away at the  end.  </P> <P> Martania Blair led Palmdale with 17 points and 14 rebounds. Karee Bonde and  Schielke chipped in with 12 and 10 points for the Falcons.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks got 12 points from Suzanne Nelinger and 13 rebounds from  Palmisano.  </P> <P> In other tournament games:  </P> <P> Westlake 64, Channel Islands 57 -- Westlake (10-1) converted 11 of 14 free  throws in the fourth quarter to hold off Channel Islands (9-4) and advance to  Saturday's championship game.  </P> <P> The Warriors used just five players until Dani O'Byrne fouled out with nine  seconds to play. O'Byrne led Westlake with 18 points, including five of seven  from the line in the fourth period.  </P> <P> Tracy Thorp (16 points), Melissa Gische (15) and Lauren Goldstine (13) also  scored in double figures for Westlake, which held the Raiders to five-of-16  shooting in the fourth period.  </P> <P> Channel Islands' Candis Carper led all scorers with 21 points.  </P> <P> Notre Dame 51, Nordhoff 43 -- Julie Nelson and Shannon McGlothlin scored 16 and  14 points to lead Notre Dame into the consolation final against Pasadena.  </P> <P> Pasadena 71, El Camino Real 51 -- Anita Bilbowssian scored 28 points, including  nine three-point baskets, to deny El Camino Real a berth in the consolation  final.  </P> <P> Nicole Nelson (14 points), Cathy Balint (13) and Angela Rich (10) all scored in  double figures for El Camino Real.  </P></p>

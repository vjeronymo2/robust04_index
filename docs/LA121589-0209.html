			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> SAM WHO TO HEAD FIELD OF 4 IN SPRINT  </P> <P> A field of four headed by Sam Who was entered in Saturday's $100,000-added  National Sprint Championship at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Sam Who will be ridden by Laffit Pincay and was assigned 122 pounds for the  ninth running of the six-furlong race for 3-year-olds and up.  </P> <P> Others entered were Order, who will be ridden by Aaron Gryder and was assigned  122 pounds; Olympic Prospect, who will be ridden by Alex Solis and was assigned  120 pounds, and Ron Bon, who will be ridden by Gary Stevens and was assigned  116 pounds.  </P> <P> Sam Who will make his first start since his fourth-place finish and subsequent  disqualification for interference after the start in the Breeders' Cup on Nov.  4. He set the track record this spring sprinting six furlongs in 1:08 flat May  20.  </P> <P> Olympic Prospect, known for his speed away from the gate, is expected to try to  jump to a big lead in the short field and hold off any late challenges.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Silicon Carbide Developed for </F> Personal Body Armour"]    [Text] Ceramic plates for use in personal body armour have  been developed by T&amp;N Technology, based in Manchester, United  Kingdom, in conjunction with TBA Industrial Products. The  silicon carbide-based ceramic offers protection comparable to  steel plate but is 50 percent lighter, the companies say.    The ceramic was developed in response to the need for a  material that could provide effective but lightweight protection  against high velocity armour-piercing bullets without hindering  mobility. TBA Industrial Products, a member of T&amp;N's  Industrial  Products and Materials group, develops body armour and armour  systems for the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, and the  police and security organizations. The company approached T&amp;N  Technology, the research and development arm of T&amp;N plc, for  help in developing a material that gave the protection of  armoured steel plate but not the weight. In response, T&amp;N  Technology set up a product development and testing programme to  examine the potential of silicon carbide in this application.    The Silicon carbide developed can withstand the impact of  three 7.6 millimeter rounds travelling at 850 meter per second  in the minus 1 power within a 100 square millimeter area. The  ceramic offers a similar level of protection to steel plate but  is 50 percent lighter. It is also 20 percent lighter than  conventionally alumina, and substantially cheaper than boron  carbide armour.    In addition to personal body armour, TBA industrial Products  expects a strong demand for silicon carbide armour in armoured  vehicles, security vehicles and security doors.

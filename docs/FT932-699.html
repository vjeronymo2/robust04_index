			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Facing up to being second rate: Why Britons have delusions of sporting grandeur BRITAIN, we are constantly being told, has not yet come to terms with no longer being a world power. How much truer this is of our sporting prowess, as the events of the past few weeks have demonstrated. I have just returned from a visit to our last colony, Hong Kong, and the shock waves of the England soccer team's defeat at the hands of the US could be felt on the shores of the South China Sea. Among the British community in Hong Kong such a disgrace was felt far more keenly than obscurely distant rumblings of domestic discontent about John Major's leadership. I flew back just in time to attend the Saturday of the Lord's Test against Australia, supposedly the highlight of the English cricket season. By the end of the afternoon, as the England batsmen fell more than 400 runs short of the Australian total, I wished that my flight had been delayed for 12 hours. The England supporters around me sat silent. The press, of course, observed no such restraint, and the sports writers since then have been vying with each other in their own private competition to see which of their number could most offend the England cricket selectors. There, I am afraid, lies the heart of our problem. The pundits who are paid to tell us what we think about England cricket, seem unable to believe that the team might possibly be less talented, simply worse, than any other nation. Their writings are based on the false premise that England are the premier cricketing nation and that it is only the stupidity of selectors and managers which prevents us from demonstrating this to upstart colonials. If only, they moan, we had not selected Smith, Gatting and Lewis and instead picked Lathwell, Thorpe and Igglesden, then we would have been all right. We seem unable to accept, gracefully and sportingly, that Australian batsmen such as Michael Slater and Mark Taylor might just be better than anything we can produce; that no matter how cleverly our team is selected, we are destined to lose to a better side. The same disease afflicts England's soccer pundits. If England ever lose an international match, it cannot be that a foreign nation actually has a higher class of player. No: it must be that great talent has been inadequately harnessed by a bad manager. An inability to come to terms with Britain's decline as a world power on the political stage is somehow more understandable. Britain was, in trading and naval terms, the greatest empire the world had seen. We are justified in being discomfited by our fall into mediocrity, even if it has been happening for 100 years or more. But in sport we have no such excuse for delusions of grandeur. Englishmen imagine that they were once a great footballing power. In fact England have only once won the World Cup, and that on home territory with the aid of a Russian linesman. Why should England not lose at soccer to the US, a vastly more populous and resourceful country? It is not even as though we field a British soccer team, which would benefit from the skills of the Celtic fringes. Instead Britain continues to imagine that it has the resources and talent to field not one but four separate international sides. As for cricket, the Ashes, for which England compete against Australia, are themselves a symbol of our sporting eclipse and, in the 100 or so years since, Britons have consistently been found wanting by the country of Bradman and Border. Perhaps it is only in lawn tennis, another of the games we invented without working out the humiliating consequences, that we are realistic. At Wimbledon we accept that defeat can be heroic, and that victory is not a right. Does it matter that England is a second rate sporting nation? One person to whom it undoubtedly does matter is John Major, the prime minister. How much better it would be for him if, just for once, he could be identified with success.

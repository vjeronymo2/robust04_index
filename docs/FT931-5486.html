			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition-led growth helps Life Sciences advance 12% LIFE SCIENCES International, the scientific instruments manufacturer, reported a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 20.6m, over the 12 months to December 31 1992. Turnover increased 21 per cent to Pounds 110.9m (Pounds 91.8m), assisted by a full-year contribution from Nestlab, the New Hampshire-based temperature control company acquired in 1991, and by the mid-year purchase for Pounds 2.65m of Anglia Scientific Instruments, a Cambridge- based supplier to the histology market. Organic growth in sales was 11 per cent, with demand particularly strong in the second half. More than 80 per cent of the group's production and 60 per cent of its sales are in the US. Most of its borrowings are in dollars, the strength of which helped push net debt up to Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 2.4m). Gearing, assessed in sterling, rose to 18 per cent (7 per cent). Fully diluted earnings per share were 9.1p (8.6p); a final dividend of 2.35p is proposed, making a total for the year of 3.55p (3.35p). Sir Christopher Bland, chairman, said US business was buoyant but UK demand for research laboratory products was weak throughout 1992, with no sign of an upturn since. The company's strategy, he added, was to become increasingly international; it is looking for 'appropriate acquisitions throughout the world'.</p>

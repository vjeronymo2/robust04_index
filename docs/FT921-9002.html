			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Burton institutes new management structure BURTON GROUP, the UK fashion company which this week sacked Mr Laurence Cooklin as chief executive, has swiftly moved to create a management board consisting of the directors of its various chains to develop a more cohesive group-wide strategy. 'The company is trying to develop a more collegiate structure than has recently been normal at Burton,' the company said. Mr John Hoerner, who succeeded Mr Cooklin as chief executive, will chair the management board which will meet every fortnight. 'I am a great believer in syndicating responsibility so that managers run with the ideas that they help shape,' Mr Hoerner said after assuming the post. While chief executive at Debenhams, Mr Hoerner was renowned for a more participatory style of management than was usual at Burton's other retail divisions. Burton also announced yesterday that Mr Terry Green, formerly womenswear buying director at Debenhams, would succeed Mr Hoerner as chief executive of the department store group. Two Debenhams directors, Mr Keith Cameron, personnel director, and Mr Steven Sharp, marketing director, will now broaden their areas of responsibility on a group-wide basis.</p>

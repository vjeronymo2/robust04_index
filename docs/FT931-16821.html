			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Italian inflation rate shows further fall in December ITALY'S consumer prices rose by an annualised 4.8 per cent in December, continuing the year's steady decline in domestic inflation but remaining well above the rises in many of the country's main trading partners. The rate in December compares with a rise of 4.9 per cent in November. It is down sharply from 6 per cent the previous December and reflects the success of government policy in holding down price increases and the impact of recession on the economy. However, the favourable data were not enough to take pressure off the lira, which fell to L1,512.33 against the dollar and L924.12 against the D-Mark, according to the Bank of Italy's indicative quotations. After heavy speculative attacks in afternoon trading, the lira fell even further, hitting its lowest level against the dollar since 1986. The outlook for Italian inflation in 1993 is mixed. Official policy to freeze public-sector prices and limit bank lending should help to combat inflation, but domestic prices will come under mounting upward pressure as the effect of September's lira devaluation starts to feed through. The lira is now floating against other European currencies in the exchange rate mechanism. Although well above the low levels against the D-Mark after devaluation, when the lira fell to almost L1,000, the currency is still more than 20 per cent below its pre-devaluation parity. The government has shown its determination to contain inflation by restricting or freezing many public-sector price increases. The cabinet committee responsible for state-sector prices last week approved a long-awaited plan to reform telephone tariffs by letting the Stet telecommunications holding company introduce a 'price cap' system for tariffs. The scheme allows for telephone tariffs to be increased automatically, subject to meeting pre-set quality and productivity criteria. However, ministers have yet to decide when the new system should be introduced, surprising the many analysts who expected it to be inaugurated from the beginning of this year.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: The power of a public sector hero - Endesa's future under Spain's electricity shake-up SPAIN'S big private sector electricity generators have nightmares about Mr Feliciano Fuster trampling over their territory with the might of the state behind him. Mr Fuster, a 66-year-old Mallorcan industrial engineer, is president of Endesa, the state-controlled electricity utility that commands nearly a quarter of Spain's generating capacity. He is a hero in the public sector and the central figure in a sweeping and increasingly combative reorganisation of Spanish utilities by the government. He is irritated that two of his biggest private sector rivals, Hidrola and Iberduero, are thinking about merging in order to confront the reorganisation ordered by Madrid. 'It would not promote competition,' he says. 'In fact, it would be against competition. I cannot compete with a group that has practically all the (low-cost) hydroelectric capacity in the country.' Spain's electricity is generated by more than 20 companies, many of them small with tiny regional distribution rights. Most own only a half or a third of a power plant. Because tariffs have been unified, the government has had to erect a frighteningly complex compensation system where low-cost producers pay out to high-cost rivals according to standard asset values held by the companies. The reorganisation 'which uses the new British model as a form of confirmation', says Mr Fuster, is designed to create just a few large generators. 'The efficiency of the sector has not been exactly fantastic,' he says, pointing out that the industry has short and long-term debts of around Dollars 40bn, even though final tariffs are roughly similar to other European countries. 'We are a collection of geographic monopolies. Why should the sector stay as it is simply because it has traditionally been that way?' If that sounds defensive, it is. Endesa has been fiercely criticised for abandoning its role as a wholesale power supplier to the private utilities, which are obliged to buy some of their power at a rate fixed by the government. In 1989, it bought 9.2 per cent of Sevillana, the Andalucian generator and distributor. Earlier this year it bought 80 per cent of Electra de Viesgo in northern Spain, and smaller packages of shares in Union Fenosa, also in the north, and Fecsa, the Catalan utility. The president of one Spanish bank with large holdings in the sector says this amounts to little more than the nationalisation of the industry. Nonsense, says Mr Fuster. 'If we wanted to control Sevillana we would have bought it. What do they accuse us of? Buying 10 per cent of Sevillana? Banco Bilbao Vizcaya bought 10 per cent just after us and no one said a thing. We bought that stake because we and Sevilla have a lot of business together.' 'We should not be talking about whether we are public sector or private sector. We should be talking about whether we are efficient or not. Endesa is not the state. We are a company in which the state holds a 75 per cent stake. (The other 25 per cent was floated in Spain and New York three years ago). We are not nationalising. We are offering public sector management.' That management has not served Endesa badly. It is the state holding company, the Instituto de Industria's (INI), most profitable company, earning some Pta80bn (Dollars 741m) after tax last year. The fact that Endesa, when it was the sector's ugly duckling, was forced to concentrate on coal-fired thermal power, while the private sector was allowed to build hydro-electrical and nuclear plants, has been turned on its head. Even independent analysts believe it is the most specialised and efficient thermal power generator in the country now. However the carping from the private sector will not go away, largely because Mr Fuster's acquisitions have placed Endesa in a strong position to head one of the two or three groups - he would rather see Hidrola and Iberduero each controlling a separate combine - that emerge from the reorganisation. Any reorganisation of the sector will involve a huge interchange of assets between the final sector leaders in order to ensure they have roughly similar production mixes. Holding on to 11.5 per cent of Fecsa, 5.7 per cent of Union Fenosa, and 9.2 per cent of Sevillana means Endesa has something to swap. Viesgo, Mr Fuster says, will probably be sold on again as part of an asset swap. Whatever the private sector and its banking partners do, Endesa is probably unstoppable. Mr Fuster and the government are convinced that larger generating companies will allow the industry to cut costs and replace over-regulation with real competition.</p>

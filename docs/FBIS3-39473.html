The Agricultural Ministry today noted that the cut came in  line with the November 1993 decision on the part of the European  Commission to liquidate the 1990 acccounts and stressed that  every year Italy suffers the biggest reductions in FEOGA funds  because of failure to respect Community controls and the terms  within which payments must be made.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Transatlantic dispute moves into top gear  -European gear-making exporters are fighting back in the US AFTER more than a year of shadow-boxing, the gloves are off in a transatlantic row that has turned the arcane world of gear-making into an issue fit for Washington's finest lawyers and lobbyists. The debate over the effect of imports on the Dollars 15bn (Pounds 8.2bn) US gear market moved out of neutral last year after the Gulf conflict focused attention on the US industrial infrastructure and its ability to mobilise for war. Now, Eurotrans, the organisation representing nine associations of European gear makers, has delivered a blistering response to the November decision by the American Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA) to seek a US Commerce Department investigation into the impact of imports on national security. Its 57-page document, filed with the Commerce Department a few days ago, pulls few punches in its descriptions of AGMA's petition under the little-used Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act. These range from 'misleading' and 'incorrect' to 'severely flawed' and even 'nonsense.' The central issue in a Section 232 petition is whether imports are affecting a US industry with significant national security implications. The question, in military jargon, is whether domestic producers can meet targets for 'surge and mobilisation' - doubling defence production in six months, and quadrupling production in 24 months? AGMA believes there is a case to answer. Mr Joe Franklin, executive director, says: 'In 232 petitions you find some cases are economic - the Washington jargon is that they are 'wrapped around the flag'. But my analysis in the gear industry is that we truly have a national security issue. There are trends in the use of alternative suppliers that reduce the US industry's ability to respond.' Eurotrans counters that the US has existing and potentially available resources sufficient to meet defence requirements. Gear imports, it says, do not contribute significantly to critical defence products. The initial response to the petition from Europe was almost dismissive. But, says Eurotrans president Michael Opperman, it was realised that 'a lot of what the Americans were saying is wrong.' Concern was heightened by the possible cumulative effect on US legislators of the AGMA petition, the 1991 Commerce Department national security assessment of the industry, and the 1990 International Trade Commission investigation documenting the decline in the US industry. 'These three important documents would be floating around Washington for years to come,' says Mr Opperman. 'The answer would always be that imports were at fault.' The European and US submissions to the Commerce Department paint very different pictures. AGMA speaks in more temperate language of an industry that, in parts, has never recovered fully from the recession of the early 1980s, suffers from predatory pricing by foreign producers, and lacks their competitive advantages in everything from access to capital to government support for research and development. Eurotrans, in its potent mix of strident language and solid statistics, says that the US aerospace gear sector leads the world but criticises many industrial gear makers for complacency. It also produces evidence of relatively low spending on research and training, and outdated manufacturing technology. It bitterly denies dumping products in the US and says US producers have the advantage over the Europeans on both the cost of, and access to, capital. The two sides cannot even agree on the level of imports - as so many gears are 'embedded' in other products. While AGMA says imports account for 30 per cent of the US commercial (non-defence) market, Eurotrans says the figure is only 18.2 per cent. The European side also berates AGMA for ignoring the effect of currency fluctuations on the rise in imports between 1984 and 1988, and pours scorn on the US contention that the automotive gear sector could not be converted to defence work for technological reasons. The two documents are the opening salvoes in a lobbying campaign which should see a presidential decision on what action to take, if any, in about nine months. A wide range of options is available, including voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs) limiting imports. However, these are being phased out in other areas, and the AGMA's petition could face an uphill battle for controls on imports.</p>

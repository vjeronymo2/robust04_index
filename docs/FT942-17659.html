			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Doyle to quit Irish bank post Mr Maurice Doyle, the governor of Ireland's central bank, is to step down at the end of this month having completed a seven-year term of office. The Department of Finance said yesterday that Mr Doyle was not seeking reappointment for a second term, but gave no indication of who might replace him. Mr Doyle, 62, has built a reputation of being a strong and forthright governor, quick to assert the bank's independence. He had also spent 30 years working in the Department of Finance, and was its top civil servant for six years. He has been one of the key figures behind Ireland's 'strong punt' policy, pursued by successive governments since the late 1980s, which together with sharp cutbacks in government borrowing over the same period has helped bring Ireland's inflation rate (1.6 per cent in 1993) down to one of the lowest in the EU. The next governor will oversee the separation of the London and Dublin stock exchanges, tentatively scheduled for later this year.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Land Travel failure leaves customers and staff stranded THE spectacular collapse of Land Travel has stranded employees and holidaymakers alike. Inside the company's smart Churchill House offices in Dorchester Street, Bath, 130 staff - some dressed in black ties after being warned of the impending doom - were told they no longer had jobs. Outside the offices a crowd of holidaymakers were left to consider that they not only had no holidays but also little chance of getting their money back. Meanwhile the collapse of Land Travel prompted a flood of horror stories from disgruntled customers, while abroad others were coming to terms with finding themselves stranded, or at the mercy of coach and ferry operators. Among the luckier ones were seven coach loads of Land Travel customers who arrived at the Euro Disney resort outside Paris yesterday morning. They were allowed in, despite the fact that they did not all have valid entry tickets, and Euro Disney reported that the coaches were still waiting patiently at the gates for them late yesterday evening. About 80 Land Travel customers had arrived at the park two weeks ago without valid tickets, according to Euro Disney. On that occasion Euro Disney gave complimentary entry tickets to about 20 of the customers. Mrs Phyllis Pratt, of Corsham, Wilts, was another customer enticed by the cut price holidays. She booked a four-day coach trip to Holland costing Pounds 100, including travel and hotel accommodation. She was let down on two separate occasions at short notice. Land Travel cited coach problems as the cause for the cancellations, she said. 'They treated me extremely shabbily. I always got the impression they were holding something back,' Mrs Pratt said. 'It was such a disappointment because I was looking forward to a holiday to help me get over losing my husband.' Among the anxious customers waiting the company's offices after doors were locked at 9.45 am yesterday was Mr Alex Fleming, a social club organiser from Tewkesbury, near Cheltenham, who had booked a Pounds 4,960 seven day trip to Spain for himself and 21 family and friends, which was cancelled on Thursday. 'We are absolutely sick. I was hoping that by coming down here this morning I could get some sort of reimbursement, so that I could arrange another holiday but I've been told we've lost everything.' Mr Judah Duiker and Mrs Meikie Duiker travelled 250 miles from York to claim money for a holiday to Rome which was cancelled at the last minute on Thursday. The couple left empty handed. Mr Duiker said: 'We have been in Britain for two years and we wanted to see as much of Europe as possible. We have lost money in terms of paying almost Pounds 100 for visas to enter France and Italy and Pounds 176 on the holiday.' Before the police and liquidators moved in Land Travel offered a range of cut-price European holidays, including three nights in Paris or Brussels at Pounds 49, ten days in Poland at Pounds 159 and tours to the Austrian lakes, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Prague and the Black Forest for less than Pounds 150. A week in Costa Brava at Christmas cost Pounds 150 and a week in Rome over the new year was priced at Pounds 104. Avon and Somerset police said they had received a number of complaints over a period of time regarding Land Travel. Company records reveal that Land Travel has been in financial trouble for some time. Mr Don Foster, MP for Bath, demanded an inquiry into Land Travel and called for new laws to make tour operators produce evidence of confirmed bookings. 'There ought to be government health warnings on package holidays that are not covered by the Association of British Travel Agents,' he said. Mr Foster added: 'In spite of everything the message has not been getting through. Of course you are free to make your own choice, but if you do not go with an ABTA company, you must beware of the consequences.' He said he would investigate claims that Land Travel holiday packages were insured. 'It is unclear who was covering them and what the back up was.'</p>

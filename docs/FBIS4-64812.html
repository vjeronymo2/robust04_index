			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham: "Two Fronts That Upset Us"] </F>   [Excerpts] Just two weeks after Greek Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou's trip to the United States and the  encouraging position by U.S. President Bill Clinton toward  Greece's role in the Balkans, the government finds itself faced  with two open fronts at its northern border without a promise  for swift settlement.    The first, of course, is the issue of Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] with the prolonged  impasse over ways to solve it within the framework of the United  Nations.    Second, there is the issue of Greek-Albanian relations,  which  deteriorated despite the Greek Government's intention to the  contrary.    On the issue of Skopje, the government is attempting a  spectacular turn in the negotiating process without so far  facing any serious objection or trouble by the opposition  parties, or by a large part of the Greek public. This means the  government appears willing and ready to discuss, still under  Cyrus Vance's auspices, the issue of Skopje in its entirety, in  one phase, including the final name, and of course under two  conditions:     -  The Greek countermeasures will remain in  effect.    -  Possible secondary agreements during the negotiations  will not depend on the achievement of an overall agreement on  the issue, which will include a solution to the name issue.    This spectacular turn attempted by the Greek  Government--which was considered almost "inconceivable" not long  ago--was helped during the prime minister's talks at the White  House. From the two leaders' official statements after their  long private talks, it became evident that the two sides agree  that there should be a new way to "approach" the issue, so that  the differences between Athens and Skopje will smooth out and  the negotiating process will be maintained. [passage omitted]    With the new process formula under discussion, both sides  could maintain the maximum of their demands.    FYROM President Kiro Gligorov could claim that his demand  for  negotiations on all issues has been accepted, while Athens could  insist on the implementation of its measures until Skopje meets  the conditions it has set (constitution-flag-propaganda) before  lifting them.    The "secret" of this approach--if it is finally adopted--is  that it offers Gligorov all the time he needs until the  critical, for him, elections in the fall, while at the same time  it allows Athens to maintain an active, but more relaxed,  process of negotiations in New York.    It is more than obvious that Athens seeks relaxation in the  issue of Skopje, since a swift solution of the issue is not  possible. On the contrary, and despite its desires, the Greek  Government faces a serious deterioration in its relations with  Tirana that does not appear about to subside as long as Albanian  President Sali Berisha's side systematically attempts unilateral  provocations, which, however, for the time being fall flat.    The recent meeting in Zurich between Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias and Albanian counterpart Alfred Serreqi did  not produce anything substantial toward diffusion of the crisis.    Tirana's official statements and Berisha's remarks prove  that  the Albanian Government attempts, at least orally, to present  Greece as the number one "threat" to its security. Furthermore,  it insists on superficial diplomatic acts on the international  scene which have already been absorbed and which have led  foreign governments friendly to Tirana to "advise" it to  decrease its offensive tones toward Athens.    Despite all that, Tirana appears determined to "play with  Athens' nerves" by exerting obvious pressure on the Greek  minority but also with disguised, but perhaps very serious,  pressure on the Albanian Orthodox Church and especially on  Archbishop Anastasios.    Maybe Tirana's continued provocative stance does not target  the Greek Government, which does not seem willing to depart from  its very calm policy toward Albania. It possibly targets the  "sensitive nerves" of the opposition parties such as New  Democracy and Political Spring.    "Angry" or even extreme statements and reaction by  opposition  parties will give Tirana the opportunity to claim that the  current government's calm policy is not a stable factor in  Greece's policy toward Albania, and therefore Tirana has every  reason to "be afraid" of the future regarding the Greek  intentions toward it.    The tour by Miltiadhis Evert, official opposition and New  Democracy chairman, to the Greek minority areas of Albania [7-8  May] will perhaps be a very good opportunity to reject and  dispel all the above claims by Tirana. Anyway, prior to his  tour in Albania, Evert had an in-depth, but also "discreet"  briefing by the Foreign Ministry.</p>

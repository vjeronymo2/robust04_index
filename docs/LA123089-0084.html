			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG NAMES FLOP WITH CHRISTMAS BUYERS;  </P> <P> RETAILING: THE TRUMP GAME AND PEE-WEE CLOTHES ARE AMONG THE RETAIL SALES BOMBS  THIS HOLIDAY SEASON.  </P> <P> Donald J. Trump, for a change, came away a loser this Christmas. Joe DiMaggio  struck out. And Pee-Wee Herman had little to giggle about.  </P> <P> Merchandise that was, in one way or another, linked to their names apparently  ranked among the bigger disappointments this holiday gift-giving season.  </P> <P> Solid sales figures aren't available yet. But it's clear that even though many  manufacturers and retailers narrowed their losses by taking fewer chances on  imaginative new products, they still came up with some flops that gathered dust  on store shelves.  </P> <P> Retail industry observers said some of the bombs were products that relied on  simple gimmickry or, perhaps, on little more than the notoriety of the people  associated with them.  </P> <P> "Trump: The Game" suffered from its somewhat misleading image as a clone of the  longtime favorite board game "Monopoly." But even more damaging, analysts said,  was the public's apparent growing disenchantment with the real estate baron  himself.  </P> <P> "If there was a Leona Helmsley game, that would have been a dud, too," said Al  Aguiar, a retailing consultant in Cameron Park, Calif.  </P> <P> Janelle Berger, assistant manager of the Toys International store in Glendale,  said the Trump game eventually sold out at her store. But, she said, it didn't  start moving until it was marked down from $40 to $29, and a sign was put up  indicating that Trump's proceeds would go to charity.  </P> <P> "Trump doesn't need any more money, and I think people realized that," Berger  explained.  </P> <P> Consumers weren't turned on by entertainer Pee-Wee Herman, either. A line of  children's clothing he promoted for J. C. Penney stores reportedly fizzled.  </P> <P> The fashion world saw women's jodhpurs, pants styled along the lines of  horseback riding breeches, get off to a slow start. Alan Millstein, publisher  of Fashion Network Report, said would-be buyers, particularly in the 35-to-54  age bracket, weren't interested in a design that accentuated their hips.  </P> <P> "Women didn't want to look like the back of a horse," he said.  </P> <P> Many other goods that were labeled mild disappointments sold reasonably well  but failed to meet store owners' overblown expectations. For example, "Game  Boy," the much ballyhooed hand-held video game from Nintendo, sold out at many  stores but never generated the hysteria that some retailers anticipated when  word came out earlier this year that Christmas supplies would be limited.  </P> <P> William B. White Jr., a Nintendo spokesman, described Game Boy as a big  success, but he acknowledged that it wasn't in "the Cabbage Patch range,"  referring to the doll that was the rage among young children during previous  holiday seasons.  </P> <P> Although the regular Nintendo game and other video goods remained popular,  retailers said shoppers otherwise turned away from high-tech and electric toys  in favor of more traditional products such as dolls and action figures. Among  the victims: several of the lines of "hyper cars," the speedy battery-powered  vehicles that have been a big hit in Japan.  </P> <P> But even if parents tended to buy toys that forced children to use their  imaginations, they didn't snap up old-fashioned educational gifts. At Toys R  Us, the nation's leading toy retailer, sales of microscopes and telescopes were  soft for the second year in a row, said Vice Chairman Michael Goldstein.  </P> <P> "That's a sad commentary on our times," Goldstein said.  </P> <P> Generally speaking, adult consumer electronics items fared well, but certain  segments of the market suffered. Lee Isgur, an analyst with Paine Webber, said  VCRs still are popular, but sales this Christmas tapered off faster than some  retailers anticipated. The problem, he said, is that many people already own  VCRs and don't need a replacement.  </P> <P> Among camcorders, VHS models seemed to lose out to the sleeker, though more  expensive, 8-millimeter devices. Home computers were a bomb for yet another  Christmas, but that apparently wasn't much of a surprise.  </P> <P> The wallet-size "electronic notebooks" brought out this year by such companies  as Casio and Sharp Electronics also failed to win over customers. They can be  used as appointment calendars, personal telephone directories and memo pads,  but they offer little advantage over pencil and paper, Isgur said.  </P> <P> "You better have an improvement. Otherwise, it won't sell," Isgur said. "The  public is very smart."  </P> <P> At bookstores, the most expensive titles languished. "The pricing in art books  has gotten away a bit from the market," conceded Edward A. Morrow Jr.,  president of the American Booksellers Assn. and owner of a book shop in  Manchester Center, Vt.  </P> <P> Morrow cited "Chagall: The Russian Years 1907-1922" and "Georgia O'Keeffe in  the West," both priced at $100. Morrow's store ordered 12 copies of the  O'Keeffe book and sold only two or three; he received five or six of the  Chagall books and sold none.  </P> <P> The store's biggest flop, though, was "Six Days in Havana" ($25) by James  Michener and his longtime associate, John Kings. It recounts their visit to  Cuba to research Michener's recent novel, "Caribbean." Morrow, who has sold  only one or two of his 25 copies, speculated that Michener fans are mainly  interested in his fiction.  </P> <P> Another bomb at the bookstores: "The DiMaggio Albums," a two-volume pictorial  set about the former New York Yankee slugger that was priced in October at $100  but is now going for less than half that amount.  </P> <P> For novelty items, the picture was mixed. Many customers broke from the pattern  of practical buying to get the "Rock'n Flower," a plastic flower that "dances"  to music.  </P> <P> In other cases, though, the buying public showed its levelheadedness. That's  what Target Stores said it found with the "Grin and Bare It" doll.  </P> <P> The doll, which is supposed to be attached to a car's window, comes with a  string that lets the owner pull down the doll's pants at drivers who pass by.  </P> <P> "It's totally tasteless," said George Hite, Target's vice president of consumer  affairs. "It's a credit to American consumers that they didn't buy it."  </P></p>

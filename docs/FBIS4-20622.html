			<p>Japan   <F P=102>   94FE0393A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGY0 SHIMBUN in Japanese 10 Feb 94  p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0393A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGY0 SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] On February 9, 1994, the Science Council (the  Ministry of Education's advisory body headed by chairman Kenichi  Fukui) put together an interim report entitled, "Promotion of  International Scientific Exchange." It contains a measure  designed to curb the excessive outflow of Japanese scientific  talent so that the present lopsided international scientific  exchange situation can be corrected. Pointing out numerous  barriers to participation foreign researchers face in the areas  of language and housing, the report proposes construction of  additional housing facilities and other measures designed to  remove these obstacles. This is the first time that the Science  Council has put together a report dealing with international  exchange.    The number of researchers sent abroad by Japan's national  universities for the purpose of conducting research or to  present their research findings is now reaching 36,000 a year,  while the number of foreign researchers coming to Japan is no  more than 12,800 a year (according to the 1992 record in both  cases). In other words, the number of Japanese researchers going  abroad far exceeds that of foreign researchers coming to Japan.    In order to alter this situation, the council's interim  report requests the reorganization and strengthening of the  Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), an  organization which serves as an intermediary in the matter of  international scientific exchange. According to the Ministry of  Education, in terms of budget and member lineup, the JSPS, in  charge of scientific fields, compares unfavorably with other  organizations similarly involved in the promotion of  international scientific exchange, and the Ministry of Education  believes that this is what impedes participation of foreign  researchers in exchange programs.    In receiving foreign researchers, moreover, the council is  requesting the JSPS to be flexible and ready to accommodate in  deciding the duration of their stay and processing of  formalities for determining their eligibility. Under the  existing Japanese system, it was not possible to give an  extension to foreign researchers if their stay in Japan does not  straddle two fiscal years since, under the present system, the  account for foreign researchers must be closed at the end of  each fiscal year. Since such a barrier does not exist either in  the United States or Europe, the report describes this system as  "one of the features of the exchange program of which Japan  should be ashamed." (Akito Arima, Director of The Institute of  Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN)).    Whether the enforcement of such a policy would resolve the  problem of "an excessive outflow of Japanese researchers" is an  extremely fine point. According to some sources, within the  Science Council, there are those who contend that "if Japan's  research level is high, then no matter how high a rent may be in  Japan, foreign researchers would not hesitate even a minute to  come to Japan."</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Clarke's promised land The equity market's initially warm response to the Budget speech is partly a mark of sheer relief. There was no hit to pensions, no extension of VAT and no clampdown on enhanced scrip dividends. But while taxes have been increased by only Pounds 1.7bn in 1994-95, it requires an act of faith to believe the government can deliver the spending cuts which constitute the rest of the deal. For next year these consist largely in lopping Pounds 3.5bn off the contingency reserve, which is all right only as long as the money does not creep back on to departmental spending totals. Ultimately, control of spending matters much more to the gilt and equity markets than the immediate promise of Pounds 7bn of under-funding and commitment to balance the budget by the end of the decade. On under-funding, the chancellor did in any case little more than to firm up Mr Lamont's earlier line, while promises for the millennium may eventually be as conveniently forgotten as his predecessor's commitment to balance the budget over the cycle. Mr Clarke, though, seemed apprised of the political advantages of being seen to tackle the PSBR 'once and for all'. A sense that grip is being restored may boost the government's standing, helping both equities and gilts. In theory, the equity market should not be so sanguine about growth if the PSBR really is to be squeezed. There is not much joy for consumers. Mortgage interest relief is definitely on the way out. Those who console themselves with a trip to the sun will find it costs more to drive to the airport and an extra tenner to take off. Yet Mr Clarke's optimism on inflation points to further interest rate cuts, while the determination to boost small companies which pervaded the budget is also encouraging. That could boost both employment and demand.</p>

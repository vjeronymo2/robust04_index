			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Airlines to stop sales in naira International airlines in Nigeria are to stop ticket sales in local currency from February 1 to prevent a backlog of naira earnings until the government clarifies its new foreign exchange regulations. The decision follows warnings by businessmen that exchange rate and interest rate controls introduced in last week's budget are unworkable, and will severely erode legitimate foreign trade. Mr Ebenezer Babatope, transport minister, has threatened to penalise the Board of Airline Representatives for action he called 'embarrassing but also illegal and out of tune with the aspirations of this year's budget'. If he overrules the ban on naira sales, airlines could restrict ticket sales to outside Nigeria. The airlines told the government last July they were worried about a remittance backlog worth the naira equivalent of Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.3m) by the start of January. The airlines believe the 1994 budget could worsen their position as it makes no provision for invisible earnings. It allots 80 per cent of foreign exchange to manufacturing and agriculture. Nigeria's deepening economic crisis has led to fears of rapid naira depreciation. 'Our decision is just to limit the damage,' an airline official said in Lagos yesterday. 'The airlines in Nigeria need an average of Dollars 30m a month to remit their local currency ticket sales to Europe. According to the budget, we won't get anything like that amount and we will be left with an even bigger naira balance.' The government fixes Nigeria-Europe fares at less than the sale price in Europe. Airlines must also base the naira price on an official dollar rate of N22. Last year the market rate was around N45. Angola said yesterday it had abolished differential exchange rates for foreign currency and introduced a single floating exchange regime, Reuter writes from Luanda.</p>

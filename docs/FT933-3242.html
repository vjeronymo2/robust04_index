			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Old-style peasant rebellions - Alison Maitland explains the tradition behind French farm protests, and the way other countries' farmers make their feelings known WHEN Mr David Evans, director general of Britain's National Farmers' Union, joined an international lobby organised by French farmers against the US-EC farm trade deal in Strasbourg last December, he was wounded in the leg by a rocket fired by a French protester. It was symptomatic of a clash of tactics. While French farmers try to blockade Paris today in the latest show of force against the Blair House agreement, their counterparts in Britain and other EC countries, will be trying to win the minds of their politicians. The scenes from French television are familiar - burning tyres, blocked railways, streets piled high with potatoes, truckloads of mud dumped outside government offices, bloodied farmers clashing with riot police. In countries such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the agricultural sector contributes far more to GDP and employs a much larger percentage of the workforce - yet it is French farmers who always steal the headlines with their high-profile protests. That is partly because France is the EC's main agricultural powerhouse and the world's biggest farm exporter after the US, giving it the strength to make or break the Uruguay Round. But French farmers are able to pursue the tradition of jacquerie, or peasant revolt, which goes back to the 14th century, because they have so much domestic support. Today's planned demonstration is by Co-ordination Rurale, a splinter group which broke with the main FNSEA union in 1991, saying it was too moderate. 'There's a large amount of public sympathy for the rural interest, which you don't get to the same extent in other EC countries,' says Mr Brian Gardner, director of EPA Associates, a Brussels-based agricultural consultancy. 'The French have a quasi-religious attitude to food and the rural sector. . . there's still a tremendous tolerance of the poor, under-privileged peasant as the urban majority sees him.' The proportion of the workforce engaged in agriculture has fallen from 22.5 per cent in 1960 to just 6 per cent today, but that is still three times the level of Britain. There are few French families who do not have a relative working on the land or own a rural retreat. French farmers take to the streets before important EC councils like the one which will bring foreign and agriculture ministers together to discuss the US-EC draft farm trade deal next Monday. 'It's part of the theatre, of creating the right atmosphere to get what they want,' says Mr Gardner. 'They have tacit support from the government because of the tenderness of the political relationship.' Most French farmers vote for the right, but there is a strong Communist constituency in the south and the Socialists also have farming support in areas such as Brittany. No party can afford to ignore them. Yet the more peaceful lobbying tactics used by farmers in other leading EC countries are arguably just as effective. As in France, the farming vote is pivotal in Germany, whose government's stance on French demands for a renegotiation of Blair House will be crucial. The Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition, has significant backing from farmers in its southern German power-base and their demands must be taken into account. The German farmers' union, which claims to represent more than 90 per cent of farmers, occasionally launches street demonstrations. But like Britain's NFU, it prefers negotiation. Big protests win little public tolerance in Germany. On the other hand, many smallholders in western Germany also have jobs in factories, increasing support for farming interests in urban communities. Farmers account for 3-4 per cent of the workforce in western Germany, and some 38 per cent are estimated to be part-timers. The German farm lobby has been effective at getting a good deal out of the CAP and the German government, says Prof Wyn Grant of Warwick University, an expert on farming lobbies. 'They've relied on their links with the political parties, particularly the CSU and the FDP, and with civil servants behind the scenes.' He points out that the EC's 'green money' system has until now worked in their favour, preserving them from cuts in Ecu-based farm prices which would normally have resulted from the strength of the D-Mark. The NFU in Britain is one of the country's most powerful pressure groups. Its president has constant access to the agriculture minister and ministry officials studiously consult producers whenever new proposals are on the table. British farmers traditionally vote Conservative and links with the party are close, although support has been ebbing away to the Liberal Democrats in the last couple of years. The union prides itself that its style of lobbying forced changes to the CAP reform proposals which would have put England's large farmers at a particular disadvantage. The NFU has rejected confrontation partly because it already has a struggle maintaining a good public image. Farmers, for all their protests to the contrary, are still popularly regarded as wealthy landowners. Improving their public standing, for example by supporting a Gatt deal even though it will cause farmers further pain, is seen as even more vital now that CAP reforms are making the size of EC support payments more transparent. Nonetheless, today's anti-Gatt demonstration around Paris will be watched closely by farmers both in the EC and in the US.</p>

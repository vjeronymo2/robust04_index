			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Accounts must be given real meaning Sir, In his article (Accountancy Column, September 16) claiming that the Accounting Standards Board may be going in the wrong direction in trying to put more meaning back into the balance sheet, Mr Ron Paterson of Ernst &amp; Young makes the curious statement: 'At best, accounts can be expected to present only a rather stylised model of a company's financial affairs.' How on earth can this possibly be squared with the Companies Act requirement that auditors assure shareholders that the balance sheet gives a true and fair view of the state of affairs of a company? Shareholders are entitled to expect that balance sheets do present such a view. If, in fact, the auditors regard such reports as merely a coded statement of something quite different, which they expect shareholders to understand, it is little wonder that a so-called 'expectations gap' has developed. The puzzle is why Mr Paterson is not suggesting that the format for the auditor's report be changed to state what he appears to believe, namely: 'In our opinion, the accounts give a stylised model of the company's financial affairs which, at best, may be true and fair.' It seems to me that the Accounting Standards Board should be encouraged to continue its efforts with the aim of converting balance sheets into documents which can genuinely be regarded as giving the shareholders a proper view of the state of affairs of companies, while at the same time ensuring that profit and loss accounts give shareholders a proper view of the profits. Mr Paterson's article seems to imply that the two are incompatible which cannot possibly be the case. P C Le Mesurier, Winterset, The Drive, Godalming, Surrey GU7 1PD</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Insurance stocks fall INSURANCE stocks fell in the wake of Friday night's IRA bomb attack in the City as financial analysts struggled to put a figure on the value of the blast damage. Estimates varied wildly but there appeared to be some consensus of as much as Pounds 1bn. Commercial Union lost 4 to 425p. The company will be affected not only by the disruption to its business but also because it owns 20 per cent of its headquarters, which were rendered unusable by the explosion. Sun Alliance, cushioned by reinsurance but still estimated by one analyst to be in line for a Pounds 40m hit from the attack, fell 4 to to 262p and even General Accident, whose exposure will be limited because of its concentration on personal clients, lost 5 to 435p. Mr Richard Wynne-Griffith of BZW's insurance team said: 'This is another blow to already weakened balance sheets and unlike a hurricane it is not necessarily a one-off incident.' Midland advance The London market picked up rumours sweeping Hong Kong that a 400p a share bid for Midland would be launched on Wednesday and the UK clearing bank's shares jumped 16 to 372p with a hefty 10m shares traded. Observers said that Hongkong &amp; Shanghai bank's parent company, which proposed an agreed takeover a month ago, was prepared to make an all-paper bid valued at around 420p. There is a belief that Hongkong wants to undermine an anticipated attempt by Lloyds Bank to make a rival offer. County NatWest was highlighting to clients yesterday the logic of a rival bid from Lloyds, which eased a penny to 395p after being 6 off at one stage. Allied-Lyons weak Comments by Sir Gordon Borrie, director general of the Office of Fair Trading, hit Allied-Lyons particularly hard, as he questioned some of the long-term supply agreements between national brewers and the pub-owning groups. Sir Gordon told the AGM of Camra, the real ale lobby group, that long-term supply agreements between brewers and pub retailing companies were becoming an alternative tie and that the agreement between Foster's, brewer of Courage in the UK, and Grand Metropolitan should not be seen as a precedent for seven-year supply agreements. Analysts said these remarks appeared to be specifically aimed at the Allied-Lyons deal under which it has kept a 60 per cent beer supply agreement in pubs owned by Brent Walker. Allied shares fell 12 to 612p. Whitbread 'A' lost 6 to 425p in sympathy. Whitbread is believed to be less advanced than Bass in meeting the Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruling on brewing ties. Bass gained 12 to 600p. Construction group John Mowlem rose 13 to 148p despite a crash in 1991 profits to Pounds 3m from Pounds 34m. The market was looking for around Pounds 10m, but the shares were marked higher after Mowlem said it was withdrawing completely from commercial property development activities. Higgs &amp; Hill, with results due tomorrow, gained 8 to 82p in sympathy, while building materials company Redland climbed 14 to 538p on hopes of an early end to the recession and speculation about lower interest rates. Worries about Barclays' exposure to Olympia &amp; York's financial problems on the day that the Canadian property group was expected to try and persuade its lenders to reschedule more than Pounds 2bn worth of debts prompted the shares to drop 12 to 315p, the biggest percentage fall of any of the FT-SE 100 companies yesterday. Turnover in Scottish Power, was a very active 18m shares, with the price rising 2 to 98p. Scot Hydro gained 2 to 100p, taking the shares up 22p since the election result and back to their partly paid flotation price. The Electricity Package slipped Pounds 30 to Pounds 3010. Turnover in Rolls-Royce surged to 8.9m and the shares initially jumped 7 after it was reported that Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific was about to place a Pounds 300m order. The shares closed 3 up at 170p. Trafalgar House moved 7 forward to 132p, after its J. Brown subsidiary won a Pounds 350m power station contract. Turnover in Queens Moat Houses reached 10m, as the shares fell 2 to 80p. Dealers believe that close examination of the sector after Friday's buying spree revealed the company's earnings recovery to be lower than that of its rivals. BT put on 6 to 341 in high turnover of 9.2m, as investors continued to buy stock in anticipation of 'better times', now that the threat of a Labour government and greater regulation has faded. Reassurance about the company's prospects and outlook following the series of analysts' visits lifted Cable &amp; Wireless 13 to 558p. US buying continued to lift Vodafone Group. The shares gained 7 to 356p. Kidder Peabody Runyon of the US reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. Defensive chemicals companies lost ground in the wake of the general election. BOC and Allied Colloids, which are both big dollar earners, fell 13 to 663p and 7 to 203p respectively. Thames Television improved 7 to 168p after an announcement that it was jointly planning the development of a new satellite television programme service with BBC Enterprises.

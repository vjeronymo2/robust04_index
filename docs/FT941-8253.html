			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Selling the railways The privatisation of British Rail is moving into the implementation stage. After the furore in parliament over the legislation, the government's ambitious plans to privatise the railways are now being put into effect. A new industrial sector must be created and financed to operate the privatised rail network. The privatisation of passenger rail services as 24 rail operating companies will present early opportunities for private sector involvement. The first route to be put out to tender, the Gatwick Express between London and Gatwick airport, is already running as a shadow franchise under the existing management. Later this year, the franchise for running the line will be put out to tender. Several more shadow franchises will be established in April, in preparation for tendering early next year. On most routes, the managers will be encouraged to lead management buyouts. At the same time as passenger services are privatised, other parts of British Rail will be prepared for sale. These include freight operations and the three leasing companies that will lease rolling stock to the operating companies. BR's maintenance operations are to be privatised as more than a dozen competing companies. And Railtrack, the organisation created to run the rail infrastructure, will take over responsibility for the network from April. The success of rail privatisation, however, will be judged by the benefits it brings for passengers. Ensuring that the customer sees real improvements in services requires the emergence of competitive and entrepreneurial rail operators. Businesses thinking about entering this new market - or providing finance for it - will need to be convinced that there are profitable opportunities. Charges There must be grounds for concern, therefore, over the charges that operators will have to pay for using the railway network. The charges will rightly reflect the operating costs of Railtrack on the routes covered by each franchise. These include track maintenance, signalling costs, depot charges and the cost of electricity. Amazingly, some of these were not allocated to particular lines under BR's internal accounting system. But the charges also reflect a Treasury target that Railtrack should make a 5.6 per cent return on its assets, valued at around Pounds 6.5bn. The rate of return will rise to 8 per cent within four years. Tight target This target is excessively tight. An 8 per cent rate of return is unnecessarily steep for what is essentially a utility. As for the value put on the assets, it can plausibly be argued that it should be much higher than Pounds 6.5bn, since BR still owns a lot of land in inner-city sites. Alternatively, it might be set much lower given the age of much of the track, signalling and stations and their run-down state. What is clear is that applying such a high rate of return to this asset value will add around Pounds 500m to the charges that rail operators must pay. Bumping up charges in this way could lead to the rail network being used inefficiently at much less than capacity. It will also mean that fewer of the franchises will be profitable without public subsidy. This creates a merry-go-round in which the revenue extracted by the Treasury from Railtrack must be paid out in subsidies to rail operators to pay higher-than-necessary track charges. The aim of these arrangements is to concentrate public subsidy for passenger services on one part of the system - the rail operators. The operator can, of course, still make a profit while receiving a subsidy, by maximising revenues and efficiency. However, businesses thinking about entering this new market may find the prospect of relying on Treasury subsidies for the duration of a franchise less than appetising. This will be especially the case if the government agrees to franchise periods as long as 15 years to encourage operators to invest in new rolling stock. The arrangements for setting Railtrack's charges are likely to reduce the attractiveness of investment opportunities in rail operations. Given the need to attract businesses into this new sector, this cannot be an outcome that is welcome to supporters of privatisation.</p>

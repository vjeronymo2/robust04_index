			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] No sooner had we broadcast that report [on the  fighting] in our earlier edition than NPFL [National Patriotic  Front of Liberia] spokesman Joe Mulbah called us up to dispute  it, and Robin White asked him what they had to say:    [Begin recording] [Mulbah] Indeed, we are shocked by the  news report from your stringer, Niinartey Allison. I mean, it  is absolutely false. We just called (Killer Bay). Our  commanders are all there. In fact, they are jubilating today --  it is our leader's birthday -- so they are shocked by the news.  It is not true, but what emanated from Monrovia is that some  disgruntled elements who happened to have once lived in Bong  County are getting together. They want to attack us. As you  know, various forces in Liberia have tried to fight us. They  consider us as an elephant; everybody is trying to get a piece  of the elephant. They have all tried their best, but to no  avail.    [White] But has this Bong Movement attacked your forces at  all?    [Mulbah] They have never attacked us. This is.... [pauses]  I mean, it is indeed a shock. As I told you, we do not know  where Niinartey got his story from, but you can have a dinner  party in (Killer Bay). You can equally have a big party in  Salala. The Salala area is under complete control. I just saw  General Vanney, Gen. Gueye, and Gen. Siafa Nomadia all in  control of those areas that your reporter was referring to this  afternoon. Things are well, and this can indeed be attested to  by the UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia] people we have in  our area who have been deployed.    [White] But why are people then fleeing?    [Mulbah] People are not fleeing. This is why I say we are  shocked. We don't know where you got your story from....    [White, interrupting] This is relief officials....    [Mulbah, interrupting] Probably, your....    [White, interrupting] This is relief officials. They are  saying that thousands of people have fled the fighting.    [Mulbah] It is not true. We are not fighting, and I think  you need to send Niinartey Allison here. We are prepared to  take him at the places he referred to to confirm the story.    [White] But hasn't Charles Taylor himself requested ECOMOG  to send some troops to the area immediately to bring things  under control?    [Mulbah] We have asked for troops to be deployed in our  areas as per the Cotonou Accord. This is what was said on our  radio.    [White] So, it is not a special request to go and fight  these Bong people?    [Mulbah] No, it is not a special request. I think we are  capable. We are in a position to defend ourselves, but we are  not ready to do anything otherwise but to abide by the Cotonou  Peace Accord. [end recording]</p>

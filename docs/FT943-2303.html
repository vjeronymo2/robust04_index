			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Arts: A cappella prowess and uninspired Mahler - Music in London St. John's, Smith Square was unusually well filled on Friday for music of the past half century; for the BBC Singers were celebrating their 70th anniversary. Not to be confused with the much larger BBC Symphony Chorus, who are stalwart amateurs, the 24 Singers are professionals of great technical prowess. This virtuoso anniversary programme, all a cappella, showed them off brilliantly. It included not only two treasures of the repertoire which they themselves premiered, Britten's Hymn to St. Cecilia and Poulenc's war-time Figure humaine, but a new commission from Iannis Xenakis. Sea Nymphs is a fractured setting of Ariel's 'Full fathom five': these are plainly Cubist nymphs, voices arranged in spiky tone-clusters, extraordinarily difficult to pitch. (Each singer consulted his or her own tuning fork assiduously.) As a collective feat, it was fascinating; at later performances it may even begin to sound like fun. Britten's twinkling Hymn could not have been feater nor more charming. The splendid eight-section Figure humaine, a wartime plea for the Liberation, needed only more fluent French in the quickest passages. Messiaen's Cinq Rechants, an old BBC Singers favourite, was all colour and sexy vitality, and in Ligeti's Three Fantasies the solo entries were as poised and telling as the rich, aqueous choral textures (tone-clusters again, but succulent ones). The conductor was Simon Joly, who seems able to inspire the Singers to practically anything. It would be hard to claim that Giuseppe Sinopoli has inspired the Philharmonia much in the several years he has spent with them. The trouble has not been with the orchestra. Even now Sinopoli's left hand has scarcely any functional independence from his right, which is not very expressive either; to weed out clotted textures, he needs recording engineers. Sunday's Royal Festival Hall concert was fairly typical. Edita Gruberova was originally billed to deliver several Strauss songs before the main work, Mahler's Fourth Symphony; but her place was taken by Angela Maria Blasi, who brought just three songs (stylishly turned, though 'Morgen' was over-slow and 'Zueignung' over-quick). Thus we got Don Juan as a Sinopoli extra: loud and puppy-eager, much of it an undifferentiated welter of sound through which only the leading voices penetrated. For brief moments one heard the Philharmonia's admirable first-desks doing their best. The Mahler Fourth was friendly, well-meant, by turns under-pointed and too heavily emphasis-ridden. The slow movement was at least heartfelt, though the sudden radiant outburst near the end sounded ordinary. It took Miss Blasi to bring the performance to real, musical life with the child's-vision Finale, in which her knowing tact and her pleasing mezzo-ish timbre were lovely to hear.</p>

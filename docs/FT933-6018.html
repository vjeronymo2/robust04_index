			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei registers its fifth consecutive gain HOPES of an imminent cut in the official discount rate helped the Nikkei average to register its fifth consecutive gain, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei rose 121.01 to 20,912.69. Index-linked trading supported activity in the morning session, but lost steam later, the index falling to a day's low of 20,747.67 in the afternoon before rising to a high of 20,924.09 just before the close. Volume came to 205m shares and advances led declines by 615 to 332, with 217 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 7.09 at 1,677.63. Market participants hoped that the government's flotation of East Japan Railway shares, which will be listed in October, would revive trading. The public offering price for the 1.4m shares was fixed at Y380,000 after the market closed. Fujitsu, the day's most active issue, firmed Y5 to Y839, supported by hopes about the government's investment in telecommunication infrastructure, and the company's development of a shopping cart with a scanner which reads bar codes. Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone appreciated Y8,000 to Y955,000. Strong demand in semiconductor chips boosted Nikon, which climbed Y12 to Y937. The company is likely to revise upwards its sales forecasts forchipmaking equipment for the year to next March. Housing issues were strong on hopes of renewed demand in the near term. Sekisui House rose Y30 to Y1,440 and Daiwa House Y40 to Y1,710. Steels were lower on profit-taking: Nippon Steel shed Y6 to Y375 and Kawasaki Steel lost Y9 to Y365. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 27.50 to 22,773.75 in volume of 20.2m shares. Roundup THE REGION was quiet and mixed yesterday, reflecting the UK holiday and other closures in Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta. AUSTRALIA set a six-year high, the All Ordinaries index adding 7.4 at 1,956.0, its best since before the global stock market crash in October 1987. Turnover fell from ADollars 810m to ADollars 366m, but brokers reported US-based buying on a combination of a higher gold bullion price and a favourable interpretation of Australia's current account deficit. Media stocks were among the star performers, the media shares sub-index rising 265.1, or 1.8 per cent, to 14,353.0 after weekend claims that they were undervalued. News Corp moved forward 10 cents to ADollars 10.04 and John Fairfax was 19 cents higher at ADollars 2.95. SEOUL tumbled in thin trading as it extended last week's 6 per cent decline, the composite index falling a further 17.70, or 2.6 per cent, to 672.12 in volume of 12.9m shares. Share prices were hit by speculation that the government will not include measures to boost the stock market today when it unveils a package of follow-up measures aimed at minimising the adverse effect of the newly enforced financial system, requiring the use of proper identities in all financial transactions. NEW ZEALAND was dragged lower by falls in Telecom, Carter Holt Harvey and Fletcher Challenge, although Brierley Investments bucked the trend, rising 4 cents to a 1993 high of NZDollars 1.25 on speculation about a large asset sale, later denied by chief executive Mr Paul Collins. The NZSE-40 index finished 14.40 down at 1,984.10 in turnover of NZDollars 65m. SINGAPORE consolidated, a 12.82 fall to 1,995.10 in the Straits Times Industrial index aggravated by a decline in Metro Holdings, which traded ex-rights for the first time. MANILA was lifted by Friday's advance of Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 in Philippine Long Distance Telephone on the American Stock Exchange. The composite index rose 10.28 to 1,776.07. BOMBAY, closed today for a Moslem holiday, fell 35.17 to 2,633.79 in thin trading.</p>

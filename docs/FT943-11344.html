			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Procter steps up attack on Unilever's Persil Power Procter &amp; Gamble has unleashed a new attack on Unilever, its arch-rival in the soap wars, with an exhibition of more frayed and washed-out boxer shorts plus full-page advertisements today in UK newspapers knocking Unilever's new-generation soap powder. Procter paraded the shorts yesterday - as well as pyjamas and a garish shirt  -in a series of photo-sessions and media briefings highlighting the results of independent tests carried out on Unilever's 'rebalanced' version of its recently launched Persil Power. The Persil Power formula was amended following Procter's original claim that the detergent's manganese-based 'accelerator' could damage clothes after frequent washing. Procter said yesterday that new test results showed that even the weakened version of the detergent could cause damage. The newspaper advertisements placed by Procter do not name Persil Power, but state that 'only Ariel (Procter's soap powder) washes so clean yet so safe' and that Ariel 'does not contain the accelerator'. The advertisements warn the public that even if they switch brands, 'manganese accelerator residues can be left on your clothes', and continue to cause colour fading. Procter says it has been warning the public about the product - also marketed as Omo Power and Skip Power elsewhere in Europe - because it does not want to be blamed for any damage. Unilever claims that Procter's actions stem from the fact that it, too, plans to launch a new-generation detergent in the autumn; while Ariel Future will not contain the manganese-based product, it will be promoted as having very similar characteristics to Persil Power, Unilever says. Unilever said yesterday that Procter's latest test results - conducted by independent test house the British Textile Technology Group - were 'very old hat'. The test data, collected in laboratory conditions, were not as valid as Unilever's field trials which had been entirely successful, the company said. Earlier this month, Unilever published extracts of independent tests it had commissioned which were said to prove the detergent's safety and effectiveness. The Consumers' Association, the UK consumer group, is currently testing Persil Power and results are due in about 10 weeks. Marks and Spencer, which manufactured some of the garments used in the tests, is also scrutinising the product. Meanwhile, the UK tabloid press is beginning to turn Persil Power into the 'galloping gangrene' of the detergent world. This week The Sun has had tales of silk boxer shorts being 'eaten'.</p>

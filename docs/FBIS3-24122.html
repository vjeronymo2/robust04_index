			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, deputy speaker of </F> the Georgian parliament, by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent  Yelena Imedashvili; place and date not given: "Deputies Hope for  Accord"]    [Text] The Russian-Georgian agreements reached during  President Yeltsin's visit to Georgia are causing controversy in  both Georgia and Russia. The parliamentary majority in the  Georgian Supreme Council has come up with an initiative to hold  an interparliamentary dialogue with Russian State Duma deputies.  Our OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent contacted the head of the  Georgian delegation, the parliament's deputy speaker, Vakhtang  Rcheulishvili.    [Rcheulishvili] We are aware of the irreconcilable positions  of some deputies on both sides. But this is precisely why the  interparliamentary dialogue is so important. After signing a  broad agreement between our countries, it is necessary to do  everything possible to establish partnership ties with the  Russian Federal Assembly. Georgia has signed agreements on  interparliamentary cooperation with many countries--Turkey,  Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Armenia. We need to sign such a  document with Russia. Interparliamentary cooperation assumes the  setting up of support groups in both parliaments. The next stage  is to establish liaison between various parliamentary  commissions. First and foremost economic. Keeping in mind the  close integration between our countries in the past and, to a  certain extent, in the future. Georgia and Russia have similar  problems. Both Georgia and Russia are multinational states; they  have certain problems with autonomies. Both Russia and Georgia  are states in the process of building a democratic society. This  is a difficult road, and we have a huge common sphere of  interests.    [Imedashvili] Then how do you explain the negative attitude  on the part of a number of Duma deputies to the Russian-Georgian  agreements?    [Rcheulishvili] In my opinion, one of the main reasons is  that Russian deputies lack true information on the events in  Georgia. Correcting mistakes should be a joint effort--of the  parliaments, governments, and information agencies. Imperial  forces are quite widely represented in the Russian Duma. But we  came to Russia to talk in a calm atmosphere devoid of  ideological or accusatory overtones. Over the past few years  this has frequently been the mode of conversation, and has  brought no good to either Georgia or Russia. I believe that we  will find a common language. After all, good-neighbor relations  and strategic cooperation are in the true national interest of  our countries.    [Imedashvili] Are you not concerned about a potential  meeting  with Zhirinovskiy?    [Rcheulishvili] I am not burning with desire to meet with  him, but this possibility cannot be precluded. Zhirinovskiy's  fascist statements are unpleasant; however, he alone does not  make policy in the Duma. I believe that his real role has been  somewhat exaggerated. We will not refuse to meet with  Zhirinovskiy and representatives of his faction. We will speak  to all who have been elected to the Duma by the Russian people.    [Imedashvili] In which faction do you anticipate finding  allies?    [Rcheulishvili] Of course, we have more in common with the  democratic forces. Mostly we are interested in the 12 December  bloc. It has not yet taken shape as a faction, but it is a very  promising group of professionals and specialists. We expect  support on the part of Russia's Choice and other factions. We  count on healthy forces which understand that for Georgia,  Russia will always be a great partner and neighbor, despite  temporary difficulties and disagreements.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Sarajevo aid airlift still halted HEAVY shelling of Sarajevo's Moslem-held suburbs yesterday drove hundreds of people from their homes and forced UN aid workers to put off resuming the airlift to the besieged Bosnian capital, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. With no sign of a let-up in the fighting in Bosnia, political tension grew in neighbouring Serbia after moderate Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Panic was told he was ineligible to run against hardline nationalist Slobodan Milosevic for the Serbian presidency. Sarajevo radio said Serb fighters shelled the western suburb of Otes late into the evening. Earlier in the day 600 civilians fled from the district, which has been the target of fierce assault since Thursday. As fighting continued in Otes and other outer districts of Sarajevo, UN relief workers said they would not resume supply flights until Monday at the earliest and said they might consider postponing them indefinitely. 'If they decide there is an acceptable level of risk they may carry on,' a UN relief official said. 'But the problem is we have had two planes fired at and hit this week.' The United Nations refugee agency said yesterday it was going to try to take aid into war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina by train, an idea rejected until now as too dangerous. Flights were halted two days later after an aircraft carrying the chief of UN peacekeepers in Bosnia, General Philippe Morillon, was hit by gunfire.</p>

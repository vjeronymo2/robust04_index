			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Wary businessmen welcome Mideast progress: Casablanca talks offer good contacts, but doubts remain International businessmen and bankers yesterday lauded recent political and macro-economic changes in the Middle East but delivered a hard-headed assessment of further reforms needed to open economies and stimulate large flows of investment into the region. While more than 1,000 businessmen have come to the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit in Casablanca, most are likely to go away with a pile of business cards and the seeds of future investments rather than signed contracts. 'We've made some good contacts here, though whether anything will actually transpire only time will tell,' said Mr Abraham Glezeman, president of Inter-Power, a US company seeking to develop a power plant in the Gaza Strip. 'But it exceeded my expectations.' For most businessmen at the Casablanca casbah, peace moves in the region are a necessary but not sufficient condition for greater investment and better integrated economies. They want further reforms, including speeding up stalled privatisation programmes, removing trade barriers - among them the Arab economic boycott of Israel - abolishing excessive import restrictions and laws which restrict foreign equity holdings, reinforcing intellectual property rights, guaranteeing full repatriation of profits and dividends, granting better tax holidays and ensuring international mechanisms for the resolution of disputes. Mr Tom Vaughan, a director of Unilever, said: 'Most businesses have many places where they can invest their money and they are looking for a business environment of reasonable risks and good returns. It's still too early for specific deals but its very good to see Arab and Israeli delegations together talking about business, trade and economics.' Mr Sandy Allan, president of Coca-Cola Middle East, said his company had invested Dollars 350m in the region in the past five years and was seeking further expansion: 'There are problems but the potential for profitable businesses in the Middle East and North Africa is still excellent.' Some bankers said they were enthusiastic about the strengthening of emerging markets in the Middle East especially in Morocco, Jordan and Israel. Mr Daniel Smaller of Union Bank of Switzerland's emerging equity markets division, said the conference 'supports the view that these are exciting markets going through positive changes. For the first time the additional risk of geopolitical instability has been reduced, so price/earnings rations are expanding, providing investors with opportunities to participate.' However, Sir William Ryrie, executive director of Barings, said that of a total Dollars 62bn of equity flows into emerging markets last year, only Dollars 200m went to the Middle East. 'The peace process slightly improves our type of business,' he said. 'But the Middle East is way behind the game.' It emerged yesterday the first merchant bank to be set up in North Africa has just received approval from the central bank in Tunis. International Merchant Bank will have capital of between Dollars 3m and Dollars 5m and brings together individual shareholders from North African countries, institutions like the World Bank's International Finance Corporation which has contributed Dollars 300,000, and two European commercial banks - Societe Marseillaise de Credit and Creditanstalt Finanziaria, the Italian subsidiary of Austria's Creditanstalt Bankverein. But potential investors in the tourism sector are most likely to leave Casablanca with real deals in their pockets. Unfolding Middle East peace has increased public perceptions of regional stability, opened borders and unlocked the development of multi-destination packages. Delegates are expected to establish a regional tourism promotion and marketing body. Mr Basil Jardaneh, chairman of Royal Jordanian, Jordan's state-owned airline, said it was adding 20 flights next month. Mr Peter Till, a vice-president of Marriott, said he was spending time at the conference consolidating a planned project in the Gaza Strip for a hotel with a private Palestinian company. He said Marriott was aggressively seeking opportunities in Israel and looking at other Middle East countries. 'We are seeing increased stability and an improved business climate and we want to do more business.' Some companies are concerned about appeals by Israeli and Palestinian leaders for the private sector to alleviate poverty in Palestinian areas. 'How do we square this with seeking good returns on investment?' asked Mr Peter Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone investment bank of the US. The extent of the difficulties ahead for the Middle East in attracting private capital was demonstrated by the absence of Japanese companies. Mr Riki Kogure, head of Middle East division of Itochu, the large trading house, said only 1.2 per cent of total Japanese investment overseas went to the Middle East, largely due to a cultural gaps between Arabs and Japanese and the absence of high-level political links. Japanese and other foreign companies will be critical to financing and executing the multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects being put forward at the summit. Mr Anthony Pellegrini, manager of the World Bank infrastructure unit, said money from domestic budgets and concessional finance was 'nowhere near sufficient to deal with the infrastructure needs of the region'. Mr Eberhard von Koerber, president of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering combine, said the region needed Dollars 80bn over 10 years to meet basic power generation needs alone and warned: 'If the regulatory environment does not allow capital to make adequate returns, then we have to be very cautious.'</p>

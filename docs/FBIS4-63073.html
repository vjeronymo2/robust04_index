			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM reporter Viktar Kotaw: "Russian Pilots </F> Remain in Belarus"]    [Text] The fate of the Russian Air Force regiment,  stationed in Zyabrawtsy near Homel, has been determined. Pilots  from the neighboring state will remain in Belarus until the year  2000. At this point, the arrangement is said to satisfy both  sides because following the withdrawal of some of the Russian  troops from this oblast, local authorities found themselves  faced with the problem of efficient use and maintenance of  military settlements.</p>

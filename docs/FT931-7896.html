			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Metsa-Serla cuts losses by half to FM290m METSA-SERLA, the Finnish forestry group, cut losses after financial items to FM290m (Dollars 49m) in 1992, less than half the previous year's FM635m deficit. The improvement came despite FM275m in exchange rate losses and reflected the benefits of cost-cutting, improved efficiency and the fall in the value of the markka. There will again be no dividend. The group believes it will show a profit after financial items in 1993, with sales increasing to FM8bn. It says its strategy of product specialisation should assist the recovery, although it expects general market conditions to remain difficult. 'Metsa-Serla's main targets are to improve profitability, secure a good cash flow and reduce indebtedness,' it said. Sales for 1992 rose to FM7.75bn from FM7.74bn, although allowing for divestments, the increase was 9 per cent. The devaluation of the markka compensated for the sharp fall in market prices, the company said. The operating margin climbed to FM1.23bn from FM896m while operating profits rose to FM718m from FM391m. Corrugated board and tissue was the group's best performing sector, increasing operating profits to FM352m from FM242m. Paper and paperboard produced an operating profit of FM199m, up from FM190m, while sawn paper and pulp managed FM167m of profits after 1991's FM41m losses. Hafnia, the Danish insurance group which is up for sale, has sold Cambio + Valoren, its Swiss asset management bank, to Union Bancare Privee, the Geneva-based private bank, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The deadline for offers to buy Hafnia, which was placed on the market last autumn, passed last week.</p>

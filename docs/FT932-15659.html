			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Throgmorton's painful fightback - Investment Trusts THROGMORTON is an example of an investment trust that lost its way in the 1980s. According to Micropal, it has been one of the 20 worst performers over the past five years, with a fall of 14 per cent (mid-market to mid-market with net income re-invested). Admittedly, Throgmorton specialises in a sector - smaller companies - which has been battered by recession. But consistently its long-term performance is below the sector average: 11th out of 16 over 10 years, 14th of 18 over five, and 15th of 19 over three. The big problem has been ventures into outside areas, especially property. The chairman, Lord Stewartby, says: 'The strategy is to get the trust back to basics. During the second half of the 1980s, it increased debt in order to acquire extraneous interests. A lot of activity is devoted to disengaging from those areas.' This policy has taken longer than expected to implement. A joint venture with Cussins Property took a year to unravel and required Throgmorton to accept property assets in settlement of debts. Some of that property was sold in 1992, and the trust hopes to dispose of more in 1993. On the house-building side, disposals have taken time because, as Stewartby explains: 'You can't sell half-developed sites.' Even unwinding an investment in art dealer Arthur Ackerman has left Throgmorton with Pounds 1m worth of residual stock in pictures. The stake in fund management group Framlington has been cut gradually to 49 per cent via the sale of two tranches of stock to French bank Credit Commercial de France. The remaining holding was valued on November 30 at Pounds 27.9m. The best news for the trust, however, is that there are signs of a revival in both smaller company shares and its own relative performance. Over the year to April 1, the trust's investors enjoyed a gain of 32.7 per cent, placing it sixth out of 24 funds in the sector. It takes time for a trust to recover from a problem period, though, particularly as the dividend was nearly halved at the end of 1990. Although some smaller company specialists trade at a premium to net assets, Throgmorton shares trade at a 21 per cent discount. Throgmorton was founded in 1957 and named after its headquarters in Throgmorton Street, close to the Bank of England. It has always specialised in smaller companies and has a sister trust, Throgmorton 1000, which looks at companies even smaller than the main trust will consider. Its present manager is Sally Hepher, a 30-year-old Oxford graduate who managed funds at Barings before joining Framlington in 1990. She stresses that management is a team effort, and has seven others to help her. The trust defines smaller companies as those with market capitalisations of under Pounds 200m. Hepher says she is looking for good-quality companies which can produce above-average growth in turnover - organically as well as by acquisitions - in profits, earnings, retained earnings and dividends. She says she is optimistic about the prospects for smaller company shares, as they are relatively more exposed to the UK domestic economy which, she feels, is improving. 'The companies we invest in have done a great deal to control costs,' says Hepher, which leaves them well placed to gain from the economic recovery. The 10 largest stocks are Framlington, Davis Service, Throgmorton 1000 Smaller Companies, Watson &amp; Philip, Senior Engineering, John Waddington, More O'Ferrall, Trinity International, Frost Group and Suter. Some legacies of the past remain for Hepher to overcome. One storm cloud hanging over the trust has been Pounds 58m of convertible stock issued in 1988 and 1989. Conversion into shares will be profitable once the share price gets above 108p; unfortunately, with the shares trading now at around 58p, that prospect looks a long way off. What makes it worse for Throgmorton is that the stockholders have a put option, giving them the right on April 30 to redeem the convertible at 117.5 per cent of par. It became clear some time ago that many might well take up that option. landing Throgmorton with a hefty bill. The news is not all bad. Throgmorton has been accumulating reserves steadily to try to meet the liability. Furthermore, some stockholders acquired the convertible as part of the consideration for acquiring Framlington. Realising the convertible for cash would land them with a hefty capital gains tax bill. To solve their problem, and help itself, Throgmorton has proposed issuing new stock at 117.5 per cent of the previous par value but with the same coupon. For those who do transfer, this means a 17.5 per cent increase in income. Holders of Pounds 13.5m of stock have agreed already to accept the new securities and Throgmorton hopes more will do so. For the others, it has arranged a Pounds 30m bank loan to meet the redemption cost. It plans to repay that by selling its remaining property and unquoted interests. Once the loan is out of the way, might a revived Throgmorton be an interesting play on the small companies sector? After all, few trusts can be bought on a 20 per cent-plus discount these days. Robbie Robertson, of NatWest Securities, thinks there is an optimistic case for the trust. 'So many of the things that gave the trust a complex structure are beginning to sort themselves out,' he says. The convertibles will be replaced by cheap borrowings and warrants will be exercised. Framlington's funds under management are rising and the property issue is under control. What will be left, says Robertson, is one of the larger trusts devoted to smaller companies. Key facts Net assets per share are around 74p. That puts the shares, at 58p on April 6, on a discount of 21 per cent, according to NatWest Securities. The dividend yield is 5 per cent and the annual management fee around 0.93 per cent. Board The chairman, Lord Stewartby, was economic secretary to the Treasury from 1983 to 1987. Other executive directors are Peter Courtney (finance); Paul Loach (managing director of Framlington) and Brian Rout (managing director of the property subsidiary). Non-executives are Sir Victor Garland, a director of the Prudential; Richard Good, also chairman of Throgmorton Dual; Michael Orr, chairman of Molins; and Michael Windsor, executive chairman of Horstmann Group. Savings scheme and Pep details The minimum monthly investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 25, or Pounds 250 for a lump sum. There are no dealing charges. The trust qualifies for full Pep status but no specific plan is linked to it.</p>

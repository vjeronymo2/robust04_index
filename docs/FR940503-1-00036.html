			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, EPA is considering limiting appeals from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presiding officer to the EAB. Appeals from the initial decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a field citation would not be of right, but would be at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion of the EAB. For example, a party seeking an appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the initial decision would file a motion with the EAB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeking leave to appeal. There would only be an appeal to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EAB if they granted such motion, or reviewed the initial decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sua sponte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Absent such review by the EAB, the initial decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the presiding officer would become the final order of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency. EPA expects that in the typical situation the EAB would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not hear an appeal from either party given the expected nature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the minor violations. Appeals typically would be limited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases with unique factual or legal circumstances. This would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conserve the Agency's resources for hearing and deciding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative appeals, and allow their use for APA cases and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more complex cases. At the same time, where appropriate the EAB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could hear an appeal. This would minimize the chance of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> erroneous deprivation of an individual interest, and at the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time maximize the efficient use of scarce Agency resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Modified 40 CFR Part 28_Consolidated Rules of Practice Governing the Administrative Assessment of Civil Penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Various Statutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the second option considered and proposed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency, the hearings on field citations would be conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to the procedures in EPA <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s proposed non-APA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidated rules of practice for the administrative assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of penalties, with appropriate revisions to conform with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Air Act. (See proposed 40 CFR part 28, 56 FR 29996 (July  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1, 1991)). In a separate rulemaking, the Agency would propose to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amend Part 28, where appropriate, to make that regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to field citations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Basis for Hearing Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules of procedure proposed as 40 CFR Part 28 are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to consolidate under uniform rules of practice the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following non-APA administrative penalty programs that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently administered by the Agency: Class I administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties under sections 309(g) and 311(b)(6) of the Clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water Act, section 109(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 325(b) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-toKnow Act (EPCRA); and administrative penalties under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1423(c) of the Safe Drinking Water Act and sections 325 (c) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) of EPCRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 28 was proposed to consolidate and harmonize certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA procedural rules and guidance for the administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of civil penalties under various statutes, where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress gave EPA authority to conduct non-APA hearings. In line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with this Congressional intent, proposed part 28 is designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide streamlined administrative penalty procedures that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to assure the protection of basic constitutional rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 113(d)(3) of the Act explicitly states that hearings on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> field citations are not subject to the APA provisions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearings (5 U.S.C. 554), and that recipients of a field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citation must be provided a reasonable opportunity to be heard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to present evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The basic hearing requirements of the field citation program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are therefore similar in structure to those programs proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclusion under 40 CFR part 28. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inclusion of hearings on CAA field citations in part 28  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be consistent with the goals stated by EPA when it proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these consolidated rules for non-APA hearing procedures under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various statutes_reduction of confusion by Agency decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makers and enforcement staffs, provision for the regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community of an essentially uniform set of procedural rules, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity with Congress' and EPA's desire to employ expedited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty assessment procedures. At the same time, the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 28 procedures are designed to provide non-APA hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures under a wide range of statutory provisions, involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil penalties ranging from $5,000 for each day of violation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $25,000 per violation. This contrasts with the field citation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, involving no more than $5,000 per day of violation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minor violations of the Act or its implementing regulations. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, adoption of part 28 procedures for the field citation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program would also involve two separate procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative assessment of civil penalties under the CAA, parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28 and 22. Adding the field citation program to part 28,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, would promote a greater potential for non-APA multimedia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement actions by providing a common administrative forum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the part 22 option, the currently proposed part 28  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures would be modified in certain ways to account for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain aspects of the field citation program. These are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Hearing Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the modified part 28, the field citation would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued as an administrative complaint. Unlike proposed part 28,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, the field citation complaints would not require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification by an Agency attorney. Within thirty days after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service of the citation, the Respondent must file a response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting a hearing. A 90-day extension of time to respond may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be granted by the complainant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As in part 22 practice, the Respondent may simultaneously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursue informal settlement and a hearing. During settlement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiations, the parties may informally exchange information, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. For example, the Agency may supply copies of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation used to support its case and the Respondent might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide any evidence that would tend to disprove the allegations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or to mitigate the requested penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

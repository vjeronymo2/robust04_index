			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Morocco ferry link postponed CENARGO, the UK marine group, has postponed the inauguration of its ferry service linking the Moroccan port of Nador and Almeria in south-east Spain to allow time for an agreement between the Rabat and the Madrid governments over the new shipping link. Mr Michael Hendry, Cenargo's chairman, said yesterday the service, which was scheduled to start today in defiance of the Spanish authorities, would commence in 10 days time. He expected Morocco and Spain to amend next week an existing bilateral arrangement that shares out the ferry services between the two countries. Cenargo claimed it was legally entitled to operate the ferry under the terms of the EC's single market deregulation of cabotage between Community members and third nations. Spain however, insists changes must be introduced to their agreement with Morocco before the the EC's directive can be implemented.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Berlusconi seeks to avert strike: Embattled government edges towards pensions compromise Italy's embattled government last night appeared to be moving closer to a deal with trade unions to head off an eight-hour general strike on December 2. Both sides appeared anxious to resolve the confrontation, over proposed cuts in Italy's generous state pensions system, as the country's rightwing coalition battled for political survival. In the run-up to a meeting last night with union leaders, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi had indicated his willingness to make concessions to avoid the strike. And speaking after the meeting, Mr Sergio D'Antoni, leader of the CISL confederation, said: 'For the first time the government has said it is prepared to study the separation of pension reform from the budget.' The unions and the government will meet again on Wednesday morning to discuss the issue. Mr Berlusconi's new position is in sharp contrast to his tough stance before and after the huge union-organised protest that brought almost 1.5m demonstrators on to the streets of Rome on November 12. His political position has been weakened in the wake of this week's warning by Milan magistrates that he is under investigation for alleged corruption. As more details of the investigation leaked out, Milan magistrates were reported to have discovered a bank account allegedly used for making unregistered payments in Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest business group. Mr Berlusconi has said he will not resign as a result of the investigation. However, if the general strike goes ahead, it will add to the political instability. The populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi is in open disagreement with its coalition partners, particularly on the pensions issue, where it is ready to side with the unions. Mr Berlusconi is fighting a desperate battle to survive and needs to get the 1995 budget through parliament. Apart from being ready to give ground on pensions, he signalled on Wednesday a renewed readiness to sell off the bulk of his stake in Fininvest - although the opposition consider such a move unlikely. Union leaders called the general strike to increase pressure on the government to remove the sensitive and complex issue of pension reform from the budget. The government was last night seeking a formula that would not alter the budget's overall aim of finding up to L50,000bn (Pounds 19.8bn) in new taxes and spending cuts to hold the public sector deficit down to 8 per cent of GDP. The treasury has warned that the financial markets would react negatively to any weakening of the budget's objectives. Removing pension cuts from the budget would mean the government finding L5,000bn from elsewhere. Any agreement on pensions between the government and the unions will have to be committed for consultation to Confindustria, the industrialists confederation; and all sides may wish to reflect before a final decision.

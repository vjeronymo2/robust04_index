			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 8 KYODO -- Japan's deputy  ambassador to the United Nations said Friday [8 April] that the  UN should abolish the "enemy clause" in its charter, which  alludes to such countries as Japan and Germany as enemy states.    Shunji Maruyama, addressing a working-group meeting to  reform  the UN Security Council, said the clause shows part of the  chapter is outdated.    In Article 53 and Article 107, the charter states that  enforcement action can be taken against any "enemy state"  without the authorization of the Security Council.    "Enemy" states refer to countries that lost World War II --  Bulgaria, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan and Romania.    Japan has strongly urged scrapping the clause. Germany has  made no such a demand, saying it is already a de facto dead  clause.</p>

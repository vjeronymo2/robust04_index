			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO P.V. NEEDS TAX-FREE SOLUTION  </P> <P> It seems to me that the question at hand is: Where is the money going to come  from to keep up roads, parks, trails, and general expenses, without taxing the  residents of Rancho Palos Verdes? The overzealous supporters of no-development  once again turn in desperation to character assassination as their only line of  defense. If they would spend as much time thinking of ways to generate revenue  to get the bills paid, as they do trying to keep these tinder-dry hills from  becoming revenue-producing, beautifully landscaped places that people could  enjoy, their service to humanity would be greatly enhanced.  </P> <P> The council needs a Planning Commission that is just that, a Planning  Commission. One that will see the needs of Rancho Palos Verdes and act as a  pilot to lead the way to a better community that is fiscally sound, serving the  general needs of our beautiful city.  </P> <P> As I have said before, if you have a better plan than a golf course and a hotel  to produce real money, let's hear it -- then people of reason can get behind  these plans, and let's quit the hype of council bashing.  </P> <P> AL BILLINGS  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / ANC rejects call for meeting: Statement says talks with de Klerk would serve no useful purpose SOUTH Africa's political crisis deepened last night as the African National Congress angrily rejected President FW de Klerk's call for a two-day meeting to break the impasse in the country's peace process. In a statement issued three hours after Mr de Klerk's attempt to defuse the tensions that have built up since last Wednesday's Boipatong massacre, the ANC said the proposed meeting 'will serve no useful purpose'. 'Once more the National Party has shown its lack of appreciation of the depth of the national crisis it has plunged the country into,' said the ANC. Earlier Mr de Klerk, who had cut short a visit to Spain to preside over yesterday's day-long cabinet meeting, said he had been 'deeply disappointed' at the ANC's decision on Tuesday night to withdraw from constitutional negotiations, and said the government would try to put the peace process back on track 'as soon as possible'. Mr de Klerk went some way towards meeting ANC demands for an international inquiry into the massacre of 42 people in Boipatong, a township near Johannesburg. He said ' a person of international repute' would join the Goldstone commission, which is already planning to investigate the massacre. The commission, headed by a respected South African judge, is a standing inquiry into political violence, which has already been critical of the security forces' behaviour. Mr de Klerk said the police would welcome an international observer to evaluate their investigation. This was the only concrete response to the ANC's terms for the resumption of talks which ended in deadlock last month. Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC president, said on Tuesday the negotiations could not resume until the government agreed to allow an international inquiry into the massacre, to prosecute security force members involved in violence, to ban the carrying of weapons in public and introduce other measures to bring peace to black townships. In Pretoria Mr de Klerk vigorously defended the security forces against ANC allegations they had been involved Boipatong tragedy, and was critical of ANC plans for 'mass action' in the form of strikes and rallies, saying it was an obstacle to negotiations. The ANC described Mr de Klerk's criticism as 'ludicrous in the extreme'. In advance of last night's statement, the ANC yesterday called for the reimposition of the sports moratorium. In a statement signed by Mr Steve Tshwete, the ANC official instrumental in South Africa's readmission to world sport, sports bodies were asked to postpone plans for participation in international sport 'until the country is firmly on a road to democracy'.

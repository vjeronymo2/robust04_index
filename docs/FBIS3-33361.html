			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Sixto Duran-Ballen has dismissed  Information and Tourism Minister Carlos Vera, because the  president said the minister failed to show respect for the  command hierarchy by criticizing Vice President Alberto Dahik.  Carlos Vera Rodriguez ordered Dahik to toe the line and refrain  from launching trial balloons after the vice president stated  the government is studying the possibility of calling a  referendum on topics government spokesmen have not yet  disclosed. Vera referred to the burning topic this noon when  he hosted a news conference that was broadcast nationwide on a  radio network. The minister officially announced his  resignation from the post he has held since the start of  conservative Sixto Duran-Ballen's government. In announcing that  he was stepping down, Vera stated: The president felt a way to  resolve the situation my remarks caused was to ask for my  resignation, and I immediately agreed.    [Begin Vera recording] It is necessary in this country to  display constant loyalty and to demonstrate with deeds and  renouncements, not just with mellifluous or questionable phrases  or poses. It is necessary to etch that word in capital letters;  it is necessary. The same applies with the words understanding,  friendship, gratitude, and frankness. That is why today when I  conclude my work I do so in a manner that should be done--with a  president of the caliber of Sixto Duran-Ballen.    I begin with my thanks, with a tight summary of results, and  my best wishes of good luck. I will later refer to the  president's decision to request my resignation and my decision  to heed his request immediately. I again begin by thanking him  for the confidence and support he gave me by entrusting upon me  this responsibility to continue the work of Pedro Zambrano,  whose untimely death, which could have been avoided [words  indistinct] of Ecuador prompted me to accept this challenge.  Before, I had encouraged him to join the task of supporting a  new course, something that ultimately cost him his life.    I could not help but sacrifice my prestige, comfort, and  economy to act according to his struggle and task. [end  recording]    Vera publicly criticized Vice President Alberto Dahik, who  in  the last few days announced the government's intention to  convene a popular consultation to propose various constitutional  reforms. Dahik made the announcement without President  Duran-Ballen's authorization, creating a state of confusion  within the government and sparking reactions from different  sectors in Ecuador.    President Duran-Ballen said the issue of a possible  plebiscite is only under consideration.    Vera said during a news conference: I do not consider it a  lack of respect to request respect for a right exclusive to the  president. He should be the first to announce such an important  matter as a plebiscite.    Several papers published today reported that Vera had become  a strong Dahik opponent due to the differences between the  officials on economic policies.    Vera, a 39-year-old reporter, had orchestrated  Duran-Ballen's  political campaign, which took him to the Ecuadoran presidency  for the 1992-96 term. The former information minister also said  Leon Herrera, National Radio director, and David Andrade,  information under secretary, had placed their post at the  executive's disposal. I have asked them to remain in their  posts until the new minister replaces them, Vera said, stating  he would return to journalism.    The government is still undecided about who will replace  Vera; therefore, David Andrade, information under secretary,  will remain in charge.</p>

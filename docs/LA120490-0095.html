			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S PARTY TIME FOR THOSE UNSHAKEN BY QUAKE ALERT  </P> <P> Pssst. Heard the latest disaster prediction?  </P> <P> The word is the Mississippi River is going to overflow. That should happen say  about Wednesday when all the folks along the river who've been stockpiling  water for the Big Earthquake finally pour it down the drain.  </P> <P> For months a major portion of the Midwest and South, from about Memphis, Tenn.,  to St. Louis and beyond, braced for the Big One. Schools in parts of four  states declared holidays. Earthquake insurance sellers reaped a fortune. An  untold number of people packed their valuables and lit out for safer territory.  </P> <P> All because Iben Browning, an eccentric 72-year-old scientist from New Mexico,  predicted a 50-50 chance that a temblor with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher would  occur within 48 hours of Dec. 3.  </P> <P> So far, it hasn't happened.  </P> <P> So you'd think maybe a lot of folks with relieved or sheepish expressions on  their faces would be crawling out of their basements about now, right?  </P> <P> Maybe. But you'd have to wade through the revelers to find them.  </P> <P> The only reeling and rocking anyone in these parts saw was at the earthquake  parties thrown throughout the region by the skeptics who stayed behind.  </P> <P> "We're trying to have a good time with it," said Jack Hailey, a big, bearded  man in an omnipresent Stetson who threw an all-day party Monday at his tavern  here in New Madrid, the southeastern Missouri town for which the fault is  named. "This is the most attention this little town ever had, and probably on  Wednesday nobody will know where it is."  </P> <P> Saturday was, according to Browning's prediction, the first day of  high-earthquake probability. At the Faultline, a nightclub in Memphis that has  a crack painted on its dance floor and another crack that runs the length of a  wall with fake body parts sticking out, dancers Saturday night enjoyed "the  last shake before the quake."  </P> <P> Revelers downed Earthquake Shooters -- "guaranteed to shake you up," claimed  the management. The place was packed.  </P> <P> Even tiny New Madrid (pronounced MAD-rid) took on a carnival atmosphere.  Ordinarily the town is so dead that children skateboard down the middle of Main  Street at rush hour without encountering cars. But this weekend policemen were  out directing traffic as a country and western band played tunes atop the  levee, and vendors sold T-shirts and barbecue downtown.  </P> <P> Not that there aren't a lot of nervous people still around.  </P> <P> Anita Wolford is one of many who maintains that only God can predict an  earthquake. But she admits she got scared a few days ago when her cat --  animals are supposed to have an inside track on these things -- started acting  funny.  </P> <P> "She just ran her head into the wall by the hutch," Wolford said. "It was just  a-running and a-scooting. Then it started jumping up like you see those  acrobats do, its hair standing up on its back."  </P> <P> The New Madrid Fault, which runs from Marked Tree, Ark., to Cairo, Ill.,  spawned the most powerful series of earthquakes in the nation's history in 1811  and 1812. Scientists say the strongest of the quakes would've measured over 8  on the Richter scale if the scale had been invented then. Its effects were felt  as far north as Canada. Water flowing in the Mississippi River temporarily  reversed directions.  </P> <P> Although the scientific community was almost unanimous in its repudiation of  Browning's prediction, geologists and emergency planning officials have taken  advantage of it to impress upon the public that, whether or not it occurred on  Dec. 3, the fault is overdue for another big rumble. People who never took the  warnings seriously before are taking them seriously now.  </P> <P> "Back in September, people were in here just hysterical," said Virginia  Carlson, director of the New Madrid Historical Museum, which has reading  material and an exhibit on earthquakes. After officials began holding seminars  on earthquake preparedness, however, people calmed down and started making  rational preparations, she said.  </P> <P> Elderly people and children seem to be the ones most shaken by the prediction.  Many of those who left, a number of residents said, were elderly.  </P> <P> "A few old people left," admitted Hailey, trying to play down the concern that  has clearly dominated the region for months. "Some guys sent their wives and  children away and they stayed. They said it was for their (family's) safety,  but I think they wanted to be here to party by themselves."  </P> <P> Robert R. Butterworth, a psychologist from Los Angeles, spent three days in  town trying to gauge the psychological effects of the earthquake prediction.  </P> <P> "It's rare that you get a situation where people are dealing with trauma before  it happens," he said.  </P> <P> Many of the people he talked to denied that they were concerned about the quake  prediction and some joked about it, he said. "But when you talk to the kids it  ceases being funny, because a lot of them are worried . . . . One child said  she was going to sleep under her bed or under a table. A lot of people are  sleeping with their clothes on."  </P> <P> Butterworth was critical of Browning for making the prediction, which he called  "frivolous."  </P> <P> "If I yell 'fire' in a crowded theater and a stampede results, injuring people,  I can be prosecuted if there wasn't a fire. Why should someone be able to yell  'earthquake' in a crowded region and be immune to the disruption and anxiety  that result?"  </P> <P> Butterworth wasn't the only person upset by the commotion.  </P> <P> Christina Smith, like everyone else in the town of 3,200, knows people who have  left town for the week because of the prediction. "This Mr. Browning, he's got  people terrified," she said. "That upsets me."  </P> <P> At the winter meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco,  academic and government seismologists, also showed some concern Monday, saying  they had become weary of trying to debunk the prediction, and adding that if --  by a freak of nature -- some quake did occur, the debate would be prolonged.  </P> <P> "I just pray there's no earthquake, because if there is I'll never get anything  done for months," said Thomas Heaton, seismologist in charge of the U.S.  Geological Survey office in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Adding to the concern in New Madrid, was the large number of reporters that  have overwhelmed the town. By one account, more than 100 television trucks were  in the area, and, as 10-year-old Jonathan Hunter said: "If they (the reporters)  didn't know something, they wouldn't be here."  </P> <P> But for everyone frightened by the cameras, there seemed to be someone else  drawn to them. Many people took to the streets with video camcorders so they  could shoot back at the professionals.  </P> <P> Browning himself has remained mostly silent. "He has not been talking to the  press for five or six weeks," his wife told a reporter who called his home. She  said he wasn't interested in responding to criticism. "It wouldn't do a bit of  good," she said.  </P> <P> Staff writer Linda Monroe in San Francisco contributed to this story.  </P></p>

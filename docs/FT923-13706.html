			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Western air-sea units to enforce Serbian sanctions WESTERN European states yes-terday agreed to mount an air and sea operation in the Adriatic to enforce United Nations sanctions against Serbia. At least five to six ships, four maritime protection aircraft and several ground-based helicopters will be involved. The naval operations will be undertaken by the nine-nation Western European Union defence organisation in co-operation with Nato. While several nations belong to both groupings, a number of Nato members, such as the US, are not in the WEU. Britain is sending a frigate, HMS Avenger, as part of the joint force. The move coincided with the adoption by the 51-member Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe of a wide-ranging European security framework, at the end of its two-day summit in Helsinki. This will give the CSCE a new peacekeeping role to tackle growing ethnic and national conflicts in post-Cold war Europe. The naval surveillance operation was decided at a special meeting of WEU foreign ministers to demonstrate that Europe was not standing aside from the Yugoslav crisis. The WEU undertook joint naval operations to protect shipping during the Iran-Iraq and Gulf wars. But this is the first time it has agreed to act jointly in a European crisis. It is also examining how it can help the humanitarian aid operation for the people of Sarajevo and other stricken Bosnian areas. A group of experts will explore the feasibility of organising transport through land corridors from the Adriatic coast to Sarajevo, where more than 300,000 people have been cut off for three months by fighting between Serbs, Moslems and Croats. Departing from the UK government's cautious attitude towards military involvement in the crisis, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said that if the feasibility of a land corridor was established, Britain would consider providing air cover for ground transport. He again ruled out British ground forces taking part in any relief operations. He also stressed that a new UN Security Council resolution would be required to authorise a land relief operation. Downing Street said that in a move to help wounded children in Sarajevo, the Foreign Office, on Mr Major's instructions, last night contacted the UN High Commission for Refugees to offer British medical assistance. Sanctions-monitoring oper-ations, which will be co-ordinated by the Italians, will take place in international waters in the straits of Otranto and on other points off the Yugoslav coast, including the coast of Montenegro. But the WEU vessels will not have the authority to stop or board ships suspected of breaking the UN sanctions, for which a further resolution by the Security Council would be necessary. President George Bush yesterday denied reports that the US was stepping up naval deployments in the Adriatic. He had made no decisions on the deployment of new naval forces since arriving in Helsinki for the security conference summit two days ago. The US has two task forces in the Mediterranean. Mr Bush has consistently refused to commit himself to the use of American ground troops in Bosnia. Helsinki reports, Page 3</p>

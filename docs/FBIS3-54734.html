			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report in the "Version" column: "A </F> Government Is Being Formed. No-Nonsense Struggle Is Under Way  Under the Christmas Tree," incorporating "Prerequisites" subhead  by Sergey Vedeneyev and "postscript" by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA]    [Text] Judging by reports from reliable sources, the  reform of the Russian Government is going to be drastic. The  institution of vice premiership is to be cut down to five posts:  two first vice premiers (Oleg Soskovets and Yegor Gaydar) and  three plain vice premiers.    In fact it is in the second echelon of vice premiers that  the  main struggle over titles is expected to occur. The constant  haggling over the posts is beginning to produce some curious  results: It appears that the carefully prepared reshuffle which  will be announced on 5 January should toss overboard two  radicals from Russia's Choice (Boris Fedorov and Anatoliy  Chubays) and two "moderates" who have displayed relative  disloyalty -- Aleksandr Shokhin and Sergey Shakhray (Party of  Russian Unity and Accord) [PRES].    This should be regarded only as a tentative prediction  because the decisive battle for the seats has not begun yet: At  yesterday's session of the government presidium -- marked by the  absence of the finance minister -- instead of the announced  agenda, a ceremony was held to express collective best New  Year's wishes to first-echelon officials.    Therefore so far the main intrigue is developing not in the  government itself but around it. The lineup of forces in the  government remains so shrouded in mystery that it is even  impossible to say whether the Economy and the Finance Ministries  will be merged to "suit Gaydar" or whether the deck will be  reshuffled differently: On one hand, the first scenario is more  logical if one proceeds from the president's assurances and  Gaydar's self-assurance. On the other, yesterday it was planned  to "give hell to Urinson" following his presentation of a reform  program, which has not as yet happened.    Intrigues around the government last week came through in a  number of statements by Yegor Gaydar and Oleg Soskovets. The  main point of contention was still over the necessity or  uselessness of financial stabilization.    Meanwhile the financial stabilization intrigue, with the  present condition of the Russian economy and with the current  composition of the parliament, is a unique case of intensive  care measures being administered to a stillborn baby. Moreover,  it is becoming clear today even for "practical workers" that  even theoretically the struggle against inflation by limiting  demand will not only provoke social upheavals like the miners  crisis (only of a general character) and further slackening of  industrial activity, but neither (sic!) will it stop inflation.    Yegor Gaydar's statements in the "Moment of Truth" [TV  program] with Andrey Karaulov to the effect that Russia was so  close to financial stabilization in 1992 and what a little way  it has to go to reach it today were obviously of a "provocative"  character and did not correspond to reality. Which posed  observers the dilemma: Either Gaydar is mistaken or he is  telling a lie. The most feasible is the version of "eyewashing"  the president (who is not an economist) and provoking Viktor  Chernomyrdin. With the emerging "president-premier" standoff,  Gaydar, mindful of the president's promise to keep him in the  cabinet, is apparently targeting his strike against his radical  colleagues, which will cause the replacement of the  Fedorov-Chubays combination with Shokhin-Shakhray.    The brilliant game played in public is apparently doomed to  success. This success, however, will remain purely internal and  will hardly affect the cabinet's performance. This in fact  underlies the hopes that the elimination of reformers from the  cabinet will be less painful for the country because with the  exception of Shakhray there is no one to deal with regional  policy; and, with the exception of Shokhin, no one to conduct  balanced talks with the EC.    Moreover, the departure of the PRES leaders from the  government will not have a stabilizing effect on  government-parliament interrelations. At the same time, the  replacement of those radicals who have assumed responsibility  for botched (economic and political) reforms can moderate  Gaydar's appetite for far-reaching confrontational  transformations, while except for him, the president does not  trust any other economist.  <H5>  Prerequisites </H5>   As the scheduled date draws near, when the renewed  structural  and personal composition of the government will become widely  known to the public, there is natural impatience and a growing  wish to find out the consequences of particular figures'  appearing at the head of the executive branch.    Anyone lucky enough to attend a conference of a narrow  in-circle at 1100 on Tuesday, 28 December in Volynskoye near  Moscow, could have satisfied his natural curiosity. It  discussed in particular the composition of the future government.    It is hardly reasonable, however, to rely on such guesswork  even if coming from the most well-informed in-people. In the  end the decisions will be made by a person with fine political  intuition that has never failed him so far at the most  responsible moments. The president has always fully understood  the importance of cadre work, personally deciding many questions  related to appointments.    As for the general trend of the upcoming (and already  proceeding) cadre reshuffle, it is apparently based on the  following prerequisites.    Balance. The need for a balanced approach conditions the  aspiration to achieve such a correlation of leading cadres in  political posts which would most fully reflect the emerging  balance of political forces and allow him to consider himself  the president of "all Russians," at the same time guaranteeing a  consistent continuation of reforms -- even if with certain  adjustments. Such an approach leaves no room for radicals or  extremists of any description in the Russian leadership and  opens the way for more moderate leaders.    Reliability. The need for guarantees of future mutual  understanding explains the choice of people who are personally  known and devoted. As the previous course of events has shown,  these may include some fairly unexpected figures (for example,  those well known in the process of past work in party bodies).    Professionalism. This quite reasonable demand is very hard  to implement in practice. First of all, it ill matches the  previous criterion. Second, the type of professional leader in  statesmanship has not as yet taken proper shape in Russian  organizational culture.    Continuity. No matter how one might wish, it is extremely  difficult and not really necessary to replace everybody  simultaneously. This process acquires a gradual character and  therefore the question of priorities in the effecting changes  arises.    Shooting the Losers [otstranennost]. The supreme interests  of self-preservation inevitably call for scapegoats and fall  guys to be found. They will be found because they provide an  easy opportunity to absolve oneself of responsibility for  failures and shift it on the part of leadership that is  replaced, which can and should be sacrificed.    Subjectivism. The logic of the president's thinking is hard  to explain since many of his decisions are of an intuitive  character. He also quite confirms this himself. Let us recall,  for instance, his famous interview with E. Ryazanov ("Does it  not seem to you that your are being led from somewhere up  above?" -- "Yes, indeed, it does.")  <H5>  P.S. </H5>   According to some reports, Vladimir Kvasov, chief of the  Russian Federation Government apparatus, has been accorded the  rank of minister. It should be noted that Mr. Kvasov was  elected to the State Duma in the 112th Orekhovo Zuyevo  constituency in Moscow Oblast.    Some sources report that the following alignment of forces  in  the cabinet is quite probable: Viktor Gerashchenko gives way to  Boris Fedorov who will in turn be replaced by Yegor Gaydar.    Such a figure as Yuriy Luzhkov is also being considered but  according to some behind-the-scenes strategists, his time will  come later -- in presidential elections because Luzhkov, in  their opinion, can become a good match for Zhirinovskiy.</p>

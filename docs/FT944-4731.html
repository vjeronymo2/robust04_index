			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: The turkeys do not vote for Christmas Sir, The chairman of British Gas will be aware that the remuneration of the boards of public companies has soared over the past 10 years, rising far more than the increase in the value of share capital or the remuneration of other valuable members of society. The rise reflects the growth in power of financial institutions and the interrelationship between the two. Private individuals, not financial institutions, are the real shareholders of public companies. I doubt whether many accept as necessary the current remunerations. However, to obtain tax relief nearly all Peps and pensions have to be channelled through financial institutions and these take over the voting rights. The power of the institutions can be seen in their management fee: only 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent typically in the early 1970s, but, despite computerisation, nearer 1.5 per cent now. To ensure genuine control of public companies, individuals should be allowed to obtain the tax concessions from direct investments. Also institutions, as trustees, should be required legally to be responsive to the views of the owners of funds. Unless such steps are taken the boards will continue to take an increasing proportion of our wealth because, to end with a seasonable note, turkeys do not vote for Christmas. Jean Currie, 20 Bateman St, Cambridge, CB2 INB</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: US buyer for Switched Reluctance Drives Switched Reluctance Drives, the Yorkshire-based developer of an innovative type of electric motor, has been bought by St Louis-based Emerson Electric, the world's largest producer of electric motors, for an undisclosed sum. SRD claims world leadership in the technology of switched reluctance drives, which can outperform standard induction motors in efficiency, speed and reliability. The purchase by Emerson is viewed by both companies as an important step for the development and commercial exploitation of the technology. SRD has had an uphill battle convincing the industry of the advantages of its motors. But Professor Peter Lawrenson, the founder and chairman, believes they could now take a substantial share in the world electric motor market, worth Pounds 20bn to Pounds 25bn a year in total. The technology has been licensed by SRD to about 20 companies worldwide. But Prof Lawrenson said Emerson was the best partner for SRD because of its breadth of motor applications, geographic coverage and history of success. SRD, which employs 30 people full-time, had pre-tax profits of Pounds 282,000 in the year to end-September, on turnover of Pounds 1.6m. It will remain at Leeds, as a subsidiary of Emerson, with Prof Lawrenson as non-executive chairman, and Mr William Schnyder joining from Emerson as chief executive.</p>

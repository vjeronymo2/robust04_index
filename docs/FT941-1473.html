			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / The Italian Election: Italy's voters look set to put new political alliances to the test - Unpredictable results are likely from an electoral system with conflicting aims For the first time, this Sunday and Monday, a European democracy is electing a parliament with two totally different voting systems based on opposite principles of representation. Italy is introducing British-style first-past-the-post majority voting to elect 75 per cent of both houses, but has retained proportional representation for the rest. This curious hybrid requires considerable sophistication from the electorate and will produce some unpredictable results with 15 main parties in the ring. Nevertheless, neither of the two main alliances - the Progressives and the Freedom Alliance - is likely to win outright. On the one hand, the majority vote has encouraged the formation of alliances and the move towards a bi-polar political system. On the other, proportional representation is designed to both reward and preserve the smaller parties. While the former system is intended to produce a clear-cut victory of one party or alliance, the latter militates against a clear result by seeking to create a group of balancing seats in the hands of small parties, who will then determine which alliance has a majority. The inclusion of this proportional balance was a deliberate move by the Christian Democrats, Socialists and their allies who held the majority in the outgoing parliament. They believed they would be in the centre orchestrating the formation of the next government. These conflicting electoral principles have determined all parties' strategies. No one could afford to fight the election on its own. First to realise this was the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), which mobilised an alliance of 'progressive' parties to contest local elections last June and again in November. Back in December the PDS-led seven-party alliance looked a near certain winner. Indeed, media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's decision to enter politics in January was determined largely by other parties' inability to forge alliances and the consequent fear of the PDS sweeping the board. His choice of partners was determined by the refusal of the centre parties to entertain his political ambitions. This left him no option but to team up his Forza Italia movement with Mr Umberto Bossi's populist League in the north and Mr Gianfranco Fini's neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance in the centre and south. Whatever was said to the contrary in public, both League and MSI were happy to benefit from the Forza Italia media umbrella and the extra votes Mr Berlusconi promised to bring from the centre. The centre was the last to agree an alliance strategy. This was partly the fault of Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader and former Christian Democrat. He flirted with the League and was courted by Mr Berlusconi and by the PDS. Unable to make up his mind or making unacceptable conditions, he was left with the Christian Democrats, rebaptised as the Popular Party (PPI), as the sole prop. Mr Berlusconi has made an extraordinary impact in a short time. The use of his media empire to launch him and the exploitation of his Fininvest network of business interests to organise Forza Italia have played an important role. But his success is arguably a direct consequence of the collapse of the credibility of the centre parties which traditionally accounted for over 40 per cent of the vote. His was the most appealing face and the most reassuring message for middle class Italy worried by political instability and recession. Yet, for a man who claims to have at least a quarter of the national vote, he explained extraordinarily little of his plans to achieve his 'new Italian miracle'. His strength, and potential weakness, lies in this being a post-ideological election. Forza Italia is not a political name but associated with football: it is run on the lines of a supporters' club backed by the Fininvest managerial expertise. It is built round the core of Publitalia, Fininvest's advertising arm, and Standa, the stores group, and its programme looks like a company report. Voters are targeted like potential buyers. Mr Berlusconi's post-ideological appeal has attracted League voters in the north disenchanted with Mr Bossi's dogmatic stand on federalism and his over-confrontational style. Forza Italia could even claim credit for removing the threat of northern separatism. The PDS, meanwhile, is presenting itself as a 'respectable' social democratic party, free of the old communist bogey label. At the other end of the scale, the MSI has changed its name to National Alliance and claims the fascist label no longer applies. The new respectability of the MSI championed by Mr Fini, despite some ugly figures in the background, has found a large echo and could be one of the big surprises. The Christian Democrats, whose raison d'etre was the Catholic vote in the cold war against communism, have dropped their religious identification and have revived the name of the party's forbear in the twenties, the Popular party. The church, itself, for the first time, is faced with a split in the Catholic vote. In this campaign the principle problems suffered by the alliances have been related to the old ideological connotations. The PDS has been damaged by the statements of its Progressive ally, Reconstructed Communism. Calls for raising taxes on government bonds arouse fears of soaking the rich even though the party is clearly posturing to its own electorate. Equally, Mr Berlusconi has given a greater mantle of respectability to Mr Fini. He accordingly suffers when the old corporatist attitudes of the MSI surface and clash with the media magnate's professed free market belief. The MSI/National Alliance colours the Freedom Alliance and forces Mr Berlusconi more to the right. This suits Mr Fini who is less concerned about entering the government than playing for the next elections. Mr Berlusconi insists in public that he would form a government with the MSI. But the League says it will not be in the same government as the MSI. Thus it is hard to see the Freedom Alliance in government in its present form. By the same token, Reconstructed Communism is an uncomfortable partner in government for the PDS. The party is unacceptable if the Progressives need to treat with the centre. As the campaign has matured, the difficulties of either main alliance forming a government have become more obvious. This has enabled the centre Pact to present itself as a viable counter-weight and may well attract voters for this reason. However, it can only pick up seats on the proportional lists. Opinion polls have been banned since March 15. But party analysts talk of the Progressives winning 230-270 seats, the Freedom Alliance 260-300 and the Pact 40-70. These parameters envisage no outright majority and many commentators suggest the next government will be an institutional one, even led by the outgoing premier, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Whoever governs, a first task will be electoral reform to ensure that Italians can vote for a clearly identifiable government.</p>

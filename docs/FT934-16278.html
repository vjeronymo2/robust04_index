			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / NatWest warns on lending BANKS are likely to be selective about which small businesses they lend to in future and demand rewards which reflect the risks better, Lord Alexander, the chairman of National Westminster Bank, warned last night. He also rebuked the government for failing to ensure a stable economic environment and said that this had led to banks charging higher margins on loans to compensate for the additional risks involved. Lord Alexander, in a speech at Manchester Business School, said that the 'boom and bust' economic cycle had made it impossible for banks to appraise business plans, and rendered some lending risks 'unacceptably high at any margin'. His remarks follow a private initiative by Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, who has called in senior executives of banks to discuss his concern that the economic upturn could be stifled if they are unwilling to lend. Lord Alexander, who called for the government to consider a successor to the Business Expansion Scheme, as part of a partnership of businesses and banks, said the government and the Bank were responsible for achieving stability. He said that while small businesses were reluctant to borrow, demand would increase as confidence returned. Banks would have to guard against being 'shell-shocked' by recent losses, and over-cautious. Banks would have to 'resist any pressures which may develop to relax the canons of sound lending'. Although 50 per cent of people were reported to believe that banks were nationalised, banks were not 'an arm of government economic policy'. 'Small business customers are not conscripts . . . the relationship should always be on a business footing and banks need a reward which properly acknowledges the risk,' he said. Lord Alexander emphasised that banks would try to encourage small businesses to seek alternative means of funding to the traditional loan or overdraft. He said banks 'cannot shoulder equity risk for debt reward'.</p>

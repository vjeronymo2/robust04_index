			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Heron faces call on Pounds 450m bonds HERON International's financial problems worsened yesterday when the troubled property group's bonds were called into default by bondholders and a lead manager of the bonds. Once the bonds are in default, bondholders can demand immediate repayment of principal, totalling Pounds 450m, threatening the property group's survival. However, Heron is confident that bondholders will recognise it is not in their interests to demand immediate repayment. But Credit Suisse, lead manager of four Swiss franc bonds, whose face value is SFr600m (Pounds 230.7m) said the terms proposed last Friday by Heron to reschedule repayments on Pounds 500m of bank loans and the bonds were not acceptable to bondholders. 'They (Heron's directors) know the current terms are not acceptable,' said a Credit Suisse executive. Credit Suisse is organising a meeting of the bond lead managers - the investment banks which arranged the sale of the bonds - on Monday in Zurich. The other lead managers are Banque Indosuez of France, Deutsche Bank of Germany, Warburg Sogitic of Switzerland, Credit Lyonnais of France and Royal Bank of Canada. Although Heron sketched out plans for a financial reconstruction last week, it may be months before bondholders receive concrete terms. 'We are endeavouring to keep bondholders up to date with what's going on,' said a Heron spokesman. 'But we cannot make formal proposals to bondholders until we have further discussions with our banks'. Credit Suisse said it was forced to call its four bonds into default when holders of other bonds called their bonds into default. 'We did not want to put holders of our bonds at a disadvantage vis-a-vis the holders of other bonds,' said an executive. Under the covenants relating to most of Heron's bonds, holders have the right to call a default if the company proposes a financial reconstruction, which it did last week. However, under Swiss law only the lead manager of a Swiss bond can call a default. Heron is trying to reschedule its debts because it is convinced that it will breach the covenants on its bank loans. One of its covenants stipulates that its net worth must exceed Pounds 350m. However, Heron, advised by accountants Price Waterhouse, estimates that its net assets at the end of March were Pounds 135m, down from Pounds 585m in March 1991.</p>

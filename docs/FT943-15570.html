			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Life at the sharp end: Chris Tighe on a working man caught in the poverty trap For John, a supervisor with a small company making wooden kitchen and bathroom furniture in Gateshead, the Pounds 28 a week he receives in Family Credit is a lifeline in the struggle to make ends meet. 'It's very tight,' he says. 'I'm not talking of the last Pounds 10 or Pounds 15, I'm talking down to the last penny. We do without all sorts, luxuries, food, going out. Holidays? No chance.' His weekly wage of Pounds 150 gross for a 39-hour week has to support him, his wife and two children aged 5 and 2. He has no opportunity for overtime earnings. On the industrial estate where he works, there are lots of lads, single men, on Pounds 120 a week, says John. He knows of 16 and 17-year-olds on only Pounds 50 a week. Now 25, John left school at 16 with CSEs but no O Levels. He went on Youth Training Schemes and Employment Training before landing his cherished job, initially at Pounds 135 a week. He and the workmate he supervises are proud of their work as wood machinists. They have told the boss of other job offers they have had, and he has promised to raise John's wage soon to Pounds 180, to make sure he stays. 'I enjoy my work here; I've got a good reputation for the work I do,' says John. 'It's being out of the house, working, and knowing things will get better.' But he admits: 'When I get down, I occasionally work out how much I would get on the dole. There's not much difference.' Last Christmas, his wife had a temporary job in a supermarket. 'She was getting more than me.' She is now training as a creche worker. 'She'll be on Pounds 4.75 a hour - that's more than I'm getting.' He says his wife and her fellow trainees, who expect to be employed at a creche near their homes, have been told they will not be allowed to work more than 15 hours a week, to keep below the national insurance threshold. John expects his promised wage rise will wipe out his entitlement to Family Credit, making the family almost no better off. In this he is probably wrong  -although many people on Family Credit believe pay rises reduce benefit pound for pound. The withdrawal rate depends on a number of factors, but never reaches 100 per cent. While he remains a low-wage earner, his family's income can rise markedly only if his wife can get out to work too, he says. Her earnings as a creche worker would more than outweigh the loss of Family Credit. The weekly rent on their house is Pounds 29. He says things have been better financially since he and his wife got on top of the heavy hire purchase outgoings for the television, video and the car. The latter is no luxury: the C-reg Vauxhall Cavalier is the vital connection between his Sunderland home and his Gateshead workplace. Keeping it going is a big commitment, made no easier by vandalism on the estate where he lives. Regularly replacing smashed car windows is an additional drain on resources. 'The car's out on the road. It's always getting broken into. I pay the damage - there's no point claiming.' Some on the estate are not bothered about the lack of work, he says. They make up their income from crime: 'They can go out and pinch six videos and get more than I earn in a week. But one day they'll get their come-uppance.' Informing the police is not the streetwise thing to do. 'If you report them, they don't think twice of putting your windows out; they don't care who's in the house.' John says he and his wife keep to themselves. His full name has not been used in this article at his request, out of concern for his family's safety. He hopes in future years to fix up a job for his son at the same factory. 'It's who you know, not what you know,' he says. 'It's all through the grapevine.'</p>

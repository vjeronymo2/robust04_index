			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS HAND OUT EMERGENCY RATIONS IN KABUL  </P> <P> Soviet soldiers handed out emergency rations Wednesday to Afghans in Kabul, and  the capital's mayor said his city has a three-month supply of food and fuel in  case of a guerrilla siege when the Soviet troops are gone.  </P> <P> U.N. aid officials, less optimistic, said much more must be brought in "if  disaster is to be averted." They were preparing contingency plans.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union said Wednesday it has begun its final troop withdrawal from  Afghanistan but that it is continuing to fight guerrilla attempts to clamp an  economic blockade on Kabul.  </P> <P> "The withdrawal process has started," Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.  Gerasimov told a news conference in Moscow. "I cannot say when it started. But  it is under way."  </P> <P> Gerasimov also appeared to dispel any doubts that the pullout of the last of  the Soviet troops will be completed by Feb. 15, the deadline set by last  April's U.N.-mediated accords on Afghanistan.  </P> <P> "Maybe it will not end exactly on the 15th, it could end on the 14th," he said.  "It is not important."  </P> <P> Muslim guerrillas operating along the Salang Highway are attacking supply  convoys bound for the city as the withdrawal deadline approaches. Soviet cargo  planes began flying loads of flour and fuel to the capital Saturday.  </P> <P> The mayor, Gen. Mohammed M. Hakim, said government soldiers killed 377  guerrillas Tuesday on the Salang Highway, which runs 250 miles from Kabul north  to the Soviet border, and the route is now open for convoys. He put the flour  reserve at 57,000 tons.  </P> <P> Friction over the supply situation has been evident between the government and  the Soviet military. Maj. Gen. Lev Serebrov, deputy Soviet commander in  Afghanistan, complained this week that his army has to feed all 2.3 million  people in the city. He accused the Afghan regime of inefficiency and failing to  ask for help in time.  </P> <P> Mayor Hakim told a news conference, "That's a private opinion. . . . I have no  comment."  </P> <P> Asked why the Soviets started the costly airlift if the city has stockpiles, he  said some supplies have been released but "we need to keep these reserves for  the future."  </P> <P> Western diplomats in Kabul have said the silo holding Kabul's wheat reserves is  down to a half-day supply.  </P></p>

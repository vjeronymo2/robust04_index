			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet oil sector 'difficult to break up' NEWLY-INDEPENDENT former Soviet republics are finding it extremely difficult to pull apart the defunct empire's highly integrated oil industry, according a report due to be published next week. Mr Yevgeny Khartukov, head of the World Energy Analysis and Forecasting Group, makes this point with 1990-1991 data compiled for each of 15 former Soviet republics after the Soviet Union's collapse in December. The figures, to be published by East-West Center, a Honolulu-based think-tank funded by the US congress, show that 'in spite of the political situation, all parts of the former Soviet industry are still very inter-dependent on each other, and this includes not just the have-not republics'. Russia, which at the peak of integration in 1990 accounted for 90 per cent of Soviet crude oil and gas condensate, cannot refine all it produces. That year and the next Kazakhstan, although it was self-sufficient in crude oil, had to import Siberian crudes to feed two of its three refineries. Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania and Turkmenistan, four other republics which process oil, accounted for about 16 per cent of refining capacity and had product surpluses. Three others, which process crude oil from other republics, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia could only partly cover their own needs for liquid fuel, while the remaining six republics - Armenia, Estonia, Kirgyzia, Latvia, Moldova and Tajikistan are completely dependent on neighbours with surpluses of refined products. Mr Khartukov has also updated two scenarios for oil output under attempts to build a market economy, which he describes respectively as slow marketisation and economic shock. He believes the oil industry is moving away from shock therapy to gradual marketisation. Under the latter scenario, the former Soviet Union would have to begin importing oil to the tune of 200,000 barrels a day in 1994, with supply at 8m b/d and demand at 8.2m b/d. Under the economic shock option, net exports would amount to 1.3m b/d, with supply and demand at 7.8m and 6.5m b/d respectively.</p>

Stefano Picchi asked  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Adamishin about this:    [Begin Adamishin recording] Our policy has been changing,  not  only in the last few days but over the past year. In what  direction is it changing? It is becoming more pragmatic -- let  us say, more interested in the defense of our national  interests. We may have passed through a somewhat romantic  period when we thought that because we had a correct foreign  policy we would no longer have any problems. This was not the  case.    Even when going in a correct direction you must still find a  way of solving problems, because interests do not always  coincide. I will give you an example: Russia's role in the  former Soviet republics is not always recognized. Sometimes it  is said that in these republics we are going back to imperialist  ways, that we want to rebuild the Soviet Union. It is not true.  We have seen, we have established that unless Russia plays an  active role it is very difficult to have stability, security,  and tranquillity on our border. The former republics want  Russia's active role; they want it. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A total of 100 servicemen from the Ukrainian  military contingency of the UN peace-keeping battalion have left  Kiev for ex-Yugoslavia. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry told  INTERFAX-Ukraine that several diplomats, including the Ukrainian  Foreign Ministry's Envoy, Andrey Ozadovskiy, had left for the  conflict zone by the same plane.    The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's press service said the  Ukrainian diplomatic mission had left for ex-Yugoslavia in order  to examine the situation in the region where the Ukrainian  battalion was stationed and to conduct consultations on the  issue.    The 550 men of the new contingency will be stationed near  Gorazde. The Ukrainian servicemen were trained in the  Prikarpatsky Military District.    The Ukrainian military contingency will be transported to  ex-Yugoslavia by four flights. This will take three days.  Ukraine is expected to have a 1,200-man military contingency in  the region. The latest figure for the Ukrainian battalion in  Bosnia and Herzegovina was 500 servicemen.    For the period of the Ukrainian battalion's presence in  Sarajevo six servicemen have been killed and about 30 wounded.</p>

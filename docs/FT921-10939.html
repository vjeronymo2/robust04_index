			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome Yesterday Wellcome's market value rose above Pounds 10bn for the first time, ranking it ahead of Hanson as the seventh biggest stock on the London market. Nine months ago its value was Pounds 5bn. In the past three months it has outperformed Glaxo by over 40 per cent. This is partly because the market has begun to see Glaxo as overvalued. Wellcome is on about 32 times this year's earnings, Glaxo on 25 times. How long can Wellcome keep it up? Yesterday's 2 per cent rise was due to further evidence that AZT delays the onset of Aids in HIV-positive patients who have not yet developed Aids symptoms. But that is a familiar story. As Wellcome has always conceded, the problem lies rather in getting symptom-free patients to take a drug of AZT's fearsome reputation. In any event, Wellcome's earnings growth depends more on the versatility of its older anti-viral drug Zovirax. Its stock market reputation has also benefited of late from the infusion of fresh management, which can have little immediate effect on the development of a drug portfolio. Unlike Glaxo, which has on the whole risen fairly steadily over the years, Wellcome has always been prone to wild speculative swings. Like Glaxo, it is in fundamental terms a remarkable company. It might be over-valued just the same.</p>

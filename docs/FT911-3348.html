			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Laura Ashley The transformation of Laura Ashley from small family business to closely scrutinised public concern has been a painfully fraught affair. However, yesterday's announcement of a second consecutive annual loss may prove the nadir of the group's fortunes. Much has been achieved over the last year, not least the overdue closure of its manufacturing plants. Gearing has been brought under control through the disposal of peripheral assets, the arrival of new Japanese capital and impressively brutal financial controls. Stock in the core Laura Ashley business, for example, has been slashed by more than a fifth. There is a long way to go before the group can make the most of its prized asset: an international brand name which covers an enviable product range. There is still a big marketing challenge to be addressed, notably in clothing, where the image badly needs bringing up to date. Cost pressures from rents and wages remain intense, the plight of UK retailers is getting no better, and the company has still to master the art of dealing with third-party suppliers. The shares - up a penny at 80p yesterday - have risen roughly 50 per cent since late January. At that level, the prospective multiple is more than 20 times for 1992. It will be some years before police horses are again controlling crowds desperate to throw money at a Laura Ashley issue.</p>

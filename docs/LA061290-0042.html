			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRANDO SON GETS NEW LAWYER;  </P> <P> CRIME: DEFENSE VETERAN ROBERT SHAPIRO HOPES TO SETTLE MURDER CASE WITHOUT  TRIAL.  </P> <P> The son of actor Marlon Brando, facing a murder charge in the shooting death of  his half-sister's lover, switched lawyers Monday, replacing civil rights  attorney William Kunstler with noted criminal defense counsel Robert L.  Shapiro.  </P> <P> Shapiro said he will meet with prosecutors to try to resolve the Christian  Brando case without a trial.  </P> <P> "It's a horrible human event," Shapiro said of the fatal shooting last month of  Dag Drollet. "Both Dag's father and Marlon are soon to be grandfathers of the  same child," he said, adding that both families have been devastated by the  killing.  </P> <P> Brando's daughter, Cheyenne, is pregnant with Drollet's child.  </P> <P> Shapiro, who formerly represented Beverly Hills murder defendant Erik Menendez,  said he will handle the bulk of the case, with Kunstler, of New York, a Brando  family friend, continuing as "senior adviser."  </P> <P> Dan Stormer, Brando's previous Los Angeles attorney, has been released, Shapiro  said. Neither Kunstler nor Stormer are experienced in handling murder cases.  </P> <P> Shapiro said the elder Brando hired him to represent Christian because the  actor wanted a seasoned criminal defense lawyer whose practice is based in  Southern California.  </P> <P> The younger Brando, 32, appeared briefly in a West Los Angeles courtroom Monday  to schedule a preliminary hearing, but legal proceedings were postponed until  June 25 while defense experts reconstruct the murder scene at his father's  Mulholland Drive estate and conduct a second autopsy.  </P> <P> Drollet's parents attended the hearing, but the elder Brando was not present.  </P> <P> Wearing a white shirt, tan slacks and handcuffs, the defendant bowed his head,  answering "yes" twice in a husky voice when asked if he agreed to a new lawyer  and postponement of the proceeding to set a preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> "He's very sad, very depressed, very emotional and very scared," Shapiro said  outside court.  </P> <P> The attorney added that, while it is "a little premature" to hold plea bargain  talks with prosecutors, he hopes to settle the case without a preliminary  hearing or trial. Typical plea bargain arrangements involve a defendant  pleading no contest to the charges, or admitting guilt to lesser charges.  </P> <P> Brando is charged with shooting Drollet, 26, whom Brando says he suspected of  beating his half-sister.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Drollet was shot in the back of the head while watching  television.  </P> <P> But Brando, who has admitted the shooting to police, maintains it was an  accident that occurred while the two were wrestling for a .45-caliber handgun.  </P> <P> Along with murder, Christian Brando, who remains in custody without bail, is  charged with illegally possessing a machine gun and a silencer. He has pleaded  innocent to all charges.  </P> <P> If convicted of first-degree murder, Brando could be sentenced to 25 years to  life in state prison. Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty.  </P></p>

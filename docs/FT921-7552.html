			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Spens renews plea seeking formal not-guilty verdict LORD SPENS will today renew his plea for a formal verdict of not guilty following the Serious Fraud Office's decision not to offer further evidence against him on fraud and false accounting charges arising out of the Guinness takeover of Distillers. The application, to be heard in private by Mr Justice Henry at Southwark Crown Court, London, is made under section 17 of the 1967 Criminal Justice Act. This provides that: 'Where a defendant . . . pleads not guilty and the prosecutor proposes to offer no evidence against him, the court . . . may, if it thinks fit, order that a verdict of not guilty . . . be recorded without the defendant being given in charge to a jury, and the verdict shall have the same effect as if the defendant had been tried and acquitted on the verdict of a jury.' The matter is subject to the discretion of the judge who must decide whether the particular circumstances warrant an acquittal. The application was first made last Friday after the SFO's announcement that it would not force former merchant bankers Lord Spens and Mr Roger Seelig to face a second trial as a consequence of the view of two psychiatrists that Mr Seelig could no longer defend himself adequately. The court was told that although Mrs Barbara Mills QC, SFO director, remained satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to proceed against Lord Spens, the public interest did not require him to be subjected to 'the rigours of a second lengthy trial'. Mr Justice Henry, before going into closed session to hear Lord Spens' application, said there was a certain illogicality in making a section 17 order in respect of Lord Spens when the effect of a nolle prosequi in Mr Seelig's case was simply to stay the proceedings against Mr Seelig and was not the same as an acquittal. Guinness Two is not the first City trial to be halted because of a defendant's health. In August 1989 Mr Kenneth Grob, former chairman of the Alexander Howden insurance group, was acquitted on theft charges. In January 1990 a judge refused to allow a linked trial in which Mr Grob faced further theft charges to go ahead because Mr Grob's poor health meant he was at risk of both physical and mental breakdown. Also, the judge said, Mr Grob and his co-defendant in the second trial could not get a fair trial because material witnesses had either died or were too ill to give evidence. Before the first Howden trial began the prosecution had been abandoned against one defendant because he was too ill to stand trial, and a few weeks into the trial charges were dropped against another defendant, also on health grounds.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHOEMAKER ENTERS FIRST RACE AS A TRAINER  </P> <P> Bill Shoemaker, who retired 3 1/2 months ago as the winningest jockey in  thoroughbred racing history, officially begins phase two of his professional  life today -- as a trainer.  </P> <P> Star Child, a 3-year-old Kentucky-bred daughter of Our Native and Ice Princess,  is running for Shoemaker in today's fifth race at Hollywood Park, a mile  allowance event for 3-year-old fillies on turf. One of 10 entries in the  $32,000 race, Star Child will be ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye and was assigned  117 pounds.  </P> <P> Ironically, it was Delahoussaye, aboard Exemplary Leader, who won the final  race in which Shoemaker competed, at Santa Anita on Feb. 3. Shoemaker's mount,  Patchy Groundfog, finished fourth in the race billed as "The Legend's Last  Ride."  </P> <P> While he's a little reluctant to admit it, the man known simply as "The Shoe"  for most of his 41 years as a rider is eager to start his new career.  </P> <P> "It's just one of my horses to run. If it wasn't the first one, no one would  care," Shoemaker said at Barn 65 South, where his stable is housed at Hollywood  Park. "I'm excited to get her in a race. She's been training good. Hopefully,  she'll run good."  </P> <P> Shoemaker said he has 24 horses in his stable.  </P> <P> "Some of the people just came to me," he said. "I just thought I'd start out  with 10 or 12. It blossomed up to 24 before I knew it.  </P> <P> "So far, so good. It's a different phase of my life."  </P> <P> Shoemaker was emphatic when asked if he missed riding. "No. I went 40 years,"  he said. "That's long enough. It's time to do something else."  </P> <P> Shoemaker made it clear he's determined to become more than just another  trainer.  </P> <P> "I'd like to win the Triple Crown, or win the (Kentucky) Derby with a horse,"  he said. "I won the Derby riding a horse, I'd like to train a winner. Only one  guy's ever done that before and that's Johnny Longden."  </P></p>

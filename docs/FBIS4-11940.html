			<p>BFN     [Text] In occupied Kashmir, five people were reported  burned alive by the Indian troops when a conflagration was  caused by excessive mortar shellings by Indian forces during the  siege of a vast area in Hindwara. Thirty houses were reduced to  ashes in this reckless military action. The situation in the  area was described as very tense and reports said the Indian  military action was still continuing.    Meanwhile, in one area of Srinagar, three people were shot  dead in a military crackdown. Similar crackdowns were also  carried out in various other localities of Srinagar and Sopor.  Another report says two bullet-ridden bodies were recovered in  Bijbiara. The dead were victims of custodial killings. In  Kulgam, two persons were shot dead by military personnel during  a siege and search operation. The freedom fighters in a  retaliatory move opened fire at the troops, but the casualties  of the occupation troops are not known.</p>

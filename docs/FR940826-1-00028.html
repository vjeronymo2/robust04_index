These proposed rules set forth reporting requirements for the survey covering 1994 and replace the rules for the last benchmark survey covering 1989. The major change in the reporting requirements to be implemented in these proposed rules is the raising of the exemption level for determining whether a long form or a short form must be filed for nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parent companies. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on these proposed rules will receive consideration if submitted in writing on or before October 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments may be mailed to the Office of the Chief, International Investment Division (BE&hyph;50), Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, or hand delivered to Shipping and Receiving, Section M&hyph;100, 1441 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005.

This survey is to be conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (Pub. L. 94&hyph;472, 90 Stat. 2059, 22 U.S.C. 3101&hyph;3108, as amended) hereinafter, ``the Act.'' Section 4(b) of the Act, as amended, requires that with respect to United States direct investment abroad, the President shall conduct a benchmark survey covering year 1982, a benchmark survey covering year 1989, and benchmark surveys covering every fifth year thereafter. In conducting surveys pursuant to this subsection, the President shall, among other things and to the extent he determines necessary and feasible_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) identify the location, nature, and magnitude of, and changes in total investment by an parent in each of its affiliates and the financial transactions between any parent and each of its affiliates; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) obtain (A) information on the balance sheet of parents and affiliates and related financial data, (B) income statements, including the gross sales by primary line of business (with as much product line detail as is necessary and feasible) of parents and affiliates in each country in which they have significant operations; and (C) related information regarding trade, including trade in both goods and services, between a parent and each of its affiliates and between each parent or affiliate and any other person; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) collect employment data showing both the number of United States and foreign employees of each parent and affiliate and the levels of compensation, by country, industry, and skill level; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) obtain information on tax payments by parents and affiliates by country; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) determine, by industry and country, the total dollar amount of research and development expenditures by each parent and affiliate, payments or other compensation for the transfer of technology between parents and their affiliates, and payments or other compensation received by parents or affiliates from the transfer of technology to other persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The responsibility for conducting benchmark surveys of U.S. direct investment abroad has been delegated by the President to the Secretary of Commerce, who has redelegated by the President to the Secretary of Commerce, who has redelegated it to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The benchmark surveys are BEA's censuses, intended to cover the universe of U.S. direct investment abroad in value terms. U.S. direct investment abroad is defined as the ownership or control, directly or indirectly, by one U.S. person of 10 percent or more of the voting securities of an incorporated foreign business enterprise or an equivalent interest in an unincorporated foreign business enterprise, including a branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of he benchmark survey is to obtain comprehensive data on the overall operations of U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates, and on positions and transactions between them. The survey is mandated by Congress to provide a factual framework for addressing the concerns of policymakers and the general public about the effects of direct investment abroad on the U.S. and foreign economies. The data from the survey are needed to record the size of U.S. direct investment abroad, measure changes in such investment, and assess its impact. The data will provide benchmarks for deriving current universe estimates of direct investment from sample data collected in other BEA surveys in nonbenchmark years. In particular, they will serve as benchmarks for the quarterly direct investment estimates included in the U.S. international transactions and the national income and product accounts, and for annual estimates of the U.S. direct investment position abroad and of the operations of U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The benchmark surveys are the most comprehensive of BEA's surveys in terms of subject matter in order that they obtain the detailed information on U.S. direct investment abroad needed for policy purposes. As specified in the Act, policy areas of particular interest include, among other things, trade in both goods and services, employment and employment compensation, taxes, and technology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed, the survey will consist of an instruction booklet, a claim for not filing the BE&hyph;10, and the following report forms: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Form BE&hyph;10A for reporting by a U.S. Reporter that is not a bank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Royal admits Pounds 1m pension mistake YOU MIGHT have thought it was difficult to take almost Pounds 1m out of a pension fund by mistake, and then not notice it for two years. But Royal Life managed to do just that with one of its externally managed funds. Now, the question is exactly how much money should be paid back. To start with, it was a very basic administrative error. In July 1988, Michael Telfer, the manager of the BTL Exempt pension fund, asked Royal Heritage, the unit-linked division of Royal Life, to cancel units from the cash holding of the fund to a value of Pounds 930,397.50. This was done. Unfortunately, Telfer says, it then made the same transfer again, leaving the fund technically insolvent. Royal Life spotted the error in March 1991 and made a repayment into the fund. The company admits that the error should not have happened, and that it should have been discovered and put right much sooner. The issue then became one of compensation. Royal decided to look at the number of units which had been removed from the fund in error, and multiply them by the prevailing unit price in March 1988. This delivered a total of Pounds 841,401.50 - less than the amount which had been taken out. A drop in the unit price over the intervening period had caused this, and Royal Life's reasoning was that this method meant the fund was now the size it would have been had the error never happened. But is this right? Telfer denies this vigorously, pointing out that the value of the fund's units is determined by its total assets, not the other way around. As the cash removed should always have been an asset of the fund, it seems unfair on that basis to reduce it. He also points out that the withdrawal of units meant being forced to realise investments, either at a loss or incurring sizeable bid-offer spreads in the process. Investment performance, and hence the unit price, might have been better had this not happened. Certainly, removing nearly Pounds 1m reduced drastically the manager's room to manoeuvre, as the fund's size had dropped to Pounds 265,436 by March 1991. Royal decided in July to make a further payment into BTL, so that the entire cash sum was repaid but without any interest. Telfer and Royal are now locked in dispute over what should happen next. Icki Iqbal, actuary for Royal Life, says the money probably was invested in cash and gilts while it was outside the fund. He adds: 'If the unit price had risen, then we would have had to pay more. That would have been our obligation. 'But unit-linked policyholders' rights are determined by the unit value, and I really don't think we have an obligation to do more than we have done.' Around 40 or 50 people, mostly directors and executives, expect to draw pensions from the BTL fund. Others who want to save through unit-linked broker funds might want to take note of the problems which arose in this case.</p>

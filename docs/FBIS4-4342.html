			<p>BFN     [Text] Reports about the readiness of the Royal Government  of Cambodia [RGC] and the Khmer Rouge to attend a meeting were  heard while fighting was underway in northwestern Cambodia. Now  there is a report that Khieu Samphan is prepared to return to  Phnom Penh.    In Sopheap, the Democratic Kampuchea representative in Phnom  Penh, has said: We are prepared to meet to solve this problem.  Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister of the RGC, was quoted as  saying on 28 March that the government is leaving the door open  for talks with the Khmer Rouge. Moreover, Prince Kromkhun  Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister and minister of foreign  affairs, said in Bangkok on 28 March: I hope the Khmer Rouge  will listen to the advice of the king father of the nation and  sit down at the negotiating table.    It is worth recalling that Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut  recently informed domestic and international reporters of the  king's desire to see national reconciliation among Cambodians  and an end to the bloodshed.    While the conflicting parties' intent to reach a peaceful  solution is being heard, there is also a rumor that Khieu  Samphan, the nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge, will soon return  to Phnom Penh. The Democratic Kampuchea official did not  confirm or deny this report.    It is known that His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk and the  queen will return to Phnom Penh on 8 April. Prince Kromkhun  Norodom Sirivut says he hopes that talks with the Khmer Rouge  will resume at that time.    The talks have been adjourned since mid-January following a  series of futile talks between First Prime Minister Prince  Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Khieu Samphan. Nevertheless,  Samdech Hun Sen has said: Our position remains unchanged. We  are keeping the door open and are considering the possibility of  such a meeting when the king returns.    Khieu Samphan's whereabouts are currently unknown. A  military source, however, has disclosed that Pol Pot is staying  in Kum Rieng village, only a few kilometers north of Pailin. He  fled Pailin two days before the stronghold fell to the  government.</p>

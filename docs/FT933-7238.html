			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Single currency essential to success of EC Sir, The debacle of the exchange rate mechanism over the past year or so emphasises a very clear message from the business community: until costs and revenues are expressed in the same monetary unit the potential benefits of membership of the European Community will never be realised. The lesson for the European Commission and the member countries should be clear: a single currency must be achieved as soon as possible. Without this, the EC will stagger on in disunity for the foreseeable future and may never achieve the desired economic benefits for its inhabitants.

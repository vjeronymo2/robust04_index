			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Kim Tae-chung, chairman  of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the Asia-Pacific  Region, has suggested a "package deal" in solution to the Korean  nuclear issue.    The nuclear issue can be resolved through a "package deal"  under which Western countries would "recognize the Pyongyang  government while North Korea give up nuclear program," Kim said  at a meeting in Taegu, capital of South Korea's North Kyongsang  Province Saturday [9 April].    Kim, former renowned South Korean opposition leader, asked  the South Korean Government to adopt a soft policy toward the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in order to bring  about change.    "The Cold War age is over and the conditions causing  division  of the Korean Peninsula have disappeared. So if South and North  Korea continue their exhausting competition, both will turn into  third- rate countries," he warned.    Kim predicted, "North Korea will eventually abandon nuclear  program and the United States will establish an embassy in  Pyongyang."    Speaking at Pusan University in the country's South  Kyongsang  Province Friday, Kim Tae-chung said that South Korea and the  U.S. should not resume their joint military exercise "Team  Spirit" as it would impede dialogue on the nuclear issue.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Assumptions on benefits of UK forestry privatisation flawed Sir, Your article 'The Future of the Forests' (November 23) suggests that privatisation of the Forestry Commission has some merit, particularly in addressing the commission's current shortcomings. But it makes two fundamental assumptions which need to be challenged. First, the commission has already made headway on the issues of hidden environmental costs, bureaucracy and unfulfilled recreational potential for which it is criticised. Progress towards quantifying and defining the costs of environmental benefits has been made through the new special management grant and the community woodland supplement for tree planting. The reorganisation of the commission last year has helped to improve its effectiveness and the fact that the commission's forests receive 50m visits per year indicates it fulfils its recreational potential very well. Second, and much more importantly, there is an assumption that privatisation could protect non-economic benefits. The role of the commission has changed out of all recognition since the 1970s when timber production at all costs was its watchword. It now takes a lead in promoting multi-purpose forestry - integrating access, landscape and wildlife conservation with timber production in its own forests and as a regulatory authority for felling and planting. This change has been hard won and like many other organisations the Woodland Trust wants to see the status quo retained, consolidated and given a chance to work. Private interests have yet to show whole-hearted enthusiasm for guarding access and conservation interests even when incentives are available. We have major concerns that the estimated Pounds 35m-Pounds 40m annual public subsidy which would be needed for private landowners to maintain the commission's current environmental management standards would not be forthcoming in the current climate on public spending. Voluntary bodies like ourselves would be left with an impossible task in trying to protect woodlands of major environmental significance.

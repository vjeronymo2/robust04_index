			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Text] Barcelona, [Ven] 20 Jan (Venpres) -- In light of  the Anzoategui State Metropolitan Police's inability to deal  with the violence that has taken place over the past two days in  the Barcelona-Puerto La Cruz metropolitan area, the two cities  have been virtually militarized as of today.    The measure was adopted by Miguel Aparicio Ramirez, general  commander of the Anzoategui State Military Garrison, at the  governor's behest because the police could no longer control the  violence which last week and over the past two days has evolved  into vandalism, pillage, and plunder.    Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz were totally calm today. The  presence of Army and National Guard units patrolling the streets  of the Barcelona-Puerto La Cruz conurbation was noted and  welcomed by residents because, at least for today, calm has been  restored in the area.    Transportation service has fully resumed, allowing workers  and students to fulfill their duties. Stores have reopened and  are conducting business as usual.    Governor Ovidio Gonzalez, who finally met with reporters  this  morning, said the situation in northern Anzoategui State has  been totally normalized, but he refused to admit that Barcelona  as well as Puerto La Cruz had awoke to [words indistinct] units  of the Armed Forces and National Guard, saying it is a routine  decision when there has been violence such as the recent  incidents.    Gonzalez disclosed that agreements had been reached by the  leaders of the Anzoategui State Transportation Union and the  mayors' offices of the state's two leading municipalities, which  are Bolivar (Barcelona) and Sotillo (Puerto La Cruz), to release  [sincerar] fares. While this happens, bus fares will be lowered  until the respective agreements are signed by the transportation  sector and the municipal councils, which are the authorities  that set bus fares.    On another issue, the governor denied that the search  conducted by police at the Anzoategui branch of Oriente  University was a search, claiming that the measure was adopted  to prevent trucks transporting food and other merchandise from  being hijacked and sacked inside the university.    Gonzalez said the police entered the university to retrieve  trucks that had been hijacked by hooded individuals and  infiltrators determined to create chaos in the city. The police  accomplished that task without violating any student rights.    Aside from that, the governor added, we cannot allow a  person, just because he is a student and can seek shelter at the  university, to perpetrate abuses and create disorder that  affects the general public. I was once a student, and such  things did not take place in our day. We protested by staging  demonstrations, and things went no further.    Governor Gonzalez explained that it is the governor's duty  to  preserve the people's property and physical security, which is  what the Armed Forces are helping to do, so peace and normalcy  can return to the area.    Gonzalez concluded by saying that for the time being, no  demonstrations will be permitted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hajrudin Sermic] </F>   [Excerpt] The residents of Maglaj have been deprived of  yet another urgently needed convoy of food and medicine. Eight  UNHCR trucks arrived, carrying everything but food. The  authorities of the aggressor 111th HVO [Croatian Defense  Council] Brigade have been blackmailing our side by insisting  that, before the [food] convoy enters the town, their 34  fighters be immediately exchanged for more than 100 of our  civilians, mainly sick and exhausted women, children, and  elderly people, who have been in the hands of these criminals  for seven months.    Previous convoys for Maglaj were sent back. Once because  they did not have a permit from the Serbian authorities, another  time because of the Croatian authorities, a third time because  they were allegedly shot at, and now because of this exchange.  Whether accidentally or not, Larry Hollingworth is involved in  this dirty matter. He came to Maglaj without the convoy at 0930  yesterday to tell the state and military leadership of Maglaj  about the HVO's demands.    Mr. Hollingworth returned to Zepce, where he is not being  allowed to take the urgently needed food and medicines. Vinko  Ivesic, representative of the HVO commission for exchange, and  Delaj Krnic, president of our commission, got in touch at 1700.  The HVO then revealed its real face. Everything is now crystal  clear. They want to get their fighters and ethnically cleanse  occupied Zepce of Muslims. They have said loud and clear that  they do not care much for their fighters, that they will expel  all 860 Muslims to Maglaj, and that they will not allow any  convoys to get through in the future, as has been the case so  far.

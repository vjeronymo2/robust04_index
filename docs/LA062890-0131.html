			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> HEN'S TEETH DEAL STUDIED  </P> <P> The city could become a partner in Hen's Teeth Square, a 27,500-square foot  retail and office center in Northwest Pasadena under a proposal presented  Tuesday by center developer Jeanette Henderson.  </P> <P> According to a city staff report, the center, at 2057 N. Los Robles Ave., is  only 60% leased and faces default.  </P> <P> The city in the past has loaned the center $376,000 and has been a tenant  there, paying $10,920 monthly for 7,280 square feet of office space. Henderson  wants the city to purchase a 50% share for $440,000.  </P> <P> The Pasadena Board of Directors instructed the city manager and the City  Development Department to analyze the proposal and report back to the board  promptly, because the center could be declared in default by mid-September.  </P></p>

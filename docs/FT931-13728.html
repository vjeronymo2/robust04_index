			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Israel's credit rating upgraded STANDARD and Poor's, the international credit rating agency, has upgraded Israel's sovereign debt rating in response to what it views as an improved political outlook in the Middle East, progress in economic reforms and the granting of US loan guarantees to back Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.45bn) in foreign borrowing. The move comes as the government is preparing to approach international lenders for funds to be borrowed against the first tranche of the loan guarantees to help it cover a projected Dollars 2bn current account deficit. The guarantees encouraged the government to plan infrastructural investment to help the economy cope with immigration from the former Soviet Union. Standard and Poor's said it was upgrading Israel's long-term external debt to triple-B from its previous rating of triple-B minus, the lowest investment grade rating. Its short-term foreign currency rating was likewise raised to A-2 from A-3. The disappearance of Soviet backing for Israel's Arab foes, the weakening of Iraq and the Middle East peace talks begun in 1991 all diminished regional tensions, reduced instability and lessened the economic burden of defence, said Standard and Poor's.</p>

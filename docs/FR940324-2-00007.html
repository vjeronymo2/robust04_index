			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CIT has reviewed and upheld the Department's sampling methodology in the context of an antidumping duty review. (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Floral Trade Council  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 775 F. Supp. 1492 (1991) (Floral Trade II).) In that case, the Court acknowledged Commerce's authority, which was unchallenged, to use sampling techniques (which in this case involved sampling among manufacturers/exporters). The decisions in Floral Trade II and numerous other cases support the proposition that the only limitations on Commerce's authority to use sampling techniques are the criteria in Section 777A, noted above.

Peninsula et al. assert that, as reflected in the December 16, 1991 letter and December 13, 1991 sampling memorandum that the Department issued, the decision to sample was based simply on the total number of respondents requested by petitioners for the three concurrent MMF Sweater reviews (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea), without regard to whether the total number of respondents in each individual country was amenable to sampling under generally recognized principles of statistical theory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Peninsula et al. contend that there is no evidence on the record which demonstrates that the Department made any effort to decide how large a sample was necessary to reduce the sampling error to an acceptable level. They argue that statistical theory does not permit sampling to be undertaken in all instances where there is a multitude of objects to be studied, and point out that required sample size should be directly proportional to the population variance. They argue that there is no analysis on the record which demonstrates that the Department considered how many firms, from the sample pool of 18, needed to be investigated in order to bring the sampling error to an acceptable level, and that Peninsula and Fang noted this in their December 23, 1991 letter to the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As in similar cases in the past, the Department's decision to sample was based on the large number of respondents in the three concurrent MMF sweater reviews, and the resource constraints that existed at the time these reviews were initiated. We have employed sampling in the past based on a large sales volume and the resulting burden that analyzing all sales would place upon us. In Certain Fresh Cut Flowers From Colombia; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, Partial Termination of Administrative Review and Intent To Revoke Order (In Part) (58 FR 65329, December 14, 1993), we noted the large number of firms and transactions under review, and in Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Partial Termination of Administrative Reviews (56 FR 11200, March 15, 1991) we noted the large number of transactions and the resulting administrative burden involved in calculating individual margins for all of these transactions. Furthermore, the CIT has upheld the use of sampling based on the cumulative burden resulting from simultaneous cases. (See, e.g., Floral Trade I.) In the present case, we initiated reviews on 128 firms from Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, and, due to the significant sales volume, we sampled firms. (We later eliminated from the sample pools companies which did not respond to our sampling questionnaire, had no shipments, or could not be located.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also disagree with Peninsula et al. regarding the information we had concerning the firms in the sample, at the time we made the decision to sample. We received from the Hong Kong government a list of quota holders and their allocated export quantities on November 11, 1994, more than a month before our decision to sample. Based on that information, we were able to assess the approximate volume of the Hong Kong MMF sweater manufacturers/exporters before making our decision to sample in the three cases. The Hong Kong sample constituted 22 percent of the firms in the sample pool, and captured approximately 60 percent of the sales volume. We therefore concluded that the sample was adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Peninsula et al. argue that sampling was inappropriate because the sample pool was too small. They cite the December 23, 1991 letter from NKSA to the Department, in which NKSA pointed out that the Department had not sampled respondent companies in other administrative reviews that had involved a greater number of companies. They also cite a 1991 submission from Peninsula and Fang, in which Peninsula and Fang argued that the 17 companies which had, at that time, responded to the preliminary questionnaire, accounted for only 204,742 dozen sweaters worth $19 million, and that, in reviews of other antidumping duty orders, the Department had reviewed transactions of single respondents with much greater values and volumes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Peninsula et al. argue that even the results of the review demonstrate that the pool was too small, noting that the presence of a single BIA respondent drove the sample rate from 5.86 to 31.72 percent. They point out that in Fresh Cut Flowers from Colombia: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Administrative Review, 58 FR 65329 (December 14, 1993), a BIA margin of 72.35 percent was applied to two firms and was included in the sample pool margin, but that the effect of the inclusion of these firms was a margin of 5.71 percent. They also argue that the Department did not seem to verify that the four companies which claimed no shipments did not export to the United States during the period of review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We disagree with Peninsula et al. that the size of the sample was too small to be appropriate. As mentioned above, our sample captured approximately twenty-two percent of firms and sixty percent of all sales. While we have at times been able to review companies with greater value and volume, given that we simultaneously initiated reviews on 128 firms from three countries, and that there were scarce resources available to us at the time, the decision to sample was justified. In Hong Kong alone, the sample pool was 18 firms, a greater number than in most antidumping reviews. Furthermore, given the differences in selling practices generally found among companies, and the necessity of conducting a separate analysis of each company selected, it is less of an administrative burden to analyze a large number of sales from a few companies, than a smaller number of sales spread among a greater number of companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the companies which claimed no shipments, we did verify their claims with the U.S. Customs Department. (See e-mail from the U.S. Department of Commerce to U.S. Customs, dated July 2, 1992.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

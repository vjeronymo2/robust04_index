The government  that now takes over the business of the Union is led by a sick  and elderly man who has made his new wife his chief assistant.  The top ranks of the civil service have been almost wholly  replaced by new people, sweeping away many with deep experience  of European affairs.    The foreign minister of this government has called Germany  "a  bestial giant with a child's brain." His deputy, who will chair  meetings of foreign ministers, has called the Turkish Government  "muggers...dragging bloody boots cross the carpets of Europe."    The country these men lead is widely regarded in Brussels as  more of a liability than an asset to the Union. Its economy is  the worst performer of the Twelve and the gap with the others is  widening. It relies on billions of pounds in subsidies from  Brussels for about 10 percent of its GNP. A substantial  proportion of these subsidies is believed to drift into private  pockets, regardless of the government in power, so corrupt is  the political culture of Greece. Andreas Papandreou himself,  risen from the political dead to return as prime minister, only  narrowly escaped conviction for corruption after his last term  in office.    With another 13 billion [U.S. trillion] pounds of "cohesion  funds" pledged for the next six years, the enthusiasm of Greek  politicians for European integration is easily understood. The  enthusiasm is not reciprocated. The particular fear now is that  the Union will be further burdened by Greece's obsession with  Macedonia, its sympathy for Serbia and its long hostility to  Turkey.    If the next six months go as badly as everyone expects, the  case for institutional reform will be strengthened. With  enlargement looming, the Union may no longer be able to afford  the uneven quality and discontinuity of the rotating presidency  in its present form.    Indeed, Greece itself is proposing that a committee of "wise  men" be set up to study a future European constitution. It  would be a nice irony if Greece's tenure of the presidency  brought forward reforms, such as presidential partnerships of  large and small countries with longer tenure, that had the  effect of preventing Greece from holding the presidency on its  own again.</p>

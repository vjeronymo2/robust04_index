			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban April 2 SAPA -- KwaZulu Police [KZP]  Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During said on Saturday [2 April] his  force was not affected by the emergency regulations and would  continue its normal policing duties in cooperation with the SA  Police [SAP] and Defence Force [SADF]. He described African  National Congress President Nelson Mandela's remark that the KZP  would be confined to barracks under the regulations as  "reckless".    "I don't know where on earth he gets that idea. We're an  independent statutory force with our own police act."    Earlier, SADF Natal spokesman Col Frans Verfuss said  clarification was being sought on the precise role of the KZP  under the emergency regulations. He added, however, that the KZP  would continue its duties in the interim.    In a telephonic interview later, Gen During said: "What  clarification is necessary? There is nothing to clarify. They've  left the kwaZulu Police completely out.    "In other words, the regulations don't affect them.    "As far as I'm concerned, we continue as in the past and  according to the laws of the country."    He said the KZP would continue cooperating with the SAP and  SADF "as in the past". "There will be operations we'll also plan  together."    He said there were a few issues within the emergency  regulations that required clarity, but as far as he was  concerned, "the role of the KZP is not affected at all".    He said confining the KZP to barracks would be doing the  community a disservice.</p>

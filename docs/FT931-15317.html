			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Time-out called in Uruguay Round negotiations TARIFF negotiators from the US and the European Community yesterday broke off talks in Geneva to seek further instructions from their respective capitals. 'We have struck a blockage and if our political masters want us to carry on they need to tell us how to do it,' said an EC official. The two sides have been trying to strike an outline deal on reducing barriers to trade in goods by next Friday, when senior negotiators in the Uruguay Round of talks on global trade liberalisation meet to review prospects. Washington and Brussels agreed to make a final push for a tariff agreement and the broad framework of a Round settlement before President-elect Bill Clinton takes office on January 20. But they have run into problems over the trade-off between US demands for more sectors to be included in a 'zero-for-zero' package, which would eliminate all duties on a reciprocal basis, and EC demands for cuts in high US tariffs on textiles and other sensitive products. Each side argues that the other has not conceded enough. EC officials say the US has offered only a 10-15 per cent cut in peak textiles tariffs, which now range up to 36 per cent, reducing the US average from 16.8 per cent to 15.7 per cent. US negotiators say they are prepared to do more if the EC will go further in reducing or eliminating tariffs in such sectors as electronic goods and non-ferrous metals. EC officials said yesterday they expected fresh instructions last night and talks would continue today 'We're still in business but we need some guidance,' said one. Gatt sources said yesterday that a final Uruguay Round deal by Mr Clinton's inauguration was never on the cards, but that Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, still hoped for 'something worthwhile' as a stepping stone to an early overall settlement.</p>

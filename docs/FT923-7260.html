			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Arts: The Voysey Inheritance - Edinburgh International Festival HARLEY Granville Barker's The Voysey Inheritance has long been regarded as one of the best English language plays of the 20th century, if only by a minority of critics. By the standards of Granville Barker, it has been performed quite often  - more than 100 times before the First World War and periodically revived since. Some of his plays have not been performed at all. This year's Edinburgh Festival is doing its utmost to make up for the neglect. When he planned it, Brian McMaster, the festival director, can hardly have known the good fortune that was coming his way. For The Voysey Inheritance is about fraud. A prominent solicitor invests his client's trust money on his own account and spends quite a lot of it on his own account as well. Gradually his family is drawn into the deceit. It is a question of desperately moving money around faster and faster in order to conceal how little of it remains. For trust funds read pension funds and the contemporary ring is obvious. Line after line could come out of reports of recent fraud cases. As old Mr Voysey explains, to gain the confidence of his clients a financier needs a reputation for wealth. 'And if one is not opulent in one's daily life, one loses that wonderful financier's touch.' Yet it is not the topicality alone that makes The Voysey Inheritance so riveting. I have seen it before and admired it almost as much. As a play, it is so splendidly adult. The theme is the ethics of business and let no one say that that was a less complex subject in Edwardian times than it is today. It was arguably more so because more people lived on capital, fraud was unexpected and there were few regulations to prevent it. Corruption was just as insidious. When the extent of Voysey's wrongdoing becomes known, it is notable how many people join in the deceit in order to protect themselves. Even the vicar, at one remove, goes in for blackmail to cover his investments. The strength of the play, however, goes beyond the subject-matter. There is a mastery of character and dialogue which is unusual in English drama, including Granville Barker's contemporary, Shaw. At least four of the relatively minor parts stand out as gems of their kind. One is Peacey, the faithful office clerk played by Ron Pember, who has known about the fraud for years but wants a handout in cash to keep his son at Cambridge. Another is old Mrs Voysey, who has known as well but never discussed business with her husband. She has great presence but very few lines; played by Gillian Martell, she scores with every shot. Then there is Frank Middlemass as George Booth, the old friend of Voysey, who stands to lose a great deal of money, even though he can afford to do so. He could be a bit of a stooge, but is played here with dignity and some feeling. The minor character who excels most of all is Peter Blythe as Major Voysey, the military member of the family with little brain but loud voice. 'What England wants,' he says, 'is chest]' This part is a masterpiece of comic writing. The play has its weaknesses. Edward, the Voysey son, who undertakes to put right his father's malpractice, starts out as something of a prig and is a hard role to deliver. Nevertheless, Peter Lindford goes as close as humanly possible to bringing him off. The other weakness, which has always dogged the play, is Granville Barker's attempt to drag in an extra theme of sexual equality. The on-off romance between Edward and his independent cousin and heiress, Alice, does not quite work. In William Gaskill's production, it is reduced to a minor impediment. Gaskill has taken advantage of everything on offer. The beautifully refurbished Lyceum Theatre is exactly the right place for this play. The stage, with sets designed by Hayden Griffin, is big enough to accommodate it. The dinner table, around which all family disputes ultimately take place, is displayed in all its bourgeois finery. The details are perfect. After Edinburgh this week the production will go on to tour Bath, Woking, Oxford, Newcastle and Nottingham. See it wherever you can.</p>

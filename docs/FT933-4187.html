			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / (CORRECTED) Global union watch on Hanson Correction (published 17th September 1993) appended to this article. A WORLDWIDE trade union council is to be established representing workers employed by companies owned by Hanson, the conglomerate. This was announced yesterday after a meeting of TUC leaders with the AFL-CIO, the US trade union body, and the United Mineworkers of America. The council will be permanent with worker representatives worldwide. The aim is to co-ordinate union strategy across the Hanson subsidiaries. The TUC and AFL-CIO said they would be seeking a meeting with the company to discuss creating a joint company-union council. Yesterday's announcement is the latest response to the current strike in the US by miners, including 17,000 employed by Peabody, the biggest private coal company in the US and a wholly owned Hanson subsidiary. The protest, which has been going on since February, is against the Bituminous Coal Association of which Peabody is a member. The United Mineworkers of America are demanding that jobs should be offered to unionised miners in new pits when exhausted ones are closed. The strike has turned into a bitter struggle over the future of trade unionism in the US coal industry. As the leading negotiator in the mineowners' association, Peabody is setting the pace for non-unionism in an industry where two-thirds of the 100,000 miners are still organised. The close involvement of the TUC and the AFL-CIO reflects a growing partnership across the Atlantic. They want to establish more global organisations to press for the establishment of social clauses established by the International Labour Organisation and the OECD in agreements with global corporations. Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson, made no comment about the proposal for a joint company-union council. He said: 'We have excellent industrial relations.' MSF, the technical union, has announced what it calls a US-style corporate campaign against Zurich Insurance company over its decision to de-recognise the union. MSF has 1,000 members employed by Municipal Mutual Insurance, which was acquired by Zurich earlier this year. The campaign involves legal action, local and national lobbying, and advertising. CORRECTION ON September 9 the FT wrote that Mutual Municipal Insurance had been acquired by Zurich Insurance early this year. Zurich Insurance has in fact only acquired parts of the business of MMI.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News in Brief: CBR holds dividend at BFr270 CBR, the Belgian cement group, proposed an unchanged net dividend of BFr270 (Dollars 7.88) a share after a sharp drop in 1992 earnings, Reuter reports from Brussels. The company said earlier its consolidated net profit per share fell to BFr606 from BFr797 in 1991. CBR said the 1992 profit fall was mainly due to the recession in the US and to a lesser extent to a slump in the Dutch construction industry. CBR is 43.2 per cent owned by Belgium's flagship holding company, Societe Generale de Belgique.</p>

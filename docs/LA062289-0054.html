An official for  the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General-Command  said the jets struck the group's headquarters and two military positions in  hills about 10 miles south of the Lebanese capital. Police said one guerrilla  was killed and eight were wounded. An Israeli army spokesman said the positions  "were used as command posts for the terrorist organization of (Popular Front  leader) Ahmed Jibril." The front, a dissident group that split from the  Palestine Liberation Organization, has denounced the PLO's recent softer tone  toward Israel.  </P></p>

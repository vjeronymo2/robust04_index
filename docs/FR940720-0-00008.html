The following table shows the NRC budget authority for Title II uranium recovery licensees for FY 1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,tp0,i1,s10,7,7,7 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Title II  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> facilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Dollars in thousands  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2FY  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> 1992  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2FY  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> 1993  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2FY  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> 1994 <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Total Budget Authority  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $3,668  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $3,065  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $2,839  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Less 10 CFR Part 170 Fees  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> ^1,700  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> ^2,600  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> ^2,200 <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=03 g=1 f=1 --> Total Annual Fees  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,968  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 465  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 639 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As shown above, the NRC total budget authority for commercial uranium recovery licensees has steadily decreased from $3,668,000 in FY 1992 to $2,839,000 in FY 1994, a 23 percent decrease since FY 1992. However, because of the relatively large collection of 10 CFR Part 170 fees in FY 1993 as a result of the NRC licensing review efforts associated with the Envirocare license application, the FY 1993 amount of $465,000 to be collected through annual fees is $174,000 less than the FY 1994 annual fee amount of $639,000. In FY 1993, the NRC estimated that approximately $2.6 million would be collected from 10 CFR 170 fees, including fees for the major review work for the Envirocare 11.e(2) license. The Envirocare license was issued on November 19, 1993. Therefore, the 10 CFR Part 170 fees estimated to be collected in FY 1994 have decreased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another reason for the increase in FY 1994 annual fees for commercial uranium recovery licensees is a reduction in the number of licensees. In FY 1993 there were 14 uranium recovery licensees subject to annual fees, compared with 12 licensees in FY 1994. This is a decrease of 2 licensees (or 14 percent). Because costs are allocated to a class of licensees, any terminations that occur within the class will raise the annual fees for the remaining licensees within that class in order for the NRC to collect approximately 100 percent of its budget in fees. The generic and other regulatory costs allocated to a class of licensees under 10 CFR Part 171 are not dependent on the number of licensees in a class.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the total amount of annual fees to be recovered from all uranium recovery licensees, commercial (Title II) and DOE (Title I) is $2.1 million in FY 1994, $1.5 million of this amount is for DOE Uranium Mill Tailing Control Act (UMTRCA) activities. The $1.5 million related to DOE UMTRCA activities is being paid by DOE in FY 1994, leaving the $0.6 million to be paid by the commercial Title II facilities. The budget for DOE UMTRCA activities does not affect commercial uranium recovery license fees in FY 1994, nor did it affect their fees prior to FY 1994. As noted by the commenters, DOE is being assessed a $1.5 million annual fee in FY 1994 (10 CFR 171.16(d), fee Category 18b). For FYs 1991&hyph;1993, the costs for DOE UMTRCA activities were assessed to operating power reactors as a surcharge because DOE was not an NRC licensee (10 CFR 171.15(c)(2)). In FY 1994, the costs for UMTRCA activities were moved from the power reactor class of licensees to the uranium recovery class because as of September 21, 1993, DOE became a general licensee of the NRC (10 CFR 40.27) because post-reclamation closure of the Spook, Wyoming site had been achieved. As a result, DOE will be billed for the costs ($1.5 million in FY 1994) associated with NRC's UMTRCA review and all activities associated with the facilities assigned to DOE under UMTRCA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statement made by a commenter that fees collected from DOE will not be used to decrease NRC's license fees is not correct. The $1.5 million to be collected from DOE will not be assessed to operating power reactors who have paid these costs since FY 1991. Therefore, the fees for operating power reactors will decrease as a result of the reallocation of costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the comments regarding the annual fee for licenses authorizing the disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material, the NRC has reexamined its allocation of the budget for Title II uranium recovery activities. Based on this reexamination and the comments received, the NRC has concluded that the part of the budgeted costs for the uranium recovery class of licensees should be allocated to licenses that authorize receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material, because some of these budgeted resources are used to regulate these licensees. Thus, the $639,000 to be recovered in annual fees will be recovered from fee category 2.A.(2) Class I facilities, Class II facilities and Other facilities, plus licenses authorizing disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material. Additionally, the Commission has determined that for licenses issued for the primary purpose of disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material (e.g., the license issued to Envirocare in FY 1994) the annual fee should be 90 percent of the fee for a Class I mill. This is based on a determination that an estimated 90 percent of the budget for regulating Class I mills is related to the mill tailings and the remaining 10 percent to the processing of the ore. Therefore, since essentially the same regulations apply to the mill tailings generated by a Class I mill and the 11e.(2) byproduct material received by a licensee whose primary purpose is to dispose of 11e.(2) byproduct material, the annual fee for a licensee whose primary purpose is the disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material should be the same as that portion (90 percent) of the annual fee for a Class I facility that is related to the mill tailings. The annual fee for non-operating mills that accept 11e.(2) byproduct material for disposal in tailings piles created by mill operations will not be changed, because such disposal is incidental to the existing tailings that were generated prior to elimination of the mill's authority to operate and the Commission's policy is not to assess an annual fee to non-operating facilities. As a result of the above changes the base annual fee for a Class I facility will be reduced from $94,300 to $74,500 for FY 1994. The annual fee for licenses with the primary purpose of disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material will be $67,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

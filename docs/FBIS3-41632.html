Kondrashov, identified by caption]    [Text] [Svyazin over video of warning sign followed  by effluent canal] At the beginning of the seventies two  reservoirs for collecting effluent from the Kazakh capital and  its satellite cities were built a few kilometers from Almaty.  Most of the effluent was channeled into the (?Zhaman-kum)  reservoir, which burst its banks in 1988. Eleven people were  killed at the time. Following the breach of the (?Zhaman-kum),  all the effluent containing heavy metals, carcinogenic  substances, petrochemical products, and also various bacteria  and viruses ended up in the Sorbulak reservoir. The water level  in the Sorbulak reservoir began to rise sharply. The threat of  a breach emerged.    Mels Yeleusizov: chairman of the ``Greens''  Party, identified by caption] The situation now is simply  critical. Another year, and the water may pour over the dike  and there will be a catastrophe. There is a real threat of  50,000 people being killed.    Svyazin: The problem of Almaty effluent recycling  has been examined by the Republic of Kazakhstan Academy of  Sciences. Scientists believe that a state emergency commission  should be set up as a matter of urgency.

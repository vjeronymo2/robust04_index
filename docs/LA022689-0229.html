			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. COULD HAVE A MAJOR STAKE IN REDISTRICTING FIGHT  </P> <P> Reapportionment, a 15-letter word for political trouble, is lurking around the  corner of the 1990 census.  </P> <P> Nothing is certain in this highly emotional, extremely important decennial  process aimed at evening up legislative and congressional districts. But if  things go as they appear now, California will get an additional four to six  seats in Congress, and at least part of one could be in Orange County, where  the population has grown considerably in the last decade.  </P> <P> At the same time, lines for 40 state Senate and 80 Assembly districts will be  redrawn to reflect California's population shifts, primarily to the suburbs.  </P> <P> Although reapportionment is still 2 years away, Republicans, including GOP  leaders in Orange County, already are trying to figure out how to head off a  redistricting that favors Democrats. And Democrats, who control the state  Legislature, where the lines are drawn, are trying to figure out how to hold  control of the mapping. Both sides will be armed with highly refined computer  programs that will massage the basic building blocks for creating partisan  districts: population and voter patterns.  </P> <P> "Reapportionment is the most difficult thing for people to understand, to  realize it is possible with the use of very sophisticated computer programs to  design districts to ensure an outcome before a single vote is cast," said  Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra).  </P> <P> Indeed, how district lines are drawn will shape the makeup of the state Senate,  Assembly and U.S. House of Representatives into the 21st Century. The party  that emerges most powerful will have primary say over state and federal  legislation affecting issues ranging from Social Security benefits to highway  construction, air pollution and national security.  </P> <P> Orange County Republicans, coming from one of the strongest GOP bases in the  nation, are trying to prevent the kind of redistricting that happened in 1981,  when Democrats were not only in power in the Legislature but had two other  advantages: a Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, to sign into law the plan  fashioned by Democrats, and a state Supreme Court dominated by Brown appointees  to hear appeals of lawsuits filed against the plan by Republicans.  </P> <P> The result was an artful gerrymander -- not unlike similar geographical marvels  fashioned by Republicans when they were in power in the 1950s -- that withstood  legal challenges even beyond the state's courts to as august a body as the U.S.  Supreme Court. The high court decided only last month that California  Republicans had no legal basis to attack the plan engineered by Democrats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Incumbents Protected  </P> <P> The 1981 plan was primarily the work of the late Rep. Phil Burton (D-San  Francisco), whose now-famous assurance to both Democrats and Republicans  anxiously awaiting the final plan was, "You're in your mother's hands." The  plan not only protected all Democratic incumbents but also most GOP incumbents  -- at the expense of a handful of Republicans whose districts were "collapsed."  </P> <P> But there was no doubt which party emerged the victor. It can be seen in this  simple result: Democrats have had a lock on their majorities in both the  Legislature and the state's delegation to the House of Representatives. In  Congress, for example, only one seat in the state has changed parties in 180  races in the last decade -- the 38th District post won by Republican Robert K.  Dornan of Garden Grove in 1984 over 10-year incumbent Jerry M. Patterson, a  moderate Democrat.  </P> <P> "In political terms, that's the most effective gerrymander in the history of  the United States," GOP reapportionment expert Tony Quinn said. Articulating a  familiar theme among Republicans that the GOP has made great strides in  attracting voters, Quinn added, "The congressional delegation, in particular,  defies the political behavior of the state."  </P> <P> Quinn said the Burton plan accomplished this by "literally cement(ing)  everybody in place. Not only are there no shifts, there are virtually no  competitive races."  </P> <P> "Phil Burton was, let's say, a Democrat's Democrat," said Richard J. O'Neill of  San Juan Capistrano, a former state Democratic Party chairman, speaking  admiringly of Burton's redistricting skills. "He hit hard and he fought hard.  He didn't take anybody's crap. He was the most feared Democrat in California."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Everyone for Himself  </P> <P> Burton also understood probably better than anyone this basic rule of  redistricting: everyone for himself. There are few, if any, incumbents who are  willing to be sacrificial lambs to the greater good of either party, and almost  as few who would give up even a modicum of voter registration "safety" to help  a colleague.  </P> <P> Burton, however, is dead. His partner in past redistricting, behind-the-scenes  political strategist Michael Berman, brother of Rep. Howard Berman (D-Studio  City), undoubtedly will have a hand in drawing the lines in 1991. House  Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced) is also expected to play a strong role.  </P> <P> But there is no question that, as one Democrat involved in redistricting put  it, "there will be a sense that Phil's not there to speak for us."  </P> <P> More important, there is a strong possibility that Democrats will fail in their  effort to recapture the governorship in 1990, which will deprive them of the  third leg of power they need to push through a reapportionment plan without the  help of Republicans. Combine that with a move to the right on the state Supreme  Court, as Gov. George Deukmejian's appointees have come to dominate, and the  1991 redistricting promises to at least live up to, and perhaps even surpass,  earlier reapportionment battles in its bitterness and divisiveness.  </P> <P> While the process is highly unpredictable, there may be little change in Orange  County's district lines, although some of the lawmakers who now cross county  lines into San Diego, Los Angeles, Riverside or Imperial counties may find  themselves pushed into one or another county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Much Shifting  </P> <P> Quinn, who also is co-chairman of a volunteer committee within the Republican  Party on reapportionment and election laws, predicted that there would not be  much shifting of districts within Orange County.  </P> <P> "Most of the incumbents in Orange County should be in relatively good shape,"  Quinn said.  </P> <P> There are five members of Congress, all Republicans, whose districts are wholly  or partly in Orange County: Dornan, William E. Dannemeyer of Fullerton, C.  Christopher Cox of Newport Beach, Ron C. Packard of Carlsbad and Dana  Rohrabacher of Lomita.  </P> <P> Of the five, Dornan's district is the one that Democrats crafted in 1981 in the  hopes of keeping at least a foothold in the county's congressional delegation.  For 10 years until 1984, the district was represented by Patterson, a Garden  Grove resident. But Dornan, whose former West Los Angeles seat had been  gerrymandered in the 1981 redistricting to strip him of his Republican support,  eyed the district's overwhelming support for President Reagan in the 1980  election and rightly guessed that the district had become too conservative for  Patterson.  </P> <P> Although the district favors registered Democrats -- currently by 49% to 42% --  Republicans generally vote in greater numbers and are more loyal to their party  than Democrats. Dornan easily beat Patterson, and Democrats have little hope  that even the most drastic of gerrymanders could round up enough voters for  their party to make the district competitive again.  </P> <P> As a result, one Democratic reapportionment expert said, "there would be no  point to destroying Dornan, no partisan interest in doing that."  </P> <P> Democrats have a better shot at bringing the 72nd Assembly District back to the  Democratic fold. Long represented by former Assemblyman Richard Robinson  (D-Garden Grove), who quit to run unsuccessfully against Dornan for Congress,  the 72nd District has been represented by Republicans since 1986. When former  Assemblyman Richard E. Longshore (R-Santa Ana) died last year, Democrats made  an all-out effort to recapture the district, falling just 867 votes short of  defeating Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) in a controversial  $1.9-million battle whose outcome is still a matter of legal dispute.  </P> <P> Democrats could try to bring in areas more favorable to them in Buena Park to  bolster their chances in the 72nd, O'Neill said. "All you need is a thousand  more votes," he said.  </P> <P> But, as Orange County Democratic leader Howard Adler said, even that  possibility is in question.  </P> <P> "It seems to me that if Democrats are going to pick up seats, they will be  looking somewhere outside Orange County to do it," Adler said. "As a practical  matter, Republicans have been winning all the marginal Democratic seats down  here."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Strategies  </P> <P> On a broader level, state Republican leaders are now pinning their hopes on two  strategies: statewide initiatives and keeping control of the governor's office.  </P> <P> There are at least two initiatives being crafted by Republicans for the 1990  ballot, including one by Assembly Minority Leader Johnson that would force  Democrats to follow guidelines -- such as drawing compact districts that do not  cross city or county lines more than a set number of times -- more favorable to  Republicans. Because it is generally believed that the public has little  understanding of reapportionment, the reforms will probably be added to a  measure that also would make major changes in the power structure in the  Assembly -- a more politically viable topic for voters.  </P> <P> The measure also would change the state Constitution since, as Republicans  painfully learned, anything short of that gets caught in a quagmire in the  courts over the issue of the legality of changing legislative rules by  statutory initiative.  </P> <P> The other initiative now under discussion would take the job of redistricting  away from the Legislature and give it to an independent commission.  </P> <P> Speaking of proposed initiatives, Kenneth L. Khachigian of San Clemente, a  former speech writer for President Reagan and a close adviser to Deukmejian,  said: "It will be incumbent on Republicans to raise all the hell they can. . .  . If we can get the boundaries even half fair, the Republicans will pick up  seats all over the place."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Committed to Run  </P> <P> With Deukmejian's decision not to seek a third term, the GOP put heavy pressure  on U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson to run, which resulted in his Feb. 18 announcement to  form an exploratory committee, essentially committing him to run for the post.  </P> <P> Importantly, in his first speech as a gubernatorial candidate, Wilson opened  the battle for reapportionment by calling for approval of the GOP's  initiatives. "We cannot permit the people of California to undergo another  cynical gerrymandering that will defraud California voters for the next  decade," Wilson said.  </P> <P> If elected, Wilson could veto any partisan Democratic plan, which would then  require a two-thirds vote to override and put the GOP in a very strong  bargaining position.  </P> <P> "If there is a Republican governor, then I think the Legislature is out of it,"  said James Tucker, chief legal counsel to Assembly Elections and  Reapportionment during the 1981 redistricting. "I don't think they can come up  with a plan that gets two-thirds of both houses."  </P> <P> A veto undoubtedly would throw the matter into the courts, which appointed  three masters in 1971 to draw the lines when the Legislature failed to approve  a plan under the same situation: a Democratic-controlled Legislature and a  Republican governor -- Reagan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Orange County Congressional Districts  </P> <P> Brea/ Fullerton/ Orange: 39  </P> <P> Westminster: 38 / 42  </P> <P> Tustin / Irvine/ Newport Beach/ Laguna Beach/: 40  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano/ San Clemente: 43  </P> <P> </P> <P> Orange County Senatorial Districts  </P> <P> Brea / Placentia: 31  </P> <P> Anaheim / Costa Mesa / Irvine: 35  </P> <P> Santa Ana: 32  </P> <P> Huntington Beach / Newport Beach / Laguna Beach / San Clemente / San Juan  Capistrano: 37  </P> <P> </P> <P> Orange County Assembly Districts  </P> <P> Fullerton: 64  </P> <P> Buena Park: 71  </P> <P> Yorba Linda / Orange: 67  </P> <P> Huntington Beach: 58  </P> <P> Irvine: 69  </P> <P> Newport Beach / Laguna Beach / Mission Viejo: 70  </P> <P> San Clemente: 75  </P></p>

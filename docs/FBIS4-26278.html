			<p>BFN     [Text] Wellington, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Chinese State  Councilor Li Tieying and the delegation led by him held talks  with New Zealand officials here today on economic reforms in  their respective countries.    Shortly after his arrival here this morning, Li called on  Wellington Mayor Fran Wilde, and the two sides exchanged views  on local government reforms.    Later, the Chinese delegation met officials from the New  Zealand Treasury and Reserve Bank. The hosts briefed the  Chinese guests on how New Zealand manages state finance,  collects taxes, runs state-owned enterprises and combats  inflation.    This evening, Li, also minister in charge of the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economic Systems, attended a  reception hosted by Secretary of Treasury Murray Horn.    In his speech at the reception, Li briefed the New Zealand  friends present on the occasion about the achievements China has  made since it started economic reforms 15 years ago.

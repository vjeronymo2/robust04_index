Information needed for that assessment, includes data relating to prior similar jobs, as applied to the specific variables of the current job. The information needed to conduct the assessment will be useful in planning the project, and in complying with any reporting requirements under this standard, when significant changes are being made to a control system listed in the standard, [see paragraph (k) of this section], as well as those of USEPA (40 CFR Part 61, subpart M). Thus, although the standard does not explicitly require the preparation of a written asbestos removal plan, the usual constituents of such a plan, i.e., a description of the enclosure, the equipment, and the procedures to be used throughout the project, must be determined before the enclosure can be erected. The following information should be included in the planning of the system: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A physical description of the work area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A description of the approximate amount of material to be removed; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A schedule for turning off and sealing existing ventilation systems; Personnel hygiene procedures; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A description of personal protective equipment and clothing to worn by employees; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A description of the local exhaust ventilation systems to be used and how they are to be tested; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A description of work practices to be observed by employees; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An air monitoring plan; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A description of the method to be used to transport waste material; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The location of the dump site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Materials and Equipment Necessary for Asbestos Removal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Although individual asbestos removal projects vary in terms of the equipment required to accomplish the removal of the materials, some equipment and materials are common to most asbestos removal operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plastic sheeting used to protect horizontal surfaces, seal HVAC openings or to seal vertical openings and ceilings should have a minimum thickness of 6 mils. Tape or other adhesive used to attach plastic sheeting should be of sufficient adhesive strength to support the weight of the material plus all stresses encountered during the entire duration of the project without becoming detached from the surface. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other equipment and materials which should be available at the beginning of each project are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _HEPA Filtered Vacuum is essential for cleaning the work area after the asbestos has been removed. It should have a long hose capable of reaching out-of-the-way places, such as areas above ceiling tiles, behind pipes, etc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Portable air ventilation systems installed to provide the negative air pressure and air removal from the enclosure must be equipped with a HEPA filter. The number and capacity of units required to ventilate an enclosure depend on the size of the area to be ventilated. The filters for these systems should be designed in such a manner that they can be replaced when the air flow volume is reduced by the build-up of dust in the filtration material. Pressure monitoring devices with alarms and strip chart recorders attached to each system to indicate the pressure differential and the loss due to dust buildup on the filter are recommended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

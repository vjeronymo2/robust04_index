			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Fatal accidents marred spring break festivities in Florida, where thousands of  vacationing students created peak crowds over the Easter weekend. In Daytona  Beach, a single-engine plane towing an advertising banner plunged into the  ocean just 150 feet offshore from the crowded beach, killing the pilot. In  Eatonville, two pedestrians were killed by a speeding car that fled the scene.  Earlier in the week, a 22-year-old Burbank, Ill., man, whom police said was not  a student, fell to his death from a Daytona Beach hotel balcony while trying to  catch a Frisbee.  </P></p>

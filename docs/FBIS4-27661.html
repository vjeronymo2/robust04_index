			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Manirat Chitsamakun] </F>   [Text] The Board of Investment (BoI) yesterday took a major  step to promote supporting industries in Thailand by announcing  benefits for an additional 10 industrial categories, mostly  small and medium-sized firms, in an attempt to attract at least  5,000 Japanese plants to Thailand.    Moreover, the board, chaired by Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai,  will also allow an additional 20 industries, including auto  parts, electronic products, plastic products and rubber  products, to be located in the Zone 2 investment area. The BoI,  however, has yet to rule whether to grant privileges to the  fertilizer and ceramic industries under the second  classification of the BoI promotional privileges.    The BoI's latest move is seen as a response to investors'  complaints over inadequate infrastructure in the remote  provinces under so-called Zone 3.    Although the government tried to promote investment by  offering a first-class incentive package for those who wish to  set up plants in those provinces some investors have been  reluctant to go there because the provinces are too far away.    At a press conference yesterday, Sathaphon Kawitanon, BoI  secretary-general, said the BoI board has agreed to grant an  eight-year corporate tax exemption to those who wish to set up  plants for engineering plastic parts, rechargeable batteries,  electronic connectors, machining centres, heat treatment,  surface treatment, sintered products, grinding tools, cutting  tools and toolings, regardless of where the industries are  located.    Yesterday's announcement has added to the list of industries  BoI approved on October 26 last year. Then, the BoI offered  maximum benefits to four industries -- moulds and dies, jigs and  fixtures, forging, casting and induction furnaces. Sathaphon  said that the incentive worked quite well as it helped increase  factories in the four industries from only one to 12.    Sathaphon said that this should help promote small-and  medium-scale industries, which are the foundation for economic  development. He said that it is coincidental that the yen has  appreciated, which is expected to prompt small and medium firms  in Japan to relocate their plants to low-cost countries.    BoI recently conducted a seminar in Japan and found that  there were about 1 million small and medium plants there. "If we  can get just 1-2 percent of the total or only 5,000 factories,  the opportunity among local industries to get transfer of  technology will be tremendous," he said.    The 20 industries which the BoI allowed to be set up in the  Zone 2 investment area are leather tannery, wheel tyre, rubber,  glass, carpet, leather products, footwear and parts, toys and  electronic games, box or packaging products, metal-made  containers, leather gloves, lenses or glasses, metal items,  metal string, auto parts, energy-saving light tubes, batteries,  electronic products, soft gelatine capsules and plastic or  plastic-coated products.</p>

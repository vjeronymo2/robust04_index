			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> O'CONNOR VOWS WAR ON VIOLENCE AND DRUGS  </P> <P> Declaring 1989 "The Year of the Child," Mayor Maureen O'Connor on Monday  offered San Diego youngsters a slate of recreational, educational and social  programs complemented by a pledge to dramatically strengthen the  law-enforcement effort against street gangs and drug pushers.  </P> <P> In her third State of the City address and the first of her new four-year term,  O'Connor spent little time on the traditional functions of the City  Charter-required annual address -- taking stock of past accomplishments or  announcing her second-term goals. Instead, she expressed concern over the fate  of the city's children and promised them "new status" in the city's priority  list.  </P> <P> "The city need not justify its alarm when our (children) can't find France on a  map, can't cross the street without meeting a pusher, can't reach the age of 16  without bearing a child, or 18 without witnessing a shooting," she said while  standing at the front of the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater in Balboa Park.  </P> <P> "It profits the city nothing to save our beaches and lose our children."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Czar for Children'  </P> <P> In the fight against "the ever-lengthening shadows of drugs and violence,"  O'Connor proposed the creation of a "metro strike team" of 40 police officers  to be assigned to the city's eastern and central divisions, and the  establishment of a police substation at 30th Street and Imperial Avenue in  Southeast San Diego.  </P> <P> She also called for the creation of a new "czar for children" within city  government to oversee coordination of child care, recreation and youth  activities.  </P> <P> In addition, she announced the establishment of a space, aviation, astronomy  and science center as the highlight of a host of new recreational and  educational programs to be started this year.  </P> <P> The center, to be created by the Fleet Space Theater and Science Center, the  International Aerospace Hall of Fame and the city, would be a "NASA-like space  camp where children can learn firsthand the trajectory for space capsules, the  orbit of the planets, and the intricacies of ground-control computers,"  O'Connor said. It would probably require a new facility somewhere in Balboa  Park, her aides said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Multimedia Event  </P> <P> O'Connor used the Fleet Theater's domed screen to make the 26th annual State of  the City address a multimedia event. Illuminated by a single spotlight in a  darkened house, she spoke against a projected backdrop of the city's nighttime  skyline as images of clouds drifted slowly over her head.  </P> <P> As she mentioned specific events of the year just past -- the visit of Mother  Teresa, the Super Bowl, the negotiations for her upcoming Soviet arts festival  -- images were flashed on the screen above and around her.  </P> <P> Although she offered no timetables or cost figures for the programs, O'Connor  said in an interview after her speech that she plans to ask the City Council to  act on the police program during the current fiscal year, which would require  dipping into the city's $450,000 contingency fund if new police officers are to  be hired.  </P> <P> City Manager John Lockwood, who attended the speech, said it would cost the  city $1 million for every 18 new officers it adds to the 2,500-member police  force. A new substation could cost $2 million, Lockwood said.  </P> <P> But, even if the council agreed to hire more officers before the new fiscal  year begins July 1, the 22-week Police Academy training would delay their  active duty at least until June, Lockwood said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shift Officers?  </P> <P> Lockwood suggested, however, that some police officers could be shifted to  high-crime and drug problem areas to begin O'Connor's program before the new  budget year.  </P> <P> O'Connor is the third city official to call for a stronger police force in  recent weeks. On Nov. 30, Lockwood unveiled a plan to add 440 officers to the  police force at a cost of $62 million. Three weeks later, Councilman Bob Filner  called for a $50-million tax increase to pay for having more police downtown.  </P> <P> Councilman Wes Pratt, who represents the Southeast San Diego neighborhoods  where gang warfare and drug sales are concentrated, praised O'Connor's  two-pronged approach to the problem.  </P> <P> "It deals with the gang and the drug problem from a law-enforcement perspective  and gives our young people some options," Pratt said after the speech. "Most  young people want some options, because they know you can't continue to engage  in that kind of activity."  </P> <P> Barbara Schutze, a member of the San Diego Substance Abuse Commitment  Committee, agreed. "If you're out dealing dope, you may be making $500 this  week," she said. "But where are you next week? You're down in Juvenile Hall."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diversion for Youth  </P> <P> Among the diversions O'Connor proposed to offer the city's youth:  </P> <P> * A combination children's workshop, museum and academy in Balboa Park's House  of Charm. Modeled after the Children's Museum in La Jolla, the facility would  give children a place to try out as newscasters, dancers, actors or computer  programmers.  </P> <P> * A "landmark children's play structure in a suitable park environment."  </P> <P> * A series of city-sponsored programs for children, dubbed "Kids Club San  Diego," which would offer children occasional free entry to the San Diego Zoo,  Sea World, museums and sporting events, plus apprenticeship programs with  business and government leaders.  </P> <P> O'Connor also promised to seek funds from a newly created federal program to  carry out "innovative support projects for low-income children and their  families" and called for the creation of "computerized telephonic" reporting  for police officers in the field to lessen the time they spend on paper work.  </P> <P> Although O'Connor touched only briefly on her 1988 accomplishments in the  speech, she distributed a 25-page annual report listing what she considers the  highlights of the past year.  </P> <P> In the report, O'Connor takes varying amounts of credit for dozens of actions,  including a 37% increase in federal funding to the city, the creation of a city  Commission for Arts and Culture, increased representation of women and  minorities on the city's boards and commissions, the planning of a new City  Hall complex and the placement of the council's unsuccessful growth-management  program on the November ballot.  </P> <P> In her speech, O'Connor said she had kept 14 of the 16 promises she made in her  1988 address and "helped five of my seven predictions" come true. She then  offered six more predictions for this year, including victory in her highly  publicized effort to thwart Southern California Edison's attempt to take over  San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.  </P> <P> The mayor took another swipe at the merger proposal when she honored Red Scott,  an SDG&amp;E director who voted against the takeover and then resigned, with  one of her annual Seahorse Awards. As Scott took the stage, the theater's domed  screen flashed the SCE logo -- circled in red with a red line slashing through  it.  </P> <P> The mayor also honored several individuals and groups with a "Seahorse Award,"  given each year to those who "best capture the real spirit of San Diego." The  honorees:  </P> <P> * Red Scott, who voted against the Southern California Edison takeover of San  Diego Gas &amp; Electric, then resigned from the SDG&amp;E board of directors  to underscore his protest.  </P> <P> * Willie Henderson and Richard Minor of Southcrest Little League, who spent 18  years working to establish a hot dog stand at Southcrest Ballpark. The stand  opened last month. The proceeds from the hot dog stand will be used to buy  equipment for Little League teams.  </P> <P> * Councilwoman Gloria McColl and the Olympic Site Task Force, who were  instrumental in the selection of San Diego County as the site of a new,  official U.S. Olympic training center.  </P> <P> * Glenn Allison of Episcopal Community Services and the volunteers of the  Interfaith Shelter Network, for providing food, clothing and shelter to the  homeless. The network of more than 100 churches and synagogues has become a  model for other cities.  </P> <P> * Ted Kissane and the San Diego County Hotel-Motel Assn., for accepting an  increase in hotel room taxes. An estimated $45 million in revenue from the  increased taxes will be used to renovate Balboa Park, and $33 million is slated  for underwriting the arts, including the Soviet arts festival in the fall.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'NEW' CLEVELAND QUARTET BOWS AT BING THEATER  </P> <P> For the decidedly with-it crowd that packed the Los Angeles County Museum of  Art's Bing Theater Wednesday evening, the Cleveland Quartet's playing rather  than their repertory was most likely the chief attraction.  </P> <P> This was, after all, the local debut of the revamped ensemble, a new first  violinist having recently signed on.  </P> <P> His name is William Preucil, the concertmaster of the Atlanta Symphony a few  seasons back. If the Cleveland wanted to radically change its aural and  interpretive image through his acquisition, it have do done so in the most  positive terms.  </P> <P> This has been a frustrating group during its 20-odd-year past, loaded with  talent but frequently raw in tone and interpretively unsettled, its fortunes  rising and falling on the erratic bow and high-strung temperament of its  brilliant founding first violinist, Donald Weilerstein, who left to pursue a  solo career.  </P> <P> Preucil is a cooler number, his tone smaller and sweeter than Weilerstein's,  his interpretive instincts better integrated with the lively but rational  attitudes of his colleagues, second violinist Peter Salaff and cellist Paul  Katz (both founders) and violist James Dunham, a hero of our local scene prior  to joining the Cleveland a few seasons back.  </P> <P> Monday's program opened with the Mozart D-minor Quartet, K. 421, a shakedown  cruise for two wobbly movements, settling down in the Minuet to establish the  evening's ultimately satisfying tone.  </P> <P> Subsequently, one could revel in the skewed lyricism of Berg's Opus 3 Quartet,  projected with stunning linear clarity and clear-eyed perception of its  heaving, sighing, singing heart. And, finally, Beethoven's First "Rasumovsky"  Quartet, played with irresistible warmth, rhythmic agility and impeccable  ensemble balance. HERBERT GLASS  </P></p>

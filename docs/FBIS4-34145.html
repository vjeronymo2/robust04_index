			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Jun (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido  Di Tella has stressed that the proposal to compensate the  Kelpers [preceding word in English] in an eventual change of  sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands is part of a negotiation  mechanism considered "normal" throughout the world.    "It is not a question of making a payment in order to throw  people out. I simply said that compensation could be given for  the transfer (of sovereignty). This is quite normal throughout  the world where this type of transfer has occurred. Although  there have not been many such transfers, there has always been  economic compensation," Di Tella said in a radio interview.    The foreign minister had stressed in an interview that he  granted to the British newspaper THE FINANCIAL TIMES that the  Argentine Government would be willing to "consider financial  compensation" for the Malvinas residents "in view of the  psychological distress that would affect them when they handed  over the sovereignty of the islands."    In view of the repercussions regarding these remarks, Di  Tella made it clear that the proposal to compensate the Kelpers  [preceding word in English] "is part of a much more complex  negotiation" between the involved parties.    "The consideration that must be taken into account first is  how to deal with the way of life of the islanders. If this does  not come first, "the issue of compensation will seem to be  offensive. The economic part, which also exists and which I  believe to be very important, would come after that," Di Tella  said when referring to the government's proposal.    Through the constitutional reform that is under way, the  2,000 Malvinas residents could obtain the legal status of a  "minority" and this would legally guarantee respect for their  language, religion, and customs.    This is established in a draft bill that the Foreign  Ministry  is studying and that the executive branch will presumably submit  to the Constituent Assembly, which is sitting in the city of  Santa Fe. The so-called Kelpers [preceding word in English]  would then be considered Argentine citizens, although with the  status of a "minority" with their own characteristics as is the  case with the indigenous peoples or the members of some foreign  communities.    The initiative is being developed by officials, politicians,  and technicians of the Foreign Ministry headed by Di Tella on  the basis of a proposal made by Justicialist Party Deputies  Carlos Branda and Florencio Acenolaza. Acenolaza is the  president of the Foreign Relations Committee.</p>

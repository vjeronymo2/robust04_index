			<p>BFN     [Text] Manama, March 20 (AFP) - UN experts charged with  eliminating President Saddam Husayn's chemical weapons program  left Bahrain Sunday for a one-week inspection mission to Iraq,  UN officials here said.    A five-member team led by American Gerald Brubaker was to  take air samples from the former chemical weapons complex at  al-Muthanna, west of the capital Baghdad, to search for the  possible presence of chemical agents.    Iraq's chemical weapons were assembled at the site and most  of them have since been destroyed.    A UN chemical weapons expert, Cees Wolterbreek of the  Netherlands, said in December that he was "99 percent" certain  that Iraq's chemical arsenal had been destroyed except for a few  weapons and munitions.    The head of the UN Special Commission on disarming Iraq,  Rolf  Ekeus of Sweden, said on February 1 that he was still not  completely satisfied with Iraq's answers about its chemical  program.    The chemical team will be the first to visit Iraq since the  UN Security Council decided Friday to continue sanctions against  Baghdad which were imposed after the August 1990 invasion of  Kuwait.    For the first time the council members could not agree on an  assessment of Iraq's compliance with disarmament resolutions  ending the 1991 Gulf war.    Russia, France, China and Brazil asked the council to  recognize Iraqi "progress" toward disarmament but the United  States and Britain rejected the request.</p>

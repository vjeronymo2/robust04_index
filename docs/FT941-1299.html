			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Takeover of a famous and independent family business The words 'British sherry' are anathema to the proud businesses of Jerez de la Frontera - the name of an inferior product they do not even recognise as wine. How poignant it is, then, that the most famous of all sherry names should become a British company through takeover by Allied-Lyons. Domecq is a resonant name in Spain, associated not only with wine and spirits but equally with bulls, jet-setting, conservatism and a many-tentacled family. Although many of the best-known sherry businesses have British - or in Domecq's case French - names, they have a strong tradition as independent Spanish family concerns. But in the last few years foreign multinationals have broken into this preserve, the absorption of the Pedro Domecq group being only the latest in the series. Grand Metropolitan, through International Distillers and Vintners, has the Croft sherry and port concern and an important stake in Gonzalez-Byass. Sandeman, also combining sherry and port, is controlled by Seagram, and the Williams and Humbert bodega in Jerez by Bols of the Netherlands. Allied-Lyons already has Harveys in its stable as well as its interest in Domecq. Independent companies such as Osborne, among the sherry houses, and the Larios spirits group are now the exception. Rapid change of this kind goes against the grain in the sherry establishment, but it is accepted with resignation as companies face the need to diversify. Domecq, with its core business as a brandy producer facing declining consumption, has already diversified with the acquisition of new spirits brands, which have helped it to boost profits. It also became a multinational in its own right, especially through its strong presence in Mexico. However, it faced another problem of its own - long-standing discord among different branches of the family over the company's future. Because of its many ramifications nobody appears to be able to determine exactly how much of the company is still owned by the Domecqs. Names are misleading. For instance, Mr Ramon Mora-Figeroa, chief executive, is a Domecq through his mother. Mr Mora-Figueroa was instrumental in establishing the first links with Allied-Lyons in the 1970s. In 1982 a bid was fought off from Rumasa, the holding company headed by Mr Jose Maria Ruiz Mateos, who had built an empire from a small-time sherry business which was later expropriated by the Spanish government. Lehman Brothers has been working towards a deal on behalf of shareholders, including members of the Domecq and Benjumea families, for more than a year. Last July the company sought an evaluation from Goldman Sachs, which then worked with Allied-Lyons' advisers, Barings, to formulate an agreement. Family pride has not been discarded, though. The Spanish company's board was insistent yesterday that the deal would leave intact 'the structure and personality, the style and tradition' that had been behind its success so far.</p>

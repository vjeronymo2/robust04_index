			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Laidlaw shifts focus to core Laidlaw, the Ontario-based waste services and passenger transport operator, is pursuing a new relationship with ADT, the security and vehicle auction group, and Attwoods, the UK-based waste services operator. The move is part of a strategy to focus on its core North American businesses. Laidlaw is the largest single shareholder in both companies, with 24 per cent of ADT and 35 per cent of Attwoods. However, Mr Jim Bullock, who took over as chief executive last October, said yesterday that there was 'no merit in Laidlaw being a minority shareholder in companies in which it has little or no input into the day-to-day management and operation'. Laidlaw has the option of disposing of its ADT stake in five years by tendering the shares to redeem a series of convertible debentures issued last month. Mr Bullock's remarks suggest that it will seek a buyer for the ADT stake before then. Laidlaw will no longer include its share of ADT earnings in its income statement. The Bermuda-based company contributed Dollars 5.7m, or 2 cents a share, to Laidlaw's earnings for the three months to November 30. Net first-quarter earnings slipped to USDollars 38m, or 14 cents a share, from Dollars 48.9m, or 18 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose by 6.5 per cent to Dollars 546.2m. The 22 per cent drop in earnings came despite a 6.5 per cent rise in revenues to Dollars 546.2m. The setback was blamed on a combination of problems in its hazardous waste business, lower income from equity investments and higher interest costs. Operating income from solid waste and passenger services was little changed. But hazardous waste income tumbled to Dollars 11.4m from Dollars 19.3m, and margins from this segment narrowed to 8.8 per cent from 16.1 per cent. The drop was due mainly to disruptions at the flagship Pinewood landfill site in South Carolina, and a decline in Canadian business. Pinewood is expected to return to prior levels of profitability later this year.</p>

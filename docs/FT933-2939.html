			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Steel subsidised at a high cost to UK Sir, It is not only in British Steel's direct interests that an EC industry restructuring plan is speedily achieved and state subsidies eliminated (Lex: 'Steely determination', September 13). It is also in the interests of British Steel's customers. As a UK steel user representative on the EC Consultative Committee, we believe it is clear that market distortions take place throughout Europe and beyond which make a mockery of a 'level playing field'. In my own industry, steel construction, we have lost well over 150 UK companies and 50,000 jobs in this recession and have to fight for every new construction project. Yet how do we compete with foreign steelwork fabricators who are able to buy subsidised steel from their state-owned steel companies (eg in Italy and Spain) in order to undercut UK companies for UK bridge contracts? We are now losing out to steelwork of uncertain quality from eastern Europe in a UK government building project] The new Inland Revenue Amenity Building in Nottingham is to use non-certified Polish steelwork for its complex roof structure - is this called 'biting the hand of the economy that feeds you'? Buying from such sources might save a few percentage points in first cost - but at what total cost to the UK economy and the consequences for direct and indirect employment?

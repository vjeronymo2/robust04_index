			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Arts: Putting a fresh twist on Beethoven - A controversial conductor who likes his players to take risks An unusual musical partnership takes to the stage in London and Birmingham over the next two weeks: Nikolaus Harnoncourt will conduct the Philharmonia Orchestra in two cycles of the Beethoven symphonies. Harnoncourt is the pope of historically-aware performing practice in continental Europe. The Philharmonia represents the modern symphony orchestra par excellence. Harnoncourt has been hailed as one of the most original and dynamic interpreters of classical repertoire, celebrated for his ability to make people hear familiar music with fresh ears. Well-known to record-buying cognoscenti in the UK, he has been a rare visitor to London. The Philharmonia concerts are his first encounter with a British orchestra - one which helped shape a previous generation's knowledge of Beethoven through its concerts and recordings with Otto Klemperer. Just how easily the Philharmonia will absorb Harnoncourt's ideas is the subject of much speculation in London's music establishment. Whatever happens, the results are unlikely to be dull. Harnoncourt's Beethoven is worlds away from the traditional approach. He favours shorter, more eventful phrasing, rationed vibrato, sharply-defined timpani and horns that rasp like their valveless antecedents. He is equally far from the opposite pole of 'authentic' gurus. He has never conducted Beethoven with a period-instrument ensemble, his dictum being that the player is more important than the instrument. He drives Beethoven's allegros with blinding intensity, but unlike Roger Norrington or John Eliot Gardiner, he introduces subtle inflexions of tempo. The result is a marriage between historical nicety and the need to project and re-invent the music for today. Harnoncourt, a Berlin-born Austrian, made his name as a specialist in baroque and early music, but now spends most of his time with conventional orchestras. Those who have worked with him speak of his instinctive feeling for the music, backed by extensive study of contemporary sources. Francis Hunter, who played oboe in Harnoncourt's Mozart cycle at the Zurich Opera House, refers to 'his ability to slot into the gut level of each piece and convey what is meaningful and expressive'. Harnoncourt spent 17 years as a cellist in the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, so he knows what it is like to sit listening to conductors. 'He has answers to why he wants things done in a certain way,' says Dane Roberts, a double-bass player in the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, with whom Harnoncourt has recorded the Beethoven symphonies. Harnoncourt, 64, is less forbidding in conversation than his platform manner would suggest. He speaks good English and is accompanied everywhere by his wife, Alice, an experienced violinist who acts as his agent. His biggest triumphs in recent years have been at the Salzburg Festival: cold-shouldered during the Karajan years, he has become a fixture of Gerard Mortier's programme, and will conduct Le nozze di Figaro next summer. His present repertoire ranges from Purcell's Fairy Queen to Bruckner's Third Symphony. He acknowledges numerous blind spots, including Gluck, Berlioz, Mahler and Strauss, but has late Verdi and Berg's Violin Concerto in his sights. Central to Harnoncourt's understanding of Beethoven is what he calls the musical rhetoric - word-like units of phrase which grew out of the connections between music and language in the baroque and early classical era. 'Composers a generation after Beethoven would laugh at the idea,' he says. 'Beethoven drew on the same musical vocabulary for 30 years of his life - words, figures, formed from a handful of notes - and used them in a rhetorical way. Is the musical speech a continuation of the previous phrase or a response to it? It's important that the players know, because his music tells you something - it's on the verge of programme music.' Harnoncourt dismisses the idea of musical authenticity. He says that even when orchestras play with period instruments, they are realising their idea of sound from a 20th-century perspective. 'Musical interpretation changes with every generation. Each laughs at its predecessor and believes it is closer to the will of the composer. I do all the repeats in Beethoven's symphonies, but 30 years ago it was not the done thing, and in another 30 it will be different again. It is like changing fashion.' One reason why the field of interpretation is so wide is that Beethoven did not always make his final intentions clear. Harnoncourt says the autograph scores are different to most composers of the period, 'because Beethoven did not correct them - he gave them to a copyist and corrected the copy. The parts were printed before the full score, so he corrected the parts. You cannot even say the last source is the will of Beethoven, because he changed a work like the Fourth Symphony for certain performances. You have to make a lot of judgments yourself.' At the same time, Harnoncourt is determined to root out modern accretions, such as the trumpet's 'note of victory' in the first movement of the Eroica. 'Orchestras today play a note which was not written by Beethoven. You could say the theme is not complete without it, that the trumpet players of Beethoven's time were not good enough, so let's add it. I think Beethoven included the failure, just as he asks the sopranos in the Missa Solemnis to sing a note that's too high for them. He wanted their faces to be blue and the voice to crack - this is part of the composition. A hero likes to show only his heroic side, but what Beethoven does is to show that after all, the hero is a failure.' He dismisses the argument that if Beethoven had had access to today's instruments, he would have adapted the parts accordingly. 'Then he would have written everything differently. The limitations of the instruments were a source of inspiration. We don't know what Beethoven would have done with the instruments of today - geniuses always do things differently to what we expect. I don't agree with the retouching that goes on. I don't change a note.' Harnoncourt also questions modern trends in orchestral sound, saying the American-led drive for technical perfection puts the emphasis on security at the expense of beauty. That is why he encourages brass players to experiment with the old valveless instruments. He describes beauty as 'something to do with unevenness - it's changing all the time, there is a bit of dirt in it, it's not pure. If you have a group of semi-quavers and you play them absolutely equal, it's sterile. 'For me, the most beautiful instrument lies at the edge of catastrophe. I prefer risk - I like a musician who makes a mistake because he risks too much.' The Harnoncourt/Philharmonia Beethoven cycle begins at London's Royal Festival Hall tonight and Birmingham's Symphony Hall next Thursday.</p>

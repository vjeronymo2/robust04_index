			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / IBM takes Dollars 8.9bn charge and cuts 60,000 more jobs INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the struggling US computer maker, is to slash a further 60,000 jobs worldwide by the end of 1994 - on top of 25,000 already cut this year - and sharply reduce its manufacturing capacity and office space. The group yesterday took an Dollars 8.9bn (Pounds 5.93bn) pre-tax charge in its second-quarter results to cover the upheaval. Yesterday's action, which included a 54 per cent cut in the quarterly dividend, is the first major restructuring by Mr Lou Gerstner, who joined IBM as chairman last April with a mandate for radical change. Underscoring the problems facing him, IBM also announced that it suffered a second quarter net loss before special charges of Dollars 40m, or 8 cents a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 734m, or Dollars 1.29 a share, in the same period of 1992. With the restructuring charge its net loss came to Dollars 8bn. The company said that when fully implemented, the restructuring would save it Dollars 4bn a year. The job cuts - roughly one fifth of IBM's workforce - and restructuring charges were considerably larger than Wall Street had expected, but the operating losses were smaller than most projections. IBM's shares rose Dollars 3 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange to Dollars 45 5/8 in late trading. Yesterday's cuts are the largest yet by IBM, which has been cutting staff for years as it struggles with computer market changes favouring smaller, nimbler rivals. Mr Gerstner, whose strategy to restore IBM's fortunes has been the subject of intense speculation, said his highest near-term priority was 'getting IBM's cost and expense structure in line with the revenue realities of our industry.' His second priority was to 'win the battle in the customer's premises.' This involved making IBM equipment easier to use and more able to link up with non-proprietary computer systems. He was also concerned to boost the morale of employees. However, he warned that yesterday's cuts were based on current estimates of future demand and further action could be necessary. IBM announced at the start of 1993 that it expected to cut its staff of around 300,000 by another 25,000 this year through voluntary and forced redundancies. Yesterday, it said that another 25,000 had now left or were committed to leave by the end of the year and that some Dollars 2bn of the special charge covered this rise in numbers. A further 35,000 jobs would be cut by the end of 1994, requiring some Dollars 4bn in charges. Mr Gerstner said the job cuts would be more heavily weighted towards IBM's operations outside the US. The remaining Dollars 2.9bn of charges will cover cuts in manufacturing capacity, office space and related expenses. Andrew Adonis writes: IBM shed about 2,000 UK employees this year under a voluntary separation programme which has now ended. Mr Peter Cruttenden, IBM's UK finance director, said he did not expect further job cuts in the UK. Lex, Page 18 IBM aims to save Dollars 4bn, Page 24 World stocks, page 38</p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Departure delays at airports cut sharply Departure delays at airports fell sharply last year for the second year running, in spite of a 3 per cent increase in air traffic movements, the Civil Aviation Authority reported yesterday. Over three years, average departure delays at the London airports have been reduced from 28 minutes to eight minutes, the authority said in its annual report for the year to the end of March. The percentage of flights that left more than 30 minutes late from six leading airports - Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham, Stansted and Luton - dropped from 19 per cent in 1990-91 to 10 per cent in 1993-94. The improved performance was attributed to the authority's investment in its National Air Traffic Services (Nats) arm, and in particular the introduction of the first stages of the Central Control Function at West Drayton, Nottinghamshire. The authority also said there had been 'lots of fine tuning' of systems, especially on routes to Europe. Mr Christopher Chataway, the authority's chairman, also announced that, for the first time, the authority had lowered its charges 'across a broad front' as a result of tight budgetary control and greater operational efficiency. In December National Air Traffic Services announced average reductions of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent in charges to airlines. The authority's Safety Regulation Group returned about Pounds 4m to its customers - equivalent to 8 per cent of its revenues - and announced a further small cut in its average tariff. The economic regulation group cut charges for airline operating licences by 15 per cent. Mr Chataway said the authority's board had given unanimous support to recent government proposals for privatising air traffic services as a contractor to the authority. He added: 'It is vital that Nats should be enabled to carry through its investment programme and this will clearly be very difficult so long as it remains in the public sector.' The authority's turnover for the year rose 3 per cent to Pounds 586.1m, but operating profit fell 7.9 per cent to Pounds 56.2m. Capital spending rose from Pounds 127.1m to a record Pounds 151.9m. Even so this was below budget, because projects were brought in at better-than-expected prices. The report reveals that Heathrow's all-time daily aircraft movement record was broken when air traffic controllers handled 1,239 arrivals and departures, nine more than the previous best. For the fourth year running, there were no fatal accidents involving UK-registered public transport aircraft with more than 40 seats. But there were two deaths in smaller public transport aircraft and 17 in general aviation.</p>

The authorities  detained and took away eight dissidents, including Wei Jingsheng  and Wang Dan, over two days.    The National People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese  People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] will open in Beijing  next week, while U.S. Secretary of State Christopher will also  begin a four-day visit to China next week; the crack down by  Beijing at this time has caused guessing on all sides.    The Chinese Foreign Ministry yesterday confirmed that  dissidents Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing, and Wang Jiaqi have  already been detained, and that Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng have  been taken away by public security personnel. Wang Dan was  later released, but Wei Jingsheng is still missing.    The human rights organization Asiawatch revealed that two  dissidents in Shanghai were also detained. Well-known  pro-democracy movement figure Xu Minli, like Wang Dan, was also  taken away for a "conversation." The authorities hope that he  will leave Beijing next week, and Xu Minli was later released.    Wang Dan was a student leader in the 1989 pro-democracy  movement. During a long-distance telephone interview yesterday  with our reporters after his release, he said that on the  previous evening he and three friends had wanted to go to  Zhengzhou; when the train was about to leave the station,  several plain-clothes public security personnel from the First  Department of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau took  him to a police substation by the train station. Wang Dan asked  them: "Why do you want to detain me?" A public security  personnel said: "You say less words!"    Wang Dan said that during the whole period of detention, the  public security personnel did not say anything other than a few  words to him. After 15 hours under detention, he found it  unbearable, and started a fast, consequently, he was released  early yesterday morning by the public security personnel after  24 hours of detention. He cited the public security personnel  as saying that "it was a misunderstanding, and it is not quite  convenient to tell you why there was misunderstanding."    Wang Dan said that the public security personnel who  detained  him told him to leave Beijing during the period when American  officials were visiting and during the NPC and CPPCC. Wang Dan  refused. He said: "If the authorities do not force me to  leave, I will not leave Beijing in March."    Wei Jingsheng, another well-known pro-democracy movement  figure, who just met visiting U.S. Undersecretary of State John  Shattuck on Sunday, was also taken away by public security  personnel yesterday morning.    According to his secretary, at about 1000 [0200 GMT]  yesterday morning, Wei Jingsheng was taken away by three public  security personnel from his younger brother's home; he called in  the afternoon and told her to cancel all his activities for the  following one or two days, but he did not say why he had been  arrested or when he would be released.    Wei Jingsheng, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for  his part in the 1978 Democracy Wall movement and who was  released on parole last September, urged the United States to  take a tough stance on China's human rights issue when he met  Shattuck on Sunday.    Reporters from this newspaper made a long-distance call to  Wei Jingsheng's family and asked them whether they knew about  his arrest, and they replied that they "did not know." They  also said that Wei stayed at his younger brother's home which  does not have a telephone; as for this younger brother's  address, they only said that "it is in Beijing" and "far away."  They also said that Wei Jingsheng usually "avoids going home as  much as possible," and that he stayed in the homes of friends or  relatives in turn. Wei returned home on the afternoon of 2  March to have lunch and called home on the evening of 3 March  just to say hello and talk about family matters, without saying  other things.    A Foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday confirmed that the  public security department had arrested Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan  Hongbing, and Wang Jiaqi, because they had "violated the  criminal law." The spokesman said that China's law enforcement  organs "base on facts, use the law as criterion, and handle  cases independently." But the spokesman said he did not know  that Wei Jingsheng had been taken away. Yuan Hongbing is a  history lecturer at Beijing University; he is well-known for his  courage in organizing activities opposing the authorities, and  his book, "The Trends of History," which was published last  year, caused controversy. Wang Jiaqi is a graduate law student  at Beijing University, and Zhou Guoqiang is a signatory of the  "peace charter," as well as the lawyer who represented Han  Dongfang, a trade union movement leader who is currently  stranded in Hong Kong. The authorities accused Zhou of  producing prints on T-shirts to arouse discontent and arrested  him for this reason.    Recently, the United States has kept exerting pressure on  China on the human rights issue. A number of officials have  visited China lately. Secretary of State Christopher is  scheduled for a four-day visit to China beginning next Friday.  One of his important duties during the trip is to assess  whether improvements in the area of human rights in China is  sufficient to enable him to suggest the extension of China's  most-favored-nation trading status.    Undersecretary of State Shattuck, who has just concluded a  five-day visit to China, yesterday dropped by Hong Kong on his  way home. He talked about the new round of crack downs on  dissidents in China and said he did not know whether such a move  would affect Christopher's visit to China next week.    U.S. Undersecretary of State Shattuck said: "Learning about  China's detention of dissidents, I am very disappointed. I once  again urge Beijing to release those who have been arrested  simply because they express their views peacefully."    Wang Dan, who was detained for 24 hours, analyzed that there  might be two reasons why the authorities had detained the  dissidents: First, Christopher will visit China next week, and  the authorities fear that U.S. officials will meet these people;  second, the NPC and the CPPCC will soon be held, and as overseas  reporters will rush in, dissidents are also a focus of media  attention. Wang Dan thought that the authorities' move to  detain dissidents in the past few days was very unwise as it  will only cause a tense atmosphere.    In November 1991, visiting U.S. Secretary of State Baker  wanted to see Dai Qing, a reporter with GUANGMING RIBAO, but Dai  Qing went missing before the meeting; afterwards, it was  confirmed that she had been "invited" to Beidaihe [a beach  resort in Hebei Province popular with the PRC leadership] to  "take a rest."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent Vladimir Maryukha, </F> under the rubric: "Timely Topic": "The People Guarding the Sea  and Coast"]    [Text] Today the naval knitted shirt that has faded to the  color of the sky is worn in the VDV [Airborne Troops] and in the  internal troops, in any subunit whose name contains the prefix  "spets" [special] and even in private guard-investigation  agencies. And at times the attention to this possessor of the  "naval spirit" is somewhat greater than to those whose knitted  shirts were later saturated with salt but did not lose their  natural color. The "winged" infantry, by way of illustration, is  always being heard from: Airborne troops "are mandatorily  dropped" for honored guests and journalists at demonstration  field training exercises and UN blue helmets are issued only in  "exchange" for blue berets, yes and simply at a difficult  moment, the first appeal is -- to the Airborne Troops.    While not detracting from the Airborne Troops'  accomplishments and only for the sake of fairness, I must point  out that the naval infantry surpasses the "winged" infantry,  both in age of service to the Fatherland and based upon the  intransigence of traditions and, finally, based upon the number  and variety of missions being carried out. The 289th year of  service with small breaks, from the time of Peter the Great's  Edict on the formation of the first naval infantry brigade --  that is a great deal of time! All the more so that in its  official history alone, the Russian naval infantry is seven  decades older than the famous American Marines. And we don't  intend to award only the age laurels.    A similar "imperceptibility" of the "black devils", as they  still quite recently called naval infantrymen, probably lies in  a different structure of subordination than the American  structure and in the variability of the names. After a number of  organic changes, the Naval Infantry became a part of the Navy's  Coastal Troops which are led by Lieutenant-General Ivan  Sidorovich Skuratov, incidentally, as far as I know the only  doctor of military sciences among servicemen of his rank.    "We don't need to make the country poor with the ideal  variant of Armed Forces organizational development," Ivan  Sidorovich thinks out loud on the problems of reforming the army  and navy and the troops entrusted to him. -- "We need the  optimal variant."    The Coastal Troops can also serve precisely as a model for  that optimal variant. The three components of the Coastal Troops  -- the coastal missile -artillery troops, the coastal defense  troops and the naval infantry -- naturally do not cover all of  Russia's sea coasts like a fence. However, due to  maneuverability and the capability to concentrate on a  threatened axis in a very short period of time, including  through reinforcements from another naval theater, the Coastal  Troops accomplish the missions of combating surface combatants  and assault landing detachments in the nearby maritime zone,  defending naval bases and other important facilities on the  coast, and landing amphibious and air assault forces. In the  latter case, the Russian Naval Infantry has a great deal of  experience from the period of the last war (3 amphibious assault  operations and more than 100 amphibious assault landings) and  the experience of prolonged performance of combat duty in remote  areas -- the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, and off the  Western coast of Africa. And a Black Sea Fleet reinforced naval  infantry battalion has acquired the experience of peacekeeping  forces operations -- in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict area. In  general, in the context of combat accomplishments, coastal  defense divisions and naval infantry brigades on the scale of  the Russian Federation Armed Forces are hardly unique. As, for  example, the Northern Fleet Red Banner Moskovsko-Chernigov  Guards Division, in which at one time were a battalion of  cavaliers of Soldiers' Glory and a company of Heroes.    Today, reforms are occurring in the Coastal Troops, just  like  in the other services and types of troops. Troops are being  reduced numerically, some portions of them are completing their  infrastructure in new locations after their withdrawal from the  near abroad -- Lithuania, Latvia, Georgia, and Turkmenistan. We  need to create a training facility all over again and, first of  all, for training the Coastal Troops officer corps.    The fact is that, with the current outward commonality of  specialties in the Coastal Troops, there is a multitude of  distinctions and nuances that, if they are not taken into  account, a BRAV [Coastal Missile-Artillery Troops] or MP [Naval  Infantry] officer can be a good missileer, tank officer, and  even an airborne troop but... he cannot in the process be a  representative of the Coastal Troops. They have taught this  specific feature or spark, if we can say it that way, at the  special departments of schools that have now turned out to be  outside Russia's borders (in Odessa, Sumy, and Sevastopol).    "Experience has shown," Lieutenant-General I. Skuratov told  me, "that even the best graduates of `ground forces' military  schools were lost for a minimum of two years as commanders and  specialists in our units due to the lack of knowledge of our  specific features, the navy and, finally, the terms that are  customary for us."    The American experience, to which we have become accustomed  to citing on any grounds in recent years, also convinces us of  that. There, across the ocean, they have long understood that  each person who has arrived to serve in the marines must have  first of all the spirit of a marine. This spirit is nurtured and  is sometimes "driven into" a young warrior with something  resembling our course. You were not broken, you did not succumb  to weakness at the first obstacle -- therefore you will be a  marine, is the advertisement of the advantages of service which  in the United States is no less aggressive than the advertising  for chewing gum or Camel cigarettes. And only later do they  train the "prepared" marine as a specialist, be he a  reconnaissance platoon commander or a regimental cook. The  Russian Naval Infantry and other Coastal Troops units were  always strong in a similar kind of elitism. This specific  feature is being lost when vacant positions are filled with  random people from disbanded units and that's too bad. It is due  to that loss of "elite" qualities in a Pacific Ocean Fleet Naval  Infantry division subunit that recently practically all of the  officers had to be replaced.    Last year, the problem of cadres for the Coastal Troops,  which extended to the statewide level, finally found its  solution. St. Petersburg Combined Arms and Kolomna Artillery  schools were added to the two schools that remained in Russia  that trained officers for the Coastal Missile-Artillery Troops  and Naval Infantry -- Blagoveshchensk Tank and Far East Combined  Arms Schools. This year, a coastal department will open at  Pacific Ocean Higher Naval School imeni S.O. Makarov, although  the first enrollment, only two classes for the time being, had  already been conducted in 1993. And what an enrollment! The  competition -- 7-8 people for each place! The batteries at  Kolomna Artillery School, where the first but unofficial  enrollment was carried out already in 1992, were recruited with  no less competition. Aren't these the prospects for the creation  of really elite units?    It's no accident that when, in the context of military  reform, the conversation turns to the creation of mobile forces  in Russia, the naval infantry and Coastal Missile-Artillery  Troops units were first among the candidates for their  foundation. The Coastal Troops will live up to the confidence  that has been placed in it if the question on mobile forces is  brought to its logical conclusion. But what we in the Coastal  Troops disagree with is the resubordination -- the "closing" of  individual units only to the command authorities of the mobile  forces. And here once again everything depends on the specific  nature of the Coastal Troops: The training system will change  with a change of the structure of subordination. Therefore, a  naval infantryman will become an ordinary motorized rifleman or  airborne troop after 2-3 years of service in the mobile forces,  maybe a high-class one but, not a naval infantryman. And they  essentially conceived the mobile troops to be made up of units  that are capable of accomplishing those specific missions which  the Coastal Troops, and only them, are capable of handling. To  drive a tank or a BMP [armored infantry vehicle], by way of  illustration, along rugged terrain is one thing. But it is  altogether something else to negotiate a strip of surf and to  seize a beachhead on a sea coast in that same vehicle.    They do not in the least oversimplify such missions in the  Coastal Troops. On the contrary, for example, they can be  deployed only in Kaliningard Oblast on the Baltic but a  threatened axis can emerge there where no Russian units are left  on the Baltic seashore. In this matter, "Bereg", the latest  self-propelled artillery system which KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has  already discussed under the "Arsenal" rubric, could become the  support for coastal missile-artillery units. But with the  economy's current disastrous situation, years could pass until  its acceptance into the inventory. That is why the Coastal  Troops commander-in-chief frequently reminds his subordinates of  late: There's no point in hoping and the center will give  everything in a saucer with a blue border. Old equipment will  also serve in the hands of masters of their profession. Hence  Ivan Sidorovich's ideas on the optimal, but not ideal, variant  of troop reform.    Yes, it is difficult for unit commanders to accomplish the  entire complex of missions facing them under conditions of the  shortage of personnel and the infrastructure at the new location  along with maintaining the prescribed combat readiness. But no  one else will do that for them. Therefore, people are not taught  to complain about everyday difficulties in the Coastal Troops  (maybe, that is why they write so little about them?). If they  say anything about them, it is in jest but they seriously talk  about the absence of a holiday. There is a tank crewmen's day.  There is also a border troops day -- but there is no naval  infantry day in Russia. Unofficially, the Coastal Troops  celebrate their professional holiday on 16 November. Peter the  Great issued his edict on the formation of the naval infantry on  that day in 1705.    According to the big picture, the Coastal Troops need not a  only holiday and the national recognition and respect which they  quite deservedly enjoyed. Publicity in the good sense of the  word is needed to attract people for active duty service on  contract. We need centers like those in the Airborne Troops to  train those same contract personnel, sergeants and warrant  officers. During the course of reform, we need to renew the  arsenal, especially of the Coastal Missile-Artillery Troops.    And we also need incentives in the service. In the Coastal  Troops, these words are understood to be not so much money and  certificates of award as... real work. This especially concerns  the naval infantry which previously regularly performed combat  service on ships at sea and currently can get dirty in  housekeeping duties. It is one thing to train for the sake of  training, it is quite another thing to breathe in a chest full  of salty sea air on an actual cruise, even if it is a  peacekeeping or humanitarian cruise. That's how it was at the  very beginning of the revival of the Navy's naval infantry  during the postwar period. For example, at that time, in 1976,  it was our naval infantry that was the first to come to the aid  of the starving population of the Island of Sokotra. And the  naval amphibious landing troops had quite a few similar  operations, right up to last year's landing under a smokescreen  at Poti.    And if there is a need -- the Coastal Troops will be the  first to meet a threat to the Fatherland. Incidentally, not only  with the current incomplete contingent but also with that  reserve that underwent training here, in the navy. And that  won't be a problem for the heroic large units -- if the  Fatherland just doesn't forget its defenders in peacetime.</p>

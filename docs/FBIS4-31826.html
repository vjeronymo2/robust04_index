			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ante Beljo, director of the Croatian Emigrant </F> Center and administrator of the Croatian Information Center: "We  Must Not Let Ourselves Be Drawn Into Any Third Yugoslavia"]    [Text] You are surely already well-informed through the  news media of the countries where you live about all the  pressures being exerted against Croatia.    These are the little poems about a Croatian-Muslim  federation  on 30 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory, and about a  confederation with Croatia (because more room is needed), and  then once again, because of higher interests, pressures will  begin for an alliance with the "Serbian Krajinas" (the occupied  areas on Croatia) and the so-called republic of Srpska (the  occupied areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina), and since all Serbs must  live in the same state, it will be necessary to create one  market (probably a customs-free one), so that in the end  everyone would end up in southern Slav "fraternity and unity."    Later on the same thing would also be offered to the  Slovenes, to whom such a solution, because of the reduced  Yugoslav market, could seem attractive. The same thing applies  to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM], because of the growing Greek pressures. Alija  Izetbegovic also would not reject having all Muslims live in the  same state.    We are calling upon all Croats in the world (the  state-creating ones, because there are a certain number of  Croats at home and abroad who have already been wholeheartedly  in the services of the pressures against Croatia for a long time  now) to do everything in their power in the countries where they  live to finally permit the Croatian people to decide for itself  on its own fate, without any pressures. That is the inalienable  right of every people according to all cultural and legal norms.    Why aren't greater pressures being brought against the  Serbian aggressor? Why isn't he being forced to return the  occupied territories? Why isn't it being made possible for  displaced persons and refugees to return to their homes under  international protection? Why aren't Croats allowed the  possibility of self-defense? Should the aggressor be granted  what he has seized?    Croatia wanted an alliance with Bosnia-Herzegovina, an  alliance with the Muslims (A. Izetbegovic). Neither Alija nor  the world wanted one. Today they are forcing us to share the  remnant of Bosnia-Herzegovina territory with the Muslims (the  expelled ones and the ones the Serbs have yet to expel). We are  being driven into the Lebanonization of this region.    During these three years the West has done everything  possible to bring Croatia to its knees (through the EC, the UN  Protection Forces, and in various other ways). Now we are being  forced, finally, to commit suicide. We cannot consent to that  regardless of the "higher interests of the world at large." Two  Yugoslavias really were too much for us.    We can talk about alliances, but we have to start with the  situation before the aggression.    Dear friends and compatriots, do not allow the governments  of  the countries where you live and where you are taxpayers and  voters to push Croatia and the Croatian people again into an  abyss from which they will never be able to escape.    With regards and thanks,    Ante Beljo, director of the Croatian Emigrant Center and  administrator of the Croatian Information Center</p>

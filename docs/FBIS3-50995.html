			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo -- The night before he was murdered,  Oswaldo Cruz Junior, president of the ABC [Sao Paulo's  industrial belt] Highways Driver Union, granted an interview to  the NEWSPAPER OF GREATER ABC in which he accuses Luis Inacio  Lula da Silva, the virtual PT [Workers Party] presidential  candidate, of heading a scheme to transfer union funds to the  party.    He told the newspaper: "Sometimes Lula personally asked us,  the labor leaders, to collect money from members."    Oswaldo Cruz Junior was murdered by Jose Benedito de Souza  on  6 January. Souza was a supporter of his uncle, union secretary  general Cicero Bezerra da Silva, who recently accused Cruz of  illegal enrichment. From the moment he returned to his post,  Cruz [who returned as part of a deal to leave his post to  Bezerra and run for president at the drivers federation]  reported the irregular transfer of union funds to the PT.  During the interview, Oswaldo Cruz Junior revealed that the  transfer of funds to the PT was systematic and that the  operation was carried out in three different ways. One way was  to label the transfer of funds as special union expenses.    "The drivers union spend 15 million cruzeiros in special  union expenses during 1993 alone," Oswaldo Cruz Junior said.    Cruz reported that the second way to transfer funds to the  PT  was to increase union contributions, authorized by ghost  assemblies.    "Sometimes we published edicts convening assemblies to  authorize discounts of up to 6 percent. The trick was that the  edicts were not distributed, no one came to the assembly, and  the discounts were approved," Cruz said.    Oswaldo Cruz Junior's interview in the NEWSPAPER OF GREATER  ABC states that the third mechanism for transferring union funds  to the PT was the manipulation of deposits held for social  security contributions and monthly contributions by companies,  which were directly sent to the unions as of 1988.    "If you were to audit the ABC Metallurgical Union you would  see that the union almost went bankrupt in 1989," Cruz stressed.    Oswaldo Cruz said that the union contracted Cotrigal  Graphics  of San Andres to print Lula's presidential campaign material in  1989, but the material was printed in the workers' newspaper  CHAPEU DE BICO which increased its number of issues from 10,000  to 300,000 in a single month.    "He will not be able to deny it after I show you what was  published," the union leader said in a challenging manner.    Cruz added that in February 1992 5 million cruzeiros was  transferred to the Santo Andre branch of the PT. The union  money was to have been used to purchase of the party  headquarters. Cruz said that the PT Municipal Building was to  be purchased by the drivers, the chemical, and the metallurgical  unions. During the interview Cruz said that he received several  calls from Deputy Arlindo Chinaglia, the PT state president,  proposing a deal to stop denouncing Lula's party.    Cruz said he had proof, adding that he had a meeting  scheduled with Senators Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive  Renewal Party-Para] and Esperidian Amim (PPR-SC) [PPR-Santa  Catarina] for 11 January to talk about the CPI [Congressional  Investigating Committee] on the CUT [Sole Workers Center].  During the interview with NEWSPAPER OF GREATER ABC, the labor  leader produced a box of video tapes which, he said, contained  proof of th? transfer of union funds to the PT.    Antonio Carlos Monico, former Santo Andre PT president,  yesterday denied allegations that ABC unions had ever  transferred money to the PT for the electoral campaign of party  candidates. Monico was named by union leader Oswaldo Cruz  Junior, who was murdered on 6 January, as a witness of the PT  use of union funds in electoral campaigns.</p>

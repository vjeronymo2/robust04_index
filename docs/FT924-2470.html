			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Canada withdrawing troops from Cyprus CANADA is to withdraw its peacekeeping force from Cyprus after 28 years because of commitments elsewhere and the lack of progress in Greek-Turkish negotiations, Reuter reports from Ottawa. Ms Mary Collins, junior defence minister, told parliament the Canadian contingent of 575 troops stationed in the critical Nicosia sector would start leaving next June. The withdrawal would be completed by September. British, Danish and Austrian troops would continue the United Nations mission. 'After 28 years of service in Cyprus, after 28 years of watching both sides in the dispute being either unable or unwilling to negotiate a political solution, after 28 years of significant expenditures to maintain troops without any measurable progress, it was time to face facts,' she said. Canada told the United Nations in September that its patience and resources were running short. 'Instead of taking advantage of the peace and order, some political leaders have used the presence of UN forces to avoid making difficult choices and compromises required to ensure peaceful co-existence,' she said.</p>

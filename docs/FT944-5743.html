			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / World Trade News: China venture will expand VW operations The Volkswagen group of Germany, the leading European carmaker, is expanding its operations in China with the development of its joint venture with First Automobile Works. Audi, the group's executive car division, is to take a direct stake in FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Company, the joint venture currently owned 60 per cent by FAW and 40 per cent by VW. A modernised version of the Audi 100 will enter production at the joint venture plant in Changchun, north-east China, in 1996 with an eventual capacity for 30,000 cars a year, the company said. The Audi stake was aimed at ensuring the long-term future for the brand in the Chinese market. VW said it would also begin making V6 engines at Changchun in 1996 with the aim of reaching a production capacity of 100,000 a year by 2001. The production capacity for Audi cars at the joint venture would be raised to 60,000 a year from 1999, when the company plans to introduce the successor to its current Audi A6, which has recently replaced the Audi 100 in Europe. The Audi 100 has been produced under licence by First Automobile Works since 1988, and is the car widely used by middle-ranking officials in China. This car will continue to be made by FAW itself, after the modernised version goes into production at the FAW/Volkswagen joint venture plant, and will be sold under the name 'Yellow Flag'. FAW previously made the 'Red Flag' limousine used by top Chinese officials. Local content for the FAW-produced Audi 100 has already been built up to around 60 per cent. Audi will continue to supply kit parts from Germany for assembly by FAW. The Volkswagen group, already the leading western carmaker in China, is engaged in an ambitious expansion in what promises to be one of the world's fastest growing car markets during the next two decades. In an effort to stay ahead of rivals, it is planning to install a production capacity in China which would rival in volume the scale of operations built by individual Japanese carmakers in North America during the last decade. It plans to have a capacity to build 660,000 cars a year as well as engines and gearboxes by 2000. The FAW/VW joint venture in Changchun will have a capacity for 360,000 cars and 500,000 engines a year, including 60,000 Audi cars and 100,000 V6 engines. The group's second joint venture, Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive, in which VW holds a 50 per cent stake and which currently builds the previous generation VW Santana, is planned to have a capacity for 300,000 cars and 330,000 engines a year. VW has added this year to its existing range (the Santana, Jetta and Audi 100) by starting assembly by FAW, at its plant at Chunde, of the Seat Cordoba small car from kits supplied by Seat, the group's Spanish subsidiary. The car is being sold in China as the VW City Golf, and VW plans to assemble around 10,000 in 1995. In the decade since it began its first low volume assembly in Shanghai, VW will have produced more than 500,000 cars in China by the end of 1994 including 453,000 cars built by the two joint venture companies and 71,000 Audis built under licence by FAW. It is seeking to increase co-operation between the two joint ventures, in particular in engine production, with the exchange of key components between the two plants. Camshafts and crankshafts are to be made by Shanghai Volkswagen, while the Changchun plant will produce connecting rods and crank cases. VW claims that around 100 components licensing and know-how agreements and 40 joint ventures have been established in China, since it began local production, and that another 30 joint ventures are now under negotiation.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRESNO;  </P> <P> CAUSE UNKNOWN IN STUDENTS' ILLNESS  </P> <P> Fresno County health officials said Friday they still don't know what caused  dozens of Fresno State University dorm students to become ill this week.  </P> <P> Although food poisoning has not been ruled out, officials said a team of  investigators was not able to find a food that was eaten by all the students  who became ill. Test results from the campus health center will be studied on  Monday in hopes of finding the cause, which some officials think was a virus.  Some of the 62 students became ill last Monday night and others as late as  Tuesday night. Campus officials said there were probably more who were ill but  did not report it.  </P></p>

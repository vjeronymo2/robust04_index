			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GIAMATTI CONSTANTLY ON VINCENT'S MIND;  </P> <P> ABOUT BAY AREA SERIES? 'SOMETHING ELOQUENT AND MEMORABLE'  </P> <P> Hardly an inning goes by during the World Series that Fay Vincent does not  think about Bart Giamatti.  </P> <P> Mostly, baseball's new commissioner thinks about what he misses about his good  friend.  </P> <P> He misses many things, but especially the eloquence and the humor.  </P> <P> For six months, Giamatti and Vincent made plans for baseball. Their plans  included attending Giamatti's first World Series as commissioner in October.  </P> <P> But Giamatti had a fatal heart attack on Sept. 1, and a couple weeks later  Vincent took his friend's place.  </P> <P> During the last 10 days, Vincent has spent a lot of time in the Bay Area  attending the playoffs and World Series.  </P> <P> At the Oakland Coliseum on Sunday before Game 2, Vincent was asked what  Giamatti would have thought about a Bay Area Series.  </P> <P> "Oh, I don't know," Vincent wondered aloud. "He would have said something  eloquent and memorable, I'm sure. It is beyond me."  </P> <P> Vincent, however, does have the ability to make people around him feel  comfortable despite still grieving for his friend.  </P> <P> "For me it's still hard to believe," he said. "It seems so unreal. I still feel  Bart is here."  </P> <P> Vincent's thoughts drifted and he looked to the outfield sky, then to the  commissioner's box where Giamatti would have presided and told his stories.  </P> <P> "His son threw out the first ball yesterday, and this World Series is being  dedicated to his memory," the commissioner said. "The tributes were nice."  </P> <P> Giamatti, a Renaissance scholar, also loved to write about baseball, and his  words painted a picture of feelings, rather than statistics.  </P> <P> When a visitor would call on Giamatti, he showed a shy excitement when bringing  out some articles he had written about the game. If you wanted, copies were  available.  </P> <P> "Before he died, Bart finished a book, and it will be coming out soon; you'll  enjoy it," Vincent said. "He asked me to read it, and I told him I particularly  liked the end of the third chapter. He asked what was wrong with the first  two."  </P> <P> But just as the game goes on, so does the job of the new commissioner.  </P> <P> In the months to come, Vincent will be faced with tough labor negotiations and  expansion.  </P> <P> "I don't think expansion is necessary, but it probably will happen," Vincent  said. "It's difficult to deny expansion. There is a terrific interest in  various areas of the country."  </P> <P> Vincent is a former CEO at Columbia pictures and a high-ranking executive with  Coca-Cola. Giamatti appointed him deputy commissioner because of Vincent's keen  business sense.  </P> <P> When it comes to the negotiations with the players' union, Vincent said he will  be "opportunistic" in helping the process.  </P> <P> But the few days of the World Series is a time for fun and, this year, a time  for reflection.  </P> <P> "I never had so many good invitations," Vincent joked. "I went to some World  Series games in 1986 when the Mets played Boston and in the early '60s when the  Yankees were in it. This is great. I think the World Series is a terrific  event.  </P> <P> "Bart and I had looked forward to being here together."  </P> <P> One would like to think they are.  </P></p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Allianz awaits order on Dresdner stake THE GERMAN federal cartel office is poised to order Allianz, Europe's largest insurance company, to reduce its stake in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank. The move, which is likely to be resisted by the Munich-based insurance group, follows an investigation by the Berlin-based authority last year. It emerged then that Allianz had taken its stake in Dresdner to more than 22 per cent while Dresdner had itself bought a 10 per cent stake in Allianz. With an investment portfolio worth an estimated DM400bn (Pounds 140bn), Allianz dominates the domestic insurance market and exercises considerable influence over German industry and finance through an extensive network of shareholdings. The cross-holding with Dresdner grew out of an agreement in 1989 to sell each other's products. Under German anti-trust rules, companies are obliged to report to the cartel office stakes in other companies only when they reach 25 per cent or more. At this level, the shareholder is deemed to exercise significant influence over management decisions and is in a position to block acquisitions and capital-raising exercises. In this case, however, the cartel office has concluded that Allianz exercises greater influence over the management of the bank through a network of shareholdings than is suggested by the 22 per cent it owns directly. A report at the weekend in Der Spiegel magazine said the authorities had decided that Allianz spoke for 47 per cent of the shares in the bank. This was at first confirmed by a cartel office spokesman, and then denied later in the afternoon. Allianz issued a statement yesterday afternoon saying that its direct stake stood at 22.3 per cent, and even if all its indirect holdings were taken into account, the stake still fell below the 25 per cent threshold. It said it had no direct shareholdings in three investment companies - Frankfurter Gesellschaft fur Finanzwerte (FGF), Vermo and Frankfurter Gesellschaft fur Chemiewerte (FGC) - which between them own 21 per cent of Dresdner Bank.

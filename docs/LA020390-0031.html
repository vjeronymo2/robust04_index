			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORDAINING OF HOMOSEXUALS  </P> <P> If someone tried to force a fundamentalist minister on a homosexual  congregation, Luedtke would scream to high heaven. Yet she feels she has the  right to try to force on other congregations ministers just as unwanted and  just as unsuitable to them.  </P> <P> If someone said homosexuals -- and others -- had no right to their own  interpretation of the Bible, she would also be just as outraged. Yet she  objects when Lutherans make their choice to accept the Bible just as written,  in regard to classifying homosexuality as a serious wrong, and therefore  sinful. Besides their freedom of choice, there is, in fact, strong reason for  accepting this teaching, since former homosexuals have stated that, based on  that outlook they have been able to change "through Christ" ("The Gospel and  the Gay," by K.O. Gangel).  </P> <P> Lutherans, then -- as well as other Christians -- have every right to their own  beliefs -- and, therefore, the right to refuse as leaders, those who do not  share their beliefs. This fundamental right to choice of leader is what both  Protestantism and democracy are all about. So-called "liberalism," it would  seem, can also attempt dictatorship.  </P> <P> N.E. DE LARA  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

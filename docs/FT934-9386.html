			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / OECD sees growth of 2.2% next year WEAKNESS in the Japanese economy will depress average growth among the world's leading industrialised economies to 2.2 per cent next year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast yesterday, David Buchan reports from Paris. After a two-day meeting of its economic policy committee, Mr Kumi Shigehara, OECD chief economist, said growth estimates of real gross domestic product were being revised downwards from 1.2 to 1.1 per cent for this year and from 2.7 to 2.2 per cent next year. While European members could expect an average 1.5 per cent next year, Japan's growth 'could be well below 1 per cent'. Ms Laura Tyson, head of President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said the US was on course in the second half of this year and in 1994 for a 3 per cent annual growth rate. The discussion on monetary policy had concluded that the macroeconomic benefit of interest rate cuts in the US, Canada, UK and Australia had been delayed or reduced because of 'build-up of debt positions in the business, household and banking sectors'. By contrast, many countries in continental Europe did not face such balance sheet adjustments. 'Here, monetary easing may have a more rapid effect on activity'. But several continental European countries had indicated that their concerns about currency and price stability prevented them cutting interest rates.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: WHEN WILL KINGS LAND BOBBY ORR?  </P> <P> Hockey in July. The guy has got us talking hockey in July. And just so the  general slapshot-happy public can keep everything straight -- although,  remember, this could change in the next 24 hours -- here are some of the few  remaining people Bruce McNall has not yet brought to the Los Angeles Kings, but  still might:  </P> <P>  -- The rest of the Edmonton Oilers.  </P> <P>  -- Bobby Orr, Bobby Hull or Bobby Clarke.  </P> <P>  -- The Howe family.  </P> <P>  -- Brian Boitano.  </P> <P>  -- That Russian goalie, Tretiak.  </P> <P>  -- Anybody born in Mexico.  </P> <P>  -- Either Esposito.  </P> <P>  -- Czech defectors.  </P> <P>  -- The 1980 Olympic team.  </P> <P>  -- Mario Lemieux.  </P> <P>  -- Pepe Lepieux.  </P> <P>  -- Any Detroit player not currently behind bars.  </P> <P>  -- Any Sutter brother, Stastny brother, Schmenge or McKenzie brother.  </P> <P>  -- Anybody nicknamed Boom Boom, Rocket, Toe, Punch, Tiger, the Cat, Moose or  Goose.  </P> <P>  -- Anybody named Guy who pronounces it Gee.  </P> <P> Otherwise, McNall has gotten around to just about everybody. His latest  acquisition: Larry Robinson, 17-year veteran of the Montreal Canadiens,  defenseman deluxe and another of Canada's national treasures.  </P> <P> A million-six? Sure thing. Sign here. How many years you want, Lar? Two? Three?  You got it.  </P> <P> Love that Bruce! You gotta love this guy, if you love good hockey players. He  wants 'em, he gets 'em. Oh, we assume that General Manager Rogie Vachon dials  the phone, but McNall is the man behind the scenes, the man with the checkbook  as thick as the Yellow Pages, the man who is going to bring a championship  hockey club to California if he has to sell every expensive black silk suit he  owns and go around the Forum wearing a barrel.  </P> <P> McNall is turning into Bob Barker. Wayne Gretzky, come on down! Larry Robinson,  come on down! Kelly Hrudey, come out West! Steve Kasper, Mike Krushelnyski,  John Tonelli, Ron Duguay, Marty McSorley, Chris Kontos, good guys, tough guys,  old guys, unwanted guys, come on out to Bruce's Holiday on Ice! The Kings said,  "California is the place you oughta be," so they loaded up the truck and they  moved to Beverly. Hills, that is. Swimming pools. Movie stars.  </P> <P> Larry Robinson will lend a hand to a defense sorely in need of one. L.A. has  enough offense to take a Stanley Cup, but not enough defense, except in goal.  Even if Robinson is not the player he used to be, he was good enough to work  long shifts for Montreal during the 1989 Stanley Cup finals, and in savvy alone  he's an asset. Glad to have him.  </P> <P> Canadians (and Canadiens) must be going nuts, though. The sight of Gretzky and  Robinson in Los Angeles uniforms . . . ugh. Picture Magic Johnson playing for  San Antonio. Or how about Chris Evert defecting to Czechoslovakia?  </P> <P> Don't you get the feeling, too, that McNall is just getting started? He's got  an offensive super-hero, a defensive wonder, a goalie, a new coach, new  uniforms, a guy with a "lucky butt" as a good-luck charm, Sylvester Stallone at  rinkside.. . . What more could anyone want? A 25,000-seat arena in the Valley?  A practice facility in Palm Springs with hot-and-cold running Molson's from the  faucets? His own TV super-station?  </P> <P> McNall has it all. He and Gretzky own a horse together, so it'll probably win  the Breeders' Cup or something. McNall could probably buy a donkey and win the  Preakness, the lucky butt.  </P> <P> We thought for a while that the Kings might sign Guy Lafleur, who has been  around so long he calls Larry Robinson Sonny. But Lafleur has signed with the  Quebec Nordiques, proving that there are some guys even Los Angeles can't buy.  </P> <P> Montreal center Bobby Smith believes Lafleur is putting too much of a load on  himself. "He's going to be in the spotlight now, and he's going to have the  type of pressure he wouldn't have faced in Los Angeles, let's say, where Wayne  Gretzky and Bernie Nicholls and Luc Robitaille are such great players."  </P> <P> We can't help wondering who else McNall might get his hands on before too long.  </P> <P> Maybe he will raid Edmonton again. If he can't get goalie Grant Fuhr, who is so  fed up with Oiler management that he announced his retirement at 26, we can  easily see McNall getting his hands on Jimmy Carson, who could play out the  rest of his contract at Edmonton, then sign with the Kings as a free agent.  </P> <P> It is no big National Hockey League secret that Carson would love to return to  Los Angeles. He still has a house here. It wasn't Carson's fault that he was  ordered to leave the country in the great Gretzky trade on Aug. 9, 1988. Carson  is an all-star who still might be as good as Gretzky someday, and has a dozen  years or more left to prove it.  </P> <P> Boy, this is fun, talking hockey.  </P> <P> Let's get this baseball business over with and get back to the good stuff.  </P></p>

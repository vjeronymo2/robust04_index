			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iv) the Institution will otherwise comply with this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) (i) Notify the PHS Awarding Component of the identification and management, reduction or elimination of any Significant Financial Interest, of the type described in Sec. 94.5(a) of this Part that did not exist or was not known at the time of the proposal, within sixty days of its becoming aware of that Interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) HHS may at any time request submission of, or review on site, all records pertinent to these certifications. To the extent permitted by law, the PHS will maintain all records of financial interests confidentially.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) An investigator may participate in a PHS-funded research project that is being simultaneously supported by an organization that has a commercial interest in the outcome of the project. However, the research support must be provided through the PHS awardee Institution. Any direct compensation or payment to the Investigator under that support is considered a financial interest under this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;94.5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Management of Significant Financial Interests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Institutions seeking PHS funding for research shall ensure that the following types of Significant Financial Interests attributable to an Investigator are managed, reduced, or eliminated, in accordance with paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) of this section, prior to award of the contract:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Any Significant Financial Interest of the Investigator that would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by the research funded by PHS, or proposed for funding; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Any Significant Financial Interest of the Investigator in an entity whose financial interest would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by the research funded by PHS, or proposed for funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In addition to the types of Significant Financial Interests described in this paragraph that must be managed, an Institution may require the management of other financial interests as the Institution deems appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The designated official(s) must review all financial disclosures, determine whether Significant Financial Interests could affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the research activities funded by PHS, or proposed for such funding, and determine what conditions or restrictions, if any, should be imposed by the institution to manage such interests. Examples of conditions or restrictions that might be imposed to manage actual or potential conflicts of interest include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Public disclosure of significant financial interests;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Monitoring of the research by independent reviewers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Modification of the research plan;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Disqualification from participation in all or a portion of the research funded by the PHS;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Divestiture of significant financial interests, or;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Severance of relationships that create actual or potential conflicts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;94.6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Remedies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each Institution that submits a research contract proposal must include in its policy for the identification and management of Significant Financial Interest procedures for enforcement action against employees who do not comply with the Institution's policy. If the failure of an employee to comply with the policy of the Institution has biased the design, conduct, or reporting of the PHS-funded research, the Institution must promptly notify the PHS Awarding Component of the corrective action taken. The PHS Awarding Component will consider the situation and, as necessary, take appropriate action or refer the matter to the Institution for further action, which may include directions to the Institution on how to maintain appropriate objectivity in the funded project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The HHS may inquire into the Institutional procedures and actions regarding financial interests in PHS-funded research, including the disposition of a particular financial interest. Such inquiry may be initiated based on information obtained by the HHS under this part, from a procurement-related document (proposal, progress report, publication of results) or any other source. Based on a specific inquiry, the HHS may decide that a particular Significant Financial Interest of the type described in section 4 &sect;94.4 is so sensitive that the issuance of a Stop Work Order by the Contracting Officer may be necessary until the matter is resolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In any case in which the Department determines that a PHS-funded project of clinical research whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment has been designed, conducted, or reported by an Investigator with a Significant Financial Interest that was not disclosed or managed as required by this part, the Institution must require disclosure of the financial interest in each public presentation of the results of the research.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15500 Filed 6&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4140&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

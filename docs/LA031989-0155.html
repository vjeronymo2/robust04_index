			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> METS WON'T BREAK UP 'MOOK-STRA' PLATOON  </P> <P> The trade rumors must seem like electric jolts to Lenny Dykstra. Unpredictable  in timing, unnerving in voltage and certainly never satisfying.  </P> <P> Lenny Dykstra, already a pretty hyper kid, cannot get used to those rumors.  They get to him every time, invariably leading him to believe the New York Mets  might set him free. Every time he rides to the top of that roller coaster, he  plummets, because the jolt sizzles for a while, then fades away.  </P> <P> Yet, because Dykstra is Dykstra, the letdowns do not dampen the excitement  whenever his name creeps into the headlines. Again and again, Dykstra, who  wants a trade, believes freedom is at hand.  </P> <P> Right now, the hopes are low because the best the Mets' top trader, Joe  McIlvaine, will say is that talks on all fronts are "dormant."  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> Dykstra is one-half of one of the game's most successful platoons --  "Mook-Stra." That center-field combination not only features, but stars, Mookie  Wilson and Dykstra. And the Mets just love the two-headed, four-legged,  fleet-footed creation. "Mook-Stra" sparks the team, no matter which center  fielder Davey Johnson pencils in.  </P> <P> Dykstra gives power from the left side, stirs hearts when running the bases,  ignites the team at the most appropriate times. Wilson? He does the same, only  from both sides of the plate. Liquid mercury on the bases, the veteran Wilson  is amazingly adept at catching fire just when it seems Dykstra might be wearing  down. Or wearing out Johnson's patience because of the little guy's  not-too-welcome penchant for trying to hit home runs. When Wilson wears down or  becomes a bit of a defensive liability or the Mets can afford to stack  left-handers in the lineup, Dykstra takes the stage.  </P> <P> It is definitely a case of a team putting its priorities first. The Mets look  at the two halves and see a whole player who, in the last three years, has  helped win two division titles, one pennant and one world championship. The  team figures, why mess with a good thing? So even though both halves of  "Mook-Stra" have had trade requests on the table since 1987, the pleas for  freedom have gotten the duo nowhere.  </P> <P> "Although both players don't like to admit it and won't admit it, they are a  good tandem and have complemented each other well," McIlvaine said. "Although  we have considered a lot of different possibilities involving both players in  trades with other ballclubs, we've never really come up with a solution that  would make us a better team."  </P> <P> "That's great -- for them," Dykstra said. "Not for us, though."  </P> <P> Wilson, who turned 33 last month, is almost resigned, and is even contemplating  life after the majors. When you get to that age, it is understandable if the  pastures of a newly purchased farm in South Carolina might compete with the  green grass of Shea.  </P> <P> But Dykstra is only 26. Unlike Wilson, he cannot point to seasons where he was  able to claim center field as his own. Knowing it will not happen this season,  unless something drastic and unexpected occurs, hurts.  </P> <P> This winter has been particularly tortuous because, at times, it seemed the  Mets' resolve was cracking. Dykstra's name actually was mentioned seriously as  one of the components in the now-ended talk with Atlanta involving Dale Murphy.  When the talks were hot, Atlanta Braves general manger Bobby Cox read the words  from Dykstra. "Someone asked him how it would feel to go from a winning team to  one that lost 100 games," Cox said. "He said, 'If I was there, they wouldn't  lose 100.' You've got to like that."  </P> <P> But the talks floundered. The Braves also wanted pitching prospect David West.  The New York Mets said no. So Dykstra stayed.  </P> <P> "It's frustrating," Dykstra said. "It's also a great compliment that teams want  me and say nice things about me. I wouldn't mind, though, if some of those  things come true. Because this is definitely not easy to accept."  </P> <P> So Dykstra returns to reality, to "Mook-Stra." All he can do is harness his  abundant nervous energy, pointing it in the direction of National League  pitchers and catchers whenever he can.  </P> <P> "I ask for a trade all the time, whenever I get a chance," he said. "I ask  reporters if anything's happening. Ain't nothing happening. That's the way it  is."  </P></p>

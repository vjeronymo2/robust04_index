Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RSPA published final rules under Docket Nos. HM&hyph;183/HM&hyph;183A establishing three new cargo tank specifications designated as DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 (June 12, 1989, 54 FR 24982; May 22, 1990, 55 FR 21035; September 7, 1990, 55 FR 37028; June 17, 1991, 56 FR 27872). The rules also made changes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the structural integrity calculations for the MC 331 and MC 338 cargo tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To allow manufacturers sufficient time to implement changes in their manufacturing operations, RSPA provided for the continued manufacture of cargo tanks to the MC 306, MC 307 and MC 312 specifications until August 31, 1993. However, as manufacturers began implementing the new requirements, certain technical issues were brought to RSPA's attention. To allow time for resolving these issues, RSPA extended the date that cargo tanks may no longer be constructed to the MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, MC 331 and MC 338 specifications from August 31, 1993 to April 21, 1994 (March 8, 1993, 58 FR 12904).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 3, 1993, RSPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to amend certain requirements for the manufacture, qualification and maintenance of cargo tank motor vehicles (March 3, 1993, 58 FR 12316). The NPRM was in response to petitions for rulemaking received after publication of the final rules. The NPRM addressed certain technical requirements for the construction of the DOT&hyph;400 series specifications and the structural integrity calculations in the MC 331 and MC 338 specifications. The comment period for the NPRM closed on June 15, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A public meeting to address issues raised in the NPRM was held in Chicago on March 24 and 25, 1993. At the meeting, several significantly different views of design engineers and cargo tank manufacturers were identified. Additionally, preliminary results were presented at the public meeting of an advanced structural evaluation (using finite element analysis) of the MC 331 cargo tank which raised questions in regard to stress levels in areas of concentrated loadings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the NPRM and to issues raised at the public meeting, commenters requested that RSPA provide a one-year continuation for construction of cargo tanks to the MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, MC 331 and MC 338 specifications. The commenters stated that they need time to finalize their engineering designs, develop written specifications, order raw materials, and establish new training requirements. Because of the complexity and impact of issues that will be addressed in the final rule and new concerns raised by the commenters, RSPA is extending the compliance date to August 31, 1995. However, because industry did not request an extension of the provisions specified in &sect;178.337&hyph;6, pertaining to inspection opening or manhole requirements for certain smaller cargo tanks, RSPA is not extending the April 21, 1994 compliance date specified in that section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA is issuing this extension of the compliance date because we view this as a noncontroversial amendment and do not anticipate any adverse comments. This final rule will be effective March 14, 1994, unless by February 11, 1994, RSPA receives comments that illustrate that extension of the compliance date is not in the public interest. Upon receipt of such comments, RSPA will withdraw this final rule before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw this final rule and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal to extend the compliance date and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, RSPA will publish a document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  confirming that this final rule will be effective on March 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

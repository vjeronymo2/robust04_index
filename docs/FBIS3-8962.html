Vlk met with Zhirinovskiy in Warsaw  over the weekend and said he found the Russian leader's views  very reasonable.    The Republican Party, led by Chairman Miroslav Sladek,  invited Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic earlier this year,  just two days after Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus, following  Zhirinovskiy's much publicized and controversial tour of several  European countries, said he hoped the Russian would not come.    During the tour, Zhirinovskiy said the Czech Republic would  lose Moravia and all that would be left was Prague and "a few  breweries where the beer will turn bitter." In an interview for  Czech Television, he predicted that in ten years young Czechs  would be vilifying President Vaclav Havel and cleaning the boots  of German army officers.    Vlk, Sladek, and Zhirinovskiy met in Warsaw to attend a  congress of the Polish National Front, a small party with  similar extremist views. Speaking at the congress, Vlk called  for the creation of an international association of nationalist,  conservative rightist parties. The Republicans also accepted an  invitation to attend the Liberal Democrats' April 2-3 congress  in Moscow.    Zhirinovskiy told the Polish party congress that Russia had  no territorial claims and its armies would never head west, but  at the same time he would not allow any Western armies to use  Poland as a path to attack Russia. If he becomes president, he  added, he would protect Russian interests by any means  necessary, "including nuclear weapons."</p>

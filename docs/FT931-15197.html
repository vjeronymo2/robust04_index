			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pessimism over recovery outlook ECONOMIC recovery in Britain will be constrained by rising current-account and fiscal deficits and by fragile consumer confidence, according to a report by the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, published yesterday. The report calls on the Bank of England to publish its advice to the Treasury on monetary policy to reduce confusion in financial markets about how policy is determined. Giving a bleak view of the UK's medium-term prospects, the Tory-dominated committee of backbench MPs says the scope for cuts in interest rates may be limited by the need to 'avoid any further substantial depreciation of sterling' to add to that which has already happened since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism last September. The committee hints that substantial measures for growth may be needed in the March Budget to produce a substantial upturn, but does not rule out the need for tax rises to hold back the increase in the public-sector borrowing requirement (PSBR). According to the MPs, Britain faces 'an abyss of ever-increasing fiscal deficits' over the next few years, assuming that growth remains fairly weak. The latest City estimates put the likely PSBR in 1993-94 at about Pounds 50bn, after about Pounds 40bn this financial year. The committee wants Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to announce in the Budget a strategy to bring down the deficit over the next few years, possibly with a programme of gradually increased taxes and cuts in public spending. On the outlook for growth, the committee says: 'It is not clear whether the limited policy measures announced during the Autumn Statement (published by the Treasury in November) and reductions in interest rates will be sufficient to counter the effects of rising unemployment and falling asset prices on confidence.' The MPs say a current-account deficit amounting to about 2 per cent of gross domestic product in a recession suggests a 'structural' trouble arising out of undue reliance on imports. They warn: 'The UK may find itself suffering from an old-fashioned balance-of-payments constraint with further downward pressure on sterling requiring tighter policies which will in turn squeeze the personal sector's disposable income.' The MPs suggest the policy vacuum since Britain left the ERM - since when the government has cut base rates by 3 percentage points to 7 per cent - has left Mr Lamont with a 'pick and mix' approach to economic policy. According to the committee, government statements since September on growth strategies have 'led to some confusion as to what is now the main objective of macroeconomic policy'. It calls on Mr Lamont to reduce the confusion in the Budget by saying exactly what economic indicators he is using to steer policy. The report says a repeat of the fiasco surrounding the ERM last summer, when Germany's desire to seek a general realignment of the system was not passed on to Britain, might be avoided by better communications between member states over realignment requests.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Stanislav Kochemasov by </F> Aleksandr Dolinin under "Topical Theme" rubric; place and date  not given: "The World Is Changing, But the Need for Alert Duty  Remains"]    [Text] Articles have been appearing in the press of late  expressing concern over the status of Russia's Strategic Nuclear  Forces [SNF]. Some publications are bluntly trying to convince  the reader that ICBM's are unnecessary. Our correspondent  turned for clarification to Colonel General Stanislav  Kochemasov, chief of the Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff.    [Dolinin] Stanislav Grigoryevich, what is meant by Russia's  Strategic Nuclear Forces today?    [Kochemasov] The term signifies first and foremost the  Strategic Missile Forces, the basis of Russia's nuclear might,  strategic ballistic missile submarine task forces, and strategic  aviation. We have always been in favor of preserving this triad  -- only the balanced development of all its components can  provide the guarantee of high combat effectiveness and the  capability to execute designated tasks. You know, each  component of the SNF has its own advantages and the qualities  attributable to it alone. But given the financial and manpower  constraints, it will evidently be necessary to grant priority to  the development of weaponry and troops alike, and to integrate  offensive and support systems. There was a discussion of these  questions in the General Staff in April.    [Dolinin] How do you envisage integration?    [Kochemasov] In order to centralize SNF command and control  and to determine responsibilty, it would be expedient to set up  an operations command authority [operativnoye komandovaniye].  Administrative leadership, however, would remain with the  commanders in chief of the various branches of the Armed Forces.  The preconditions for this already exist, as does the  possibility of creating a unified system of military command and  control. But you have to look before you leap....    [Dolinin] What is the place of the Missile Forces in the  structure of Russia's SNF?    [Kochemasov] The Strategic Missile Forces remain their basic  component -- both in terms of quantity of warheads and in terms  of a number of other characteristics. This is the objective  situation now, and it will persist in fact until 2003-2005 --  something which is determined not by someone's wish but by the  building and development of the SNF in previous years.    [Dolinin] It seems that in the future, too, the Strategic  Missile Forces will remain the basis of the SNF. But already,  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA readers are getting the impression that the  troops are all but completely disarming. Which nuclear missile  weapons will Russia still have in the years to come? Is it not  the case that we have been bled dry by the well-known  Russian-American treaties?    [Kochemasov] Several hundred launchers have been withdrawn  from the effective strength of the Strategic Missile Forces.  Basically, these are missile complexes [kompleksy] which have  been in service for twice the warrantied service life. Not a  single launcher has been removed from alert duty if its  warrantied service life has not been exhausted. We have kept  intact the grouping [gruppirovka] of modern missiles. We are  continuing with the planned commissioning, albeit in a lesser  quantity, of the Topol mobile missile complexes, which your  newspaper has already written about. In order to preserve the  armament and hardware of the two combined units from Belorussia  [Belarus] we plan to redeploy them to Russia intact. We are  including an RS 12M complex in the grouping. This complex will  be the first created exclusively by the cooperation of Russian  design bureau and plants. Preparations for testing it are  progressing as planned. An experimental and test base has been  set up at the Mirnyy test site. The first missile for testing  systems and power units [sistemy i agregaty] was delivered to  the test site at the end of 1993. In accordance with an edict  by the president, the Missile Forces and industrial  organizations have set about testing the complex.    The system of military command and control is being  improved and modernized. All this is being done so that combat  potential is maintained at a level guaranteeing deterrence of  any aggressor.    [Dolinin] Are the cutbacks affecting the combat readiness of  troops? With the elimination of old complexes and the transfer  to new ones the need for officers does not lessen but, on the  contrary, increases....    [Kochemasov] First, within the framework of the impending  modernization of the grouping we plan to retain the existing  position areas and their attendant infrastructure,  accommodations, and social and cultural facilities, in order to  ensure normal living conditions. Second, upon withdrawing  missile complexes from the effective strength we are leaving  some of the officer personnel in the newly formed units [chasti]  or else relocating them to other combined units [soyedineniya].  The main problems concern a lack of accommodations, although we  have steadfastly fulfilled the plan for housing construction  over the past three or four years.    Cutbacks may affect combat readiness to some extent if  measures are not taken. But the main thing is that we preserve  a system of centralized military command and control. This  allows us to maintain the attained level of combat readiness.    [Dolinin] The program for developing the weaponry of  Russia's SNF through the year 2005 stipulates that the basis of  the Missile Forces will be the Topol single-warhead  solid-propellant missile for the mobile off-road complex, and  the Topol M for silo basing. How far does the missile meet this  purpose, and how reliable is it? How are preparations for  testing the Topol M progressing?    [Kochemasov] The future lies with single-warhead missiles.  MIRVed missiles will be withdrawn from effective strength as  their operational life expires, as envisaged by the START II  Treaty on condition of its ratification. Moreover, 105 MIRVed  RS-18 (SS-19) missiles will be reequipped with single-warhead  nose sections and retained until their operational life expires.  And 90 launch silos for the RS-20 (SS-18) heavy missiles will  be converted to accommodate the Topol M fixed-site version.    The composition of the SNF and the number of delivery  vehicles must be brought to a level which guarantees the  solution of the task of strategic deterrence, and it must be  commensurate with the actual military threat. For the Strategic  Missile Forces, this level has been set at between 900 and 1,000  missile launchers by the year 2003. START II allows for their  number to be increased to between 1,000 and 1,200 missile  launchers.    [Dolinin] Stanislav Grigoryevich, the continued development  of missile technology is impossible without a solid testing  base. In this connection, what is the fate of the Kapyar test  site, and what are its functions today? Is the proposed  reassigning of the rocket test site at Plesetsk (Mirnyy) to the  military-space units an appropriate move?    [Kochemasov] Extensive and comprehensive ground-based test  site trials cut the cost of the development [sozdaniye] of any  complex, inasmuch as they drastically reduce the number of  missiles required for actual launches. When the capacity of a  test site is based on the number of missile launches, this has  to be seen not as an advantage but as a serious shortcoming in  the methodology of ground-based testing.    At the Kapustin Yar test site, individual elements of a  complexes are tested by firing over short distances using  inexpensive series-produced carriers [seriyno otrabotannyye i  deshevyye nositeli]. The main tests of systems and power units,  the complex as a whole and the missiles, incorporating launches,  are carried out at the Mirnyy test site. The methodology for  developing a complex is such that up to 70 percent of the tests  are conducted on the ground.    The question of reassigning the test site is raised from  time  to time by the command of the Military-Space Forces. It would  be an appropriate move if the existing structure and system of  subordination disrupted or seriously hindered the execution of  tasks in the new conditions. But it does neither. The problem  has been studied in depth, and the president of Russia has been  made aware of the situation. It was deemed advisable to  preserve the existing system of subordination. The test site's  30-year history, and the last few years in particular, confirm  the possibility of resolving all tasks in precisely this  organizational-regulation structure [organizatsionno-shtatnaya  struktura].    [Dolinin] In May this year, missile launchers will no longer  have any targets. There will take place the so-called zero  targeting agreed with the Americans. Their missiles will be  targeted on desert regions of the earth insofar as the system of  military command and control of American ICBM's is somewhat  different. What will this mean in practice?    [Kochemasov] In line with the accords reached and a  directive from the Russian president, by 31 May the missiles  will be on alert duty with "zero" mission assignments. Put  simply, they will not have specific targets.    The practical implementation of the nontargeting regime  depends on the design characteristics of the missile complexes,  and this will be determined specifically by us and by the  American side for each type of missile. The common element for  all, however, is the clear lowering of the sudden-strike  threshold, inasmuch as a number of operational and technical  measures will have to be conducted in order to reestablish each  side's combat plans. This will take time, which the politicians  can made additional use of to find a peaceful solution to  problems if they emerge.    However the circumstances take shape, the Strategic Missile  Forces will perform their alert duty. Around 20,000 missilemen  are at their combat posts around the clock. As they have been  for virtually the past 35 years. The world is changing, but the  need for alert duty has not disappeared.</p>

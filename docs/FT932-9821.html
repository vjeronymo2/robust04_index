			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Twin track to Bosnia peace: Air attacks and military aid are complementary, not alternatives Many readers are suffering from Bosnia fatigue. 'I know it's terrible,' they say, 'but things are just as bad in Armenia, Abkhazia, Tajikistan and a lot worse in Sudan. Why do you go on about it?' I go on about it not primarily for moral reasons but because I believe the security of Europe is threatened by the failure of European states to act on the principles they proclaim. Czechs and Slovaks, Russians and Ukrainians have shown that a federal state can be dissolved without bloodshed. But the chances of it happening in Yugoslavia were never good. Too many Serbs had drawn, from a selective reading of history, the conclusion that they would never be safe unless they all lived in one state. They were ready from the start to fight rather than accept the secession of Croatia or Bosnia-Hercegovina. Recognition of those states was therefore a cruel deception, unless the recognisers were able and willing to deter the Serbs from reacting with violence. But it is no use crying over spilt milk. The question is what to do now. So far the Serbs have succeeded, by being better armed and more ruthless than their opponents, in seizing control of most of the territory where Serbs lived - even where they were a minority - and 'cleansing' it of other ethnic groups. This has created an unmanageable refugee problem, reminiscent in too many ways of the Palestinian one, and has set an appalling precedent for ethnic or national leaders elsewhere in central and eastern Europe. It must not be allowed to stand. The Vance-Owen plan accepts the Serb logic, since it divides Bosnia-Hercegovina into provinces all but one of which would be dominated by one ethnic group. But it attempts to apply that logic more fairly than the Serbs themselves have done. The Bosnian Serbs do not like the plan because the provinces it assigns to them would not all be contiguous, either with each other or with Serbia proper; and because it requires them to withdraw from territory they now control, leaving some of their homes under 'alien' domination. In those areas, they naturally fear, it would be their turn to be 'ethnically cleansed'. The Bosnian Croats like the plan because it puts almost all their homes under their own political control. They have already set about making sure of that by doing some 'ethnic cleansing' of their own. The Moslems do not like the plan at all. It leaves them, the largest group, with the smallest area. The plan would give them back some of the territory they have lost, but would still leave many of their homes outside their political control. Their chances of returning to those homes would be slim. Still, the Moslems have accepted the plan because it is their only chance of getting international support. They too have been driven to accept the Serb logic, and start 'cleansing' some of the areas they control. Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, has suddenly emerged as a 'goody' because he wants the Bosnian Serbs to accept the plan, as he wanted the Croatian Serbs to accept the Vance plan in January 1992. He does not expect either plan to be implemented, but hopes that a ceasefire now would get the international community off his back, while enabling the Bosnian Serbs to consolidate their gains (as the Croatian Serbs have done). Having got so far, the 'international community' (meaning the west egged on by Moslem and other non-aligned states, dragging Russia nervously in its wake) should take Mr Milosevic at his word. He says he is cutting off all but humanitarian aid to the Bosnian Serbs. The United Nations should respond by placing monitors all along the Yugoslav-Bosnian border and keeping them there until the Bosnian Serbs have not only signed the Vance-Owen plan but implemented it. Failing that, the military option is the only one. It need not imply putting more external troops on the ground. It may even require withdrawing those troops that are now there, since it certainly requires dropping any idea that they are neutral. The military option means giving Bosnia the means to defend itself: a fundamental right of any state, consecrated by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. While the weapons are being flown in, Nato air power should be used to prevent the Serbs from launching an all-out assault. At last, it seems, those two actions - arming the Bosnian government forces, and air attacks on their opponents - are seen in Washington, if not yet in European capitals, as complementing each other, not as alternatives. That is vital, because neither by itself is likely to achieve what must be the objective: the defeat of those, whether Serb or Croat, who seek the partition of Bosnia. If the Bosnian Serbs could be convinced that this strategy was really about to be put into force, they might well promptly accept the Vance-Owen plan as (from their point of view) the lesser evil. They should be given a last chance to do so. But once the military strategy went into action the plan should be dropped. Abraham Lincoln did not challenge slavery south of the Mason-Dixon line so long as there was a hope of avoiding secession. But once Americans were fighting and dying to keep the country together, he proclaimed emancipation of the slaves throughout the union. Similarly, the Vance-Owen plan can be defended as an alternative to war, but not as a war aim. If the war is to go on, the only acceptable outcome is one allowing all Bosnian citizens to return home freely and in safety.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Tokyo Uncertainty over the yen's strength is expected to weigh on prices this week, in spite of signs of economic recovery, writes Emiko Terazono. With the market finding buyers around 20,000-20,500 levels on the Nikkei index, and potential sellers around 21,000, prices fluctuated in a narrow range last week. However, analysts point out that the yen's strength has yet to be factored into share prices. Although last week's Bank of Japan quarterly economic outlook was optimistic and many of the economic figures to be released this week are expected to indicate a pick up in activity, there is still a risk to growth from currency movements. Barclays de Zoete Wedd reckons a 5 per cent currency appreciation cuts GDP growth by 50 basis points. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

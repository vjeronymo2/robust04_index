			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Croats reject UN mandate: US Secretary of State Christopher hesitant over lifting sanctions on Serbia The Croatian parliament yesterday voted against renewing the mandate of the UN peacekeepers in Croatia unless the UN forces are given some muscle to return Serb-held lands to government control. Separatist Serbs have exploited a stalemate wrought by a UN-policed ceasefire to cement the breakaway Republic of Serb Krajina, spanning a third of Croatia's territory, which was seized in a 1991 uprising against secession from Yugoslavia. UN troops in Croatia have failed to fulfil their mission to repatriate refugees to the Serb-held Krajina, disarm its rebels and restore Croatian sovereignty because they are prohibited from using military force. Meanwhile the US administration, which is due to receive a visit from Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic today, is backing away from easing sanctions against Serbia, in a move that could threaten the unity of the five nations which are working for a peace settlement in Bosnia. US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the US did not think the United Nations Security Council should vote late yesterday on easing economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. 'We think it probably should not be voted on today,' he said. But at the United Nations, diplomats from countries belonging to the contact group on Yugoslavia said US Ambassador Madeleine Albright had agreed for the vote to go ahead last night as scheduled. The draft resolution will lift, for a trial period of 100 days the UN bans on direct flights to Belgrade and on sporting and cultural exchanges. Diplomats said the US administration remained vulnerable to the pro-Bosnian lobby in Congress, despite the tightening of military pressure against Bosnian Serbs that was signalled by Thursday's Nato air strike in the Sarajevo area. The air raid was the first time the UN has accepted the idea that attacks on its own troops should be punished by air raids on targets that had no involvement in those attacks. The air raid followed strong pressure from Nato headquarters, and some intensive private lobbying by senior US politicians and military officers, for tougher action.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Swiss Valley witness proposed that the somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment begin at 400,000, with a positive adjustment as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SCC declines, and a negative adjustment as the SCC increases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from that level. The adjustment would be five percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Cheese Exchange block price per 100,000 somatic cells.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Swiss Valley witness explained that the adjustment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cells should apply to all producer milk and that Swiss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Valley would support a somatic cell adjustment on Class II and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class III milk for the handler.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its post-hearing brief, Swiss Valley reiterated the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testimony of its witness in favor of including an adjustment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cells in the amended order. Besides supporting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position of the Swiss Valley witness, Swiss Valley expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general support for a somatic cell adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testimony by a fluid processor witness indicated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handler pays a quality premium when buying milk from producers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and specifies minimum quality standards on purchased tanker milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A witness for Mid-America Dairymen, Inc. (Mid-Am), testified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that Mid-Am favored the inclusion of an adjustment for somatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cells in the amended order. The witness quoted from the Final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decision of the Indiana, Ohio Valley, and Eastern Ohio-Western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pennsylvania proceeding to support the position of Mid-Am that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment for somatic cells should be included based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect somatic cells have on all milk. The witness explained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that quantifying the adjustment on an incremental basis was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult, and since not all milk is used in the manufacture of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cheese a moderate adjustment rate should be used. The witness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained that the Mid-Am proposal would apply the somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment to all producer milk, on a hundredweight basis, with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive adjustment for a somatic cell count below 400,000 and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative adjustment for SCCs above 400,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witness explained that under the Mid-Am proposal, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cell adjustment would be computed by subtracting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monthly average somatic cell count (in thousands) of the producer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 400 and then multiplying the result by the National Cheese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exchange monthly average barrel cheese price multiplied by .0005.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> He stated that since the somatic cell adjustment would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the computation of the producer price differential,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the producer side only, the total size of the pool would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change but individual producers would receive more or less,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depending on whether their milk had a somatic cell count above or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below the average SCC of the market. The Mid-Am witness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued by explaining that the Mid-Am proposal would be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redistribution of money from high somatic cell testing producer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milk to the lower somatic cell testing milk, since there would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no additional money in the pool from the somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instead of supporting the inclusion of somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment provisions in the five Federal orders, witnesses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testifying on behalf of Land of Lakes, Inc., and NCI supported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those organizations' proposals to allow each handler to submit a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cell or quality adjustment plan for payments to its own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers to the market administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A witness for LOL testified that with the LOL proposal a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handler could reduce a producer's payment by up to ten percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from that required by the order if other producers of the handler  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received positive adjustments to their payments, as long as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total payments were equal to at least the minimum total order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment requirements. The witness explained that LOL's proposal does not contain specific criteria for quality and/or volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments. Each handler would submit an individual quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or volume adjustment plan to the market administrator which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the handler would be required to adhere to until a new plan would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be submitted. The witness testified that there is general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement among handlers for the need to adjust payments for milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on quality and volume. The witness continued by arguing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that since the industry has not yet reached a consensus on how to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjust for quality and volume, it would be appropriate to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each handler to develop its own quality and volume plan with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval of the market administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

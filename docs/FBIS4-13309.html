			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F> delegation to the Cairo talks with the Israelis, by radio  correspondent 'Umar Zaydani, in Cairo on 18 April; from the  "With the Midday Events" -- recorded ]    [Excerpts] [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th last night summed up  the negotiations which lasted 12 hours between the Israeli and  Palestinian delegations yesterday.    [Begin recording] [Sha'th] Negotiations are continuing with  all their committees. A large group of experts in various  fields was added to the Palestinian delegation this week.  Today, there were some positive developments. They are slow,  but proceeding persistently regarding the security issues. Some  progress was made also on the jurisdiction issue. [passage  omitted]    [Zaydani] We understand that the Israeli delegation  submitted  to discussion the issue of relations between Fatah and Hamas in  the Gaza Strip.    [Sha'th] For the tenth time, I would like to explain that  relations between Fatah and Hamas, or between Fatah or any other  Palestinian organization, is a 100 percent internal issue, and a  PLO affair only. We want Palestinian national unity. We spare  no effort to create a framework of Palestinian understanding and  Palestinian participation when the Palestinian entity sees  light. However, at the same time, we are very clear, we are  committed to this agreement and to its full implementation. Our  desire to have the biggest possible number of Palestinians  contribute to our decision making does not at all mean we will  relinquish our commitments to this agreement. [end recording]    [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th was asked about his opinion of  measures taken in Amman to the effect that the Hamas Movement is  an illegal movement in Jordan.    [Begin Sha'th recording] I prefer not to comment on this  issue. I believe all Palestinian factions will eventually find  their true house within the PLO and on Palestinian territory.  His Majesty King Husayn reiterated that the PLO is the sole and  legitimate representative of the Palestinians. The PLO is the  side that is responsible and must be responsible for protecting  the entire Palestinian house. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Leading Article: The cost of saving energy In creating the Energy Saving Trust, UK government ministers thought they had found a winner: a tool for bringing about expensive environmental improvements that would also be popular. But the trust has been stalled by a row over its funding, which has also exposed the confused state of the government's plans for energy conservation. The trust is intended to subsidise household improvements such as low-energy light bulbs, efficient boilers and insulation for lofts and walls. The costs  -some Pounds 400m a year by the end of the decade - will be passed on to gas and electricity customers, even if they have not benefited. At least, that was the plan. Today Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director general of Ofgas, the regulator, is likely to tell a parliamentary select committee, for the third time, why she will not allow these costs to be passed on to gas customers. She is right to insist that the government should not use regulators to levy taxes, and to point out that the impact would be regressive, falling proportionally harder on poorer families. But the row obscures the broader questions of whether Britain needs to promote energy conservation, and if it does, whether the trust is the right tool. Curbing emissions The government's main argument for energy saving is that the UK committed itself at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit to curbing emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. The Rio targets are questionable - scientists are uncertain of the threat of global warming - but countries feel that precautions are warranted. In giving its backing to Rio, the government has not weighed up the costs of cutting emissions against the value of the global benefit. It has tended to imply that saving energy is always worthwhile, whatever the cost. But even if the aim is justified, ministers put too much weight on the trust: they want it to generate a quarter of the savings needed to meet the Rio targets. Funding aside, the trust was never likely to be up to the task. It lacks the administration to disburse Pounds 400m a year in parcels of several hundred pounds, let alone to identify which households should benefit. Sharp price rises Instead, the more appropriate tool for curbing carbon emissions - though one the government may feel is politically inaccessible - is further sharp energy price rises. The better argument for the trust's existence is that some household energy conservation measures pay for themselves quickly. The trust says that all of its schemes would cover their costs within five years, but that the public is deterred from adopting these measures by ignorance and by the initial spending needed. It estimates that 90 per cent of households lack at least a quarter of the energy saving measures which it recommends. To the extent that the trust can overcome those barriers, it has a justifiable role, although a smaller one than it now envisages. It also needs to direct its cash towards those who can least afford to pay. But the trust's funds should come from taxpayers, not from consumers. Energy conservation costs money; the government should not use rhetoric and the regulatory system to usher through a disguised and regressive tax.</p>

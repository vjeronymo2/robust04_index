			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wates City disappoints with Pounds 0.1m Wates City of London Properties, the development and investment group, disappointed the stock market yesterday despite increasing optimism on City office prices. Even though the company announced a return to the black in the year ended December 31, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 113,000 against a loss of Pounds 74.9m (after write-downs of Pounds 71.9m on property valuations last time) the share price still fell 8 1/2 p to 87 1/2 p. Disappointment focused on a further property provision of Pounds 2.7m in 1993, and on Wates' net asset value per share of 72.8p, an increase of only 0.4p. However, 1993 was a turnround year for Wates, which entered the recession with 27 per cent gearing but saw it peak at 102 per cent due to slashed property valuations. Last year, Wates substantially strengthened its balance sheet, through a rights issue and property disposals. Total borrowings fell by 38 per cent to Pounds 56.2m, and gearing fell from 102 per cent to 50 per cent. Wates is proceeding with the site formation for a 57,400 sq ft office and retail development in Queen's Street, although it is possible that the site could be sold. It will also demolish Winchester House during 1994, to make way for a 300,000 sq ft office development. The project is 60 per cent owned by Friends Provident. Wates is unable to renew a dividend payment, because of a substantial deficit on the company's profit and loss account. There were reduced losses per share of 0.71p (59.26p). Mr James Dundas Hamilton has announced his retirement as non-executive chairman. He will be replaced by Mr Paul Wates, the current chief executive.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Two Azerbaijani warplanes, an Su-24 and an Su-25,  entered Vardenisskiy Rayon at 1500 today. The first started to  carry out a reconnaissance flight over Sodk [formerly Zod] and  (Kurts). Overflying (Kurts), the second plane swerved toward the  rayon center but had no time to bomb the city. It broke into  pieces and fell in Vardenisskiy Rayon after being hit by a  missile fired by the Armenian Republic's Air Defense Forces.  The other plane quickly flew off.    The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service reported that  the  two pilots of the downed plane were captured.    While the neighboring republic expresses readiness to stop  the military operations during the Olympic games, it also sends  military airplanes to bomb our Republic's peaceful border  settlements.    The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's [NKR] Air Defense Forces  shot  down another Azerbaijani Air Force plane today over the north of  the Karabakh war front. Details of the case are not yet known.    According to reports received from the NKR Defense Army  headquarters at 1700, the Karabakh units repulsed the attack  launched by the Azerbaijani side against Agburun in Martuninskiy  Rayon this morning. There was no report of casualty figures.</p>

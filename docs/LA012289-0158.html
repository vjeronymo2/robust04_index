			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Olympic gold medalist Meldrick Taylor stopped John Wesley Meekins after 7  rounds at Atlantic City, N.J., to retain the International Boxing Federation  junior welterweight title.  </P> <P> Meekins (20-2-2), of West Hempstead, N.Y., couldn't answer the bell for the  eighth round because his right eye was closed, and there was a bad swelling  under his left eye and a cut over the left eye.  </P> <P> Taylor (21-0-1), of Philadelphia, has won 9 straight fights and has recorded 15  knockouts in his career. He was cut over the left eye by an accidental head  butt in the second round, but cut man Ace Marotta kept the gash from becoming a  factor.  </P></p>

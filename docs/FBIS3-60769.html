			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] DAVAO, Philippines, Dec 26 (AFP) -- Three powerful  explosions ripped through the San Pedro Cathedral in this  southern Philippine city Sunday during a packed post-Christmas  mass, killing at least four people and wounding more than 100  others, police said.    Police said the explosions, which occured almost  simultaneously at about 6:20 p.m. (1020 GMT), caused pandemonium  among some 3,000 Roman Catholic church-goers present. Some of  those hurt were injured in the stampede.    A fourth explosive device was found beside a pew near the  altar and was detonated by bomb experts.    Davao police chief Superintendent Rogelio Abaday said that  four people were killed, including 15-year-old Rachel Lu who  died on the spot, and that 119 others were wounded, many  seriously. He declined to comment on the suspects or any  possible motive.    Restituta Plete, a candle vendor, told AFP said she was  standing with her father and husband, Roberto, on the cathedral  steps when they heard the explosion and saw a blinding flash of  light.    Plete and her husband were wounded but her father,  51-year-old Thomas Juliano, was killed. Tears welling in her  eyes, she said doctors told her that her husband's feet might  have to be amputated.    "I don't know what I will do now. We don't have any money.  I'm appealing for help," Plete, in a local hospital, said.    Police said two of the explosions were apparently caused by  homemade bombs and were attempting to verify witness reports  that the third blast was caused by a grenade hurled by a youth  who then fled.    The first bomb exploded five rows from the altar, the second  near the parking lot at the rear. The third, believed to be the  grenade, exploded in a middle row of the church.    "I was seated on the third pew from the altar when I heard a  loud explosion," Sarah Sapun, 27, said from her hospital bed.  "Immediately we ducked for cover. My husband covered me and my  four-year-old son." Her husband was also wounded.    "I am grieving over what happened," said a shocked Davao  Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, still clutching a child's slipper he had  picked up.    In the blasts' aftermath debris such as bags, slippers,  shoes  and seats littered the church and outside.    Residents living near the downtown cathedral, which is near  police headquarters, also panicked.    Some clambered atop passing mini-buses to get away from the  scene while others ran for safety or sought cover.    Abaday ordered stepped-up police patrols in the city and all  exits were sealed to prevent the suspects from escaping a police  dragnet.</p>

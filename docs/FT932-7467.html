			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / From dictators to democracy: Political debate returns after decades IN the 40 years since independence from France, Cambodia has known little of democracy until this week. When Prince Norodom Sihanouk was in power in the 1950s he stifled and persecuted parties which opposed him; Lon Nol, who overthrew the prince in 1970, was a dictator. The Khmer Rouge leaders who came to power in 1975 were ruthlessly authoritarian and killed 1m Cambodians, and the regime installed by Vietnam in 1979 was a one-party state modelled on the Soviet system. The United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) has nevertheless tried to introduce western-style democracy following the signing in 1991 of the Paris peace accords by the four main Cambodian factions. UN volunteers have fanned out across the country to preach the message. For the first time in decades Cambodians have been exposed to a spirited debate between politicians at hundreds of election rallies around the country. Nearly 4.8m people have registered to vote. In some respects the policies of the 20 parties in the election are indistinguishable. Many are run by exiles who live in France, Thailand or the US. Most call for peace and reconciliation and are broadly hostile to Vietnamese immigrants. Most recommend a free market economy but are otherwise vague on economic and financial policy. The chief distinction between the leading contenders is over whether to isolate and destroy the Khmer Rouge or to attempt to accommodate them - as the UN did with so little success - in a new government. The main parties in Cambodia are: Cambodian People's party. The Communist party behind the present administration in Phnom Penh. Installed after the Vietnamese invasion which overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979, it has failed to receive international recognition, something it hopes to gain by winning this week's election. The party claims to be the only organisation strong enough to combat the Khmer Rouge menace. There are fears it will be reluctant to hand over to opposition parties if it loses at the polls. Mr Chea Sim is the party leader. Funcinpec. The royalist party regarded as the main rival to the CPP. Created by Prince Sihanouk in 1981 to oppose the Vietnamese occupation, the party is now led by his son Prince Ranariddh, a university professor at Aix-en-Provence. It is the best-financed and organised of the opposition parties with offices throughout the country. Funcinpec's policy is to hand over substantial powers to Prince Sihanouk and seek accommodation with the Khmer Rouge, with which it had an alliance against the Vietnamese occupiers until the 1991 peace accords. Buddhist Liberal Democratic party. Led by Mr Son Sann, an 81-year-old former Cambodian prime minister, the BLDP could be an important third force in the new assembly. The party emerged from the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, the US-backed faction which signed the Paris accords. Like Funcinpec, it was allied to the Khmer Rouge during the Vietnamese occupation but is now almost defunct as a military force. The party has committed itself to resisting the Vietnamisation of Cambodia, to opposing any return of the Khmer Rouge and to fighting corruption. Khmer Rouge. Known to its supporters as the Party of Democratic Kampuchea, the Khmer Rouge has rejected the election. The organisation signed the Paris peace deal but has reneged on the agreement by refusing to disarm its guerrillas and vowing to disrupt the voting. Pol Pot, the infamous Brother Number One, is still regarded as the Khmer Rouge leader, although Mr Khieu Samphan is technically party chief.</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOLS EXPLORE ERA OF SHARED POWER  </P> <P> At Bell High School, they're working on ending "squawk box" interruptions over  the public address system. At Micheltorena Elementary, they drew up a new lunch  and recess schedule. And at Norwood Street Elementary, they tackled the irksome  question of who gets to use the copying machine.  </P> <P> In about 100 schools throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District -- and  soon on the mammoth district's 500 other campuses -- newly elected local  councils of teachers, parents and administrators are beginning to change the  way decisions are made regarding the basics of daily school operations.  </P> <P> Despite some initial complaints, the councils are producing surprising results.  </P> <P> "I love it that they (the councils) are making decisions that would be  dictatorial if they came from me," said Norwood Principal Angie Kasza.  </P> <P> The new system is called "shared decision-making," a method of decentralizing  power that is being tried in an increasing number of school districts across  the country. It is taking shape in many forms.  </P> <P> In Chicago, an arrangement put into effect this fall gives parents significant  power over local schools. In other cities such as Los Angeles, Santa Fe, N.M.,  and Rochester, N.Y., teachers are being given the dominant voice.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, educators say the councils signal a badly needed revamping of  public education for the nation's second-largest school system, which has  610,000 students. Educators across the country are watching how Los Angeles  fares as it enters a largely uncharted area of educational reform -- one that  says schools will not improve unless teachers have a major hand in running  them.  </P> <P> Giving more power to teachers sounds good, said Stanford University education  professor Michael Kirst, "but there's not much basis for predicting how it will  work."  </P> <P> So far, the experiment has not been trouble-free. In several Los Angeles  district schools, allegations of electioneering and failing to provide adequate  information have marred the elections of parent and community representatives.  </P> <P> For example, at Belvedere Elementary School in East Los Angeles, district and  teachers' union officials delayed counting ballots until charges of ballot  tampering and intimidating voters could be resolved.  </P> <P> Voter turnout at many of the year-round schools was abysmal; in some instances  there were more candidates than people who showed up to cast ballots.  </P> <P> Once elected, many parents have shown only spotty attendance. And after only a  few meetings, some parents, feeling outnumbered and harboring years of  frustration over low-performing schools, say they already are disillusioned.  </P> <P> "It's power for principals and teachers," said Janice White, a parent  representative at Main Street School in South-Central Los Angeles. "It  alienates the parents and community at our school."  </P> <P> Under the terms of the contract with United Teachers-Los Angeles, forged after  last May's teacher strike, principals no longer can make unilateral decisions  in five specific areas: continuing education programs for teachers; student  discipline guidelines; scheduling of final exams and other school activities;  spending of certain monies, such as lottery funds; and use of school equipment,  such as the copier. Those decisions will be made by the council through a  consensus process, with a vote being taken only as a last resort.  </P> <P> The councils range in size from six to 16 members, depending on school  enrollment. Half of each council must be made up of the local UTLA chapter  chair and other teachers, while the remaining seats are filled by the  principal, parent and community representatives and other school employees.  </P> <P> Teachers at all schools chose their representatives over the summer. District  and union officials said the election of more than 2,000 parent and community  representatives will be completed in November.  </P> <P> Campuses that operate year-round because of crowding were the first to form  councils. These schools started their academic year in July. Councils at the  district's other schools are expected to begin meeting soon.  </P> <P> At Norwood, a year-round school near downtown Los Angeles, one of the first  items on the agenda was to review the use of the school's only copying machine,  which is operated by clerks and administrators. Teachers raised the issue  because they were frustrated about a school policy that said they had to submit  copying requests 24 hours in advance.  </P> <P> The council reviewed the cost of running the machine, which Principal Kasza  said amounts to $18,000 a year for the lease, maintenance and supplies. It  decided to start a system for filling emergency copying requests so teachers  could have copies made of lesson materials in the morning for use the same day.  But the council imposed a limit, allowing no more than a daily total of 60  copies per teacher.  </P> <P> "I found that when they analyzed the cost of operating the machine, they were  horror-stricken. They decided to restrict the use of it rather than open it  up," Kasza said. "I wouldn't have had the nerve to make that decision. And you  know what? It's working."  </P> <P> Michael Romo, a Norwood second-grade teacher and council co-chair, described  the new policy as an important morale booster. Teachers have long complained  that they are victims of bureaucratic tyranny, with their powerlessness to  control a piece of equipment as mundane as a copying machine a symbol of their  lowly status.  </P> <P> "I know when the average person reads in the newspaper about teachers wanting  access to the Xerox machine, they think it's ludicrous. . . . But we won the  right in our contract to make these decisions," Romo said, and teachers will  demand a voice in setting  </P> <P> more momentous policies in the future.  </P> <P> "We'll never go back to the point of accepting things from the top blindly.  We're going to question things," he said. "(Teachers) keep coming up to me and  asking, 'Is this the way things are supposed to be done? Can we change things  and do things better?' I think it's great. It shows we are professionals."  </P> <P> At Bell High, a year-round school in the city of Bell, the council has turned  its attention to alleged abuses of the school's public address system.  </P> <P> Bell teachers said the P.A. system too often is used to make "inane"  announcements, such as reporting prom queen election results or the license  plate of a car left with its lights on in the school parking lot. This disrupts  classes, which are too short to begin with, they say.  </P> <P> "Why should 2,400 students be jolted out of what they are doing to hear someone  say 'Will so-and-so please call the office,'?" music teacher Ken Salter said at  a recent council meeting.  </P> <P> After a lengthy discussion, the council agreed to turn the matter over to a  subcommittee to draft guidelines. Principal Mary Ann Sesma agreed on the  condition that a student would be included in the group.  </P> <P> Then the council took up the matter of student discipline, a topic that  provoked critical comments from several of the parent and community members.  One member told the council of her children's complaints that school was  boring. Another asked why the school hadn't contacted her about her son's  truancy problem.  </P> <P> "The outside community has the feeling that this (shared decision-making) isn't  going to work," said Pat Quiles, a retired maintenance administrator for the  city of Los Angeles whose four children attended district schools. "After all  these years, there has been no (improvement in) achievement. So why do this  now?  </P> <P> "The record shows that our schools are down in the bottom as far as achievement  levels go," Quiles said in an interview.  </P> <P> Social studies teacher and council co-chair Beverly Cook said winning the  parents' trust is going to be a challenge. "They blame us and want us to cure  it all," she said.  </P> <P> Principal Sesma agreed. "I'm trying to get people to think about where the  school is now -- and where they want it to go. They have to create a vision of  what they want to see in the school five years from now."  </P> <P> Some say that it is hard to envision profound gains in school performance when  the councils' authority is limited to such concerns as copying machines and  when final exams should be given. But the councils will have a chance to  demonstrate their need for more sweeping powers next year when district and  union officials will begin inviting proposals for "school-based management,"  the next phase of the restructuring plan outlined in the teachers' contract.  </P> <P> In Miami, changes undertaken by school-based management teams have included  reorganizing the school day to create longer instructional periods, for  instance, and hiring Berlitz instructors to teach foreign languages.  </P> <P> Helen Bernstein, a UTLA vice president who is a co-chair of the districtwide  central council on school-based management, said Los Angeles teachers are  beginning to talk about such changes as combining primary grades into  cooperative learning groups, personalizing large schools by breaking them up  into several mini-schools, and providing child care on campus for students who  are already parents.  </P> <P> School-based management is the revolution that will turn around low-performing  schools, Bernstein said.  </P> <P> For now, teachers, principals and parents say, they are struggling to learn the  basics: how to set up a school calendar, how to read a budget and boning up on  district policies. And they are trying to get along without the adversarial  roles to which many of them had grown accustomed.  </P> <P> "It's a little awkward now," said Lucille Derrig, principal of Miles Avenue  School in Huntington Park. "I'm used to making decisions sometimes without  having to consult other people. Now I have to think twice about moving too fast  in certain areas.  </P> <P> "And it's a little awkward for teachers, too," she added, "because they need  background information" before they can make decisions.  </P> <P> For many parents, the challenge is to become equal partners with administrators  and faculty.  </P> <P> "I feel that shared decision-making is a great idea," said Larry Galvan, a Bell  High School parent member. "But you know what? It's not going to succeed unless  the others remember the parent. There are some of us who do know what we are  doing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> School districts across the country are looking for new ways to decentralize  authority and raise academic performance. One promising strategy is "shared  decision-making," which involves giving greater power to teachers, parents and  administrators in individual schools. Some experts say it could lead to  dramatic improvements in the way schools operate.  </P></p>

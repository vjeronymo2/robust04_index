			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> PHOENIX BIG-LEAGUE BID STALLED  </P> <P> Citing high start-up costs, Triple-A Phoenix Firebirds owner Martin Stone says  he probably will withdraw his bid for a major league baseball franchise,  seriously setting back an effort to bring big-league baseball to Arizona.  </P> <P> Stone, a front-runner in Phoenix's effort to get a major league franchise, said  he is "90%" certain he will withdraw his bid if he cannot persuade National  League owners to reduce the $95-million franchise fee.  </P> <P> Stone added that he is trying to arrange a meeting later this week with members  of the league's expansion task force.  </P> <P> Stone said he would have to pay an additional $40 million to $50 million in  start-up costs, which would put the actual cost of beginning a franchise at  $135 million to $145 million.  </P> <P> The high start-up costs, Stone said, would make a new Phoenix franchise  "economically not viable," because the Phoenix area could generate only $3  million to $3.5 million a year in television and radio revenue. New York City  can generate television revenue as high as $41 million, he said.  </P></p>

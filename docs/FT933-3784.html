			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / English arrogance, French paranoia: Is it still a case of plus ca change over Anglo-French monetary relations? THESE are not the words of some disaffected City economist discussing the recent fiasco in the European exchange rate mechanism. The reference is to the instability of the franc in the 1920s and the words were written by JM Keynes, the economist, in his preface to the French translation of A Tract on Monetary Reform. With their neat encapsulation of English arrogance and French paranoia, they serve as a reminder that mutual incomprehension in Anglo-French monetary relations is close to being one of the eternal verities. Indeed, a striking feature of the ERM debacle is just how often the same arguments and the same drama have been played out over the centuries with remarkably similar results. Consider, first, the French attitude to speculation, starting with the arrival in France in the early 18th century of the notorious Scots financier, John Law. Law was a proto-Keynesian who believed that monetary expansion and the setting up of more banks held the answer to unemployment. Exiled from England for killing a man in a duel, he was thrown out of France in 1706 for asserting that paper money was superior to gold and silver - an early instance of the strong currency obsession being taken to extremes. When he returned in 1713 his proposal for setting up a bank to restore order to the public finances allegedly fell foul of the dying Louis XIV, who is said to have inquired whether the proposer was a Roman Catholic. The news that Law was a protestant prompted a magisterial non. Apocryphal or otherwise, the rejection was temporary. Under the regency that followed, Law's persistence was rewarded at a time when Desmaretz, the controller general, was pursuing a savagely deflationary policy through currency appreciation. Law proceeded to flood the country with paper money, prompting a spectacular bout of inflation; and there was rampant speculation as the Scotsman's bank immersed itself in the Mississippi Bubble - a stock trading scam based on the same chain-letter principle that operated in England's contemporaneous South Sea Bubble. The economist and historian Charles Kindleberger has argued that the collapse of the Mississippi Bubble in 1720 helped set back the cause of banking and bank notes in France for more than a century. If most French banking institutions are called caisse, credit, societe or comptoir rather than banque, it is because Law gave the word bank a bad name - a classic case, says Kindleberger, of collective financial memory. In contrast, the English experience with the South Sea Bubble was, in the end, salutary. The South Sea Company, and the closely associated Sword Blade Bank, had originally tried to usurp the Bank of England's position as the main manager of the government's debt. When the bubble collapsed, the Bank of England rescued the South Sea Company, but let the Sword Blade Bank go to the wall. Its position was thenceforth unchallenged in British banking and the orderly management of the public finances was enhanced rather than weakened. Yet the French public finances, comprehensively wrecked by the military adventures and domestic extravagance of Louis XIV, remained rocky throughout the 18th century; and the attempt to restore them through swingeing taxes contributed to the pressures that brought about the revolution of 1789. When the peculiarly unpleasant system of privatised tax collection known as tax farming then collapsed, France was once again forced into experimenting with a form of paper money known as assignats - IOUs supposedly secured on church property appropriated by the state. The inflationary experiment was extended when the revolutionary government had to finance unsuccessful military ventures in Belgium and the Rhineland, as well as action at home against the counter-revolutionary forces in the Vendee. As the face value of the assignats collapsed, peasants refused to sell grain for depreciating paper. Hungry Parisians demanded the guillotine for speculators and called for the revolutionary government to abandon its commitment to a free internal market. An economically progressive French Constituent Assembly that had abolished internal customs barriers in 1790 promptly assumed a more paternalistic, dirigiste role and reintroduced food price regulation. Against that background the deep-seated French fear of the speculator is understandable. And it was a yearning for currency stability that subsequently caused the French in the 1860s to engage in an early practice run for the Maastricht treaty: the Latin Monetary Union. This union, which started with a meeting between France, Belgium, Italy and Switzerland in 1865, was inspired by what is now known as the 'optimum currency area' theory. Its underlying assumption is that when countries have achieved a degree of convergence in economic structure it makes sense to dispense with exchange rate changes and reap the efficiency benefits of a single currency. The problem that haunted the Latin Monetary Union from the outset was that the French insisted on basing the currency on a bi-metallic standard. No need here to go into the arcane 19th century debates on bi-metallism. The essential point is that the attempt to peg the value of a currency to two metals simultaneously flies in the face of market logic. If the supply of one metal increases or declines relative to the other, speculators immediately engage in arbitrage against the countries that try to maintain a fixed relationship between the gold and silver coinage. As Morris Perlman, of the London School of Economics, underlines in a recent paper for the LSE Financial Markets Group, the French political commitment to bi-metallism overrode the desire of the other participants and of most contemporary economists for a gold standard. At the conference of 1865 this fundamental disagreement was swept under the carpet in favour of procedural discussions. Yet by 1867 the French were trying to turn this concept into a worldwide currency union, an idea that was debated at length at a conference of 20 nations, including Britain and the US, in Paris that year. All the participants were enthusiastic, with the single exception of - yes - Britain, its delegates expressing profound scepticism about a proposal based on the use of the French franc and the decimal system. A British royal commission subsequently rejected the Paris plan and recommended a universal currency based on the British sovereign. And Walter Bagehot, the great editor of The Economist, hankered after an Anglo-Saxon monetary union, perfectly foreshadowing the instincts of Margaret Thatcher and today's Eurosceptics. Plus ca change, plus c'est la memsahib. In the end the universal currency went nowhere. And a sustained fall in the price of silver relative to gold caused arbitrageurs to dump silver on the countries in the Latin Monetary Union. The union was thus undermined. And in 1871, after their victory in the Franco-Prussian war, the Germans administered the coup de grace to hopes of a wider European monetary union by adopting a gold standard on a basis that was incompatible with the French system. Worse, they sold silver, an act of sabotage that in French eyes might bear comparison with the recent actions of the Bundesbank within the ERM. Perlman shows how the political strands of the current European monetary debate are, so to speak, vieux jeux, even if we no longer have technical discussions about mint ratios for the coinage. Yet it would be wrong to assume that the obsession with strong currency and the antipathy for market processes is a uniquely French attribute. In the 17th century, when the English were far from being pre-eminent in European finance, City merchants nursed xenophobic worries about Italian bankers, who were suspected of wanting to drain the country's bullion - a classic fear on which the doctrine of mercantilism is built. Nor were the English of this period all instinctive free marketeers where currencies were concerned. The prominent 17th century economist Gerald Malynes, a bullionist, inveighed against self-seeking speculators who distorted currency markets through their use of sophisticated bills of exchange. Such speculation, he believed, drove parities away from sound levels that reflected the underlying bullion content of the currency. A government official, as well as a successful merchant, he wanted all exchange transactions to be conducted at a fixed rate by a 'royal exchanger' authorised by the king. Mr Balladur would have felt entirely at ease with him. Yet there is a difference between the two countries which partly reflects the way the market-versus-mercantilism debate took place mainly at national rather than international level, and had varying outcomes at different times. One example, the French physiocrats who believed that all wealth derived ultimately from the land, attacked the industrial interventionism pioneered by Louis XIV's finance minister Colbert. It was they who coined the phrase laisser faire. But the more liberal aspects of their theory failed to take deeper root in France, not least because the physiocrats underestimated the productive capacity of industry. But the more important difference probably lies in the respective political structures. Interventionism sits easily with strong government; and in the words of the historian Richard Cobb: 'French history has been dominated by the violence of government . . .' In contrast, the English inheritance from the Glorious Revolution was not only a parliamentary system that incorporated a fair number of checks and balances; the interests of private creditors tended to be given predominance over those of the government debtor, at least until the 20th century. Discipline was reinforced for much of that time by adherence to the gold standard. Power in France, on the other hand, remained tilted in favour of high-spending governments, and against the interests of creditors, for much longer. Hence the admiration of 18th and 19th century French historians for the tidiness of British public finances. All that changed in the 20th century when public spending throughout the developed world started its inexorable rise as a percentage of GNP. And the recent tragedy of Anglo-French monetary relations has been that the swing of the pendulum in fashion from fixed to floating exchange rates and back again has rarely coincided in the two countries. In the 1920s, when the Treasury under Churchill took sterling back to the pre-war parity against gold, the French were unable to follow suit because the franc had fallen too low. Between 1924 and 1926 their currency was under constant speculative attack from German and Austrian banks. Just as Louis XIV's government banished Law for his soft money views, the government of Raymond Poincare expelled foreigners who took advantage of the franc's undervaluation. Yet by the time of the 1929 Crash, when Britain and Germany were already in depression, the victim of the currency speculators, France, was enjoying prosperity - derived largely from the undervaluation of the franc by those same, obnoxious speculators. In the 1930s, the experience was reversed. When the British came off gold in 1931 France was back in one of its strong currency phases. Indeed, its manic accumulation of gold had helped precipitate the global liquidity crisis of 1931; and France compounded its problems through dogged adherence to another precursor of the ERM, the Gold Bloc, the members of which included - shades of the earlier Latin union - Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Italy. It took 4 1/2 years of political instability and savage deflation before France devalued under Leon Blum's Popular Front. Britain, meantime, was enjoying an extended post-devaluation bout of economic growth. Yet the French readiness to go along with fixed exchange rates is invariably coloured by wider perceptions of national interest. In the post-war period General de Gaulle, an archetypal bullionist, complained vociferously about the fault lines in the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate agreement, an essentially Anglo-Saxon creation. His government helped hasten its demise by selling dollars for gold in an act of monetary aggression that supported de Gaulle's anti-American foreign policy stance. Not to be outdone, the British were soon to moan about the fault lines in the Franco-German inspired ERM, which even the French obsession with currency stability has not been able to save. Its de facto disintegration now threatens another idealistic attempt at a European monetary union. Yet by loosening the ERM bonds, speculation may yet prove to have saved continental Europe from another savage deflation. The monetary disagreements between Britain and France, which reflect very different experiences of inflation both in the 20th century and before, are thus more subtle than they appear at first sight. How, then, are we to explain the present French reluctance to take advantage of the new freedom to cut interest rates after the ERM fiasco; the apparent preference for the the hair-shirt of the mid-1930s to the prosperity of the late 1920s? Perhaps the best rationalisation is provided by the late Fred Hirsch. In his book Money International he remarked of France's deflationary enthusiasm in the Depression: 'France was genuine in its financial conservatism. Its very lapses in periods of inflation and external depreciation made it the more determined to make amends when it could - to store up, so to say, a pile of financial virtue as a reserve, both physical and spiritual, against the next fall from monetary grace.' That, surely, hits the bull's eye - and with much less arrogance than Keynes.</p>

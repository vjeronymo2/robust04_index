			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Shetlanders seen to oppose separate independence SHETLANDERS have little interest in seeking separate independence from Britain if Scotland were to become independent, Mr Edward Thomason, convener of Shetland Islands council, said yesterday. The question has become significant because an independent Shetland could, along with an independent Orkney, lay claim to a large part of the North Sea oil and gas fields. If England also drove a hard bargain over the division of oilfields in the North Sea, an independent Scottish government could end up with less than 10 per cent of North Sea oil revenues. Mr Thomason said there was 'no evidence of a wish for independence in the islands'. He added: 'No one is more surprised by all this talk of separation than the Shetlanders themselves.' The present airing of the Shetland question comes in the latest North Sea oil report by County NatWest WoodMac, the brokers, which looks at the possible implications for the North Sea of an independent Scotland. It says that the maximum North Sea oil revenues Scotland could expect over the next five years would be Pounds 17bn in 1992 terms out of the total of Pounds 18bn. This assumes that the border between the English and Scottish sectors was drawn due east from Berwick-on-Tweed. If the direction of the land border between England and Scotland was continued into the sea and if Shetland and Orkney took their share of the oilfields then Scottish revenue could be as little as Pounds 1.5bn. The report says that at a time when the North Sea is having to compete for oil-company funds with the emerging oil and gas provinces in Africa, South America and the former Soviet Union, oil companies need to be convinced that they would not be 'economically disadvantaged' by any carve-up.

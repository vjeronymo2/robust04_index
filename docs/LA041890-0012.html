			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEARCH FOR SUCCESSOR TO KORNBLUM BEGINS  </P> <P> Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday authorized a nationwide search to find a  successor for beleaguered Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner Ronald N. Kornblum,  who announced he will step down from the job on July 1.  </P> <P> "That's going to be a real tough one," said Supervisor Kenneth Hahn of the  recruitment effort.  </P> <P> He noted that the coroner's staff of 15 doctors performed 5,804 autopsies and  its 160-member staff handled 18,019 investigations last year.  </P> <P> A recent management audit called for 155 changes in the coroner's office after  finding that staff shortages, coupled with a growing homicide rate, were  leading to a breakdown in controls and sanitary conditions.  </P> <P> Kornblum, 56, took over the coroner's office in 1982 when Thomas Noguchi, the  so-called "coroner to the stars," was accused of mismanagement and lost his  job.  </P></p>

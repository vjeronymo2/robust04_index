			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE KING OF THE FIELDS BY ISAAC BASHEVIS SINGER (PLUME:  $8.95)  </P> <P> One of Singer's most recent and curious works, "King of the Fields," contains  the elements of a Greek tragedy: betrayal, revenge, lust and Divine wrath. The  struggles of Cybula, a petty chieftain, to comprehend the debased nature of  humanity are crystallized by his confrontation with the resolute virtue of the  Jewish exile, Ben Dosa. Although the actions and thoughts of the characters  have the ring of authenticity, Singer seems unable to place the story in time.  When Cybula and his followers abandon their existence as hunter-gatherers and  begin to practice agriculture, it appears to be set in prehistoric Poland; when  they visit a bustling market town, time seems to have shifted several millennia  forward to the High Middle Ages. "King of the Fields" ends on an  uncharacteristically dark note: Unlike the oppressed hero of "The Slave,"  Cybula is overcome by the evil he finds within his wife and himself, and  chooses the God of Death over the God of Life.  </P></p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Company reps give green light to grey cars THAT BANE of Britain's motorways, the company rep in his macho red car, tailgating at 90mph, might be starting to fade into history. According to a survey by PHH Allstar, one of the UK's biggest car fleet management groups, bright aggressive car colours are starting to be replaced by more subdued tones. This year, grey company cars have become six times more popular than in the same period of 1991. This would 'seem to confirm that Britain is becoming the more caring and hard-working place that prime minister John Major has said he wants to see', according to PHH Allstar. To the ranks of the greys must be added the greens. The number of orders for green cars has more than doubled from last year, according to the survey. The information came from an analysis of 5,000 cars which PHH has bought for its clients since January 1. Blue cars have overtaken white for second place in the popularity stakes, although red remains marginally the favourite colour. The trend could lead to less stressed motoring in future because there are observable links between the colours chosen for cars and driver behaviour, says PHH Allstar. The company recruited psychologist Dr David Lewis to carry out a study of the subject last year. Accident frequency rates and their possible causes have become a particular focus of concern for the fleet management business. This has been as a result of soaring insurance premiums and a restructuring of the premium system by the Association of British Insurers during the past 12 months. So what does that mean in terms of driver attitudes? According to Dr Lewis, grey cars are indicative of a careful nature, 'a strong sense of duty and a belief that everybody should lead as sober and upright a life as him or herself.' Green cars are said to denote caution and a tendency to put family life before success at work. The survey could be seen as waving a red rag to blues, in concluding that they are likely to be 'hard-working but slightly lacklustre'.</p>

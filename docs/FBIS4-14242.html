			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 26 Apr (SUNA) -- Justice Minister  'Abd-al-Aziz Shiddu has again stressed Sudan's firm commitment  to human rights, in conformity with the nation's faith and  current orientation. Shiddu responded to a statement issued by  the U.S. Embassy last week, in today's issue of AL-INQADH  AL-WATANI. Shiddu stated: We know all our responsibilities and  do not need guidance on this issue. He declared the  government's rejection of the United States' evil deeds against  Sudan both inside and outside the country.    The U.S. Embassy claimed that Amnesty International's  findings, which confirm that Sudan's human rights record is much  better than that of the United States, Great Britain, and  Israel, were not correct. The U.S. Embassy statement referred  to alleged human rights violations in Sudan, and urged the  government to take what it called serious steps to stop these  violations.</p>

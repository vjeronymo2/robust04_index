			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: JC Penney sets record as Dayton Hudson slips JC PENNEY, the fourth-largest US retailer, maintained its strong sales and earnings momentum in the third quarter, while Dayton Hudson continued to suffer from its heavy exposure to the sluggish Californian economy. Penney, with nearly 1,300 department stores in 50 states and an extensive catalogue-sales business, yesterday said net income, before an extraordinary item, set a quarterly record at Dollars 221m, or 83 cents a share. The result compares with Dollars 186m, or 70 cents, in the corresponding period of 1992. In the three months to the end of October, the company took a one-time charge of Dollars 36m, or 14 cents, to cover early retirement of debt, plus a Dollars 14m provision to adjust deferred taxes. With both items included, net income was Dollars 185m, or 69 cents. The improvement in earnings was struck on a 9.1 per cent advance in sales to Dollars 4.76bn. Sales in stores open for at least a year were 9 per cent ahead of last year's level. Penney continued to benefit from Sears' recent exit from the catalogue business, as mail-order sales climbed 15.2 per cent. By contrast, Dayton Hudson's third-quarter results underscored the group's continuing difficulties in the discount sector. The retailer said a poor performance by Mervyn's, an clothing chain with a strong presence on the west coast, had contributed to a 24 per cent decline in net income to Dollars 43m, or 53 a share, against Dollars 57m, or 70 cents, in the 1992 quarter. Revenues showed a 7 per cent increase to Dollars 4.63bn. However, on a same-store basis, a more reliable measure of retailing strength, sales were up by only 1 per cent. Mervyn's operating profits were down significantly, while same-store sales dropped by 7 per cent. Target stores, which offers general merchandise at discounted prices, continued to be a bright spot, showing a 6 per cent gain in comparable-store sales and higher operating profit. At the department-store division, which includes the Dayton's, Hudson's and Marshall Field's chains, earnings and sales were flat.</p>

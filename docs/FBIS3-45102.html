			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "An Unwise Move"] </F>   [Text] On 6 Jan, disregarding the fact that Sino-U.S.  textile talks had not yet been concluded, the U.S. government  unilaterally announced that as of 17 Jan, the textile import  quota for China in 1994 would be cut by 25 to 35 percent from  that of 1993. Such a move would seriously damage normal  Sino-U.S. trade and naturally has prompted vigorous protests  from Chinese officials. It has also infuriated Chinese  industrial and commercial sectors, apart from causing  dissatisfaction among American importers and consumers.    The U.S. government cited the so-called "illegal transit" of  China-made textile products, through third-world countries,  into the United States, as reason for its move, which is  untenable.    The textile product quota system is a means of regulation  for  normal textile trade. It was arrived at through negotiations on  equal footing between the Chinese and U.S. governments and, as  such, is totally unrelated to illegal textile transit. The  Chinese government always opposes the illegal transit of textile  products and deals with such practices sternly, when there is  solid evidence. In fact, last year, China's MOFTEC publicly  punished nine enterprises for such illegal practices, and called  two special national conferences in connection with cracking  down on illegal textile transit. The United States was well  aware of the efforts China has made and their effects in this  regard. But the U.S. government ignored these facts and  arbitrarily extended the accusation to normal textile trade.  This is completely wrong.    Trade disputes can only be solved through talks based on the  principle of equality and mutual benefits. The U.S.  government's latest move runs directly against this principle  and has violated the GATT free trade rule and regulations of the  International Multi- Fibre Agreement.    The United States should not imagine that its action can  force China to yield. It will not achieve this. The Chinese  people have never bowed to any external pressure. The U.S.  unilateral cut in China's textile quota assuredly will hurt  Chinese textile production and exporting firms. But ultimately  it is its American textile importers and consumers who are going  to be hurt. American firms engaged in joint-venture textile  production and technological cooperation in China will also be  hit hard. The serious consequences of such a move will also  affect other American industries.    China's MOFTEC has solemnly declared that China will  continue  talks as originally planned in order to solve the problems  through consultations. If the United States clings obstinately  to its course, it will force China into a position where it has  to adopt corresponding retaliatory actions. We hope the U.S.  government will change its course, immediately correct the wrong  action, and return to the path of consultation on equal footing  in order to safeguard the normal development of Sino-U.S. trade  and overall Sino-U.S. relations.</p>

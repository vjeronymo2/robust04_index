			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Bank forecasts surplus OVERNIGHT lending rates in the UK money markets dropped to 4 per cent yesterday morning, after the Bank of England forecast a cash surplus of Pounds 100m. The Bank said this was the first time it had forecast a surplus for almost three years. The last time that it needed to smooth out the imbalance between the government's accounts and the private sec-tor by selling Treasury bills into the market was in April 1990. According to the Bank, there were no special circumstances behind the surplus. On most days more money flows from the commercial banks to the government than vice versa, so the banks' holdings of liquid assets are run down and the money market finds itself with a shortage of funds which the Bank then relieves. All that happened yesterday was that more money flowed from the government to the commercial banks so the Bank had to drain the system of excess liquidity, in order to maintain control over short-term lending rates. Money market dealers reported that, although money was easy as a result of the surplus, longer dated rates were scarcely affected. One-week money rates declined to around 5 1/2 per cent from Friday's 6 1/8 per cent, while one-month money softened to around 6 per cent on the offered side from 6 3/16 per cent. The key three-month inter-bank rate, seen as a good guide to base rate trends, fell to 5 15/16 per cent on the offered side, from 6 1/16 per cent. In the afternoon the Bank revised the surplus to Pounds 200m. It then sold the market Pounds 200m of Treasury bills, due on March 12, at 5 3/8 to 5 9/16 per cent. Dealing in short-sterling futures was quiet. The June contract moved within a narrow range and finished virtually unchanged on the day at 94.60. In France there was more activity. The June French franc contract rose by more than 20 basis points, buoyed by a stronger franc. The market believes that with a firmer franc the French authorities will be able to lower their short-term interest rates in the near future. The June contract was finally around 91.63, following an opening level of 91.41. Three-month interbank rates in France were sharply lower yesterday. They were quoted at 10 31/32 per cent, compared with 11 1/2 per cent on Friday.</p>

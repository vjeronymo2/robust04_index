			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Tiphook Renting boxes and trailers should be a straightforward business but Tiphook's aggressive growth and accounting policies have lent it a certain mystique. As a result, its shares have been buffeted far more by sentiment than fundamentals. Even though interim profits dipped 10 per cent, Tiphook's shares remain strikingly cheap on conventional measures of analysis. Most reasonable expectations of this year's earnings leave its forward multiple languishing at less than six while its dividend yield - at 9 per cent - is about twice the market average. Despite the increasing clarity of its accounts, UK investors continue to harbour an aversion against a leasing company which carries close to Pounds 1bn of debt and gearing of 300 per cent on a stock market value of Pounds 323m. On the other side of the Atlantic, Tiphook is seen as a different story. Even though its earnings under US accounting rules are only about half those stated in the UK, its Wall Street followers focus on the strong cash flow and well-covered dividend. Heavy buying by US investors has lifted their holding to 30 per cent and may yet prompt a reassessment in the UK. That, though, would have to await a general economic recovery, when gearing would work in Tiphook's favour rather than against it.</p>

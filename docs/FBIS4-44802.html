			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Rose: "EDI Players Team Up to Fire the </F> Market"; first paragraph is LE MONDE INFORMATIQUE introduction]    [Text] Though embryonic, the EDI market has  nonetheless won over 8,000 companies already. To shore up their  positions, suppliers have just joined forces in GO-EDI, an  information exchange club created under the aegis of  SimproFrance.    Suppliers of EDI (electronic data interchange) products and  services have just teamed up in a club christened GO-EDI (EDI  providers group). Their goals are to share information on how  standardization is progressing, to adapt their products more  rapidly, and analyze the market both in France and abroad.  Participants include Axime Ingenierie, BT France, Bull, IBM/CGI,  EDS, General Electric Information Services, and Transpac. "Those  seven players account for 80 percent of the market," reckons  Christrophe Viry, head of EDI studies at SimproFrance.  <H5>  Consulting Is Half the Market </H5>   "This resolutely open club, which will not tolerate any form  of bureaucratese, has been created to help boost your EDI  sales," wrote Bernard Stoven, secretary-general of SimproFrance,  to market players. The EDI market, which SimproFrance estimates  at 425 million French francs [Fr] in 1993, is having real  trouble getting off the ground. SimproFrance counts between 90  and 120 suppliers, depending on whether distributors of software  package are included. Over 8 out of 10 are based in  Ile-de-France, where most of the demand is concentrated. In an  apparent sign of a more mature market, many of the suppliers  surfaced less than three years ago. In 1991, for instance, 30  new players came into the French market, or three times as many  as the year before. EDI in France breaks down into three  categories: consulting, bundled software, and valued-added  networks and services (VANS). Consulting (studies of timing and  feasibility) comprises the traditional business of helping EDI  user companies lost in the thicket of standards, procedures, and  products. SimproFrance has counted 55 firms, which racked up  sales of Fr145 million last year, operating in this niche, which  takes in both big consulting firms (Coopers &amp; Lybrand) and  small  ones of fewer than five people. Examples include ABX Consulting  (two people), Euroedi (3 people, Fr2 million), HB Technologies  (3 people, Fr2.5 million), and Logcom (3 people, Fr1.5 million).    Also active in consulting are the big software package or  service companies such as CGI, Unilog, Sligos/Marben, Bull  Ingenierie, EDS, Digital, and SG2, whose consulting work  supports product sales. "Of the 55 companies that do consulting,  only 30 are not tied to a bundled software or value-added  services line," notes Christophe Viry.    Thirty companies offering 45 products in France racked up  sales estimated by SimproFrance at Fr100 million in 1993 (for  5,659 units sold) in the second component of the EDI market,  software packages. Four companies control over half the sales.  Polysoft, one of the oldest publishers in the market, wrote  Fr4.8 million worth on 1,500 titles; General Electric  Information Services markets 1,100 titles; Sedinov, created in  1988, offers 800 titles; and Transpac and its EDI 440 line,  which has been on the market since 1983, boasts 650 titles. Most  of the bundled software has been written in France, with only 40  percent of it imported from abroad, mainly from the United  States and Northern Europe. "And foreign products are not  penetrating," observes Christophe Viry, who explains, "The  Americans did not make the Edifact standard a priority, and most  of their products, which are relatively old, still run on DOS.  Their only aces are a competitive price and the availability of  titles, which number in the thousands."    There are many fewer players in the third area, VANS. Just  13  companies market 18 services. VANS is the stronghold of carriers  (BT with EDI*Net, France Telecom with Atlas); suppliers of  vertical services such as Bull/Athesa with Allegro for commerce,  and Brio for building and public works projects; and software  houses (Axime Service, SG2, Sligos). According to SimproFrance,  the provision of such services generated sales of Fr200 million  in 1993, for about 9,500 mailboxes. General Electric is still  number one in VANS (one third of the market), ahead of Transpac  (26 percent), and Bull (12 percent). Together, the three serve  over 70 percent of all subscribers.    On the demand side, the craze among French companies has a  long way to go before it catches up to that of English-speaking  or Northern European users. Comments Christophe Viry, "An EDI  show there attracts at least a hundred exhibitors and 10,000  visitors, while in France it is hard to come up with 30  exhibitors and 2,000 visitors."    On the supply side, the increasingly competitive environment  has sent prices tumbling. The average cost of a product for PCs  is Fr14,500, or 15 percent less than in 1992. In addition, the  position of players has been made more fragile by the  reliability and efficiency of products, which have squeezed  regular earnings from consulting and assistance. The rise of  both Windows (currently 20 percent) and Unix (50 percent)  products is also making DOS versions (66 percent) shakier.  <H5>  Boxed Material: A 1994 EDI Product Guide </H5>   SimproFrance, a public organization assigned to research and  develop ways to cut costs and turnaround times in commercial  transactions, has just published the 1994 edition of its "EDI  Product Guide." The modestly-priced (Fr120), 160-page handbook  features a series of standard forms showcasing the products of  62 firms. Products are divided into four categories: software  packages, communications modules, value-added networks and  services, and consultants. Each product is accompanied by a  description, a statement of the company's marketing policy,  prices, and persons to contact.</p>

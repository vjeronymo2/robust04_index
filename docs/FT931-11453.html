			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Northern Foods launches Pounds 91.28m debut issue NORTHERN Foods, the UK dairy and convenience food company, yesterday launched the first sterling convertible bond issue for two months, taking advantage of rising UK share prices and falling interest rates. Strong demand enabled the food company to increase the size of the issue, which marked its debut in the international capital markets, to Pounds 91.28m from Pounds 85m. The coupon was set at 6.75 per cent, the low end of the indicated range of 6.75-7.00 per cent, and the conversion price was set at 326p a share, representing a premium of 18.11 per cent over the ordinary share price at the time of pricing. This came in at the top of the indicated range. Mr Martin Clark, finance director of Northern Foods, said the issue was aimed at repaying short-term debt of Pounds 120m linked to last year's Pounds 359m acquisition of Express Dairy and Eden Vale from GrandMet. 'The issue also improves the company's debt (maturity) profile,' he said. The 15-year issue, redeemable after five years, represents 5 per cent of Northern Foods' share capital. The bonds were priced at par but rose to 101 1/2 in grey market trading. Convertibles dealers were hopeful that Northern Foods' issue heralded a pick-up in a market which has been virtually moribund for the last 12 to 14 months, during which high interest rates and low share valuations discouraged finance directors from using this sort of financing.

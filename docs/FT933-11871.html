			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (8): Scanstyle - furniture from the forest IF GHANA is going to make a go of export-led growth, it will need more companies like Scanstyle Mim, a small furniture manufacturer working in the heart of Ghana's tropical hardwood forest. Scanstyle's main contact with the outside world is through a crackly radio transmitter. The national electricity grid only reached the factory in Mim last year. Yet Scanstyle is responsible for more than 90 per cent of Ghana's furniture exports. Its earnings are small - Dollars 6m last year - but growth potential is huge. The company's turnover has grown six-fold since 1982. And in added value terms, Scanstyle's furniture earns five times as much as the same volume of unprocessed timber. So why aren't more loggers branching into the furniture business? 'Because,' says Mr Kwabena Pepera, the company chairman, 'logging earns more money with less risk. If a consignment of furniture is rejected, you risk bankruptcy.' Many Ghanaian companies find it difficult to export because they cannot meet the quality standards demanded by overseas customers, he adds. Local manufacturers often have little knowledge or experience of marketing abroad. Ghana is not yet geared to providing pre-export finance, or long-term capital for investment in plant and machinery. Scanstyle shows how obstacles were overcome. The company was set up in 1968 by a Norwegian who spotted an opportunity to use the offcuts of a large sawmill in Mim. In the early 1980s, frustrated by government curbs on his business, he decamped to Singapore, leaving a knowledge of the European furniture market and the quality standards required. 'Under the old government controls,' Mr Pepera recalls, 'we could not export a single chair. But we had Lebanese traders coming from the Ivory Coast and paying cash to smuggle our goods through the jungle.' Life for exporters has become easier. Export and import licenses have been abolished; foreign exchange controls scrapped; and the cedi has been devalued, making Ghanaian exports more competitive abroad. With the help of a Dollars 400,000 Japanese loan, the company has bought computer controlled lathes from Italy which will allow it to tackle more complex furniture. It trains its personnel abroad, and has opened a sales office in London to be closer to its clients. Scanstyle's biggest market is the UK, where its garden furniture and chairs in tropical hardwoods - white teak, mahogany and other species with mysterious African names - are highly prized. The company also exports to Germany, Italy and Ireland. It has not been able to break into the American market because it cannot yet match the size of the orders. 'Our main constraint is a shortage of raw timber,' Mr Pepera explains.</p>

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Cash trades quietly STERLING cash rates were mostly unchanged in quiet trading, following the forecast of a small Pounds 500m shortage by the Bank of England. The overnight rate came down to 7 1/2 per cent after the market took out most of the Pounds 500m shortfall by lunchtime. In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 400m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 550m, and the Bank bought Pounds 150m of Band 1 bank bills, also at 9 7/8 per cent. This straightforward trading softened period rates at the short end. One-week money closed at 10 per cent, down from 10 1/8 per cent, one-month was at 10 1/8 per cent from 10 3/16 per cent, and three-month off  1/16 at 10 1/4 per cent. However, dealers saw no fundamental factors softening rates and still found plenty of reasons to be bearish about a base rate cut. There is still the fear of a Lombard rate rise, and eyes are firmly fixed on August 6, the date of the next Bundesbank council meeting. Sterling's slide yesterday to 2.57 percentage points below its nearest competitor in the European exchange rate mechanism, the Italian lira, was also depressing. Yesterday's CBI quarterly survey underlined the view that economic recovery is a long way off, and only made the atmosphere gloomier. But it had little effect on the market, having been substantially discounted after its contents were leaked at the weekend. Futures trading was more subdued, closely tracking sterling's fall on the foreign exchanges. The September short sterling contract dipped 6 basis points from its opening of 89.73, but picked up to close at 89.69. Dealers said a futures broker had bought 500 lots at 89.68 and, on a day when volume reached only about 12,000 lots, this had had a substantial effect on the market. In the German interbank money market, dealers reported continuing tension as German call money held close to the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. Banks quoted call money within a broad range of 9.65 to 9.75 per cent, but said most trade was at 9.70-9.75 per cent. Liquidity levels were not high, and some dealers were concerned that pension fund payments due today would drain funds from the market.</p>

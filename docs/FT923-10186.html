			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / People: Exiting at an exciting time Norman Askew (right), president and managing director of TI Aerospace and Titeflex International, is the new managing director of East Midlands Electricity in succession to Dan Cowe, who is retiring. As the number two to chairman John Harris, Askew, 49, says it was too good an opportunity to pass up, despite the fact that he was leaving TI 'at a very exciting time for the business', following the acquisition of Dowty. He had been at TI for 26 years. The fit with East Midlands he describes as simply a common philosophy - 'excellence in customer service'. Asked whether customers' most immediate preferences might not be for lower prices, he says that he does not believe companies should have to apologise for making money. East Midlands Electricity has just reported a 41 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 1992. He adds that continuing improvements in distribution efficiency can lead to lower prices 'in the longer term'. He is also looking forward to continuing 'a fairly ambitious programme' for expansion of the non-regulated businesses such as energy services, control systems and electrical and mechanical contracting. Cowe, a light rapid transit systems and model railway enthusiast, is retiring at 60 at the end of September.</p>

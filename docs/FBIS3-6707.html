The 45.4 percent of the survey respondents who are uneasy  about the future of Japan is the highest ever recorded in the 24  years of the survey and the percentage of those still optimistic  about Japan stood at 29.6 percent, slipping below the 30 percent  mark for only the third time.    The only other times the belief Japan is "heading in a good  direction" dipped below 30 percent was in the 1974 survey and  again in 1982.    The poll, conducted last December, surveyed 10,000 Japanese  men and women aged 20 or older, with a response rate of about 71  percent.    The number of people thinking "Japan is headed in a bad  direction" has shown an increase each year since 1989 with 49  percent of the pessimists saying they were concerned about  employment and labor conditions and another 33 percent worried  about food stores.    The decrease in the number of people optimistic about Japan  reflected a slide in the respondents who believe in Japan's  economic power, about 24 percent, and the nation's food  supplies, about 10 percent. Both figures are the lowest ever  recorded.    Following last year's unprecedented high of 70 percent of  the  respondents saying the government did not reflect the will of  the people, this year's figure decreased to around 62 percent.    This year's survey indicates an increase of 7 percentage  points to 30 percent in the number of people thinking that  government reflects the will of the people.    For the first time since 1984, the survey also asked about  the government's dialogue with citizens regarding social affairs  and political matters with 65 percent of the respondents saying  the government should talk with the people.    Asked about social conditions in Japan, 73 percent of the  respondents agreed that Japan has peace but only 24 percent said  things are stable, a decrease of 3 percentage points.    Only 9 percent said they are living comfortably, another  decrease of 3 percentage points, while 12 percent said they did  not feel any vitality in their lives -- about double the number  of the year before.</p>

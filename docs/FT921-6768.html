			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Sweden goes against trend on defence costs SWEDEN is to increase its defence spending at a time when most European countries are cutting their military budgets. It also wants to boost Swedish arms sales abroad, particularly to eastern Europe, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. Mr Anders Bjorck, defence minister, said yesterday the centre-right government intended to increase defence spending by SKr7.3bn (Pounds 700m) over five years. The proportion of GNP going into military expenditure would rise slightly to 2.4 per cent. Sweden's security forces 'will be leaner but meaner', he said, adding that 'the risks of local conflicts in eastern Europe have clearly grown'.</p>

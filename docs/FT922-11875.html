			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Earnings at Comalco fall 60% in first quarter COMALCO, the Australian aluminium producer, yesterday said profits fell by about 60 per cent in the first quarter to the end of March, compared with the year-ago first quarter. However, Mr John Ralph, chairman, said the result was 'a significant recovery' from the last quarter of 1991, when Comalco reported an operating loss. Mr Ralph told the annual meeting that the result was better than anticipated, mainly because of an unexpected improvement in metal prices. Aluminium is currently quoted at about 62 US cents a pound on the London Metal Exchange - the highest since May last year. Mr Ralph said world aluminium production had remained fairly flat in the first two months of the year, but inventory levels had climbed. As a result, prices were likely to weaken in the absence of a notable increase in consumption or further cuts in production. The board does not expect the level of first-quarter profits to be maintained, implying a fall in full-year operating profits, Mr Ralph said. Comalco reported an operating profit of ADollars 21.5m (USDollars 16.5m) in 1991, down 85 per cent on the previous year. The group reported a loss of ADollars 72m after taking account of extraordinary losses of ADollars 94m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by ROK Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok delivered at the </F> ROK Memorial Day Ceremony held at the National Cemetery in  Tongjak-dong, Seoul--live]    [Text] My fellow countrymen, men who have done meritorious  deeds for the country, and members of the families of the war  dead:    Today, on the meaningful 39th Memorial Day, we are here to  uphold the will of the souls of those who dedicated their lives  to the fatherland and the nation, while paying tribute to their  noble spirit.    First of all, together with all countrymen, I pray for the  repose of the souls of those who are resting at this sacred  place of the nation, respectfully bowing before their souls.    At the same time, I would like to say words of deep respect  and consolation to those who have done meritorious deeds and  members of the families of those who have dedicated their lives  to the country, who have only lived indefatigably for the  country and the society with dignity and purposeful life even  under the difficult circumstances, and those military servicemen  and policemen who are still suffering in the hospital from the  wounds they suffered during the Korean war and the Vietnamese  war.    Fellow countrymen:    We are enjoying much freedom and prosperity today and have  been able to secure a firm position in the world. We owe this  to the noble sacrifice of those who have done meritorious deeds  for the country, including the deceased patriots and the war  dead.    They dedicated with delight their flowering youth in the  Korean and Vietnamese wars, thereby laying the foundation for  bringing today's remarkable development and democracy into  blossom.    At this solemn ceremony today, we should solidify our  resolve  to repay their patriotic loyalty by deeply bearing in our mind  the real meaning of the fatherland that they defended with blood  and sweat.    The country they really wanted was a unified fatherland in  which the whole nation can enjoy a happy life amid abundance  while all people's freedom and human rights are respected and  democracy is rooted.    Today's world, in which communism has collapsed and the  ideological confrontation between the East and West has ended,  clearly shows that their faith in free democracy was correct.    However, the unchanged confrontational aspect of the Cold  War  era still remains on the Korean peninsula, the ground for our  Korean nation's living, the only example of such a kind on earth.    Under these circumstances, looking at our compatriots who  have fled the North who are suffering from all kinds of  hardships while wandering about China and Russia, we cannot but  feel warm compassion and patriotic love toward the North Korean  residents whose basic human rights are not being guaranteed.    This is why we feel reverence toward the great meritorious  deeds of those who dedicated their lives to the country--who  made today's ROK possible with a firm faith in the future of  their nation--when the fate of the fatherland was at stake.    Fellow countrymen:    The reality of our national security is that the vigilance  against the North is increasingly weakening [taebuk kyonggaksimi  chomcha huibakhaejigo issomyo] in spite of the fact that North  Korea is pushing for its southward strategy in the reunification  front and its nuclear development at a heightened level and that  even a callousness to national security is spreading and we are  not noticing it.    We should resolutely cope with those forces that are  threatening our free democratic system and should exercise  wisdom and sagacity to prepare with composure for a unified  fatherland of tomorrow based on a firm view of the country and a  sense of national security, while giving up hasty expectations  or illusions on the unification.    Now is the time to concentrate all national strength on  increasing the national competitive power at a time when we are  faced with an important stage that will determine the future of  the nation. This notwithstanding, some circles in our society  are putting forth reckless claims and allegations, and excessive  selfishness. This is very worrisome.    Even under these circumstances, all our countrymen should  establish a mature democratic society through participation and  reconciliation from a broadminded viewpoint of developing a  national community.    Souls of those who dedicated their lives for the country:    We do not forget even for a moment your meritorious deeds,  who made today's fatherland possible by defending the free  democracy in this land. We will establish a blissful country  where freedom and justice overflows and open the era of the  Korean nation which will toweringly stand in the world to repay  your sacrifice.    The government will make further efforts in providing your  beloved descendants with material and spiritual courteous  treatment to help them enjoy their life with honor and dignity,  thereby helping the spirit of your noble patriotism lay in the  hearts of the countrymen forever.    Today, on this meaningful Memorial Day, we respectfully pray  for the repose of the souls of those who are resting at the  National Cemetery--the sacred ground of the nation--once again  paying tribute to them, while recalling once again the patriotic  loyalty of the war dead and those who dedicated their lives to  the country.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ATTEND NCAA, COLLEGE PRESIDENTS URGED  </P> <P> An American Council on Education official today urged college and university  presidents to attend the NCAA's annual meeting and support a proposal requiring  colleges to disclose how many of their athletes graduate.  </P> <P> James Whalen, president of Ithaca College who is completing his term as  chairman of the ACE Board of Directors, said the NCAA meeting Jan. 7-9 in  Dallas will "deal with issues vital to the future of our institutions."  </P> <P> Whalen, in a letter to the presidents of about 840 NCAA schools urged them to  support the graduation disclosure plan.  </P> <P> Citing proposed legislation that would require such disclosure, Whalen said  that if the NCAA does not adopt such a policy, "the Congress of the United  States will do it for us."  </P> <P> "Federal intrusion in this area would set a very dangerous precedent and would  open a door that we will never be able to close again," said Whalen.  </P> <P> The highest number of presidents ever to turn up at an NCAA meeting was 199,  Whalen said, "and 25% participation is simply not enough." He said many  presidents designate another person, usually the athletic director, to attend  the convention.  </P> <P> Unless the presidents recognize the need to participate actively in the NCAA,  "we're making a very serious mistake and our credibility will be very, very  poor," he said.  </P> <P> The letter also asked for support of a proposal to shorten the football and  basketball seasons.  </P> <P> "We genuinely believe that these are meaningful proposals, and that they  represent real steps toward reform," Whalen said in the letter. "They are not  the final answer, of course; but they are a good beginning, and they will be  adopted only if we have the support of our colleagues."  </P> <P> Whalen acknowledged that the presidents at many NCAA institutions have little  control over their athletics departments and some have grown used to the extra  revenue generated by the various programs. But, he insisted, "the president  must take responsibility for all aspects of that institution, including  athletics."  </P></p>

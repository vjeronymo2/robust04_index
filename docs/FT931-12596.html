			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: The oilman's land of opportunity - Existing exploration contracts cover only 17 per cent of Peru's 70m hectares of potential oil-bearing territory PERU REMAINS 'the great unexplored in the oil business,' says Mr Roger Alderson, general manager in Peru for Simon Petroleum Technology. 'No-one questions the technical possibilities of major finds here.' The country has more that 70m hectares of potentially oil-bearing territory but only 17 per cent of that is covered by existing exploration contracts. Since 1983, investment in oil exploration in Peru has been in almost continuous decline. Last year companies under contract with state-owned Petroperu invested a mere Dollars 43m in exploration, a tenth of the amount invested ten years earlier. Proven oil reserves have slumped to about 350m barrels, half of their 1982 level, and Petroperu estimates exploration investment should be at least Dollars 115m a year. But the situation, it is hoped, is about to change. The controversial return to democracy in Peru via congressional elections on 22 November could now pave the way for a long-awaited spurt of foreign investment. 'The April 5 coup didn't scare investors away,' says Mr Alderson, 'but it did slow things down. If Peru's democracy is now accepted as valid, we're away and flying. Peru has ten times the opportunities of Argentina, for example, and, historically it's no less stable or any worse a risk than either Argentina, Colombia or Bolivia.' For the past two years, SPT (formerly Robertson Research) has been working with Petroperu to boost foreign interest in Peruvian oil. Twice-yearly promotional tours have targeted oil operators, largely in the US, who are seeking fresh fields for expansion. A big factor in Peru's favour is recent legislation governing foreign investment in general and oil exploration in particular. 'The current law works,' says Mr Jaime Quijandria, president of Petroperu. 'We can prove we offer better conditions than Colombia, Argentina or Ecuador - and investors are coming.' One hiccup has been the delay in gaining final approval for contracts. But under new, streamlined procedures Petroperu has been able to reach speedy agreement with three US oil companies over exploration and development, but Peru's council of ministers has inexplicably been dragging its feet. One of these contracts is with Great Western Resources for exploration in the Peruvian jungle; another with Olympic of Denver, Colorado, in association with a Peruvian firm Petrolera San Juan for drilling in the northern coastal area of Piura; and the third, an exploration and production contract, with Texas-based Clayton Williams. The proposed joint venture with Clayton Williams, the ebullient Texan operator who once ran for governor of his home state, is Petroperu 's first  -and the first for an area already producing. Clayton Williams has an 80 per cent share and will bear the full Dollars 10m initial cost of drilling five wells. Petroperu's contribution will come in down the line when a further 40 wells are planned. Mr Quijandria is convinced that Peru must, as Colombia did, get its oil industry off the ground with a series of similar smallish contracts. 'The larger companies aren't risk-takers,' he says. 'They prefer the smaller fry to come in and do the donkey work - then they'll move in later.' There are only two big names operating locally at present, Mobil and Occidental Petroleum - and both have been in Peru for years. Occidental has increased its output by 20 per cent in the past few months since settlement of a long-running dispute with the previous Peruvian government. Mobil's hopes of striking it big in Peru's unexplored central jungle, meanwhile, have been dashed. The company boldly entered the central Huallaga, centre of the Peruvian illegal cocaine trade, two years ago. The camp was attacked by Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas in December 1990 and had to be almost completely rebuilt. Terrorism is not the reason for the pull-out, however. After investing about Dollars 32m in necessary infrastructure, the first well drilled was dry. 'At least we've learned there's no oil there at 9,000 ft down,' says a philosophical Mr Quijandria. 'But remember the Huallaga basin has never been drilled before - it would have been utopian to find oil first go.' Petroperu's promotional efforts focus on two Peruvian basins, the Ucayali and the Maranon. Both have basic transport infrastructure in place and are close to Peru's northern pipeline. Initial surveys show the jungle zone of Madre de Dios is also promising, but transport is more of a problem. The hurdle is getting the first investors interested. Petroperu is having to go it alone with development of the rich Chambira deposits, where oil was struck three years ago. Now that Dollars 30m in financing has been agreed with the Andean Development Corporation (CAF), Chambira should be producing 7,500 barrels a day within 12 months. 'This is a totally no-risk enterprise,' says Mr Quijandria. 'Yet we offered it for a year to the private sector and no-one was interested.' While the complex process of privatising Petroperu is taking time, senior company managers, perhaps surprisingly in a massive state-owned enterprise, are full of initiatives. In recent weeks, Petroperu has reached a 'maquila' (lease on idle capacity) agreement with trader Marc Rich to utilise 20,000 b/d of idle capacity at its La Pampilla refinery. Marc Rich will bring in Dollars 18m of crude every 45 days for refining. The refined products will be left for Petroperu to market locally, and the residual crude will be re-exported. Later, when domestic Peruvian prices are more internationally competitive, it is expected that Marc Rich will market in Peru under its own brand-name. Camisea, the vast gas and condensates field discovered by Royal Dutch Shell in the Peruvian jungle in the mid-1980s, remains the most exciting prospect. Shell is dragging its feet - but Peru's current, dramatic electricity shortage is injecting fresh urgency into the search for a solution. State-owned Electroperu is now contemplating construction of several gas-fired thermal plants near Camisea. Electricity could be shipped over the Andes by cable instead of building a gas pipe-line. 'It's a financing problem now,' says Mr Quijandria. 'I'm suggesting the government appoint an agent to get a consortium together for the Dollars 1.4bn needed to develop Camisea. Then we have to put pressure on Shell to say whether they'll agree to head it.'</p>

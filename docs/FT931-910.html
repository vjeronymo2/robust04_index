			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / UDM to ballot members on strike action THE Union of Democratic Mineworkers yesterday announced that it would ballot its 12,000 members next Friday over a 24-hour strike in protest at the government's white paper for the coal industry, Robert Taylor writes. The decision by the union's executive to hold a ballot represents a sharp move away from its moderate policy. It underlines feelings of outrage among some of the union officials at the proposals of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The officials believe the proposals have unfairly hit the union's Nottinghamshire stronghold. 'This is the first time we have ever gone down the path of industrial action,' Mr Neil Greatrex, UDM president, said yesterday. 'We have tried to save the coal industry by every proper and intelligent way and this has not worked. Striking was always seen as our last resort. But we need to show the rest of Britain just how we feel about what has happened.' Mr Greatrex said he felt let down by the government after spending the past four months trying to convince ministers and Conservative MPs not to close any of the 31 threatened pits. He had felt that in a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, he secured a clear understanding on what needed to be done. Mr Greatrex said the government had changed its position on which pits to save only late on Wednesday night, after he had been assured all the Nottinghamshire pits would be secure. 'I was told none of them would be mothballed but two of the five threatened (Nottinghamshire) collieries have been,' he said. 'The white paper is an absolute disgrace. It is just designed to get Mr Heseltine off the hook.' The union - founded in 1985 by miners who worked through the 1984-85 national coal strike - has worked with British Coal over the past eight years while pit productivity improvements were introduced. The UDM leaders believe their loyalty has been abused and they are in the mood to urge their members to take industrial action.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Arts: 'Carmen' smoulders on - Opera in Birmingham and Glasgow A bloodthirsty spectacle of high drama and passion has arrived in Birmingham. No - not the one in which twelve men in grey suits stab each other in the back for the sake of a concept that none can define. That was last week. This is the arena production of Bizet's Carmen, involving a huge company of performers (500 singers and dancers and ten horses, according to the press hand-out), which was first seen in London at Earl's Court in 1989. In Birmingham it is being played in the National Indoor Arena, where it opened on Wednesday after a postponement of a couple of days in order to allow the previous occupants, the world's media who had been attending the summit, to move out. At best, it is still a spectacular show. Without turning Carmen into an all-singing, all-dancing musical blockbuster, the production brings off some splendid coups de theatre. Escamillo arrives with a torch-lit procession of admirers. Gypsies descend from the roof on rope ladders. The parade of toreadors, arriving on horseback to the acclaim of the multitude, was just the grand and exciting climax it ought to be, but never usually is. In its original staging all these ideas were said to add up to a production that was well integrated and scorchingly alive. But in that case some of the burning Spanish midday heat has gone out of it. This revival in Birmingham needs a lot of tightening-up if the drama is to generate momentum. Scenes with the principals need to suggest early enough the passion smouldering below the surface. It was not until the final confrontation - a splendid scene with Don Jose stalking Carmen around the deserted bull-ring - that Wilhelmenia Fernandez and Jacques Trussel really set sparks off each other. As a soprano Carmen, Fernandez was attractive and sensual but lacking the darker side, the fatalism, the rawness of emotion; Trussel's singing sounded stretched. Cynthia Haymon was a lovely Micaela and Gregory Yurisich a proud, confident Escamillo. Prospective visitors should note that the casts are variously interchangeable. Amplification of the voices was excellent; the ensemble, though, seemed perilous. From my seat no less than 12 television sets were in view relaying the conductor's beat to the stage, but even that was not sufficient to keep singers and orchestra together across such a vast space - a pity, as Jacques Delacote was giving a real performance in the pit, enlivened with subtleties and insights in every corner. Nevertheless, like each of the arena opera productions seen so far, this one is a creditably serious attempt to present opera truthfully to the masses. The local audience would seem to have taken to the idea, as thousands flocked to the first night, leaving few empty seats. No doubt the people of Birpmingham are delighted that the city is now playing host to a show in which more than a government's reputation gets murdered at the end. Performances continue until October 27 (021-200 2222 and 021-633 3333)</p>

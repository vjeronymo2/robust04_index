			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow steadier with help of jobless data Wall Street AIDED BY some unexpectedly good economic news, US share prices held their ground yesterday following two days of heavy losses. Secondary markets were particularly strong, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.56 at 3,589.49. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 firmed 0.85 to 457.50, while the American SE composite put on 2.30 at 453.38 and the Nasdaq composite gained 6.98 at 737.71. New York SE volume totalled 258m shares. After the sharp declines on Tuesday and Wednesday, selling pressure in the markets appeared to have been exhausted. Sentiment was aided by some rare good news on the economy: weekly jobless claims fell 10,000 in the first week of September to 316,000, the lowest level seen since June 1989. Overseas news was also positive for stocks. The Bundesbank cut German interest rates, prompting similar rate reductions by other European central banks. Lower rates in Europe are viewed as bullish for US equities because they will stimulate growth in European economies and boost demand for US exports. Once again, investors ignored events in the bond market, where three days of big gains and rumours that congress was considering imposing a tax on foreign holdings of US government securities sparked off heavy profit-taking. By late afternoon the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue had risen to 5.957 per cent. Among individual sectors, bank stocks, which have returned to favour after a short period in the doldrums, were once again in demand on hopes of continued improvement in earnings. Chemical rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 43 1/8 , JP Morgan Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 77 5/8 , Citicorp Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 35 3/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 36 1/2 . UAL advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 142 3/8 on news of an improvement in August traffic figures. The day's most heavily traded stock was Hanson, which firmed Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 19 1/2 in volume of 41.3m as trading jumped ahead of today's dividend payout. Glaxo ADRs climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 19 1/2 on news of a 17 per cent improvement in fiscal 1993 earnings. On the Nasdaq market, leading technology stocks led the way higher, with Intel moving ahead Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 64 3/4 and Microsoft Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 76 1/4 . Canada TORONTO rebounded and retrieved the 4,000-point level in busy trading, after two days of steep declines. The TSE 300 index jumped 56.4 to close at 4,009.3 and rises led falls by 532 to 241 after volume of 62m shares. The golds sub-index rallied 3.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Amish drive horse and buggy through health insurance plan: Self-sufficient sect is exempted from Clinton scheme In the back rooms of Congress, a small and soft-spoken group has moved quietly to knock a small hole in President Bill Clinton's promise of universal guaranteed health insurance, winning itself an exemption from any US healthcare reform bill. The Amish, an Anabaptist sect which has tried to remain separate from the modern world and whose descendants continue to shun 20th-century conveniences such as cars and electricity, persuaded the House of Representatives ways and means committee to allow them to opt out of universal health coverage on religious grounds. Mutual help is a strong tradition among the Amish. When a member of the community loses his barn in a fire, the neighbours gather to build a new one  -a scene that became familiar to filmgoers in the thriller Witness, starring Harrison Ford, part of which is set in the Amish country of Pennsylvania. 'One of the most basic tenets is that they don't believe in public or private insurance because they believe that it breaks down the community,' says Mr Mark Weller, a spokesman for a coalition of businesses that employ Amish, which has led the effort to win the religious exemption. The Amish came to the US, in search of religious freedom, in the middle of the 18th century, and in a second wave in the early 19th century. About 130,000 now live in 22 states and in Canada, although the population is mostly concentrated in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana. In some areas, such as Pennsylvania's Lancaster, the black-clad Amish in their horse-drawn carriages have become a popular tourist attraction. While the core of the Amish tradition is farming, farmland is scarce and Amish families are often large, so many members now work outside their community. Many are employed in Indiana building the sort of motor-powered recreational vehicles and camper vans that their own customs would not allow them to drive. The exemption agreed by the ways and means committee, which is closely modelled on a similar exclusion from the social security pension system, would also cover the Mennonites, who have a similar religious objection to insurance. Advocates note, however, that it would not include religious groups who reject medical treatment of any kind. The Amish do, in fact, visit doctors, and have even been able to negotiate substantial discounts from hospitals because, when a member is ill, the community pays in cash and in advance. Few Amish take part in the political process, although they have won exemptions from social security, state unemployment insurance and hard-hat regulations, as well as from the requirement to send their children to school after the age of 14. The lobbying for the health insurance exemption was largely carried out by their employers - who stand to benefit if they can also win exemption from the obligation to pay the employer's premium envisaged in the Clinton reform plan.</p>

Aleksandr  Zvyagintsev, chief of the Russian General Prosecutor's Office  Information Center, announced in an interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA that we will have to await the results of investigations  being carried out by the Federal Counterintelligence Service,  the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Prosecutor's Office.    Aleksandr Grigoryevich noted that the press has nothing to  fear with regard to libel charges -- it has simply carried out  its professional duty. Those who circulated these false stories  prior to their publication in the press should bear the  responsibility.</p>

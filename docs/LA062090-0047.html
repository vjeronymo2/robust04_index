			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> THE HUMAN CARGO IN THE BACK OF TRUCKS  </P> <P> Travel anywhere in Southern California and you are likely to see children, and  adults too, riding in the back of pickup trucks. It's a way of life some  places. But researchers at UC Irvine's California College of Medicine, and  others like them around the country, have turned up some disturbing findings  about how unsafe such travel really can be for anyone, especially children.  </P> <P> For the past decade, the UCI researchers have looked at injuries to children  taken to 10 Orange County hospitals after falls out of the back of trucks. A  surprisingly high number of the injuries, some quite serious, occurred when  there was no crash at all; the truck had simply hit a bump, swerved or turned a  corner sharply. No wonder Dr. Phyllis Agran, an associate professor of  pediatrics at the school, says, "A kid traveling in the back of a pickup truck  is an unguided missile."  </P> <P> There's already a law on the books in California that hasn't done much to keep  youngsters from bumping their heads or sustaining more serious injury. It says  that children under 12 may not ride in the back unless a set of dubious  conditions are met -- for example, unless an adult is riding in the back too.  Even so, a chaperon won't be much good if a turn or crash renders him, like the  youngster, into another, but larger, missile.  </P> <P> The problem with designing legislation to protect children in pickups is  obvious. It's virtually impossible to legislate effectively against the appeal  or convenience of a truck, even when people are thoughtless enough to put a  child in the back of one on a freeway. And there are absurdities to the current  law: For example, dogs currently must be tethered, but their 13-year-old human  friends do not have to be restrained.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Eric Seastrand (R-Salinas), has introduced well-intentioned  legislation that has cleared the Assembly and awaits action in the Senate. It's  a dramatic solution: simply prohibit anyone, regardless of age, from riding in  the back of a pickup or flatbed truck. Yet, while new legislation might close  loopholes, it would present the same old problem. That is, how to mandate good  judgment so widely abandoned?  </P> <P> Adults have some latitude to make their own risky calls, a privilege many  exercise in taking a chance in the back of a pickup. But children, for whom  adults ought to be making safe and sane decisions, are another story. Those  under 12 already are covered by a law that doesn't seem to work. So there's  really only one place for everyone to go from there -- that's up to the front  of the truck, by choice.  </P></p>

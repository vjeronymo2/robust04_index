			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 11 FEARED DEAD IN AUSTRIAN CRASH  </P> <P> A plane carrying 11 people, including a government minister, crashed into a  lake today near the Swiss border, and all aboard were presumed dead, officials  said.  </P> <P> The plane, a nine-seat Aerocommander AC-90 from Austria's Rheinthalflug  airline, was preparing to land at Altenrhein just over the border when it went  down, said airline spokeswoman Renatte Moser. "We have to fear that there are  dead," she told the Associated Press. Moser said the nine passengers included  Austria's social affairs minister, Alfred Dallinger, 62. There were two crew  members on board. A previously unknown group calling itself the Austrian  People's Army claimed responsibility for the crash in a telephone call to the  West German news agency DPA. The Austria Press Agency said police were  investigating the call. The caller did not say why the group would want to  bring down the plane.  </P></p>

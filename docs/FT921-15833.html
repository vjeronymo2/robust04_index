			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Whessoe calls for Pounds 8m to help finance US purchase WHESSOE is making a Dollars 21m (Pounds 11.2m) acquisition in the US and raising Pounds 8.1m in a rights issue to help pay for it. The engineering and pipework group said it needed the 1-for-4 issue, priced at 185p, even though it had more than Pounds 10m in the bank last month. Mr Chris Fleetwood, chief executive, said part of its cash was advance payments from customers and so not free. The group also needed the capacity to meet bonding requirements on large contracts. Whessoe's recent expansion, including acquisitions in Italy and the US, could push up its turnover to between Pounds 80m and Pounds 90m this year, compared with Pounds 57.9m in the year to September. This would considerably increase working capital demands. The purchase announced yesterday is of Varec, a California-based maker and distributor of tank gauges and vapour control products. It is being bought from Rosemount, part of Emerson Electric. Mr Fleetwood said the deal continued the policy of reducing Whessoe's dependence on the UK power industry. Varec would become part of the instrumentation and control division, which last year contributed just over a quarter of group turnover. Piping systems accounted for more than half, with the rest in project engineering. The group has so far proved resilient to the UK recession, pushing up pre-tax profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 7.4m last year. Mr Fleetwood said it was helped by the 60 per cent of sales that lay overseas, by long-term contracts and by its cash holdings. The rights issue price of 185p compares with yesterday's close of 226p, down 8p after the announcement. The underwriters are Schroders and Hoare Govett are the brokers.</p>

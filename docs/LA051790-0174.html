			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH EL MONTE;  </P> <P> MAYOR, 3 COUNCILMEN SUED  </P> <P> A group of dissidents who say the city's Redevelopment Agency is wasting  taxpayers' money served Mayor Stan Quintana and Councilmen Jim Kelly, Art Olmos  and Albert Perez with a legal action during last week's City Council meeting.  </P> <P> During the segment of the meeting in which residents are allowed to address the  council, Christopher Sutton, lawyer for Citizen Advocates of South El Monte,  walked to the podium and handed the papers to the four councilmen.  </P> <P> "Gentlemen, consider yourselves served," Sutton said. Only newly elected  Councilman Raul Pardo was excluded.  </P> <P> The dissidents, who are South El Monte residents, business people and property  owners, are challenging the designation of two redevelopment plans. Business  Improvement District Projects 1 and 2, as the projects are called, cover 239  acres in six widely scattered parts of the city. They were adopted by the City  Council, whose members serve as the redevelopment agency's board, in 1988 and  1989.  </P> <P> The complaint calls the two plans irrational and invalid and holds that  implementing them would squander city revenues. The city officials named in the  suit declined comment on the advice of counsel.  </P> <P> Trial in the suit is set for July 31 in Los Angeles Superior Court.  </P></p>

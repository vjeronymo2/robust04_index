			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / World Bank warns on MFN Any US move to strip China of its Most Favoured Nation trading status, due to human rights concerns, could have 'disastrous' consequences for both nations, a World Bank study warned. It said Chinese exports to the US could be cut by 42-96 per cent if President Bill Clinton decided not to renew MFN status for China in June. American consumers could also pay Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9.5bn) a year more for costlier substitutes for Chinese products. Mr Clinton last year demanded significant progress from China on human rights as a condition for renewing trade benefits this year.</p>

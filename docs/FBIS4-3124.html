			<p>BFN     [Text] On the afternoon of 4 April, the provincial party  committee held a provincial meeting on democratic recommendation  of excellent young cadres. At the meeting, principal leading  cadres and veteran comrades in all fields of the province were  urged to extensively recommend suitable persons for reserve  cadres at the provincial and city (departmental) levels based on  the demands of the province's economic construction and the  building of leading bodies. Through democratic recommendation,  the field of vision and the channels to appreciate the cadres'  capabilities were expanded and a number of young cadres were  discovered, thus providing organizational preparations for the  readjustment of leading bodies at all levels and for the shift  of terms of the provincial party committee and party committees  of various cities next year.    Attending the meeting were leading comrades of the  provincial  party committee and other provincial-level leading bodies; some  former veteran comrades of the provincial level; principal  responsible comrades of various departments and commissions  under the provincial party committee; secretaries of the leading  party groups and party committees of various provincial-level  units, the provincial higher people's court, the provincial  people's procuratorate, various people's groups, and various  central units stationed in Shenyang; chairmen of various  democratic parties and industrial and commercial federations;  secretaries of party committees of various cities; deputy  secretaries in charge of organizational work and directors of  organizational departments under various city party committees;  cadres and personnel section heads of various provincial-level  units, about 500 persons in total.    Wang Huaiyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, presided over the meeting. He said: This meeting is  an important one held by the provincial party committee to adopt  feasible measures to replace old cadres with new ones, to  further perfect the structure of leading bodies, to make leading  bodies more vigorous, to strengthen the construction of leading  bodies, and to ensure and promote the development of economic  construction and all other undertakings. The current democratic  recommendation was conducted in the form of being mobilized by  the provincial party committee in a unified manner, being  arranged by various localities and departments, respectively,  being recommended by oneself, and being concentratively  estimated by the organizational department of the provincial  party committee.    Yu Junbo, standing committee member and director of the  organizational department of the provincial party committee,  made specific explanations of the work of how to democratically  recommend excellent young cadres.    Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee,  delivered an important speech at the meeting.    Gu Jinchi said: In the new historical period, we should  carry out three projects: 1) Winning the hardest battle of again  pushing the economy on the new stage; 2) establishing the  socialist market economic structure; and 3) successfully  building leading bodies at all levels. These three projects are  closely connected with one another. Of them, the project of  successfully building leading bodies constitutes an important  guarantee for accomplishing the first two projects. In building  leading bodies, an urgent and conspicuous task at the moment is  to vigorously select and train young cadres.    On how to examine and evaluate young cadres, Gu Jinchi said:  In evaluating young cadres, we should persist in seeing innate  character, main trend, practical achievements, and development  potential. In seeing the innate character, we should primarily  see whether young cadres have a correct outlook on the world and  on life, are wholeheartedly serving the people, and have a  strong sense of dedication and responsibility for developing the  socialist productive forces, for enhancing China's comprehensive  strength, and for improving the people's living standards. By  the main trend, we mean making an all-round, objective, and  dialectical analysis of strong and weak points of young cadres  and then having a good command of their major factors. By  practical performances, we mean judging whether young cadres are  working in a down-to-earth manner and quietly immersing  themselves in hard work or are merely paying lip service and  pursuing personal fame and gain, and whether young cadres are  working hard for the present, giving consideration to the  long-term interest, and laying solid foundation or are eager for  quick success and instant benefit. At the moment, in evaluating  the performances of young cadres, we should pay special  attention to their style of work and see whether they are  realistic and practical in work, whether they can find out the  real situation, tell the truth, strive for practical results,  and are as good as their words. By development, we mean the  development potential of young cadres. Generally speaking, young  cadres lack experience in leadership and are poor at handling  complicated contradictions, but they have the potential for  continued development as decided by the foundation of their  quality. So long as we bravely promote those excellent young  cadres with great potential to leading posts and let them work  at their posts, they will be adapt to their work rapidly.    Gu Jinchi stressed: In the current democratic  recommendation, we must emancipate the mind, broaden the field  of vision, and seek suitable persons from an even wider scope.  We should emphatically search talents from the first line of  reform, opening up, and economic construction. We should select  talents not only among leading organs but also grass-roots  units, the county (city) and district leading posts in  particular. We should select talents not only among large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises, institutions of higher  learning, and scientific research institutes but also among the  cadres emerging in all sorts of new economic organizations. We  should select talents not only among our own localities,  departments, and fronts but also positively recommend excellent  talents of other localities and units, in particular the talents  of the localities and units advanced in building two  civilizations.    Gu Jinchi called on party committees at all levels to  strengthen leadership, pay attention to selecting and training  young cadres, and actually list this work as an item of their  daily agenda.</p>

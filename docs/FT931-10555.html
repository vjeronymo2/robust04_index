			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / AEEU hopeful on single-union deals THE number of single-union agreements will increase if the electricians' wing of the Amalagmated Engineering and Electrical Union rejoins the Trades Union Congress in the autumn, according to AEEU leaders. The leadership today launches its campaign to convince the union's 600,000 members to vote in favour of rejoining the TUC. A postal ballot will be held next month. Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the electricians' section, says that returning to the TUC after being expelled for defying rules five years ago will provide 'great opportunities to negotiate more single-union agreements'. His union was at the forefront of the trend to single-union agreements that peaked in the late 1980s. In forthcoming research to be published in the Industrial Relations Journal, Mr Gregor Gall, a research student at Manchester School of Management, says the old EETPU signed 66 of the 194 single-union deals he has found, followed by the engineering union with a further 57 of them. Mr Gall points out that 93 of the total deals were made between 1986 and 1989 with the largest number of 37 achieved in 1988. Only 14 more have been signed since 1990. He argues that the sharp decline in such agreements after 1990 was mainly due to the recession and fall in new overseas investment, particularly by Japanese companies who were at the forefront of the earlier single-union deal wave. But he argues an important secondary cause for the drop in interest in them over the past four years stemmed from employer concern that signing new style deals solely with the EETPU would destabilise their industrial relations once the union was outside the TUC. In a survey of 37 single-union agreements just published by Industrial Relations Services it was found management favoured such deals because it ensured they could achieve 'high levels of flexibility in the use of labour'. As many as 73 per cent of the companies surveyed said they had introduced team-working as a result of having single-union agreements while 65 per cent had 'adopted multi-skilling, where employees are required to undertake a wide range of tasks without demarcation of any kind'. Just over half reported they had introduced just-in-time production methods and 62 per cent they operated total quality control. The research also found that single-union deals brought single status for workers in three quarters of the agreements, breaking down the old blue and white-collar worker distinctions in terms and conditions of employment. Joint consultation committees are also a feature of most single-union deals.</p>

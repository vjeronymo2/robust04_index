			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP) -- Germany's Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel has launched a German initiative aimed at combating the  threatened proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A  10-point paper published today by the Foreign Ministry in Bonn  calls on all those states which have not yet signed the nuclear  nonproliferation treaty or conventions on biological and  chemical weapons to do so without delay. In addition, the  treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons should be  extended indefinitely from 1995.    The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe should  be augmented to become a model for the regional nonproliferation  of nuclear weapons which could also serve as a model for other  regions. In addition, the German initiative envisages  international cooperation in the area of export controls. The  Foreign Ministry also urges greater support, including financial  aid, for disarmament programs in the CIS.    Plutonium coming into circulation as a consequence of  disarmament should in the future be monitored by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The United Nations  should compile a nuclear weapons register to create a better  overview of the number of nuclear weapons in existence. The  German Government also reaffirmed its call for a worldwide and  comprehensive agreement against nuclear testing.    The Foreign Ministry paper also points out that in a basic  resolution the UN Security Council described the proliferation  of weapons of mass destruction as a threat to international  security and peace. This gives the Security Council scope to  impose the appropriate coercive measures.</p>

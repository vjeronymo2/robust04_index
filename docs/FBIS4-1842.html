			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of Work Report of the Shanghai Municipal </F> People's Procuratorate, submitted by Ni Hongfu, chief procurator  of the Shanghai People's Procuratorate, to the Second Session of  the 10th Shanghai Municipal People's Congress in Shanghai on 21  February]    [Text] In 1993, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, focusing on  the central task of economic construction, and following the  policy of "grasping two links at the same time, attaching equal  importance to both," procuratorial organs in Shanghai actively  implemented the party Central Committee's plan on combating  corruption and the Supreme People's Procuratorate's instructions  on strictly enforcing the law and vigorously investigating  cases. They earnestly fulfilled their responsibility of legal  supervision; fully exercised their procuratorial functions of  investigation, arrest, and prosecution; relentlessly cracked  down on embezzlement, bribery, and other types of economic  crimes; dealt heavy blows to serious criminal offenses;  strengthened the fight against infringement of people's rights  and dereliction of duty; and stepped up law enforcement. As a  result, new progress was made in procuratorial work and in  building the ranks of procurators.  <H5>  1. Resolutely Cracking Down on Embezzlement, Bribery, and </H5> Economic Crimes and Promoting In-Depth Progress of the  Anti-Corruption Struggle    During the past year, relying heavily on party and  government  organizations at all levels and on the broad masses of people,  procuratorial organs in the municipality successfully deepened  their struggle against embezzlement and bribery. A total of  1,189 cases of embezzlement, bribery, and other economic crimes  were uncovered last year. Of the total, 935 were major and  important cases, an increase of 69.7 percent. The total amount  of money involved in all the cases reached 253 million yuan, 4.3  times the amount in the previous year. Some 92.09 million yuan  of illicit money and goods were recovered, and some 89.77  million yuan of economic losses were avoided, representing an  increase of 200 percent and 230 percent, respectively, over the  previous year.    Last year's struggle against corruption had the following  major characteristics:    First, the masses became more and more enthusiastic about  informing on crimes. Taking advantage of the good  opportunities, procuratorial organs at all levels strengthened  the work of informing on crimes by actively carrying out  propaganda work to mobilize the masses. A total of 11,544 cases  were reported by the masses, of which 2,730 were reported in the  first half of 1993, averaging 455 cases a month; 8,814 were  reported in the second half, averaging 1,469 cases a month, and  3.2 times that of the first half of the year. Cases of  embezzlement and bribery cracked by procuratorial organs based  on information provided by units and the masses accounted for 60  percent of the total number of cases on file, a percentage  higher than the previous year.    Second, the number of major and important embezzlement and  bribery cases notably increased. For the whole year,  procuratorial organs cracked 900 major cases -- cases involving  bribery of more than 10,000 yuan and embezzlement of more than  50,000 yuan -- and 35 important cases -- cases involving cadres  at the departmental level. Major cases accounted for 78.6  percent of the total number of cases on file, an increase of  27.7 percent. Of this number, 280 were mammoth cases involving  more than 50,000 yuan in bribes and more than 100,000 yuan of  embezzled funds, an increase of 300 times that of the previous  year. Three of the mammoth cases involved bribery from 500,000  yuan to 1 million yuan; seven involved bribery of more than 1  million; and five involved embezzlement of more than 10 million  yuan.    Third, a number of cases were uncovered inside party and  government organs, and judicial, administrative law enforcement,  and economic management departments. The number of such cases  on file reached 143 for the year, accounting for 12 percent of  the total number of cases on file. Of the 143 cases, seven  involved party and government organs, nine involved judicial  departments, 40 involved administrative law enforcement  departments, and 87 involved economic management departments.  After review, it was decided to arrest 75 people. Using his  position in charge of urban construction, real estate  management, and housing construction, Zhu Wenqing, Luwan  District's former deputy head, accepted 140,000 yuan in bribes  in the course of approving joint land development projects and  in connection with commercial housing purchases by units inside  and outside Shanghai. His case topped the list of uncovered  crimes committed by Shanghai's bureau-level cadres in terms of  the amount of money involved. Although people committing such  crimes accounted for only a very small percentage of state  functionaries, they seriously damaged party and government  images, disrupted the normal work order of state organs, and  seriously endangered society. Seriously investigating and  sternly handling such cases are very important to promoting the  building of clean and honest government and forging closer ties  between the party and government and the masses of people.    Fourth, we investigated a number of embezzlement and  bribery cases in some fast-growing economic sectors. In the  process of establishing a socialist market economic structure,  Shanghai's markets of such production factors as banking,  stocks, foreign exchange, and housing and real estate have  developed rapidly. In order to ensure normal operations and  healthy development of these markets, procuratorial organs  earnestly investigated and handled in good time economic crimes  of embezzlement and bribery in these sectors. Last year, they  uncovered 87 cases involving 59.91 million yuan in banking and  stock departments; 67 cases involving 15 million yuan in foreign  exchange regulation markets; and 54 cases involving 5.97 million  yuan in housing and real estate markets. Timely efforts to  crack down on economic crimes and to stop them from spreading in  these sectors was conducive to improving Shanghai's investment  environment, protecting and expanding the fruits of reform and  opening up, and establishing a sound socialist market economic  structure.    Fifth, we pursued and captured a number of perverse  criminals  who absconded with big sums of money. Last year, we arrested 21  criminals on the wanted list who absconded with a total of 18.34  million yuan.    Sixth, we stepped up investigation and prosecution of  embezzlement and bribery cases. Throughout the year, we  indicted in courts a total of 614 economic cases involving 680  criminals. Of these, 487 were major and serious cases,  accounting for 70.6 percent of the total. Especially since last  August, in conjunction with the central and municipal party  committees' strategic arrangements for the anticorruption drive,  we concentrated efforts to indict, in four groups, 262 serious  embezzlement and bribery criminals involving 46.98 million yuan.  Through publicity by the mass media, we kept the masses and  various quarters of society informed of the results of  anticorruption work, thereby expanding the social effects of the  anticorruption drive.    Seventh, we strengthened the prevention of criminal offenses  in embezzlement and bribery. We established and perfected  special bodies for preventing embezzlement and bribery, and set  up 38 grass-roots preventive networks of all kinds. Based on  investigations of some 40 major cases, we made proposals for  supervision, and urged and assisted the relevant departments to  plug loopholes, and enforce preventive measures.  <H5>  2. Striking Severely at Serious Criminal Offenders To </H5> Maintain Public Order and Social Stability    In the past year, procuratorial organs at all levels in  Shanghai closely coordinated with judicial and public security  departments in launching preemptive strikes at, and swiftly and  harshly punishing serious criminal offenders for murder,  robbery, rape, explosion, and theft and robbery of guns; and  criminal gangs of the nature of underground societies. Last  year we handled a total of 12,302 criminal suspects whom public  security organs had requested approval for their arrest. Of  these, we completed investigations on 11,597, and approved the  arrest of 10,897, including 4,437, or 40.7 percent of the total,  on wanted lists. We also handled a total of 11,580 suspects  forwarded by public security organs for investigation and  prosecution; of these, we completed investigations of 10,957,  and prosecuted 10,245. We actively cooperated with judicial and  public security departments in launching special campaigns to  tackle such social maladies as taxi robbery, unlawful growing of  poppies, destruction of telecommunications equipment, and  prostitution, which were rather serious during a given period of  time. Under the municipality's unified arrangements, we took  part in concerted campaigns to crack down on theft, train  robbery, criminals on the run, and pornography, approving the  arrest of 6,841 suspects, and prosecuting 832 cases involving  1,265 suspects. All of this had a positive impact on deterring  crimes and maintaining public order and social stability.  Procuratorates at various levels seriously implemented the  guidelines of the party Central Committee and the NPC Standing  Committee's "Decision on Strengthening the Comprehensive  Management of Public Security," and further strengthened  procuratorial work related to comprehensive management of public  security. Over the past year, procuratorates at various levels  used legal cases to publicize the legal system more than 300  times. In light of loopholes in the management of public  security and prevention of crimes, those organizations put  forward 419 suggestions. According to special characteristics  of crimes committed by juveniles, procuratorates at various  levels adopted effective measures to improve work, and increase  results in handling those cases. They formulated rules for  supervising and controlling reform activities for juveniles; and  strengthened education and helped juvenile law offenders change  their behavior by persuasion. They revisited 1,400 people who  were exempted from prosecution, and inspected the situation of  more than 3,900 people whose sentences were executed outside  prison. Various procuratorates supervised the work of helping  those people improve themselves. They unfolded activities of  "joint construction of civilized units" with enterprises and  other business undertakings by providing legal consultations,  and urging them to administer in accordance with the law. In  coordination with concerned departments, various procuratorates  laid stress on improving the situation of some places and units  with conspicuous problems of public security, and worked hard to  ensure social stability and reduce crimes.  <H5>  3. Seriously Investigate and Handle Cases of "Violation of </H5> Lawful Rights" and Crime of Dereliction of Duty To Protect  Citizen's Lawful Rights and Benefits and the Normal Operation of  State Organs    Over the past year, procuratorates in the municipality  handled 645 cases of "violation of lawful rights" and  dereliction of duty, and filed 279 cases for investigation, an  increase of 64.1 percent compared with the previous year, and  recovered 9.38 million yuan's economic losses for the state and  collectives. Among those cases filed for investigation, the  five major categories of self-seeking misconduct, using torture  to coerce statements, unlawful detention, dereliction of duty  and responsibility for major accidents increased by 63.3 percent  compared with the previous year. Of these, 25 cases were  "hostage type" unlawful detentions, eight cases were dereliction  of duty by financial workers, six cases were crimes committed by  public security cadres and policemen to seek self-interest by  misconduct and to coerce confessions by using torture, and 94  cases were related to responsibility for major accidents. In  investigating various cases, procuratorates paid attention to  using legal cases to publicize the legal system. This has  enhanced citizens' consciousness of law and self-protection, and  played a positive role in improving public security and  preventing crimes.  <H5>  4. Actively Investigate and Handle Crimes of Evading Tax and </H5> Resisting the Payment of Tax and Imitating Trade Marks To  Protect State Tax Income and Economic Order on the Market    Over the past year, procuratorates in the municipality  further strengthened their work of cracking down on crimes of  tax evasion, and resisting the payment of tax, and imitating  trade marks. Over the past year, various procuratorates  investigated and handled 473 cases of tax evasion and resisting  payment of tax, and recovered 20.86 million yuan for the state.  First, various procuratorates attached importance to handling  major cases. Over the past year, they discovered 50 especially  serious cases of tax evasion each involving an amount of more  than 100,000 yuan, an increase of 72.4 percent compared with the  previous year. The biggest personal tax evasion case involved  2.27 million yuan of tax money. Second, various procuratorates  firmly investigated and handled tax evasion by legal persons.  They handled 14 such cases in the past year, or 470 percent  more than in the previous year. Third, various procuratorates  struggled against specific crimes in light of special  characteristics of different trades. They publicized education  on the tax law 63 times while investigating cases of tax fraud.  Meanwhile, they helped concerned units establish and improve  operational and tax management systems. Fourth, various  procuratorates worked in coordination with taxation  organizations to improve tax collection. They ordered some  "stubborn" units to pay taxes and fines for delaying payment.  Procuratorates at various levels strengthened their efforts to  "crack down on fake and shoddy products." They stressed  handling major and serious cases of imitating trade marks, and  producing and selling fake and shoddy products, which involve  large volumes and have a very bad impact on society. They also  seriously investigated and handled criminal groups which  manufactured and sold fake and shoddy commodities. Over the past  year, they filed 80 cases of imitating trade marks, an increase  of 60 percent compared with the previous year. Of these, 48  were serious cases, accounting for 60 percent of cases. The  total amount of illegal operations reached more than 29 million  yuan. They cracked down on and destroyed 56 "criminal nests"  which manufactured fake commodities. Cases of imitating trade  marks discovered by procuratorates involved 20 categories and 39  kinds of commodities, including automobiles, auto parts,  household appliances, bicycles, medicine, beverages, and medical  apparatus. Investigating and cracking down on those cases played  a positive role in protecting consumers' lawful rights, and  maintaining economic order in the market.  <H5>  5. Strengthening Law Enforcement Supervision, Vigorously </H5> Launching Inspection of Investigation and Trial Activities and  Law-Enforcement Activities of Prisons, Detention Centers, and  Reeducation-Through-Labor Camps    During the past year, procuratorial organs paid closer  attention to law-enforcement supervision. First, they  strengthened supervision over investigation and trial work.  They arrested and prosecuted 182 criminals who had slipped  through the net, turned down 776 cases for further investigation  on the ground of insufficient evidence, and gave verbal or  written comments to public security organs and courts on 88  cases rectifying violations of law. They also decided not to  approve the arrests of a total of 700 people and not to  prosecute 14 others on the grounds that their actions did not  constitute crimes, or because there was no need to hold them for  criminal responsibility. In addition, they protested court  judgment on 22 cases on the grounds that the judgment was  inappropriate. Second, they strengthened inspection of prisons  and detention centers. They gave their views on 391 cases of  violation of law by prisons, detention centers, and  reeducation-through-labor camps [jian guan gai zhao chang suo  4148 4619 2395 6644 1034 2076]. They organized special task  forces to conduct special investigation into law-enforcement  activities and prominent problems in enforcing criminal verdicts  and judgments. They presented views to rectify action on a  timely basis, and pressed law-enforcement departments to  strictly enforce the law and conduct business in accordance with  the law. Third, they vigorously conducted inspection into civil  action and administrative cases. During the year, they set up  files on 88 civil action and administrative cases following the  parties's appeal, protested verdicts and judgments on six cases  which appeared inappropriate, and presented views to rectify  mistakes on eight cases. Fourth, they made earnest efforts to  investigate charges and appeals. They accepted 29 appeals over  verdicts and judgment on criminal cases, and presented views to  courts in six cases to rectify mistakes. In addition, they  accepted appeals over 111 non-prosecution decisions and reversed  decisions on 29 cases out of 61 concluded cases. Fifth, they  strengthened internal checkups in case handling work. They  improved the system of separating arrest from prosecution, and  strengthened checkups on cases investigated by procuratorial  organs themselves. Following the review process, they decided  not to arrest a total of 45 people after the cases were  investigated and forwarded to them by their own criminal  departments. They also issued orders to arrest and prosecute  seven suspects after the criminal departments decided not to  arrest and prosecute them.  <H5>  6. Strengthening the Ranks of Procurators and Promoting </H5> Efficiency and Integrity Among Procuratorial Organs    A contingent of procurators who are politically conscious,  professionally competent, highly disciplined, and superior in  workstyle serves as an important organizational safeguard to the  fulfillment of procuratorial organs' responsibilities in  supervising law enforcement. Over the past year, upholding the  policy of "strictly managing procuratorial personnel and  operating procuratorial offices in accordance with the law,"  procuratorial organs simultaneously attended to procuratorial  work and the building of procuratorial ranks, and worked hard to  push the work of building a procuratorial contingent to a new  stage.    Procuratorial organs strengthened education in political  theory and persisted in using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm  procuratorial officers and men. They regarded using Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory to arm procuratorial officers and men as  the central link of their ideological-political work and the  paramount task of education in political theory. They worked  hard to raise procuratorial personnel's political integrity and  theoretical standards so that they would be more conscientious  and determined in implementing the party's basic line.    They took further steps to promote spiritual civilization,  beginning with building civilized units. They launched  emulation activities in a down-to-earth manner and deep-going  way to inspire vast numbers of officers and men to make  progress, take the overall situation into consideration, fight  with an indomitable spirit, and make selfless dedication.  During the year, the municipal procuratorial system selected 85  advanced collectives and 115 individuals for performing  meritorious services. In addition, 30 collectives and 42  individuals received commendations. Four collectives and four  individuals received commendation and awards from the Higher  People's Procuratorate while 18 of the 20 district and county  procuratorial offices were commended as "civilized units."  Among them, Zhabei district procuratorial office and a branch  of the municipal procuratorate were commended as municipal-  level "civilized units."    Study on reforming the cadre personnel management system  has been actively carried out with a responsibility goal-setting  system being adopted in procuratorates at the municipal,  district, and county levels, under which scientific management  was introduced to enhance work efficiency. Eleven  procuratorates at district and county levels experimented with  the system of "exchanging, waiting for, and experimenting with  duty points." Some district and county procuratorates even  studied such things as the "chief investigator's responsibility  system" and the "system of accounting for wrongly investigated  cases."    Work on promoting clean administration among officers and  men  has been intensified. While following arrangements made and  meeting demands put forward by the central authorities, the  municipal party committee, and the Supreme People's  Procuratorate, and taking into consideration the reality of  procuratorial work, procuratorial organs at various levels in  the municipality held meetings on democratic life, and appraisal  meetings for office level and above, during which officers and  men would seriously screen their own actions against relevant  central stipulations and make necessary self correction. The  municipal procuratorate has formulated and promulgated the "Code  of Clean Administration for Police Officers and Men of the  Shanghai Municipal Procuratorate;" republished telephone numbers  on clean administration supervision, enhanced clean  administration awareness among officers and men; and conducted  massive inspections on law and discipline enforcement where  wrongdoers would be seriously dealt with.  <H5>  Voluntarily Submit to Leadership of the Party Committee; </H5> Accept Supervision of the People's Congresses    In performing our duties, we persisted in making timely  reports to the party committees on serious conditions and major  cases, and sought their support and guidance. We have been  conscientiously implementing the "Regulations on Judicial Work  Supervision" adopted by the Standing Committee of the municipal  people's congress and adhered to the system of submitting work  reports to the people's congresses and their standing  committees. We have been seriously handling cases handed over  or assigned by the people's congresses and their standing  committees, and relevant motions and proposals put forward, and  criticisms made by the people's deputies with prompt replies on  their outcomes. We took the initiative to invite the people's  deputies and members of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference to inspect the procuratorates and  conscientiously heard their appraisals and opinions on  effectively improving work and enhancing the law-enforcement  level.    The major tasks for Shanghai's procuratorates this year will  be: To persist in being guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  on establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics, and  conscientiously implement the guidelines set by both the Third  Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Second Plenum  of the Sixth Shanghai Municipal Party Committee; to unshakenly  uphold the party's basic line of "one center and two basic  points;" to unswervingly implement the guiding principle of  making procuratorial work serve economic construction; to uphold  the principle of "being firm in attending to both material  progress, and cultural and ideological progress;" to strengthen  the functions of law supervision through stricter  law-enforcement and thorough investigations into all cases; to  persist in waging struggle against corruption and bribery; to  severely crack down on serious criminal activities; to  conscientiously investigate cases involving "infringement of  rights" and dereliction of duty; to conduct inspections on all  fronts to preserve political and social stability and protect  the on-going reform, opening up, and economic construction; and  to make new efforts to promote the establishment and perfection  of a socialist market economic system.</p>

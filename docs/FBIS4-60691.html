			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 May (MENA) -- Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas,  former Yemeni prime minister and 'Ali Salim al-Bid's envoy, left  Cairo this evening after a one-day visit to Egypt.    In a news conference held before he left, he paid tribute to  President Husni Mubarak's efforts to end the fighting in Yemen.  Mubarak's mediation is needed more now than ever before to save  the Yemeni people from successive disasters, al-'Attas said. He  stressed that the Yemeni people feel proud of and grateful to  Egypt's president, government, and people. He praised the role  played by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to restore  peace in Yemen.    He said the recently formed government in Aden stresses its  desire to stop the Yemeni war without any conditions and is  willing for a direct dialogue with the northerners to find  serious solutions to the crisis, ones that will take the  interests of the people into consideration. The dialogue should  be based on equality and frankness, and the north should not  express any reservations about the participants, he said.    Al-'Attas blamed Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and  the General People's Congress for aborting Yemeni unity. The  dismissal of southern ministers and ambassadors means  separation, and so does imposing unity by occupation, he said.    Al-'Attas accused Sanaa of going back on the Pledge and  Accord Document, which he said "enjoyed the support of all the  Yemeni people." He said President Salih declared war against  the Yemeni nation, took away freedoms, and exceeded his  constitutional powers when he declared emergency rule and  unilaterally abrogated all the minutes that preceded the  proclamation of unity between the two parts of Yemen.    He said the detention of a number of nationalists and the  disappearance of known political leaders like 'Abd-al-Quddus  al-Midwahi, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mu'min, 'Abd-al-Habib Salim, and  'Ali Salih 'Ayyad strengthens the conviction that the authority  in Sanaa is canceling its constitutional legitimacy.    Mr. al-'Attas said Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's  decision to storm and loot homes of the leaders of the Yemeni  Socialist Party and other parties and to use those leaders as  human shields to protect his palace and his tribe from air raids  indicates that his acts, including the war decision, were  illegitimate.    He said Yemen today is being subjected to a crushing war  imposed by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the elements allied with  him, with military and financial support from Iraq and Sudan, to  implement a joint scheme that Aden is determined to confront and  foil.    Asked about the possibility of restoring Yemeni unity if the  battles stop, al-'Attas said in his news conference that such an  action will not take the form of merger unity as in 1990. He  explained that many issues need to be discussed before the  restoration of unity, such as relations with Yemen and relations  with Arab countries.    Asked about the international efforts being made to arrange  a  cease-fire in Yemen, al-'Attas said that during his recent visit  to Washington he sensed a sincere international desire led by  the United States and the Arab countries to end the fighting.  He blessed these efforts and noted Egypt's decision in the  early sixties not to go to war against Syria when the latter  decided to secede from the United Arab Republic.    Al-'Attas ruled out the fall of Aden at the hands of the  northern Yemeni forces. He stressed that Aden is a strong front  that is difficult to occupy. If the aggression against Aden  continues for long, he said, then "we will be compelled to  request assistance from the fraternal countries."    Al-'Attas said that irrespective of the results of the  current battle in Yemen, it cannot determine the future of the  country. He admitted that the northern forces made some gains  and occupied some regions, but he described the military  statements issued by Sanaa as exaggerated.    He stressed that Sanaa supports extremists and  fundamentalists to use them for political assassinations in  Yemen. He pointed out that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has not yet  signed a draft law on education because the Yemeni Reform  Grouping, which is a religious party, is opposing it.    Al-'Attas explained that the recently proclaimed Democratic  Republic of Yemen in the south was meant to stop the bloodshed  and to prevent Yemen from disintegrating into many mini-states.  He said the new state does not need de jure international  recognition. He said the government of this republic pledges to  work with all national forces to strengthen the foundations of  security and stability and to hold municipal elections within  one year. It also commits itself to implementing all provisions  of the Pledge and Accord Document.    Al-'Attas said this republic is eager to establish strong  relations with the Arabian Peninsula countries and with Egypt  and Syria, and is now working to restore its right to membership  in the Arab League, the Islamic Conference Organization, and the  United Nations.</p>

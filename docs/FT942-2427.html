			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Madrid acts to reassure business Spain will not deviate from its current economic policies, despite the defeat suffered by the ruling Socialist party in last week's European elections, according to economy minister Pedro Solbes. He told an audience of businessmen in Catalonia at the weekend that this would mean tight national budgets for the next three years. Cutting the public sector deficit was essential to enable the country to grow and create jobs on a permanent basis, he said. His comments, aimed at reassuring business in an unsettled political climate, followed pressure from hardline sectors of the Socialist party to move towards the left and seek a rapprochement with the Communist-led United Left party. The Socialists need United Left support to continue running the regional government in Andalucia, where they suffered heavy setbacks in elections last week. The government has at the same time been pressed by leaders of the conservative Popular party to respond to the verdict of voters in the European ballot. Mr Rodrigo Rato, the PP's parliamentary spokesman, said in an interview published yesterday that Spain needed tougher budget cuts and lower social costs to industry.</p>

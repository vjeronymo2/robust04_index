			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / ANC edges towards two-thirds majority South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission is expected to release final results today confirming the overwhelming victory of Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress in last week's all-race poll. Any further delay in the count could upset the timetable leading to Mr Mandela's inauguration as president next Tuesday. All party leaders consider it unthinkable that the event, expected to be attended by more than 40 world leaders, should be postponed. The latest official count, based on figures made available last night, showed the ANC edging further towards a two-thirds majority in the 400-member National Assembly that would give it the power to draft the country's constitution. The commission's latest batch of figures, encompassing more than 80 per cent of the estimated electorate, showed the ANC consolidating its lead with 64.7 per cent of the vote. The National party, led by outgoing president F. W. de Klerk, was second at 20.6 per cent and the Inkatha Freedom party third on 8.1 per cent. The assembly is required to draw up a new constitution which will be the basis of the next election, due by 1999. The constitution's principles, however, were agreed after multi-party talks last year. The strong support for the ANC will also reinforce its dominance of the cabinet, where posts will be allocated according to the parties' electoral showing. Mr Mandela has hinted, however, he will offer ministries to the conservative Freedom Front, the liberal Democratic party and the radical black Pan Africanist Congress, although none is likely to achieve the minimum 5 per cent of the vote that cabinet representation requires. Uncertainty over parliament's composition saw the financial rand, main barometer of international investor confidence, shed 6 cents in London to close at R4.79 to the dollar.

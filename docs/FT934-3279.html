			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Blick improves 10% to Pounds 9.4m Blick, the communications systems and time products company which acquired Time and Security for Pounds 57.6m in October, yesterday reported full year pre-tax profits slightly ahead of forecasts made at the time of its rights issue to partly fund the deal. Pre-tax profits increased by 9.7 per cent to Pounds 9.41m in the year to September 30, compared with profits of Pounds 8.58m. Earnings per share increased by 4.1 per cent to 27.06p (26p) and the final dividend is increased to 6.9p (6.2p), making a total for the year of 10.2p (9.2p). Nevertheless, Blick's shares closed down 5p at 440p. Turnover increased by a relatively modest 6.4 per cent to Pounds 32.8m (Pounds 30.9m), including Pounds 1.93m attributable to acquisitions. Public address systems turnover growth was particularly strong, as were exports which grew by 24 per cent. However, Mr Ian Scott-Gall, managing director, said the overall turnover figure masked strong growth in rental income which increased by 16.5 per cent to Pounds 15.8m and more than offset a slight decline in outright sales. The group is emphasising rentals as its preferred growth route. At the end of September its gross future rentals under contract totalled Pounds 87m but the Time and Security acquisition is expected to almost double this to Pounds 167m. Operating profit rose by 12.3 per cent to Pounds 8.89m (Pounds 7.92m) including Pounds 57,000 from acquisitions. The improved operating profits came despite modest but unquantified restructuring costs, mainly related to the group's time division. Net interest receipts fell from Pounds 664,000 to Pounds 517,000, mainly reflecting the impact of lower interest rates on the group's cash bal-ances which stood at Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 7.35m) at the end of September. As foreshadowed in October, in order to finance the Time and Security acquisition the group used not only its own cash surplus and the proceeds of the Pounds 20m rights issue, but also put in place Pounds 40m of bank loans and guarantee facilities. As a result the group is geared for the first time since its flotation in 1986.</p>

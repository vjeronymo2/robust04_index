			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Anhui radio station correspondent Hua Yan (5478) and </F> ANHUI RIBAO correspondents Li Changwen (2621 2490 2429) and  Huang Xiaohong (7806 2556 4767)]    [Text] At a provincial meeting on propaganda and  ideological work held on 5 March, Comrade Fu Xishou delivered an  important speech.    Comrades Lu Rongjing, Wang Taihua, Liu Guangcai, Du Cheng,  Tu  Yijin, Yang Duoliang, Wang Sheyun, and Hou Yongtong attended the  meeting, which was presided over by Comrade Fang Zhaoxiang.    Fu Xishou's report is composed of three parts: first,  concerning the economic situation in 1993; second, concerning  this year's economic work; and third, opinions about propaganda  work in the economic field.    While talking about Anhui's economic situation since 1993,  Fu  Xishou said: Anhui enjoyed fairly rapid development in 1993.  Despite economic fluctuations, Anhui has achieved its goal of  maintaining rapid economic growth. As a result, Anhui ranks  high in economic growth among all provinces in China. Bumper  agricultural harvests and overall improvement of the rural  economy have effectively supported the rapid growth of the  national economy. Industrial production, which has increased by  a large margin and enjoyed a large expansion in overall economic  performance, has played a role in spurring rapid economic  growth. Fairly good results have been achieved in the  construction of infrastructural projects, adding more strength  for economic development. In line with rapid economic growth,  Anhui's incomes have remarkably improved, as have the incomes of  its urban and rural residents. Important progress has been  achieved in reform and opening up. The national economy has  become more market-oriented. As a result, economic development  is further invigorated.    While talking about this year's economic work, Fu Xishou  stated: Generally speaking, the basic tasks for this year's  economic work are to deepen reform, promote development, and  maintain stability by seizing opportunities and by doing our job  in a thorough manner. Efforts should be made to ensure that  reform, development, and stability will coordinate and promote  one another. To achieve good results in performing this year's  work, he put forward the following requirements: We should have  a full understanding of current favorable opportunities and make  good use of them. We should try in every possible way to  maintain good momentum in our economic growth. Major efforts  should be made in optimizing economic structures and enhancing  economic performance. Particularly, we should rely on  scientific and technological progress in a bid to manufacture  more products with less input. In carrying out this year's  reform, we should continue to concentrate on changing the  management mechanism of state-owned enterprises; on actively  exploring effective methods to establish a modern enterprise  system; on accelerating reform in finance, taxation, banking,  foreign trade, foreign exchange, planned investment, and other  fields; and on establishing a macroeconomic control system that  meets the needs of a market economy. More efforts should be  made to carry out reform. With new breakthroughs in reform, we  can achieve greater economic development. We should discover in  a timely fashion and pay great attention to the problems  cropping up during the course of reform and economic development  so as to maintain stability of the overall situation.    Concerning how to carry out the current propaganda work in  the economic field, Fu Xishou put forth the following opinions:  First, it is necessary to uphold the correct guidance of public  opinion so as to steer Anhui people's enthusiasm and creativity  to the drive of reform and economic development. This year's  reform is unprecedentedly large in scale. We should have a  clear-cut stand in publicizing and supporting reform. We should  provide effective ideological guarantees and a fine public  opinion environment for the introduction of major reform  measures. Second, it is necessary to establish and give  publicity to Anhui's new image. In doing so, the people of  Anhui should seize opportunities, deepen reform, open up wider  to the outside world, and speed up economic development. In  addition, we should also try to do a good job on the propaganda  and ideological front. We should have a good command of the  overall situation, persist in seeking truth from facts, and  neither overestimate nor underestimate our capability. We  should make more efforts in giving publicity to Anhui's  achievements and progress. Third, we should actively explore new  methods for carrying out propaganda work under a socialist  market economy. In light of the central work and important  plans of the party and government, we should effectively  organize large propaganda campaigns and enhance our ability in  organizing such campaigns. Meanwhile, we should pay attention  to in-depth publicity. Particularly, we should be good at  scooping out economic news which are of important significance  of the times. Continued efforts should be made to publicize our  excellent enterprises and quality products. Fourth, leaders at  all levels should pay great attention to propaganda and  ideological work, and should support such work with real actions.    More than 570 comrades heard Fu Xishou's report. They were  party secretaries and propaganda department heads of all  prefectures and cities; directors of all county-level propaganda  developments; responsible persons of relevant units directly  under the provincial government; responsible persons of  universities and large enterprises; and responsible comrades who  attended the provincial meetings on radio and television work,  cultural work, foreign propaganda work, press and publication  work, and work concerning provincial federations of literary and  art circles.</p>

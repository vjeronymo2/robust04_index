			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: London After a raft of UK economic data inspired a volatile ride for gilts last week, the market will be relatively quiet this week as significant domestic statistics are in short supply. Attention will be focused instead on activities and sentiment abroad. Germany's influence, which has been muted during the past week because of UK data, will return to the fore as markets look to the German M3 money supply data, expected as early as today, and definitely this week. Over the past three months, the headline growth rate of M3 has fallen and the markets are now expecting a small month-on-month rise, which would continue to bring down the annual rate to about 8.8 per cent, still above the Bundesbank's 4.0 to 6.0 per cent target corridor. Such news could lower European bond yields, which would have a knock-on effect on the gilt market. The markets will also be watching for details of the September 28 gilt auction, which will emerge on Tuesday. The announcement on Friday suggested a maturity between 2004 and 2006, and Mr Andrew Roberts, economist at UBS, said he believed the auction will be the new 10-year benchmark. He anticipates an 8.5 per cent coupon. In the UK, markets are likely to focus on the CBI manufacturing trends survey for signs of an upturn.</p>

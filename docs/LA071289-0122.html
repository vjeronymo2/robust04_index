			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> United Flight Attendants Vote to Strike: Flight attendants at United Airlines  have overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike, the Assn. of Flight Attendants  said. However, negotiations between the union and United are under the  supervision of a federal mediator who would have to declare an impasse and  order a 30-day cooling-off period before a strike could be called. The  negotiations are in recess. The union represents about 13,500 United attendants  and has been negotiating with the carrier for nearly two years.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The former operator of a court reporting service in San Diego has pleaded  guilty to mail fraud, and apparently will cooperate in a federal investigation  of Los Angeles lawyers purportedly involved in an insurance fraud scheme.  Suzanne Rubin, 29, who had been arraigned on a single mail fraud count, changed  her plea to guilty in San Diego federal court. U.S. District Judge John Rhoades  ordered her plea agreement with federal prosecutors sealed. Neither Rubin nor  her lawyer would say if she is assisting the government. But Assistant U.S.  Atty. George D. Hardy called this "a fair implication from the circumstances."  Authorities are investigating whether about 15 lawyers, paid millions of  dollars by insurers to defend policyholders, schemed to prolong litigation and  fatten their fees by conducting unnecessary pretrial discovery and filing  spurious claims against each other's clients.  </P></p>

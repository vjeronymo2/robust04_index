			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Buoyant car sales put Henlys Pounds 3.22m back in the black BUOYANT car sales, particularly to fleet buyers, lower interest costs and a turnround in the bus and coach building business helped Henlys Group bounce back into profit in the first half. Henlys, which fought off a hostile takeover bid from its rival T Cowie last year, achieved Pounds 3.22m pre-tax in the six months to June 30. Losses of Pounds 898,000 a year ago were after reorganisation costs of Pounds 950,000. Earnings per share were 6.6p (losses 2.7p) and the interim dividend is lifted 50 per cent to 1.5p. Based on the continuing high level of activity in both the motor division and coach manufacturing and sales division the board said it also intended recommending a 50 per cent increase in the final dividend to 3p. Turnover increased by 13 per cent to Pounds 188.2m (Pounds 166.5m) led by a 20 per cent gain in the motor division where turnover rose to Pounds 154.5m (Pounds 128.8m). Operating profits in the motor division, jumped by 17.7 per cent to Pounds 3.83m as the group outpaced the market with a 24 per cent increase in new car sales - including a 34 per cent gain in fleet sales - and a good performance in service and after-sales activities. The coach manufacturing and sales division managed to turn a Pounds 1.02m operating loss into a Pounds 438,000 profit despite a decline in turnover to Pounds 33.7m (Pounds 37.6m). Group profits were also boosted by lower interest costs of Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 2.35m) reflecting lower interest rates and a reduction in borrowings which stood at Pounds 23.9m at the end of June, down Pounds 6m, representing gearing of 51 per cent. The shares closed at 233p, up 11p. COMMENT Shareholders who backed Henlys during last year's takeover battle have been rewarded. Based on current share prices they are now 35 per cent better off than they would have been accepting the Cowie offer. By targeting fleet buyers Henlys' new car sales are running well ahead of the underlying market growth of 9 per cent. Meanwhile, the struggling bus and coach business appears to have finally turned the corner. Production will be about 25 per cent higher in 1993 and is expected to rise again next year. Analysts were upgrading their profit forecasts yesterday and, based on cautious estimates, the group should achieve pre-tax profits of about Pounds 6.1m this year, equivalent to earnings of 12.6p per share, and is trading on a prospective p/e of 18.6.</p>

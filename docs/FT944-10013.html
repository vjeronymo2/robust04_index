			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: Secret life of a shopaholic - On the surface, she looks quite normal. Underneath, she has an uncontrollable urge to spend, spend, spend . . . all the way to financial disaster Miranda works for a blue-chip American firm in the City of London. She is 36, successful, personable, confident. She earns Pounds 45,000 and is about to be promoted to a more senior job in New York. On the surface, life is going well for her. Yet, she has a problem. All week, she helps her clients make better sense of their money. On Saturdays, she feeds a secret vice that threatens to destroy everything. Miranda is a shopaholic. So far, she is Pounds 60,000 in debt, half of which she owes to various department stores and credit card companies: Harvey Nichols, Harrods, House of Fraser, Visa, American Express, John Lewis and half a dozen others. The rest she owes to her bank which, a few weeks ago, told her she was close to being bankrupt. On one occasion last summer, she spent Pounds 3,000 in an hour at Harvey Nichols alone. Miranda is an extreme case of an increasingly common problem. According to Mintel, a market research company, 15 per cent of people in the UK are addicted shoppers. This is a complaint of modern times, a disorder akin to bulimia, alcoholism or gambling. It affects women far more than men and touches all classes and levels of income. And Dr Richard Elliott, a consumer psychologist at Lancaster University, who is carrying out government-funded research into compulsive shopping, says the increasing availability of credit is partly to blame. For Miranda, it all started 12 years ago. She had just bought a house with her boyfriend, who showed her that the place could be furnished in style - and all on credit. She came from a respectable, middle-class family that had never owed a penny. His family was different. 'They were very go-getting. It was an eye-opener to me,' she says. The relationship soon fell apart and Miranda found herself a single woman in London. 'I was part of a lively social set with people who were earning more money than me. I wanted to be included, and I used to treat people to things. Before I knew it, I had a Pounds 1,000 overdraft.' When she reached the limit on her credit cards, she did not stop. Instead, she found her bank was more than happy to consolidate her credit card debts into a Pounds 1,500 loan. 'It was very easy - no one made me suffer from it. I started to take three or four holidays a year, to the Canaries, Greece, Italy. I wanted to look my best, so I used to buy clothes.' At that stage, she was going to such high street shops as Wallis and Principles, and spending Pounds 300 a time. 'I'd see a dress I liked and buy it in three colours, or buy two exactly the same. I always made sure I had the money to spend. I'd apply for a new credit card, thinking about it as Pounds 25 a month, the minimum repayment. I never thought about how I was going to pay it back. Instead, I thought: I want that dress and I want it now.' As her tastes grew more expensive, the number of her credit cards grew, too. The credit reference agencies had no problem with Miranda. Her well-paid, steady job looked impressive, as did the regularity with which she always met the (minimum) repayments on all her cards. By the late 1980s, she had shifted into a new gear. She got loans from Marks and Spencer and the Beneficial bank totalling Pounds 6,000 - enough to clear the debt off all her cards and start again, this time with higher credit limits. Other credit companies would write offering to lend her more, and she would leap at the offer. The spree might have stopped in 1990 if her bank had decided to be more difficult. The manager agreed to extend the loan to Pounds 15,000, although he insisted that she cut up all her cards under his nose. But he made one mistake. 'He did not tell me to cancel the accounts. So, I got all the companies to send me replacement cards.' By this time, she had so many clothes and shoes she could hardly get them in through the doors of her small flat. Once, she tried to call a halt to the spending, and started repaying some of the debt - but it did not last. 'My boyfriend had an affair with his secretary and that knocked my confidence.' It was the perfect excuse for a monumental spending spree to cheer herself up. Eventually, she reached a stage where there was no looking back. 'I owed about Pounds 30,000 then and, when you get to that level, there is no point in trying to pay it off. It would have taken 10 years, and the thought of not being able to buy anything for that time was . . . well, unpalatable.' About two years ago, she was approached by an aggressive credit company from the US trying to break into the London market. It offered her a gold card with a Pounds 6,000 limit - and took on all the outstanding debt from the other cards. Over the past year, her finances have become more and more difficult to balance. Eventually, her bank told her she had no choice other than bankruptcy. She did not agree. Instead, she suggested an Individual Voluntary Arrangement under which her debts will be reduced to a manageable size. The deal will mean surviving on Pounds 200 a month for the next three years, which will be hard when her dry-cleaning bill alone comes to Pounds 40. Yet, she thinks she can do it. 'I have a strong will. I gave up chocolate seven years ago and haven't touched it since,' she says. Privately, she hopes there will be a quicker way out. On holiday in Marbella last year, she saw a clairvoyant. 'She told me never to worry about money. I would meet a very rich man and never need think about it again.' (Miranda is not her real name).

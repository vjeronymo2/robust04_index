			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, May 9 (AFP) -- Troops loyal to Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih broke through the last defenses  north of Aden on Monday [9 May] and were just five kilometres  (three miles) from the southern stronghold, the north said.    But an AFP correspondent in central Aden said the port city  was calm with no sound of battle on the outskirts. Aden Radio  played military music and rallied for reservists to join the  battle.    A northern military spokesman in the capital, meanwhile,  said  Salih's troops were "waging decisive battles against the last  remnants of secessionist forces."    The battle for Aden had reached Dar Sa'd, just five  kilometres from the city, he said. Salih's troops also captured  the south's main air base, Al-Anad, 50 kilometres (30 miles)  north of Aden.    The southern forces of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a  bitter rival of Salih, have a second air base in the Hadramaut,  700 kilometres (420 miles) east of Aden.    Two Scud missiles, meanwhile, crashed into the Yemeni  capital, without causing any casualties. Witnesses said the  missiles fell in empty lots in the suburbs, causing little  damage.    The south has been counting on its warplanes and Scud  missiles to hold off the north since civil war broke out on  Thursday, after several months of political feuding between  Salih and al-Bid.    To the north of Aden, a battle with tanks and artillery was  raging for control of Dhaleh, a town 60 kilometres (35 miles)  from the port city, the spokesman in Sanaa said.    Anti-aircraft guns had shot down a southern fighter over  Abyan Province east of Aden and clashes were also taking place  in Lahij Province north of the city.    Earlier the southern-controlled Defence Ministry said  "thousands of citizens" had responded to a general mobilisation  order to defend Aden, a city of more than 500,000 people, under  attack from the north and east.    Aden Radio, preparing for a possible siege, said southern  forces were putting up fierce resistance and had destroyed two  of the north's bases outside the city.    The north, which had already said Sunday that Aden was about  to fall, said its forces were Monday "ready at any moment to  surround and break through the separatist strongholds... at the  gates of Aden."    Seventy-four northern fighters have been killed and 240  wounded in a series of northern advances, military officials  here said, giving the first toll issued by either side.    They said southern forces suffered "enormous losses."    Civil war erupted Thursday between forces loyal to Salih, a  conservative northerner, and those of al-Bid, leader of the  Yemen Socialist Party.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / US Senate paves way for banks to operate nationwide The US Senate cleared away the last obstacle to nationwide banking yesterday when it voted to allow banks to set up branches outside their home states. The move is expected to prompt a number of bank mergers and acquisitions as institutions expand across state lines. Supporters of the legislation say it will produce a more efficient banking system that will be able to better serve consumers. Although the measure had seemed certain to be approved, its supporters had begun to fear that the vote would get held up in the logjam of legislation awaiting action before Congress breaks up next month to prepare for the November elections. Once it has been signed by President Bill Clinton, the bill will allow big bank holding companies to merge the separate subsidiaries they must now maintain in each state into a single bank. It will also allow banks to open new branches and acquire other banks outside their home states. The bill passed the House of Representatives last month, but a vote had been held up in the Senate because of objections by Senator Phil Gramm, who opposed a measure relating to home equity lending in Texas, and by Senator Howard Metzenbaum. When the senators dropped their objections, the bill passed by 94 votes to 4. Big US banks have been waiting for years for legislation to allow interstate banking, which was backed by the Bush administration as well as the Clinton administration. But many smaller local banks have lobbied against the measure, which has also been tied up for years by a related dispute between the banking and insurance industries over bankers' use of a loophole allowing them to sell insurance policies. The bill will allow banks to convert their subsidiaries into branches from 1997 onwards, though states will be entitled to opt in and allow interstate branching earlier. Although yesterday senators agreed to drop a measure that would have required foreign banks to set up US subsidiaries if they wanted to take advantage of the new branch freedom, the bill will lower the limit on the amount of retail deposits that a foreign bank may accept. Along with a bill passed earlier this year to encourage the establishment of community development banks, the interstate branch bill is the main piece of banking legislation attempted by the Clinton administration. Treasury officials expect, however, to try again next year to consolidate federal banking regulations, an attempt they dropped in the face of opposition from the Federal Reserve.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The Amnesty  International in a statement March 31 reportedly expressed  apprehensions over the human rights abuses in South Korea and  urged the South Korean authorities to release all the prisoners  of conscience and scrap the "National Security Law" (NSL).    It demanded the release of two members of the opera troupe  "Huimangsae" (Birds of Hope) and members of the Fellowship  Society for Modern Philosophy and others who had been arrested  some time ago, concluding that they were conscientious prisoners  detained for demanding the freedom of expression.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Stenographic version" of statement by Bishop Samuel Ruiz </F> Garcia to unidentified domestic and foreign reporters at the San  Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral on 27 February]    [Text] Good evening to all the domestic and international  sisters and brothers of the press, radio, and television media.  Events that occur outside the discussion table influence  differently those who are sitting at this table and on those who  are abroad. Although we cannot say news has been lacking, it has  certainly influenced the mood of the talks. For example, the  news on what has been happening in Altamirano has influenced our  work. Even if those events would not have occurred and we would  not have known of the steps taken to achieve greater peace, it  would have been difficult for the parties at the table to  continue to progress without feeling there was a disturbing  external pressure.    Fortunately, after steps were taken, good sense prevailed.  Although several incidents occurred again, they did not  seriously affect our work, much less the sincerity with which we  are all acting. The incidents did not hinder us from making  progress on topics of greater complexity, which, as we admitted  in the joint communique issued by the mediator, the EZLN  [Zapatist National Liberation Army], and the [peace]  commissioner yesterday, present certain difficulties.    The current difficulties are not, as could be thought, --  characteristically I have always spoken very truthfully -- the  contents of the agreements being discussed for later approval or  the lack of flexibility on one side or another -- such an  attitude has not existed up to now -- but in the inherent  complexity of the linguistic and cultural translation. That is,  the complicated task of reading the text of the proposals and  understanding the terms used in the wording of a text. The  mediator has to say that he too has had difficulty in this  respect because there are terms in our language that vary in  meaning according to the level or field in which they are being  used. A word used in computer science has an entirely different  meaning in regular usage.    Terms can be difficult, especially those that are abstract  or  have legal implications, which we do not use regularly, but  which those who are advising us, at our request, do use  regularly. To understand the terms and implications of a  proposal, to make an accurate translation and find the  corresponding words in the cultural field, and to assimilate all  this to explain it to each linguistic group -- they have to go  through exactly the same steps to be able to assimilate them and  later take them to the groups in the four linguistic regions --  has prompted a complicated situation that computer techniques  have not been able to alleviate.    We can say, however -- we would have wanted to say it in a  more impressive manner and with everyone present for your  satisfaction -- that we are currently in the definitive  consensus phase. We have discussed almost all of the document,  which I will witness the day this ends. We always say it will be  soon but there are the differences between the pace of western  time and the Mayan culture, which is much slower.    We could provide abundant examples of the complexity of this  job, but instead of saying what I have already said, citing  examples, perhaps we could preview the structure of the  agreements themselves, practically all of which have already  been discussed. Some 10 or 12 points remain to be discussed;  some of them, four or five, are of secondary importance. Others  have a certain relevance but there are language problems to be  resolved. These points are being discussed but they are not  fundamental in the agreement. We could say a significant  agreement has been reached.    The document will have the following points or subheadings:  a  preliminary set of articles or statements, which will be called  Commitments for a Worthy Peace in Chiapas. There are 34  commitments. Two of these commitments do not include resolutions  and have to do with democracy. It was difficult, since we knew  from the beginning the commitments were not part of an  agreement, strictly speaking, but they are opinions divulged to  the national community and we certainly hope they will have an  impact on the agreements.    The drafting of these two agreements, which are statements  and do not include resolutions, is already finished. The  agreements containing resolutions have to do with the different  problems or demands made by the EZLN, to which an overall  response has been given since the first day and to which  solutions will be found gradually, step by step.    A few days ago, Subcommander Marcos and the commissioner  said  what percentage of the agreement points had been discussed. Once  these commitments are made, naturally, we will reach the peace  agreements. These agreements are made up of two parts: Mexican  Government agreements and EZLN agreements, and include the  military's role in this peace process, the amnesty that must be  sought, the specific manner in which it must be implemented, and  a final commitment to comply with the peace agreement. These two  steps, commitments for a worthy peace, and peace agreements lead  us to a third and final point, which is a peace declaration.    This peace declaration, already formulated and agreed to in  its basic terms by mutual consent, together with all the sets of  previous documents and agreements, as well as said commitments,  will be presented here when the logistical part is completed,  and each copy of that set of agreements that is picked up will  be authenticated by me.    The necessary copies will be delivered to each party -- EZLN  19 copies -- and the team of the peace commissioner and myself  (will be delivered) as many copies as necessary, authenticated,  that is signed by me as was the text of the original agreed  upon. Both parties will present the accords to the rank and  file or grass-roots structures and corresponding levels so that,  after the established time, which evidently will not be long,  they will return to this city to make peace in what we hope will  be a solemn and to some degree magnificent manner, because the  signing of these accords pertains to the entire country.    What the parties will do is to explain to their  corresponding  membership the implications and reasons why specific or concrete  points were accepted.    For the peace commissioner, there is one difficulty that  involves convincing each agency that they are part of the  execution of the accords, and for the EZLN it involves  distributing the document to 19 different groups, communities,  in the language of each group.    Yesterday, for instance, both sides worked nearly  unrelentingly. The EZLN representatives did not get much sleep;  they went to bed at 0300 and had to be up and working by 0700.    The peace commissioner and also the mediator, with their  respective teams, were also working on the preparation of the  three agreed fundamental ideas. They are in the process of  drafting the final document to make the definitive assimilation  [asimilacion definitiva] already agreed upon, with the exception  of eight points which, as I said, are the ones that have not  been definitively addressed. This will permit them to later get  to the final part.    It is a matter of explaining what the parties here have  agreed to in this lengthy process of drafting documents and  receiving the definitive support of all EZLN sectors, after the  final signing.    That is the process we wished to describe to you.    Tomorrow, as opposed to what one might expect, given that  today is Sunday, will be a day in which there will not be a news  conference. All the infrastructure and logistics will be  devoted to producing a document pertaining to issues already  approved, and from that moment on, perhaps some of the things  that must be considered a regulation of different  infrastructures or commissions that have appeared as necessary  and that have to be implemented.    This is what we intended to convey to you, regretting that  the pace of work has not allowed the peace commissioner or EZLN  representatives to be present here today.    Consequently, as we said earlier, there will be no news  conference tomorrow nor Tuesday evening nor Wednesday morning.  We hope that the work will be definitely completed. This will  be reported in due time.    Thank you very much for your kindness and understanding.</p>

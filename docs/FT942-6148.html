			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Management: Director's nightmare - The biggest worries for senior UK executives The chairman is drunk in charge of the business. The company's owner is insisting on terms of employment that will surely end up before an industrial tribunal. The board is deadlocked on whether the company should cease trading. Real cases, real dilemmas: the next step for the three company directors faced with them was to contact Britain's Institute of Directors, which has logged the 10 most common worries. At 24 hours' notice, any one of the IoD's 47,000 members - many of whom run companies too small to have a full range of in-house specialists - can speak to an expert for free and in confidence. Every year, around 1,000 of them do. Employing six part-time advisers, each senior in their own field, the IoD's advisory service covers finance, law, human resources, property, marketing and the birth and death of businesses. As such it offers an insight into the issues that cause headaches. Dismissal, it would seem, is the threat that causes most anxiety. The single most common call to the service is prompted by IoD members' own lack of job security. For one managing director, who was instructed by the owner of his company to take more than 20 sales representatives off their salaried contracts and pay them on a commission-only basis, the threat of a rash of industrial tribunal cases for constructive dismissal was only avoided by refusing to co-operate, and losing his own job. In the end, he got almost 12 months' salary, kept his company car and received help with a CV and job contacts. Another managing director, this time of a UK subsidiary of a company jointly owned by Russia and Ukraine, called the service when the majority holder had decided his nationality was a problem. The Russians wanted a Russian in the post. A third, running the subsidiary of a British company based in Zambia, was similarly sacked from afar. Alone and unaided he needed rapid advice on his legal position and rights. All three cases demonstrate the degree to which many directors are unprotected. A surprisingly large number take up jobs without a service agreement. One such caller owned 5 per cent of the equity of a company. He was its managing director and the owners were related to his wife. Surely, a position of security. If the company were acquired, he could be in trouble, the IoD told him. Nor is it just directors' job security that arises. The dismissal of other company employees is a recurring topic. One managing director, who inherited a 52-year-old secretary on an 18-hour week, had given her two verbal warnings for poor work, before offering early retirement with severance pay equivalent to the statutory redundancy figure. The secretary was now holding out for straight redundancy, but the managing director did not want to make the position redundant. The IoD was emphatic on the error of mixing disciplinary procedures with redundancy. Other cases have been more shocking. The chairman of a small publishing company wanted to dismiss a 59-year-old senior editor, who had not been doing his job properly since developing a brain tumour. The editor's doctor had advised that it would be best for the man to continue working. The IoD warned of an industrial tribunal case, and advised a generous severance payment. The service did have one scrape with a dissatisfied customer when a director facing insider-dealing charges claimed the service had told him his transactions were legal. IoD records showed he had not spoken to the service until after the transactions, and that the IoD had anyway not said they were legal, and the claim was dropped.</p>

King left a Las Vegas hospital Monday in good spirits and  "asking for his guitar" after being hospitalized over the weekend because of a  bout with high blood sugar. King, who had to cancel performances at the New  Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival over the weekend, returned to his Las Vegas  home for two weeks of recuperation, his manager said.  </P> <P> Manager Sid Seidenberg said King, 64, was admitted Friday to Valley Hospital,  where doctors were concerned about King's blood sugar level and suggested the  hospitalization for further tests. He said the level is being monitored.  </P> <P> Seidenberg said King had a "diabetic attack," but his assistant, Tina Brincat,  said he wasn't diagnosed as having diabetes. Hospital officials refused to  discuss the case.  </P></p>

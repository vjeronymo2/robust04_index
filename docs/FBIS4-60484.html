			<p>BFN     [Text] The finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, has said  that the successful outcome of the Rao-Clinton summit has  vindicated that the prime minister's visit to the United States  was in the national interest. Speaking to reporters in London,  he said both the U.S. Government and captains of American trade  and industry have welcomed India's economic reforms program and  the strategy integrating its economy with the global economy.  Dr. Singh said there is a lot of enthusiasm in the United  States about India's prospects as a large and emerging market  offering great opportunities for American investments.</p>

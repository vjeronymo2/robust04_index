			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Santa Monica Museum of Art officials Wednesday signed a lease for their Main  Street building with Edgemar, developers of the multi-use complex that houses  the museum. They also announced renovation and programming plans. Activities  scheduled for the museum, slated to open formally in September, include  exhibits by Alexis Smith and Lita Albuquerque and performances by Rachel  Rosenthal and Sara Elgart. Formation of the museum has been surrounded by  controversy. However, all but one of 15 misdemeanor charges against founder  Abby Sher, filed for her alleged use of the museum before obtaining a final  certificate of occupancy, have been dropped, said museum director Thomas  Rhoads. Sher was fined $250 for the outstanding charge.ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

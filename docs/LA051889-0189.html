			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: TUSTIN MARINE CORPS FACILITY AND ENVIRONS: FOCUS;  </P> <P> BUSINESSES AND MARINES: ALL IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD  </P> <P> In a real estate developer's dream tract, the largest plot of land belongs to  the U.S. Marines.  </P> <P> Near the northeastern corner of an area defined by the Santa Ana, San Diego and  Costa Mesa freeways and Culver Drive in Irvine, the U.S. Marine Corps  Helicopter Air Station in Tustin occupies 1,558 acres of prime  commercial/industrial acreage. It borders the rich concentration of private  industries in Irvine Business Complex, which boasts 47 Fortune 500 companies  and nearly 600 corporate headquarters.  </P> <P> Surrounded by a granite-and-glass high-tech business community where "old"  buildings are those built 15 years ago, the World War II military base shows  its age. Its 1,088-foot-long hangars were constructed in 1941 to house  submarine-hunting blimps for the U.S. Navy. The largest unsupported wooden  structures in the world, the hangars earned the base a national landmark  designation in 1978.  </P> <P> Today, the air station's 140 helicopters are used for troop training and to  transport troops and cargo in the Western Pacific. With 4,030 military and  civilian employees, the Tustin station is the county's second largest employer  (after Hughes Aircraft Co.) and pumps half a billion dollars into the local  economy.  </P> <P> More than 4,600 people live on the base -- currently the only residents in the  air station-Irvine Business Complex neighborhood. That's changing, however, as  the Marines plan more housing units on the base and the city of Irvine departs  from master-plan tenets that historically proscribed mixing housing and  high-rises.  </P> <P> At Jamboree Road and Kelvin Avenue, the Charter Apartments, first residential  development in the business complex, is nearing completion. And more homes are  on the drawing boards as the developers and the city of Irvine explore ways to  integrate working and living areas.  </P> <P> Land between the marine base and the San Diego Freeway was formerly inexpensive  industrial space, but much of it now is used for executive office parks,  research and development and some retail. While industrial and R&amp;D space is  expected to remain stable, projections indicate office space will more than  double by 1995.  </P> <P> High-rise office space and large mixed-use projects such as Koll Center Irvine  now dominate development along the San Diego Freeway. And restaurants, hotels,  upscale athletic clubs, theaters and shops abound in the emerging urban  village.  </P></p>

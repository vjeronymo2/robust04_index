			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / L&amp;G blamed over Homes Assured INEFFICIENCY AND policy poaching by Legal &amp; General, the insurance company, helped cause the collapse of Homes Assured, the mortgage broker, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. The claims were made by defence counsel in the trial of three former directors of Homes Assured, which specialised in arranging finance for council tenants buying their homes under the 'right to buy' scheme. The three deny trading fraudulently. Legal &amp; General, which had a tied-agents agreement with Homes Assured, was 'wholly incapable' of coping with the work provided by the brokers, said the counsel for defendant Mr Keith Woodward. Mr David Penry-Davey QC said that both Legal &amp; General and later Criterion Insurance Company were unable to keep Homes Assured properly informed of the proper level of policy cancellations. The insurance company's inability to process policy applications on time caused considerable hardship to home owners and led to further cancellations, he said. In addition, Legal &amp; General poached policies from Homes Assured and actively encouraged the cancellation of many of them, he added. 'With hindsight, it is clear that the failure of the insurance companies in notifying Homes Assured of the cancellation of insurance policies was the main cause of the liquidation of the company,' he said. Mr Woodward, Mr Anthony Dobson and Mr Michael Robinson all deny a joint charge of fraudulent trading from November 1988 to August 1989. Mr Dobson also denies two charges of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception, and Mr Woodward one of furnishing false information. The trial continues today.</p>

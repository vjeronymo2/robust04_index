			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "The Concept Is Good, But...."] </F>   [Text] Mochovce -- Without further expert analyses and,  most important of all, the realization of measures, the  depository for radioactive waste being built near the Mochovce  nuclear power station in Levice district cannot, given its  present state, be considered prepared to meet the task assigned  to it. This was stated, among other things, by Douglas Champ  from Canada, the head of a team of International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] experts, at a news conference in Mochovce  yesterday. Since the beginning of this week, the international  group of experts has been studying in Mochovce all important  aspects of radioactive waste storage at the depository adjacent  to the power station, possibilities of enhancing the  depository's safety, requirements for control, technology, and  professional qualifications of the maintenance staff, as well as  the progress of finishing work. The experts reached the  conclusion that the concept of storing radioactive waste to be  used at Mochovce is good and that, following the implementation  of recommended measures, storage will be reliable and safe.  According to Douglas Champ, the recommendations will encompass  a wide range of ideas, ranging from design, construction,  specifications of the waste, and measurement of limits, down to  public relations.</p>

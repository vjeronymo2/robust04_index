			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Groupe Suez pushed to first loss by provisions GROUPE SUEZ, the French financial and industrial conglomerate, yesterday estimated it lost between FFr1.8bn (Dollars 323m) and FFr1.9bn net last year, its first-ever deficit, due to heavier-than-expected provisions on property holdings. The loss, the most dramatic evidence yet of the impact of the Parisian property crisis on French financial institutions, represents a FFr5.7bn swing from a FFr3.8bn net profit in 1991. However, Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, said Suez should make a profit this year, now that the heavy provisions were behind it, and would therefore maintain its dividend at the 1991 level. 'The good ship Suez has endured a storm but has not given up to the waters,' he said. Property losses and provisions accounted for FFr4.2bn of the change, he said. By the end of last year, provisions covered 19 per cent of group lending to the property industry. Mr Worms had earlier warned that Suez would produce the worst results in its 135-year history, but this was well below market expectations of a FFr500m to FFr1bn net profit for 1992. Mr David Harrington, general market analyst at James Capel in Paris, said: 'The group has had one problem after another. There must be a lot of red faces at Suez.' The loss showed lack of control on property investment over the past decade, said another analyst. On top of this came FFr800m of provisions for the fall in value of the group's equity investments, plus FFr700m for the effect of the economic downturn on the group's operating results. The group is supporting its banking subsidiaries affected by the property crisis, such as Banque Indosuez, its main banking unit, which has received FFr800m in fresh equity from its parent last December.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Citizens' rights strong in Russia Sir, Chrystia Freeland in her article 'Court backs consumer rights' (August 4) claims incorrectly that 'the first legal blow in post-communist Russia for consumer rights' was delivered on August 3 1994 when a Moscow court ordered the retailer 'Kvikk' to award Mr P Gusev Rbs2.318m (Pounds 574). The Moscow Consumers' Union (MCU) caused a minor sensation in the Russian press when they won their first case in the Russian courts in 1988 on behalf of a pensioner who had been sold a faulty refrigerator. Since then, several hundred consumers have been awarded compensation and damages in individual and class actions brought by member organisations of the Inter-Republican Confederation of Consumer Societies in Russia and Ukraine. Exasperated Russian airline passengers were greatly cheered when the Consumer Society of Ekaterinburg's chairman sued Aeroflot after a 21-hour delay in a freezing Moscow departure lounge. The Inter-Republican Confederation is now fighting to secure compensation for the families of Russian victims of the Siberian air disaster. The independent consumer movement in the Russian Federation is one of the most active and positive forces for citizens' rights to emerge in the post-communist era, and one of the few reliable defences against the widespread corruption, speculation and fraud which characterise the Russian economy at the present time. While pleased that the Financial Times felt that Mr Gusev's victory merited reporting, I would like to draw attention to the fact that Mr Gusev's success is not the first of its kind. It follows many years of concerted effort by Russian consumer activists who, in Russia's present business climate, work for little remuneration and often at considerable personal risk. They deserve recognition for their attempts to civilise the 'Wild East'.

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Pensions to top Major's reform programme The cabinet yesterday agreed an autumn legislative programme based on the twin themes of supply-side and welfare state reform as Mr John Major kept open the options for an early ministerial reshuffle. The core bills for the Queen's Speech in November will include measures to equalise the pension age at 65 and reform pensions law, to cut the cost of unemployment benefit by introducing a job-seekers' allow-ance and to establish a new Environmental Protection Agency. But in an apparent victory for the cabinet's 'consolidators', ministers have deferred plans for an omnibus privatisation bill and early legislation to pave the way for the introduction of motorway tolls. Other casualties of the cautious approach being adopted by the prime minister include measures to liberalise licensing laws and a proposed reform of local government housing rules. There remains a question mark over a further criminal justice bill. In deference to the sceptics on the Tory back benches, Mr Major has also resisted pressure to introduce a bill to scrap British summertime in favour of alignment with European partners. But senior ministers offered a clear hint last night that the cabinet's leading radicals - Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary - had all but won their battle for a Post Office privatisation bill. Ministers said that, subject to the consultation announced in yesterday's green paper, room had been allowed within the programme for legislation to allow the sale of the Royal Mail. Among other controversial legislation will be a bill to provide for the dismantling of regional health authorities and the extension of fund-holding by GPs. Ministers have decided against committing themselves to a bill to reform the operations of the Child Support Agency. But if political controversy over the CSA refuses to die down - the agency will be the subject of a Labour-inspired Commons debate on Monday - space can be found later in the legislative programme. The programme may also have to include a potentially difficult bill to raise the limits on Britain's contributions to the European Union, a move almost certain to spark unrest among Tory Euro-sceptics. Meanwhile, speculation about the timing of the reshuffle intensified last night after the government broke with normal practice and delayed announcing the date of the parliamentary recess. Mr Major is expected to reshape the cabinet within a week or so of the break. It is understood that the prime minister has all but finalised the details of what is promised as the biggest government shake-up since the 1992 general election. Party managers insisted that MPs would continue to meet at least until the third week of July - but ministers raised the possibility that the summer break could start in two weeks time. That in turn would allow Mr Major to bring forward the cabinet changes. Whitehall insiders have pencilled in the week beginning July 11 as the most likely for the shake-up but have refused to rule out earlier changes.</p>

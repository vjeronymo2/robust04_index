			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABORITES SUSPECT A COVER-UP  </P> <P> Britain's opposition Labor Party said Sunday that it suspects a cover-up by  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government in the bombing of a Pan Am jumbo  jet after new revelations about a warning letter that was sent too late.  </P> <P> The government admitted Sunday that a letter dated Dec. 19 -- two days before  the crash -- was not sent to airlines until early January. A Transport  Department spokesman said it was delayed because color photographs of a suspect  radio-cassette recorder seized by West Germany had to be prepared.  </P> <P> The disclosure prompted new demands for a statement by Transport Secretary Paul  Channon or a public inquiry into the bombing, which killed 270 people, and its  aftermath.  </P> <P> Channon said Thursday that the letter was not sent out until "some days" after  Dec. 19. His department's statement on Sunday appeared to be an admission the  delay was even longer.  </P> <P> Some newspapers said the Dec. 19 letter contained details that could have  helped spot the bomb. "It all adds to the suspicion of confusion and cover-up,"  Byran Gould, a Labor spokesman, said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Sunday Express reported that the man who made the bomb that blew  up the Pan Am flight and plotted the attack is a Libyan known to international  security officials as "The Professor" because of his experience with  explosives.  </P> <P> The London newspaper attributed its information to unidentified detectives and  did not identify the suspect by name. It also repeated earlier reports that a  Lebanese student, 21-year-old Khalid Jaafar, of Dearborn, Mich., unwittingly  carried the bomb onto the flight in a radio-cassette player given to him as a  gift.  </P></p>

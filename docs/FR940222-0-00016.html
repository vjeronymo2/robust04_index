			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A third commenter requests an extension of the time period for reinspection of a spar cap found not corroded from 36 calendar months to 60 calendar months. This commenter states that a well-maintained airplane that is always hangared and removed from a coastal environment should only have these inspections every 60 months. The FAA does not concur that this compliance time should be extended. The FAA has determined that the majority of airplanes affected by this proposal are not maintained and operated in the conditions referenced above, and that the 36-month inspection interval is suitable for the typical affected airplane when found corrosion-free. In addition, establishing a reliable corrosion growth rate for these airplanes is extremely difficult, especially considering the diverse environment and operating conditions these airplanes are approved for. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the minor change discussed above and minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 562 affected airplanes registered in the United States, 10 have already accomplished the required inspection in accordance with Twin Commander SB No. 208A, dated November 9, 1992. None of these airplanes required spar cap replacement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The compliance time for this AD is presented in calendar time instead of hours time-in-service (TIS). The FAA has determined that a calendar time for compliance would be the most desirable method because the unsafe condition described by the AD is caused by corrosion. Corrosion can occur on airplanes regardless of whether the airplane is in service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 562 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by this AD, that it would take between 110 and 162 workhours per airplane (varies by model; a weighted average of 146 workhours) to accomplish the required inspection, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total initial cost impact of the inspection specified by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,688,980 ($8,343 per airplane). As previously discussed, 10 of the 562 affected airplanes have already accomplished the required inspection. This reduces the initial cost impact of the inspection specified by this AD on U.S. operators to $4,432,560. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inspections currently required by AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;09 carry an earlier FAA-estimated cost impact on U.S. operators of $880 (16 workhours &times; $55 per hour) per airplane. In actuality, those inspections range from $1,100 (20 workhours &times; $55 per hour) to $1,980 (36 workhours &times; $55 per hour) depending on the airplane model. Because of the more comprehensive inspection procedures specified in Twin Commander SB No. 208A, the initial cost impact of the inspections of this AD carries an additional cost impact of between $4,950 to $6,930 per airplane over that which is already required by AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;09. This AD provides owners of the affected airplanes some relief from some of the provisions of AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;09. For example: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If no corrosion is found, this AD would require repetitive inspections at 36-calendar month intervals instead of 12-calendar month intervals, which is a savings of between $2,200 to $3,960 over the next 24 calendar months depending on the airplane model. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If corrosion is less than 50 percent of the allowable service limits referenced in Twin Commander SB 208A, this AD would require reinspection at 30-calendar month intervals instead of 12-calendar month intervals, which is a savings of between $2,750 to $4,950 over the next 30 calendar months depending on the airplane model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Replacing the spar cap terminates this repetitive inspection requirement, which is a savings of $1,100 to $1,980 per year depending on the airplane model. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, if the required inspection revealed corrosion in excess of certain established limits, then replacing the spar cap would be required at a cost of approximately $100,000, parts and labor included. If the spar cap did not reveal corrosion in excess of certain established limits, then an airplane affected by this AD could have an incremental compliance cost as low as $4,950 (proposed inspection cost at 110 workhours minus the cost of the inspection required by AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;09) or $6,930 (required inspection cost at 162 workhours minus the cost of the inspection required by AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;09). If replacing the spar cap would be necessary, an airplane affected by this AD could have an incremental compliance cost as high as approximately $104,950 (required inspection at 110 workhours minus the cost of the inspection required by AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;09 plus spar cap replacement) to $106,930 (required inspection at 162 workhours minus the cost of the inspection required by AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;09 plus spar cap replacement). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Varity slides into red on USDollars 108m charge VARITY, the international farm and industrial machinery group, suffered a 12 per cent drop in sales last year. After a special USDollars 108m restructuring charge, it posted a net loss of Dollars 178m, or Dollars 7.87 a share. This compares with a profit of Dollars 94.4m, or Dollars 2.77 a share, in fiscal 1991. Varity's biggest markets were hit by the recession. Overall sales were Dollars 3.2bn for the year ended January 31 1992, against Dollars 3.6bn in fiscal 1991. Farm equipment sales were down 19 per cent and diesel engine sales fell 15 per cent. Vehicle components, accounting for nearly half the business, dipped 7 per cent. In the final quarter, after the restructuring charge, Varity's loss was Dollars 115.3m, or Dollars 4.80, against net profit of Dollars 19.1m, or 56 cents. Sales were Dollars 899m, against Dollars 896m. Mr Victor Rice, chairman, said Varity's restructuring was aimed at improving operating performance in fiscal 1993 'whether or not there is an economic recovery'. Worldwide payroll will be cut by 1,300, or 7 per cent, to lower operating costs by Dollars 45m. Varity has reduced manpower by nearly 3,000 already since 1989. The job cuts will take Dollars 40m of the special charge, while Dollars 68m comprises non-cash writedowns for future asset sales. Over the next 18 months, Varity hopes to raise up to Dollars 175m from asset sales, to be applied to debt. Varity sees moderate improvement in some sectors this year, and overall operating results should be substantially better. The Kelsey-Hayes vehicle component subsidiary had operating income of Dollars 106m in fiscal 1992, against Dollars 135m. Perkins was badly hit by the UK recession and operating income was Dollars 35m, against Dollars 61m. Demand will continue to be sluggish, but Perkins will benefit from a 10-year engine supply pact with Caterpillar of the US, worth an estimated Dollars 1bn.</p>

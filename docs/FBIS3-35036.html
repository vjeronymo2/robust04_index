			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["The Memory of History" column by Zakariyah Nil: "The Laws </F> of Boycott: Between Doubt and Certainty"]    [Text] The Arab boycott of Israel will remain the only  issue regarding which no Arab country can take any unilateral  steps. The companies that deal with Israel or help it in its  war effort will remain on the boycott file and will make no  unilateral decision to stop or cancel these dealings. The  strange thing about this boycott is that the moods felt about it  fluctuate. Those who used to dismiss the effectiveness of the  boycott and claim that it had no real influence are now  wondering about and revising their positions.    Why all the fuss about the boycott?    Why does the United States always take the initiative and  ask  that it be lifted?    If this Arab boycott of Israel does not harm Israel's  economy, why are there so many threats being issued by Zionist  pressure groups?    Those who used to underestimate and belittle the  effectiveness of the boycott are suddenly waking up and  monitoring the debate about it in the Arab and American arenas.  They finally realize there is something to it. As the popular  saying goes: There is no smoke without fire. The clouds of  smoke are shielding the boycott. There is a fire--the  boycott--to which the smoke led. Those who used to dismiss the  effects of the boycott are now worried and acting to lift it.  They insist that it be lifted. The conclusion is that the  truth about the effectiveness of the boycott laws has not  changed. Otherwise, what is the meaning of this action?    First, a group of U.S. congressmen or members of parliament  have rallied support for a draft project that asks the U.S.  Administration to stop the contracts of any U.S. arms deals with  any Arab country that fails to end its boycott of Israel. They  are trying through every means of pressure to gain the support  of other congressmen so that a majority will pass the draft  project. They mean Saudi Arabia first, which has contracts with  the United States to buy developed planes and missile launching  pads plus many other things on the list that it needs to develop  its Armed Forces, especially after the lessons it learned from  the catastrophic Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and after the bitter  experience of Desert Storm.    The question is: If these people thought the boycott was  useless, why do they have this aggressive stance on the Arab  countries, most of which have distinguished relations with the  United States?    Why is Saudi Arabia the primary target of this threat? Is it  because it encourages a just peace in the region? Or because,  thanks to it, it has revived the U.S. weapons factories and  prevented millions of workers and employees from losing their  jobs so that they do not end up in the cesspits of unemployment  and homelessness?    Second, there is a saying that some U.S. Administration  officials always repeat but that has become hollow and empty of  any practical content. This saying is that taking such a step  encourages Israel to assume positive positions in the course of  the peace negotiations and to speed up the implementation of  autonomy for Gaza and Jericho. Undoubtedly, time has proven the  falsity and treachery behind this logic and that Israeli  positions regarding the peace process remain governed by  belligerence.    Third, when Israel's friends found the Arabs were reluctant  to speed up taking such a step before the aggressor forces ended  their occupation of the Arab territories, they rallied around  this issue from another angle using the pretext that the boycott  has started to hamper and paralyze projects to build up the  autonomy areas. When U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown  arrived in Cairo as part of his visit to countries in the  region, he made a point of visiting the Arab League and meeting  its secretary general, Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al- Majid. This visit  resulted in the start of a dialogue on ending the boycott. When  the secretary general affirmed that the decision to boycott  Israel was an Arab League Council decision, the U.S. commerce  secretary took Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid's pulse on whether this issue  could be discussed anew during a coming Arab League Council  session.    The secretary general wondered about the motives behind the  question. The U.S. secretary replied that there are American  companies that want to participate in implementing the  reconstruction projects in the Gaza Strip. But the Arab boycott  laws prevent them from carrying out this urgent mission--a  pretext with logic. The response from the secretary general  was: This issue is always on the Arab League Council's agenda.  It automatically moves from one council to the other. It is  listed on the agenda, naturally.   <H5>    Time bombs and fuses: </H5>   Indeed, not all of these are the parties involved in the  game  of pressure to revoke the boycott laws. There are also the  parties that hold the threads and play on the nerves of the  Palestinian team in the talks to implement the self-government  principles. The Jewish campaigns of pressure on U.S. President  Clinton and his men are continuing. These pressures have two  objectives. The first is to tell the world in general and the  Arabs in particular: The solution for all crises is not in the  hands of the U.S. Administration; it is in our own hands. The  second is to hint to the same U.S. Administration that it stop  making statements it cannot implement.    Signs of this are: Following the working meetings between  Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in the  Swiss city of Davos, Peres' declaration that progress was made  in this round of talks, and the U.S. reactions praising Peres  when he arrived in Washington after the Davos talks, Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin made remarks from which one  understands that Peres did not have full authority during these  talks and that concluding them requires several months, not one  or two weeks. He then summoned the top officials in "the ruling  military establishment in Tel Aviv," that is, the Israeli army's  commanders, to solicit their views. He stated: We want first  to ascertain three issues that require study. These are:    The security issues.    The border crossing points.    The size of Jericho.    From this, it appears that Israel has not spent almost three  months arguing these three points. Clearly, and despite what is  being said, Rabin stands by his word that he is seeking more  from the Palestinian self-government principles than he is  giving. By claiming the need to be assured of "Israel's  security" guarantees, he wants to turn the border crossing  points in Gaza and Jericho into outlets for tightening his grip  on the Palestinians through search posts that enable Israel to  tighten its police grip. And he wants to expand his presence in  the self-government areas under the slogan of his right to  provide all possible security means for the Jewish settlements  in these areas. Israel thus wants to return to the old policy  of occupation to make itself the government at the heart of the  self-government authority. These are the real mines buried in  the body of the Palestinian agreement. They will be like fuses  that threaten all the self-government projects and interfere in  its legitimate sovereignty over its national soil.    The nearer the U.S. Administration moves toward taking  positive steps to boost the negotiations on the peace tracks,  the more intense the Jewish organizations' pressure on it  become. Such campaigns have frequently forced the U.S.  President to retract some of his decisions. Pressure was  exerted to withdraw his nomination of Admiral Bobby Inman for  the post of defense secretary on the pretext of his hostility to  Israel. Nobody knows yet how successful the new campaigns to  force the U.S. President to abandon his nomination of Strobe  Talbot as assistant secretary of state on the pretext of his  hostility to the Jews will be.    Maintaining the boycott's rules has become an inevitable  need  until the Israeli Government complies with and implements the  resolutions of international legitimacy, makes the resumption of  the peace negotiations in Washington on 15 February the starting  point for a solution to all the points of difference, and agrees  with a joint timetable for the stages of its withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories. The security guarantees for the  various countries of the region lie in the implementation of  Resolution 242, which enjoys the unanimous support of all  countries, including Israel. Will it do so? I doubt it can join  the "peace of the brave."</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW SENDS PLANE TO IRAQ TO GET ITS WORKERS;  </P> <P> EXODUS: THE SOVIETS ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS BAGHDAD'S DEMAND FOR PAYMENT FOR  TERMINATED CONTRACTS.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union on Wednesday welcomed Iraq's announcement that it will allow  all 3,300 Soviet workers in the country to leave and expressed its willingness  to discuss an Iraqi demand that compensation be paid for broken labor  contracts.  </P> <P> "If there are going to be costs, we are prepared to bear those costs because we  feel that the security and well-being of our citizens should come first,"  Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly I. Churkin said.  </P> <P> In Baghdad, a Soviet diplomat said an IL-86 wide-body jetliner, which can carry  as many as 400 passengers, is expected to arrive today to pick up the first of  the homeward-bound Soviets, most of whom were employed in Iraq's oil industry.  </P> <P> By Wednesday evening, more than 200 exit visas had been approved by Iraq's  Interior Ministry for the departing Soviets, the diplomat said.  </P> <P> The decision reportedly taken by Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council to allow  the Soviet exodus was explained Tuesday by a government spokesman in Baghdad as  an attempt to stop the Soviet Union from making "deals" to secure the safety of  its nationals.  </P> <P> The Kremlin, along with the United States, voted last week in the U.N. Security  Council to authorize the use of military force if Iraq does not withdraw from  Kuwait, and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze warned that the Kremlin  would send troops to the region if Soviet citizens in Iraq were threatened.  </P> <P> Unlike the Americans, Western Europeans and Japanese detained in Iraq, several  hundred of whom have been positioned as "human shields" at strategic locations,  Soviet nationals have not been held as hostages. But like other foreigners,  they were barred from leaving.  </P> <P> During the last visit by Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz to Moscow, Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev insisted on the immediate return of the workers.  Therefore, Churkin told a government news briefing, word of Iraq's decision  evoked satisfaction in Moscow. Officials had initially reacted Tuesday with  skepticism and caution.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union "proceeds from the fact that our people can now leave Iraq and  return home without hindrance," Churkin said, reading from a Foreign Ministry  statement. He expressed hope that Iraq's "political assurances" will not remain  mere words but will be translated into action.  </P> <P> The Soviet spokesman moved to play down speculation that his country might  moderate its position on the Persian Gulf crisis in exchange for the safe  return of its citizens, saying, "Our attitude will not change at all."  </P> <P> President Saddam Hussein's government had previously refused to let key foreign  personnel leave until they had completed their contracts, but it regarded  recent Soviet actions and expressions of concern about the Soviet workers as  tantamount to threats.  </P> <P> One point of uncertainty remained, however. According to the Iraqi News  Agency's announcement Tuesday, the Soviet workers will be free to go as soon as  Moscow agrees to compensate Iraq for the early termination of their contracts.  </P> <P> The Foreign Ministry statement read by Churkin makes no reference to such a  deal having been made, however. Churkin said only that Moscow is willing to  discuss the issue.  </P> <P> "Soviet representatives are prepared to resolve those questions in Baghdad," he  said. It was not immediately clear whether the Iraqis would consider that  sufficient. Churkin also said he did not know how much the compensation might  be.  </P></p>

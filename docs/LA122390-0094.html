			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL NOTES;  </P> <P> EXPOSURE ALMOST ADDS TO UNLV'S TROUBLE  </P> <P> The last thing UNLV needs is help in getting in trouble with the NCAA. Yet that  is what almost happened with the school and Sports Illustrated.  </P> <P> The Runnin' Rebels' program, which was granted an appeal to defend its NCAA  championship this season in return for being kept out of next year's tournament  for violations dating to 1977, and which received a letter of inquiry this week  about more recent violations, almost incurred a violation for the way the  magazine posed and dressed two of its players.  </P> <P> In the periodical's Nov. 19 College Basketball issue, UNLV forwards Larry  Johnson and Stacey Augmon were dressed in stylish outfits from shoes to  overcoats. The magazine included a tag line giving credit for the items to each  manufacturer, a definite violation of NCAA rules as far as amateur athletes  promoting products.  </P> <P> An NCAA spokesman said it was a "non-issue."  </P> <P> "Legislative Services was in contact with the school right away," Jim Marchiony  said. "The kids and UNLV were able to verify that they did not know Sports  Illustrated was going to put the credits in. If they had known it would have  been some kind of violation."  </P> <P> The first NCAA individual statistics for the season are out and the  Southwestern Athletic Conference takes a back seat to no other league as far as  scoring goes.  </P> <P> Three of the top six scorers in Division I through Dec. 17 play for SWAC  schools, including Nos. 1 and 2.  </P> <P> Bobby Phills, a 6-foot-4 senior guard from Southern University, tops the  scoring list at 37.0 points per game, 17 points higher than his average last  season.  </P> <P> Alphonso Ford, a 6-4 sophomore from Mississippi Valley State, is second at  34.8, just better than his 29.9 as a freshman which was good enough to lead the  conference.  </P> <P> Steve Rogers, a 6-5 junior from Alabama State, is tied for sixth at 29.9,  slightly better than his 29.7 last season when he was fifth in the nation in  scoring and eighth in steals at 3.1 per game.  </P> <P> Three NCAA records have been tied already this season and one gets an asterisk  in the shape of a video camera.  </P> <P> UNLV matched the record for 3-pointers in a game with 21 against Nevada in a  50-point win. There was no doubt that tied the standard set last season by  Kentucky against North Carolina and matched by Loyola Marymount against  Michigan in the NCAA tournament.  </P> <P> Samford went 34-for-34 from the free throw line on Thursday night in an 89-80  victory over Central Florida. The win snapped a nine-game losing streak for the  Bulldogs and the free throw shooting matched the best ever for a minimum of 30  in game as Cal-Irvine went 34-for-34 against Pacific on Feb. 21, 1981.  </P> <P> Brigham Young's 7-6 freshman center Shawn Bradley blocked 14 shots in a 90-86  victory over Eastern Kentucky in the opening round of the Cougar Classic to tie  David Robinson's mark for swats set against N.C.-Wilmington on Jan. 4, 1986.  </P> <P> When the game ended, however, Bradley had been credited with just 12 blocks. A  further review of game films verified the two more which got him a piece of the  record.  </P> <P> Nicholls State point guard Ray Washington was activated with his Louisiana  National Guard unit as part of Operation Desert Shield. He averaged 4.9 points,  5.1 rebounds and a team-leading 4.5 assists and 2.4 steals when he was called  to active duty last week.  </P> <P> Several of his teammates wore gray sweatbands with Washington's No. 10 on them  in his honor. Washington was the second Nicholls State athlete to be called to  active duty as tailback Bennett Williams received his orders last month.  </P> <P> Georgetown didn't lose a player to the Mideast military action, but the Hoyas  did lose their voice.  </P> <P> Rich Chvotkin, who just started his 17th season calling Georgetown games on the  radio, was called to active duty and is set to leave for the Persian Gulf in  the immediate future. Chvotkin, who is a lieutenant colonel with the Army  Medical Services' Combat Psychiatry Unit, called the first four games of the  season before receiving his orders. Chvotkin's full-time job is as a  psychologist with the Washington Instsitute.  </P> <P> Fairfield has had one of the country's most amazing offensive turnarounds. The  Stags averaged 57.7 points per game last season and 60.2 over the last two  years. This season, Mitch Buonaguro's team is averaging 86.4 points over the  first seven games, a difference of more than 28 points per game.  </P> <P> An update on two coaches who had health problems this season:  </P> <P> Southwest Texas State's Harry Larrabee, who suffered a mild stress-related  stroke just before a game in Missoula, Mont., last month, was discharged from  the hospital and has begun his recovery at home. With some weakness in his left  side, doctors have imposed a late-December earliest return to any on-court  duties, quite a difference from the early prognosis of a full season off.  </P> <P> Wichita State's Mike Cohen, who tore his patella tendon below his left knee  when he was accidentally bumped by one of his players as he was leaving the  floor at halftime of the Shockers' upset of Alabama, will remain in a brace and  on crutches for a minimum of 8-10 weeks. He faces a minimum of two months'  therapy after that for the injury which usually ends athletes' careers.  </P></p>

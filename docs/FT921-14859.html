			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Ellis &amp; Everard declines 29% ELLIS &amp; EVERARD, the chemicals distribution company, yesterday reported its first profits decline in 10 years, with the interim return down 29 per cent to Pounds 7.5m. Mr Peter Wood, managing director, warned that conditions continued to be difficult in the second half, and said it was likely that the group would report lower profits for the full year. 'We assume that the underlying level of demand will remain depressed for the remainder of the financial year,' he said. The impact of the recession on the group's non-core, higher margin businesses - swimming pool chemicals and surface cleaning products  - took the heaviest toll. These operations accounted for about Pounds 1.5m of the overall Pounds 3m decline in profits. The US, where operating profits fell by about 24 per cent, accounted for a further Pounds 1m of the pre-tax decline. The remaining profit fall was due to losses of about Pounds 400,000 at the Spanish operations. Mr Michael Marshall, chairman, said the group had concentrated on reducing costs in the first half and had maintained them virtually at 1990 levels. This would imply that Pounds 1.5m had been trimmed from total costs - before acquisitions, said Mr Wood. Some 5 per cent of jobs had also been cut. Mr Wood stressed that the performance of the core UK commodity chemicals businesses had proved the group's long-held maxim that distribution companies benefited in times of recession. The theory is that customers will switch to buying smaller quantities from distributors rather than in bulk from manufacturers. In the UK, profits declined by just 2 per cent, he said. In the US, chemical distributors form a larger share of the overall chemicals market, and thus do not benefit as much from an economic downturn. Acquisitions, which were largely responsible for the 10 per cent increase in group sales to Pounds 198m, contributed little to profits. Mr Wood said the group saw its future growth and focus in the 'heartland commodity chemicals business'. However, he would not be drawn on whether the group intended to put the non-core businesses up for sale. Interest charges rose from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 1m. Mr Wood said debt - about Pounds 16m at the half year, or 25 per cent geared  - would be reduced by the year-end. Earnings per share fell by 30 per cent to 6.7p. The interim dividend is held at 2.25p. COMMENT It looks like this will be a dull year for Ellis &amp; Everard. At least the declines of the second half have been halted. The group appears to be bumping along the bottom - a condition it might be able to maintain for some time yet. Ellis &amp; Everard has maintained its market share and simply has along with everyone else. Forecasts for the full year are pitched at Pounds 14m, making a prospective p/e of about 15. This looks a little high for the moment, given the economic uncertainty.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Observer: Deceptive Can you believe it? The new deputy chairman of Women into Business (WIB) does not believe in compulsory maternity leave and bans women wearing trousers to the office. How careless of this branch of the Small Business Bureau, a Parliamentary lobby group, to let in what might sound like an unreconstructed MCP, you may say. Meet 46-year-old Tina Knight, managing director of Nighthawk Electronics. Knight is not your average feminist. She has been fighting to save the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson hospital for Women, but she normally riles at anything smacking of 'wimmin's' issues. Yes, networking can help business women 'feel not quite so abnormal'. But on the whole, she believes problems encountered by small company entrepreneurs have very little to do with gender. The SBB - as opposed to WIB - is, according to Knight, a very male preserve. 'We should be all together' she says, and seems to be there to try and make that happen.</p>

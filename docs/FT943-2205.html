			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Emerging markets help Edinburgh Fund to Pounds 7.4m Edinburgh Fund Managers, the fund management group, reported a 99 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the half-year to July 31, from Pounds 3.72m to Pounds 7.39m. New products, particularly those aimed at the emerging markets, together with the recovery in the financial markets, were largely behind the rise. Mr Peter Arthur, finance director, cautioned that the comparison with the same period last year had to be set against the background then of depressed market conditions; also, the 1993 interims did not include contributions from two important acquisitions. Compared with the second half results, which he considered more meaningful, pre-tax profits were 22 per cent ahead. Two new investment trusts - the New Tiger Trust aimed at the far eastern market and the Inca Trust targeting Latin America - had raised over Pounds 180m from investors. Fund management income rose 63 per cent to Pounds 11.71m (Pounds 7.17m) compared with the same period last year, while group turnover increased by a similar amount to Pounds 12.85m (Pounds 7.84m). Earnings per share jumped 93 per cent to 26.7p (13.8p). The interim dividend is set at 8p (6p), with the company expecting to pay a maintained final of 22p. Edinburgh's geographical spread shifted year-on-year towards the emerging economies. Funds under management in the UK slipped from 61 per cent to 55 per cent, while the Pacific Rim rose from 16 to 21 per cent and Latin America from 2 to 4 per cent. Investment trusts increased their share of the company's income, rising from 42 to 47 per cent. The volatility in the world markets contributed to a fall in total funds under management from Pounds 4bn to Pounds 3.8bn.</p>

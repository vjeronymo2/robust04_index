			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Serbs to quit Sarajevo peaks: Promise seen as attempt to forestall Nato air strikes BOSNIAN SERBS agreed last night to a phased withdrawal from two strategic mountains overlooking the besieged capital, Sarajevo, so as to allow United Nations peacekeeping troops to occupy the peaks. The agreement with UN commanders came after Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic warned that peace talks in Geneva would collapse unless Nato launched air strikes against Serb artillery around Sarajevo. British Brigadier Vere Hayes said UN troops would occupy one of the peaks, Mount Bjelasnica, this morning, when the Bosnian Serbs would pull out. He said 150 French troops would go today to Mount Igman, nearer Sarajevo. The Serbs have promised to quit this peak in the next few days. The Serbs took the two mountains from Moslem forces in an unexpected offensive last week, tightening their stranglehold on the Bosnian capital, which has been under siege from Serb snipers and artillery for 16 months. The pledges of withdrawal are an apparent attempt to forestall air strikes, under discussion by the Nato alliance, and to put moral pressure on the Moslem-led government to resume the Geneva talks on carving up Bosnia largely on ethnic lines. President Izetbegovic said earlier he thought air strikes against Serb positions had 'never been closer' than now. 'I can say if there are no air strikes, then there is no peace process, no negotiations,' he said in an interview on the eve of scheduled talks with Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic and his Croat counterpart Mr Mate Boban. However, Nato officials indicated Mr Izetbegovic's urging was likely to get a cool reception when Nato ambassadors meet in Brussels today to discuss possible air strikes. Nato did not intend the Bosnian Moslems to use the hope of military intervention as an excuse for stalling talks, an official said. Today's meeting is expected to agree on logistics for any future air strikes, out of a list of options finalised by the Nato military committee in Brussels at the weekend. But officials warned that the allies were unlikely today to authorise air strikes as there were still significant differences about the scope and timing of any action. In sharp criticism of western policy, Mr Izetbegovic singled out the UK for undermining his government over the past 16 months of war. 'They had two ways to help; either directly through intervention or to lift the arms embargo,' he said. 'They did not do anything. Now we are left with our hands tied.' But indicating he had accepted Bosnia's tripartite division, he outlined what he called his minimum requirements for Moslems: 'A fair map for the Bosnian republic with access to the River Sava and the sea. We must have territory covering an area suitable for 2.5m citizens. We need a geographic and viable state.' Editorial Comment, Page 11</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Boost for military in China: Communist party central committee elections reverse trend THE CHINESE Communist party yesterday elected its central committee, ushering in a better educated leadership, notable for the absence of nepotism, but with an enhanced role for the military. The appointments to the party's central committee - the first since pro-democracy demonstrations were put down in June 1989 - reversed a 15-year trend of decline in the People's Liberation Army's membership of the party's top decision-making body, diplomats said. Admirals, generals and political commissars were among new members on the committee, voted in at the end of the party's 14th Congress. Diplomats said the rise in PLA representation underlined concern within the Communist party that the economic reforms the party endorsed at the congress could lead to civil unrest, especially if unemployment rises. 'They need to have the PLA on the party's side if things get out of hand,' one noted last night. The congress has been a triumph for the economic and political policies of Deng Xiaoping, 88. In the past week Deng and his ideas have been lauded in the official media, promoting China's pre-eminent leader to a status almost higher than that of Mao Zedong. The near 2,000 delegates voted unanimously to accept a report presented last week by Jiang Zemin, party general secretary. In it Jiang said that China would develop a 'socialist market economy', where prices were deregulated, government would be taken out of state industry and foreign investment encouraged. The selection of the new members are in line with Deng's instructions to choose leading officials who were 'revolutionary, young, knowledgeable and specialised'. The committee, expanded from 175 to 189 full members together with 130 alternates, saw a rise in provincial representation at the expense of the central government. It also exhibited a bias towards the university-educated and, by China's standards, the young. Nearly half are new faces. The Xinhua news agency sought to emphasise the youth of the party's new central committee and its ability to provide China's future leaders. It noted 61 per cent of the committee members were below 55 years old. This was 'evidence that the Communist party of China is full of vigour and vitality and has a train of successors', it quoted 'sources' as saying. None of the children of the party's elderly leaders was appointed to the central committee, either as full or alternate members, despite intense speculation beforehand that many, including Deng's daughter Deng Nan, would be selected. The congress dumped some ideological hardliners, and about 100 of the outgoing committee's members stepped down to make way for the younger officials.</p>

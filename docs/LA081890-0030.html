			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECRUITING STORIES CAN HAVE DIFFERENT ENDING SECOND TIME AROUND  </P> <P> Jim Harrick, criticized by some earlier in the year for the Bruins' poor  recruiting, looks like a genius now because he had a stockpile of scholarship  money available for Southern California's top two prep players, Ed O'Bannon and  Shon Tarver.  </P> <P> While at Pepperdine, Harrick benefited from transfers such as Jon Korfas, Tom  Lewis and Dwayne Polee. Coaches do not always win the recruiting war the first  time around, but, in some instances, there is a long-term benefit for finishing  a close second.  </P> <P> MICHAEL ZAPOLSKI  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

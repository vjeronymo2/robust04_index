			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Selivanov report in the "Power" column: "Who </F> Controls the Situation in Ukraine. Or Why Mr. Radetskyy Ignores  President Kravchuk's Position"]    [Text] Because the final session of the former Ukrainian  Supreme Soviet took place a few days ago, the legislative branch  in the republic has temporarily ceased to exist. For now, it is  hard to tell how long this will last. Therefore, during this  period all power in Ukraine has been concentrated in the hands  of Leonid Kravchuk, who is to continue in his presidential post  for approximately two more months. Nonetheless, judging by some  signs, Mr. Kravchuk's control of the situation is rather weak.  The most graphic evidence of this is the openly rebellious  behavior by Ukraine Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, who at  the talks in Sevastopol completely ignored his president's  position on the issue of Black Sea Fleet basing, even at the  risk of thwarting the talks.    Observers consider at least three versions explaining the  situation that has arisen. First, it cannot be ruled out that  Kravchuk and Radetskyy are acting on an earlier coordinated  plan. The president is demonstrating his inherent peace-loving  nature, while the defense minister, who has ostensibly "gotten  out of hand," is "misbehaving" somewhat. Yet at stake is Mr.  Kravchuk's personal prestige and his ability to control the  situation. He would hardly agree to have his competence called  into question. The second version is based on the assumption  that at the talks in Moscow, Leonid Kravchuk went too far in  agreeing to the principle of the navies' separate basing, and  then, recognizing his mistake, left Vitaliy Radetskyy to make up  for his blunder. It is hard to believe, however, that such an  experienced and cunning politician as Leonid Kravchuk, who  carefully calculates his moves, could have disgraced himself so.    Since the first two explanations of the situation that has  emerged in the relations between the Ukrainian president and his  defense minister are inconsistent, there is the last one -- most  simple and alarming. Leonid Kravchuk is gradually losing  effective control of the events. If this assumption is true,  therefore not only legislative but also any supreme political  authority is absent in Ukraine.    The resultant period of power vacuum can be taken advantage  of primarily by various national-patriotic organizations. In  light of this the manifestation of unusual independence on the  part of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, where the most avid  supporters of the national-patriotic idea are concentrated, is a  more than alarming symptom.    According to some leaders of the national-radical  orientation, such as Mikhail Goryn and Stepan Khmara, the  patriotic forces of Ukraine have literally just a few weeks to  save the great power from another enslavement. This time frame  is dictated by the date of the upcoming June presidential  elections. The elections will not gain anything for the  national patriots, while the advent to power of a leader like  Leonid Kuchma is regarded by them as the end of the history of  independent Ukraine. The wish of the "true patriots" to prevent  such an end is quite natural. Which methods will be used for  this, the very near future will show. Yet it is clear already  at this stage that they can be rather far from democracy, which  has not justified the "nationalists'" hopes: That much is clear  to anyone today. Signs are that Vitaliy Radetskyy, who is  showing an "independence" rather unusual for a defense minister,  has been assigned a far from minor role in the pending events.</p>

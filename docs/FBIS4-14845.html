			<p>BFN     [Text] Georgia's chief negotiator at the talks with  Abkhazia, Jaba Ioseliani, declared upon his return to Tbilisi  from the Georgian-Abkhazi line of confrontation Thursday night  that it is time "to do away with the situation where Georgian  militiamen are in the hiding out in the zone of the conflict."  "It is war time now, and those who evade their duty, primarily  youth and refugees, must be expelled from Georgia," he stressed.    In his words, "a critical situation has come about" in the  Kodor gorge. Georgia's Defence Ministry has "taken no steps to  help the local residents, whose squad numbers only 150 men," he  said. "The militiamen lack weapons, most of them are untrained  soldiers, however, despite that, they have been holding the  gorge and have been resisting the nearly 2000-men-strong Abkhazi  unit mainly thanks to the mountainous terrain," Ioseliani noted.    On the incident in parliament on March 31 and a rally of  advocates of the late ex-president Gamsakhurdia, he declared  that "he was shocked by the site." "What rallies can be held  and what birthdays of the traitor-president can be celebrated  today? All his followers should be isolated, and that will be  done to restore order to the country without law, where everyone  does as he pleases", Ioseliani emphasized.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLAND'S NOBLE RESISTANCE;  </P> <P> KONSPIRA SOLIDARITY UNDERGROUND BY MACIEJ LOPINSKI, MARCIN MOSKIT AND MARIUSZ  WILK (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS: $24.95; 272 PP., ILLUSTRATED;  0-520-06131-4)  </P> <P> Forming an underground seems to be a typically Polish way of coping with a  political disaster. Since the 19th Century, the best men and women of nearly  each generation have felt compelled to leave their homes and families in order  to plot the overthrow of foreign powers, or to struggle for the country's  independence.  </P> <P> It was no accident, then, that on the night of Dec. 12, 1981, when Gen.  Wojciech Jaruzelski's police started to arrest opposition leaders, those who  managed to escape the net went underground and, after a number of aborted  attempts, formed "Solidarity underground structures," better known as Konspira  -- from the Polish word the conspiracy. Soon Konspira was rumored to reach into  the remotest corners of the country, to have a million regular participants, to  run thousands of illegal Solidarity cells and clandestine publishing  enterprises, even to infiltrate the police and the military.  </P> <P> Was it reality or legend? More significantly, was it the best way to deal with  the Polish predicament -- the discrepancy between aspirations of the society  and the dismal political realities of Brezhnev's final years? Most of the  opposition activists who were arrested endured their detainment with dignity,  and after their release undertook all sorts of independent yet open activities  to preserve the Solidarity spirit and push the government toward some kind of  negotiated solution.  </P> <P> They wrote books and published them abroad or underground, organized  clandestine lectures and seminars, launched a campaign of support for the  victims of repression and the declining economy. There were other, spontaneous  expressions of social defiance: wearing forbidden badges and symbols, laying  flowers at the sites of national martyrdom, boycotting various official  institutions, attending church celebrations and street protests. Was Konspira  really the driving spirit and the organizer of all those actions?  </P> <P> In 1982, three young journalists -- Maciej Lopinski, Marcin Moskit (real name  Zbigniew Gach) and Mariusz Wilk -- decided to seek out seven of the best-known,  and best-hidden, leaders of the underground and ask them directly. The result  of their investigation was a book of interviews now made available to the  American reader. "Konspira," published in 1984 by one of the Poland's  underground houses, received an annual Solidarity award for best independent  publication, yet provoked some heated debates among the opposition leaders.  Even an official pro-Jaruzelski weekly, Polityka, chose to reprint fragments of  the book without the authors' permission, and with some obnoxious commentary.  </P> <P> The story of the underground, told in the leaders' own words, was definitely  less heroic and innocent than many expected. It was a story of great sacrifice  and courage, but also of petty ambitions, personal squabbles and the sense of  growing isolation from the mainstream of the political life. The main redeeming  quality in those partly cocky, partly confessional statements is their great  honesty, the sense of moral responsibility and almost obsessive preoccupation  with purity of means and intentions.  </P> <P> What we see here is a sophisticated resistance aware of the many pitfalls of  "underground mentality." This awareness is eloquently expressed by one of the  most steadfast and unimpeachable Solidarity leaders, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk:  "Although everyone wants to fight for an independent Poland, a self-governing  society, brotherhood and so forth, increasingly we are using dubious and  underhanded methods. Brotherhood becomes a fiction, there's no unity, and  ideals get pushed aside."  </P> <P> Like all underground organizations in history, Konspira had to devote most of  its energy and resources to itself: establishing contacts and setting up safe  houses, training and protecting its people, looking for money and technical  support. Relations with the external world -- the clandestine Solidarity cells  in factories and the society at large -- proved more difficult to manage.  Channels of communication were slow, awareness of the popular moods often  inadequate, and the underground governing body, the Interregional Coordinating  Committee, was hard pressed to find a unified strategy.  </P> <P> Instead of leading and coordinating, Konspira often limited itself to  supporting and evaluating spontaneous initiatives. It was in that area, too,  that the underground suffered occasional setbacks. Some of the strikes and  demonstrations it called for never came off, while others broke out without the  underground's knowledge or approval. Sometimes a letter of support arrived to a  striking factory exactly at the moment when protests were losing momentum, or  the situation was turning dangerous and unmanageable.  </P> <P> The underground's main problem was to justify its existence as something more  than just a symbol of defiance. Yet what was really the long-term purpose of  all its efforts and sacrifices? Contending opinions were voiced in underground  publications but the conclusions often were ambiguous and unconvincing.  </P> <P> The trade-unionist branch pushed for a general strike as a all-out battle with  the government. Some proposed formation of an underground state, with regular  political bodies, its own judicial system and foreign representation, modeled  on the structures that existed under the German occupation. Still others opted  for a broad and loosely organized "civil society" that would maintain social  integrity and prepare the Poles for democracy. The controversy was never fully  resolved.  </P> <P> In the end, the Solidarity underground was denied a spectacular victory, or  even a heroic defeat. In 1988, Jaruzelski's government, encouraged by  Gorbachev's policy of "openness" and convinced that its own methods never would  assure political and economic stability, started to drift cautiously toward a  negotiated solution, resulting in the "round-table agreements" of 1989.  </P> <P> Part of the agreements' success certainly was due to the endurance of the  "underground men" who kept reminding the government, the Polish society and the  world that any political solution must take into account the heritage of  Solidarity. Yet the agreement was outlined by those opposition activists --  mostly intellectuals -- who had been acting openly and seeking some  rapprochement with the reform-minded fractions of the government. The result  was a certain sense of bitterness and disappointment among those who devoted  eight years of their lives to the underground.  </P> <P> "Konspira" contains a fair amount of interesting human material about the  personal motivations, fears and doubts of these men. It is, undoubtedly, a  valuable historical document, and was reprinted recently in Poland by one of  the new private publishing houses. Yet history seems to be moving too fast to  favor careful reevaluations of the past.  </P> <P> Solidarity, cast simultaneously in the role of the government and the  opposition, clearly is struggling with a crisis of identity. The first  non-Communist government, headed by old Solidarity adviser Tadeusz Mazowiecki,  recently became a target of vitriolic criticism from Walesa and the new  centrist bloc, which proposed Walesa as the next president.  </P> <P> Even with hyperinflation halted, Polish productive powers remain in deep  recession, and the economic miracle many secretly hoped for is slow in coming.  Familiar and disturbing sentiments of chauvinism and intolerance begin to be  heard from some marginal groups. Against all that, the period of anti-Communist  struggle may yet be viewed as an era of moral simplicity and purity.  </P> <P> "Konspira's" chief value may be in treating that romantic myth with realism,  without depriving it of its basic nobility.  </P> <P> BOOK MARK: For an excerpt from "Konspira," see Opinion, Page 2.  </P></p>

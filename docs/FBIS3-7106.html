			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Chuan Ditches the Ones Who Shed Blood for </F> Democracy"]    [Text] Last year, the administration of Prime Minister  Chuan Likphai promised to create a park and build a monument to  commemorate the May 1992 bloody political events and a similar  uprising in August 1973 when scores of people disappeared or  were killed.    Till today, however, this promise still remains to be  fulfilled.    On Tuesday, the May 1992 Heroes' Relatives Committee  appealed  to the government to speed up the building of the monument to  remember the deaths of those who took part in the bloody  prodemocracy rallies on Ratchadamnoen Avenue and to wrap up  investigations into the disappearance of some 41 people during  the May crisis.    The anxiety of the families and friends of those who went  missing in May 1992 is understandable. Many of the  pro-democracy demonstrators who disappeared were breadwinners  for their families and their next-of-kin have not been given any  financial assistance whatsoever by the government. Though the  Interior Ministry announced that it had already provided a total  of Bt26 million to 1,359 families of victims of the bloodshed  and would continue to provide assistance until May 1995, it  should be borne in mind that this aid does not extend to the  next-of-kin of the missing.    The problem of those missing after the May massacre has to  be  accepted as a national trauma, even though some quarters in Thai  society might suggest that they are best forgotten.    The May 1992 Heroes' Relatives Committee accused the Chuan  government of having failed to do enough to ensure justice for  the relatives and they felt let down by the administration.    "The government has been negligent on issues concerning the  May victims. This shows the coalition is insincere in getting  to the bottom of the problem and doesn't support democracy in a  meaningful way," said the committee's leader Adun Kheowboriphun  who lost his only son in May 1991, when he was cut down by a  hail of bullets on Ratchadamnoen Avenue.    The question remains: What is the underlying fear that  prevents the Chuan government from letting the public know the  findings of a commission set up by the Anan II administration to  look into the May 1991 events?    The point to be made is that if the public knew the truth  about what really happened, some of the wilder rumours about how  the bodies of the missing were disposed would be dispelled.  Until this is accepted, there will be further argument between  opposing sides and the conflict will never be resolved.    Nearly two years later, we can't help but ask: Was it worth  going out onto the streets, facing police batons and Army  bullets on Ratchadamnoen Avenue, risking our lives and demanding  democracy -- only to get a lameduck government that disregards  everyone's interests but its own?    Democracy in Thailand survives on promises for a better  future and a fear of a return to the brutal past. But now it  seems the promises made by Chuan cannot be fulfilled.    A major message of May 1992 is that an eligible candidate  for  the prime ministership must be an elected MP. The post of the  country's chief executive can no longer be monopolized by army  generals and political appointees. Also, politicians must be  more cautious about their conduct because they can come under  intense scrutiny as a result of heightened public expectations.    But many politicians seem to have forgotten the profound  changes that have taken place around them and remain  pre-occupied with their own narrow self-interests. Political  bickering has become their way of life, to the extent that they  have lost sight of their official duty -- to make decisions on  how to deal effectively with problems facing the country.    Politics in Thailand has become a game of  self-aggrandizement  played by society's well-to-do. Little thought is given to the  people, let alone the pro-democracy protesters who helped place  MPs in their positions of authority and responsibility. The  proposed constitutional amendments are a good example of how  little these politicians care for the people. While the  amendments are of utmost importance to guarantee the rights of  the people, MPs are arguing over the number of points to be  passed at the extraordinary session of Parliament next week.    Instead of displaying his leadership to rein in government  and opposition MPs over this issue, and to help solve many other  problems plaguing the country, Chuan has been behaving like Nero  fiddling away while Rome burns.    Day by day, the prime minister seems to be losing support.  The May relatives have now joined the academics and  pro-democracy movement in not wanting to have anything to do  with him. The message is clear: Whatever government purports to  represent us must also champion our rights. Chuan Likphai has  failed the very people whose loved ones gave their lives for his  government.    The writing on the wall is clear. Since Chuan has, after two  years, failed to shape up, he must now ship out.</p>

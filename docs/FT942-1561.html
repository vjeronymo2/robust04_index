			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US official attacks Canadian wheat marketing A top-ranking official of the US Department of Agriculture took aim at Canada's entire wheat marketing system in a speech made in Fargo, North Dakota on Tuesday, calling the Canadian Wheat Board's operations 'monopolistic' and incompatible with the new free trade climate in North America. The comments, made by Mr Eugene Moos, Undersecretary for International Affairs and Commodity Programmes at the US Department of Agriculture, may indicate that the US will push for an overhaul of Canada's entire grain marketing system, rather than just a short-term fix to a cross-border grain trade dispute, when US agriculture secretary Mr Mike Espy and top trade negotiator Mr Mickey Kantor meet with their Canadian counterparts in Chicago on Monday. The Clinton administration, under pressure from congressmen from farm states bordering Canada, is threatening to impose emergency quotas on wheat imports from Canada, and Canada has promised to retaliate. The US claims Canada is unfairly marketing into US wheat-producing regions, although US flour millers and pasta processors contend that short supplies of high-quality US wheat have forced them to buy from Canada. Mr Moos went beyond the domestic trade issues in his remarks on Tuesday, saying: 'The predatory practices of the Canadian Wheat Board must end'. Although Canada does not directly subsidise grain exports in the way that the US and the European Union do, Mr Moos said the Wheat Board's pricing policies allowed it to undercut subsidising competitors. He said he had asked to be allowed use the US grain export subsidy program, known as EEP, against trade competitors other than the EU, warning: 'We in the USDA intend to use all of the tools at our disposal to encourage other competitors to trade fairly'. Although national grain marketing boards like those in Canada and Australia were not addressed in the recently-concluded Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, they have recently become the focus of unfair trade practice complaints. Mr Winston Wilson, president of the largest US wheat export trade group, said: 'I think it boils down to the fact we are now involved with two free trade agreements with Canada, and we have two different systems of grain marketing that are not very compatible'.</p>

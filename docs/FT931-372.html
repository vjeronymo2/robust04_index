			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Inco plans Dollars 20m charge to restructure alloys unit INCO, the western world's largest nickel producer, will charge USDollars 20m against first-quarter earnings to cover the costs of restructuring its troubled alloys business. The after-tax charge will be about Dollars 13m. The alloys unit, known as Inco Alloys International, has been hit hard by weakening demand, especially from aerospace and defence-related industries, and by increasingly fierce competition. About 60 companies are vying for market share. Inco's alloys and engineered products division lost Dollars 29m last year on sales of Dollars 557m. Alloys account for about half the division's business. More than one third of the loss was incurred in the fourth quarter, and sales for the year fell 48 per cent. The reorganisation includes cutting the workforce by 340 people, or by 12 per cent. Inco said the cost of retirement and severance packages would make up about half of the first-quarter write-off. Production and marketing functions would also be streamlined.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Power benefits delivered Sir, Your leader, 'Littlechild's power gamble' (February 14), gives the reader a misleading and partial analysis of the power generation industry. It is misleading because, by repeated reference to the market power and price-fixing ability of the duopoly generators, it implies their guilt can be taken for granted. Yet in his latest report, as in all his earlier ones, Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, confirms he has found no evidence of any abuse by National Power with regard to its behaviour in the market, pricing or profitability. The article is partial because, while critical of the power generation industry's structure, it omits to recognise any of the benefits it has delivered. For example, electricity pool prices are still below the level predicted by government at the time of privatisation, and competition in generation is increasing faster than anticipated - hence the reduction in our market share in three years from 47 to 35 per cent. Moreover, National Power's wholesale charge for the vast majority of consumers is significantly lower in real terms than before privatisation - 16 per cent for the typical industrial user - and the very largest users would also have enjoyed price reductions had they not lost government subsidies in 1991. Even without them, they are paying on average no more in real terms. Add to that an increase of more than 50 per cent in our productivity, and capital investment, largely on environmental clean-up measures, exceeding our pre-tax profits over the last three years, and I believe that this is firm evidence of the success of privatisation. John Baker, chief executive, National Power, 85 Queen Victoria Street, London ECV 4DP</p>

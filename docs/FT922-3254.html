			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / A slow sprint to the market: Why one survived where others failed When MFI's managers decided to buy the company out from an unhappy merger with Asda the food retailer, in November 1987, they thought they were leaving the starting blocks for a two-year sprint to the stock market. By early 1989, talk was of a Pounds 1bn float that autumn which would give investors in the Pounds 718m buy-out - including the directors and managers  -a rapid and racy return. The 350 managers who had each invested between Pounds 200 and Pounds 80,000 would share up to 26.25 per cent of the group's equity if the flotation target was met. But by late spring of 1989 sales growth was slowing, profit margins slipping. Something was going wrong. By July MFI admitted it was missing its profit targets. And in August the group agreed a refinancing with its bankers involving a Pounds 35m rights issue and a deferral of Pounds 60m of debt repayments. The experience demonstrates that combining the high operational gearing of a furniture retailer with the financial gearing of a buy-out can rapidly turn from success to disaster. MFI's survival when others, notably Lowndes Queensway, failed is a mark of the management's efforts. There is wide acclaim for the team, headed by Mr Derek Hunt, which has stuck together through thick and thin. Mr Paul Deacon, retail analyst at Goldman Sachs, says: 'MFI is one of Britain's outstanding retailers, and it all comes down to the management.' Unlike Lowndes Queensway, the MFI team had run the group for some years before the buy-out. Even so Mr Hunt readily admits that running a business with Pounds 500m of debt through the worst recession since the 1930s has taught him some lessons. When the fall in sales first hit the group in 1989 it tried cutting its prices, but soon found that did no good. People had just stopped buying. After that gross margins were put up again and have been held throughout the recession. It also dawned on the group that the old system where stock was held in the shop and customers took it away - on a roof rack borrowed from MFI if necessary - could be replaced by an efficient delivery system so long as customers could be assured of a delivery date. Computer systems linking the shops to the factory and warehouse made that possible, and also meant stocks could be slashed. Stocks have fallen from Pounds 106.5m at the 1989 year-end to Pounds 69.6m in the latest balance sheet. 'MFI is a very different animal from the one it was in 1987,' Mr Hunt says. In spite of the recession it is a 'stronger, better organised business'. Although the debt burden has pushed the group into losses, at the trading level it has made profits through the recession. In the four-and-a-half years since the buy-out, MFI has paid Pounds 260m in interest and invested Pounds 250m. With its debt reduced from Pounds 500m to Pounds 100m via the float, the group will immediately see a sharp rise in pre-tax profits. That should be followed, analysts hope, by a reversal of the gearing effect which cut profits so savagely in the recession. A small improvement in sales should bring a big rise in profits. The managers who backed the buy-out have seen their original incentives vanish. A new plan was agreed with the shareholders before serious work on the flotation began. Under this scheme the managers will share an Pounds 11m bonus. Good, but nothing like the original bonanza.  --------------------------------------------- UK FURNITURE &amp; CARPET RETAILERS  --------------------------------------------- Market share (percentage)                     1989   1990   1991  --------------------------------------------- MFI                  9.2    9.3    9.4 Allied Maples        3.3    3.0    2.9 Courts               1.4    1.5    1.6 Magnet Retail        na   na   1.5 Cantors              0.8    0.9    1.0 IKEA                 0.4    0.5    0.7 Saxon Hawk           1.2    0.6    0.7 Perring              0.4    0.4    0.5 Habitat              0.9    0.7    0.4 Lowndes Queensway    5.7    2.6    na  --------------------------------------------- Sources: Business Monitor, Verdict Estimates  --------------------------------------------- Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Japan quells speculation of deal to cut discount rate JAPAN'S government yesterday tried to quell speculation that it had secretly agreed with Washington to cut its official discount rate from 2.5 per cent. Mr Hiroshisa Fujii, the finance minister, said Thursday's dollar-buying intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was not the result of a new agreement between Japan and the US on the yen-dollar exchange rate. Market speculation about a bilateral deal, which came after a statement by Mr Lawrence Summers, US treasury under-secretary, welcoming a recent decline in Japan's money rates, helped support the dollar in the Tokyo market yesterday. The dollar closed up Y2.47 to close at Y104.45. It closed in London at Y104.85. While Japanese officials welcomed the Fed's intervention, they admitted that the trend towards a higher yen was unlikely to abate until Japan took concrete steps to deal with its huge trade surplus by stimulating the domestic economy. The dollar's rebound came as Japan's Economic Planning Agency submitted a gloomy monthly report on the economy to the cabinet. The August report revised the agency's earlier judgment that the Japanese economy had bottomed out. It said the economy was in an adjustment phase and signs of recovery appeared to be faltering because of new adverse factors, including a cold summer and the sharp appreciation of the yen. The report also said personal consumption and corporate capital spending remained sluggish. Industrial production was stagnant while the employment situation was deteriorating. The report confirmed growing concerns in Japan that the economy was in a delicate state and needed substantial fiscal and monetary measures to help it on the road to sustained growth. The government has so far focused on steps to pass on the benefits of a higher yen to consumers and deregulate Japan's markets as the pillars of its September economic stimulus package. Although it has not indicated whether fiscal and monetary measures would be included in a package of economic stimulus measures to be delivered next month, recognition was growing among government officials that such measures might need to be considered. Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, trade minister, said yesterday the Japanese public wanted fiscal and monetary measures to be included in the stimulus package and indicated that steps such as a cut in the official discount rate should be considered. Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, deputy director general of the Economic Planning Agency, mentioned further that fiscal and monetary measures were not being excluded from consideration. The government is also facing growing pressure to implement income tax cuts and issue deficit-covering bonds but has so far resisted these calls on the grounds that the revenue base was already severely squeezed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Svetlana Sukhova report under the "Situation Regarding </F> Crimea" rubric: "They Write Down `Crimea' and Bear `Donbass' in  Mind"]    [Text] The Ukrainian parliament decision to deprive Crimea  of economic and political autonomy (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 25  and 26 February) has given rise to widespread dissatisfaction  both in Crimea and in Ukraine itself. Yesterday Crimean  President Yuriy Meshkov, when asked about the legitimacy of his  trips to Moscow and the agreements he concluded with the Russian  authorities, said that he "does not have to report to the  Ukrainian president." Ukraine's parliamentarians and president  themselves have long been aware of the unfeasibility of the 24  February resolution. Currently, however, Kiev fears that not  only Simferopol, but also eastern Ukrainian regions may demand  autonomy, which would be much more dangerous.    Sergey Kunitsyn, Ukrainian deputy and chairman of the Union  of Support for the Republic of Crimea, said on the evening of 28  February that the Crimean Supreme Soviet would not adhere to the  parliamentary decree on the status of Crimea. In his view,  "There is no mechanism to enforce the decree" and there are  virtually no Ukrainian state structures on Crimean territory  except for the army. The most important thing, Sergey Kunitsyn  said, is not to give Ukraine a pretext for "rash actions."  President Leonid Kravchuk, for his part, is trying to frighten  Simferopol with precisely this turn of events. He expressed his  confidence that Crimea would not embark on the path of  confrontation, "otherwise this will cause harm." He recalled  that Crimea is an integral, albeit autonomous, part of Ukraine,  hence any actions aimed at noncompliance with this provision  will be illegal. Kravchuk attempted to sweeten the pill,  however, as he said that "the regions should have greater  autonomy, particularly with regard to the economy and culture."  Leonid Grach, leader of the Crimean Communist Party, which is  growing stronger by the day, believes that the resolution on  Crimea expresses "the ambitions of lame-ducks," but the problem  concerning the parliamentary decision may be resolved by holding  elections for all branches of power. He expressed his hope that  Kravchuk will be prudent enough not to enforce the provision on  appointing a representative of the Ukrainian president in Crimea  so as not to heighten tensions.    In the view of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts, tensions over  Ukrainian integrity may heighten not only inside the  Moscow-Kiev-Simferopol triangle. Even at present the  centrifugal forces in eastern Ukraine with its predominantly  Russian-speaking population are giving Kiev a headache. By  passing strict but effectively unenforceable resolutions on  Crimea, politicians in Kiev bear Donbass in mind, too. This  consideration will inevitably prod them to demonstrate toughness  regarding the "separatists." Harsh statements and resolutions,  however, tend to wear out with excessive use.</p>

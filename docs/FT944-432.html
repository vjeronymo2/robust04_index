			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Japan's surplus turns upward Japan's surplus in trade and services in November showed the first year-on-year rise in five months, according to a preliminary report by the finance ministry. The current account surplus rose by an unadjusted 15 per cent to Dollars 9.67bn after falling for four months in both yen and dollar terms. For the January-November period, the current account surplus dropped 9.7 per cent in yen terms and 1.9 per cent in dollar terms. The trade surplus, which makes up the bulk of the current account surplus, increased by 20 per cent in November to Dollars 10.94bn. Although imports increased by 21 per cent, their impact was offset by a similar rise in exports. The finance ministry believes, nevertheless, that Japan's surplus is on a downward trend. The surplus with the US increased in the first half by 15 per cent to Dollars 26.24bn and that with south-east Asia by 21 per cent to Dollars 33.81bn. However, its surplus with the European Union declined by 37 per cent to Dollars 11.96bn. Lex, Page 10</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Farmers attack plan to finance milk scheme Farmers' leaders yesterday attacked the Milk Marketing Board for threatening to deduct millions of pounds from milk producers to finance deregulation of the market in November. The board said it had not yet received written loan agreements from its banks for the Pounds 30m it needed to wind up its operations and establish Milk Marque, the voluntary producers' co-operative that will succeed it. In a letter to the 28,000 dairy farmers in England and Wales, it said: 'As a matter of prudence, in the unlikely event that the financing arrangements do not come to fruition, then it will be necessary to deduct up to 4p per litre for October supplies.' The National Farmers' Union said a levy of this size would raise Pounds 37m, equivalent to about Pounds 1,000 for an average farmer with 70 cows. Sir David Naish, NFU president, was seeking urgent clarification from the board about when the money, if deducted, would be repaid. He said: 'For the past 18 months the MMB has assured us that financial arrangements for the scheme of reorganisation were in place. Had we known this was not the case, we would have insisted that this problem be dealt with much earlier.' Many farmers were shocked at the threat, especially those who have chosen to sell direct to a dairy company, rather than through Milk Marque. Mr Chris Wood, a Cumbrian producer, said the board's levy would cost him Pounds 1,600. 'Why should I finance somebody else's business?' he asked. Mr Andrew Dare, the board's chief executive, blamed the delay in finalising the bank loans on uncertainty caused by the Dairy Trade Federation's unsuccessful High Court challenge to deregulation last week. But he admitted that the loans were needed because the flotation of Dairy Crest, the board's processing arm, had been postponed. Mr Dare said he hoped that the loans would be agreed in the next fortnight and insisted that a levy on farmers was 'very remote'. But he indicated that, in the event of a levy, the money would not be repaid. 'It's a financing of the scheme, it's not a loan,' he said.</p>

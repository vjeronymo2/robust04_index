			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Observer: Dog-lover renews lead Where Passat failed, will Kriss break through? He is the pet basset hound of the European Community's new internal market commissioner Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, who looks likely to give a renewed lead to the EC's effort to get Britain and Ireland to lift their stringent quarantine rules on imported pets. Passat, on the other hand, became a canine symbol of the force of Anglo-Irish fears of the spread of rabies when he and his owner Dieter Rogalla, a German member of the European Parliament, were banned from crossing the Channel on new year's eve. Rogalla - who was making a deliberate attempt to test the rules which advocates of a pure border-free Europe believe needlessly hamper free movement - was stopped before he and his pet could board the ferry at Calais. The turn-back seemed to confirm Brussels officials' suggestions that the commission had shelved plans for legislation to loosen the quarantine by such means as 'pet passports' giving animals have a clean bill of health. But 61-year-old Vanni d'Archirafi, a former Italian ambassador to Spain and Germany, indicated yesterday that the measure had certainly not been abandoned. Although he had never tried to test the rules, Kriss's owner added, it was perhaps his love of dogs that explained why his country had never offered him a diplomatic post in Britain.</p>

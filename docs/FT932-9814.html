			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Italy's tangle ITALIAN CAPITALISM, like Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, appears to exist in two strikingly different guises. Its outward-turning features radiate the resourcefulness which since the second world war has given Italy one of Europe's fastest economic growth rates. This performance, while strongest among Italy's array of medium-sized companies, has turned some leaders of large Italian groups into international figures. It has also rewarded the country with a GDP per head (based on official figures) higher than that of the UK and united Germany. The secret countenance of corporate Italy is much less pleasant to behold, but until recently has been mainly hidden. This face has now been revealed by investigations into corruption during the past 15 months in which more than 1,000 senior politicians and businessmen, many of them from Italy's leading corporations, have been implicated. Italian executives stand accused of connivance in a network of systematic bribery which has defrauded large sums from the public purse and helped keep in power a generation of flawed politicians. As a result of the energy of the magistrature and the long-suppressed indignation of the public, the edifice of malpractice has started to crumble. For the larger companies caught up in the fray, an exercise in damage limitation is under way. Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector group, which has seen more than half a dozen of its top executives arrested, interrogated or briefly detained in corruption inquiries, yesterday unveiled a strict code of business ethics to stop Fiat employees accepting payment in money or in kind from unscrupulous outsiders. On one level, this is an attempt to demonstrate that Fiat is making a genuine effort to adopt more transparent practices in line with those ruling, say, in the US. On another level, by mounting an internal and external campaign against kickbacks, Fiat seems to be trying to win less harsh treatment for its executives ensnared in the judicial net. Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive, who previously complained about over-inquisitive magistrates, has switched to helping them with their inquiries, and exhorting other company chiefs to do the same. Fiat's appeal to Italian industrialists may turn out to be a full-hearted bid to support the country's political reforms. But if the company is simply trying to avoid prosecutions of individuals on the grounds that they were forced to misbehave by the politicians, this is likely to bring discredit. A spirit of co-operation - seen most vividly in Italy's close-knit business networks - has been a vital source of its economic dynamism. But when such networks give rise to self-serving or even criminal collusion among corporations or among corporations, politicians and the state, they are consistent neither with desirable standards of public morality, nor with Italy's wish to move closer to the head of Europe's economic league. The programme of privatisation of state enterprises is one way of freeing Italy's considerable reserves of dynamism. Yet unless Italian companies co-operate fully in the current attempt to unravel an inefficient and self-destructive tangle of corruption, the dream of a reformed Italy will remain unfulfilled.</p>

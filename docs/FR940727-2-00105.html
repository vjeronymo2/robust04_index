(``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The rule change amends Sections 1(b) and 1(c) to Article III of the NASD By-Laws and Schedule C to the By-Laws to clarify the process by which an applicant applies for membership in the NASD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD amended the proposed rule change three times subsequent to its original filing on March 11, 1994. The first amendment changed the requirement that an applicant for membership in the NASD submit a copy of its ``current submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 15b1&hyph;2(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934'' to require that the applicant submit ``Form BD filed with the Central Registration Depository.'' This amendment is technical in nature in that it corrects a deficiency that arose out of the 1992 amendments to the broker-dealer registration process which deleted Rule 15b1&hyph;2(c) and requires that Form BD be submitted to the NASD.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31660 (Dec. 28, 1992), 58 FR 11 (Jan. 4, 1993) (adoption of rule amendments to broker-dealer registration and reporting requirements). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second amendment reflected the results of the NASD membership vote concerning the NASD's proposed rule change.

Description of the Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD seeks to amend its By-Laws and Rules with respect to the procedural aspects of the membership application process. The NASD has identified instances where its By-Laws and rules are inconsistent and where its actual practices are inconsistent with its rules. This rule change corrects these aberrations and further clarifies the membership application process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Amendments Concerning the Role of the District Committee in the Membership Application Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD By-Laws currently provide that any application for membership shall be referred to the District Committee of the NASD district in which the applicant has its principal place of business. The By-Laws further provide that the appropriate District Committee shall determine whether the applicant satisfies the NASD's admission requirements. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  In contrast, the NASD's rules, Schedule C to the By-Laws, provide that the District Office staff initially determine an applicant's eligibility for membership. The rules do, however, further set forth procedures for review by the District Committee, upon request by the applicant, of the District Office's determination. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> NASD Manual, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  By-Laws, Art. III, Secs. 1(b) &amp; (c), (CCH) &para; 1311. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Schedules to the By-Laws, Schedule C, Part I, Secs. (1) &amp; (2), (CCH) &para; 1783. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the NASD, the actual practice is for the appropriate District Committee to determine an applicant's eligibility for membership. The NASD has determined to amend its By-Laws and Schedule C to allow each District Committee to designate a Subcommittee to act, under limited circumstances, on behalf of the District Committee. The proposed rule change, therefore, amends the NASD By-Laws and Schedule C to provide that all initial applications for membership be reviewed by either the District Committee or a Subcommittee of the District Committee, with a right of appeal to the full District Committee. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD has also amended the By-Laws by deleting the explicit requirement that determinations of the District Committee (and now Subcommittees designated by the District Committee) be made by a majority of its members. The NASD indicated that it removed this requirement because it believes that the requirement that a determination be made by a vote presumes that the vote will be a majority of the members of the District Committee or Subcommittee designated by the District Committee.

Amendments to Schedule C <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD has also submitted ministerial amendments to Schedule C designed to clarify the NASD's procedures concerning the application process. These include amendments to Part I of Schedule C to the By-Laws: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Subsection (1)(a), clarifying that an applicant must provide other relevant information and documents requested by the District Office staff; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (1)(a)(6), clarifying that an applicant must provide other relevant information and documents requested by the District Office staff; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (1)(b), clarifying that the scheduling of an applicant's pre-membership interview and the determination of which responsible personnel shall appear on behalf of the applicant at such interview will be determined by the District Office staff; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (2)(a) clarifying that it is the determination of the designated Subcommittee, rather than the District Office, which will be reviewed by the District Committee upon request of the applicant; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (2)(a) clarifying that the applicant's request for review must be filed within 15 calendar days after notification of the Subcommittee's determination; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (2)(b) clarifying that, in connection with review by the District Committee, an applicant is entitled to appear before a Hearing Subcommittee of the District Committee and that no member of the District Committee who served as a member of the Subcommittee originally designated to review the applicant's submission and no member of the Hearing Subcommittee shall participate in the determination resulting from the District Committee's review; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (2)(c) clarifying that the District Committee's determination of the record developed before it shall be made independent of the determination of the Subcommittee designated by the District Committee; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (2)(d) clarifying that the District Committee's determination shall be subject to review by the National Business Conduct Committee (``NBCC'') upon request made by the applicant filed within 15 calendar days after the date of notification to the applicant by the District Committee of its determination; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

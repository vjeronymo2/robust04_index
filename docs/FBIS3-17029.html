			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Early this morning, Russia's Defense Minister Army  General Pavel Grachev, left for Tajikistan.    [Begin Grachev recording] First, these are planned exercises  involving units from the 201st [motorized rifle] Division.  Second, they are coalition exercises, since subunits from the  Armed Forces of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan will participate in  the exercises. The whole essence of these exercises is that for  the first time, the exercises are taking place with the subunits  of various states, that is, CIS states.    I have set myself the main task of checking the combat  readiness of the units in the 201st Division, their military  training, the coordination of the subunits, and also the  individual training of NCOs, privates, and officers. [end  recording]    [Correspondent] But it is not just the joint exercises that  interest the minister; Grachev is taking a collection of musical  instruments on behalf of the Russian Children's Foundation.  Humanitarian aid is also going with him, sent by General  Burlakov, the commander of the Western Group of Forces. All  this is for the children of the 201st Division of Russian troops  in Tajikistan.</p>

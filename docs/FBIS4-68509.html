			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Ostapov, correspondent: "(!) American </F> Engines Will Lift Russian ILs Into the Air: Plans of the  Ilyushin Aviation Complex"]    [Text] During yesterday's  press conference, dedicated to the 60th anniversary of the S.V.  Iliushin Aviation Complex and the 100th anniversary of the birth  of the founder of this design bureau, it was announced that the  firm's primary task today is to return Ilyushin products to the  world market. In order to accomplish this, the aviation complex  intends to cooperate with the American firm of Pratt &amp;  Whitney.  Yevgeniy Ostapov, correspondent, tells about the Ilyushin plans,  as they were announced at the press conference.    The S.M. Ilyushin Aviation Complex today has the OKB (Bureau  of Experimental Design), production experience, and a flight  testing base in Zhukovskiy, where around 5,000 persons are  employed. The Voronezh and Tashkent aircraft plants are occupied  with the serial production of IL aircraft. Without halting work  on military projects (seven percent of total work), the aviation  complex considers as its main task the design of passenger and  transport aircraft needed by Russian aviation. A great deal of  attention is being devoted to implementing an international  program based on cooperation with Pratt &amp; Whitney, the  American  engine construction firm, and the Collins Company, manufacturer  of aviation equipment. On April 6, 1993, flight testing was  begun on a wide-fuselage, long-range airliner, the Il-96M,  equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines--the first achievement  of  this cooperation. Comparing the Il-96M with the Boeing 777,  Genrikh Novozhilov, general designer of the aviation complex,  noted that they are very similar in their characteristics, but  the four-engined Ilyushin aircraft requires a great outlay for  operational expenses.    At yesterday's press conference it was noted that during a  meeting between representatives of Russian air and space  companies and Viktor Chernomyrdin on April 6th, the Prime  Minister promised state support and loans for manufacturing the  Il-96M at the Voronezh aircraft plant. The production plan calls  for constructing 24 airliners per year. The Prime Minister also  gave his support to the Pratt &amp; Whitney program for improving  the Russian aircraft engine PS-90A, produced by the Perm Motors  association. The new engines will be used in the Il-96-300,  Il-96M/T, TU-204, and Il-76 aircraft, as well as in gas-pumping  stations and electric generator plants. In addition, Viktor  Chernomyrdin also approved a program for creating a unified  aircraft construction complex at the site of the S.V. Ilyushin  complex and the Voronezh Aircraft Plant. The question of  including the Tashkent Aviation Association in one complex will  be decided during negotiations with the government of Uzbekistan.</p>

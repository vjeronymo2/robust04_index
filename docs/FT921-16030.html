			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Peak year for S&amp;P downgrades RECORD levels of corporate debt were last year downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's, one of the main Wall Street rating agencies. The figures underline the extent to which leverage taken on by companies in the 1980s is still compounding the recession. S&amp;P said yesterday downgrades covered Dollars 509.7bn of corporate debt, up from Dollars 500.1bn in 1990. It did, however, offer some hope when it disclosed that the ratio of downgrades to upgrades improved slightly. In 1990, 766 corporate debt issues were downgraded, while 200 were upgraded; in 1991, the figures were 696 and 220. Although the figures cover all debt issues monitored by S&amp;P on an international basis, the rating agency confirmed that most of the downgrades related to US-based corporate issuers. In large part, problems in specific sectors explained the dismal picture. For example, S&amp;P noted that debt of the 'Big Three' car companies - Chrysler, Ford and General Motors - together with their related entities, amounted to Dollars 250m, nearly half the corporate debt downgraded. In the troubled airline industry, ratings for seven of the 11 leading carriers not already in default were reduced. And in the financial sector, S&amp;P said that institutions 'continued to experience stress', although it added that the pace of downgrades had slowed. It said that 352 debt issues by commercial banks, finance companies, insurers, and thrift and brokerage firms were downgraded last year, compared with 394 rating reductions in the previous year. Offsetting this, there were 40 upgrades, against 44 in 1990. Big US commercial banks which saw their ratings reduced included Wells Fargo and Security Pacific. A significant number of Japanese, British, French and Nordic banks also suffered downgrades. In the troubled US life insurance industry, rating reductions outpaced improvements by a ratio of 25:2 - with the problems blamed largely on the quality of some investment portfolios, especially those with heavy property exposure. The generally poor picture was mitigated slightly by some upgradings of former junk bond debt. The most prominent beneficiary was RJR Nabisco, the huge tobacco and food group, where Dollars 12bn of outstanding debt moved to investment grade status. Improvements were also seen at Safeway, the west coast supermarket group, and Owens Illinois, the fibreglass company. Outside the corporate sector, the rating agency noted that municipal debt also suffered record rating reductions, with Dollars 53.1bn worth downgraded. The number of issues downgraded increased by 29 per cent last year, with eight states - California, Connecticut, New Jersey, Illinois, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island - seeing their debt ratings reduced.</p>

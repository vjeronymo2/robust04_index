			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / The FT Interview: Mind your language - Jacques Toubon 'My great desire is not to prevent the French from speaking whatever language they like,' says the man whose name, Jacques Toubon, will for ever be attached to the law of August 4 1994, regulating the use of the French language. 'What I want is to make it just as modern, just as - dare I say it? - 'fashionable' to speak French as to speak English.' Had the minister of culture and 'francophonie', now known to many of his compatriots as 'Jack Allgood', just broken his own law by using an English word while speaking in his official capacity and on public premises? That would be for the courts to decide, if anyone prosecutes. The official glossary of French words which Mr Toubon wanted to append to his law was struck out by the Constitutional Council as an infringement of the 'free communication of thought and of opinion' proclaimed by the Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789. This means that 'you can still oblige people to speak French, but they can speak whatever French they like  -which obviously leaves it to the courts to decide, in the last resort, what is French.' Mr Toubon is a close ally of Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist mayor of Paris, former prime minister and now for the third time presidential candidate. But he insists his language policy is part of a general strategy adopted by the Balladur government, aimed both at developing French culture abroad and at strengthening the links within the French-speaking world, of which the most important is of course the language itself. Indeed, he claims the loudest demand for action to defend French in France came from other French-speaking countries, which are anxious to join with France 'in proposing an alternative to the Anglo-Saxon model of the universe'. And he clearly relishes the task of defending this alternative in an interview with the Financial Times, a newspaper seen by many French people as heading the Anglo-Saxon invasion of the continent. 'I'm a strong believer in learning foreign languages,' Mr Toubon declares. 'What I don't want is a language which would be neither a foreign language nor my own. I want French, English, Russian - but as languages, in the plural. I want the English of Shakespeare, not of Microsoft.' His nightmare is that in 50 years France would have a 'tribal' linguistic structure, with executives speaking English, immigrants speaking their own languages, ordinary people speaking 'the language of television - 400 words, with every kind of sloppiness', and 'in the middle the language of the administration . . . and perhaps the language of intellectuals and professors'. This, he says, would be 'a catastrophe: it would mean that our society, already torn apart by so many other things, would not only tear itself apart but the fragments would be incapable of understanding each other'. Mr Toubon brushes aside the argument that language cannot be decided by law. In France, he says, 'the state has always had its word to say', ever since the 17th century when Richelieu instituted the French Academy. It was in this spirit that he fought his successful battle last year to keep cultural products, especially film and television, outside the purview of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, preserving France's right to subsidise its film industry and to reserve a part of its air time for European products. In the same spirit he is now engaged in another battle, aimed at ensuring the European Union as a whole takes advantage of this 'cultural exception' and acts to preserve the diversity of European culture. Largely thanks to French pressure Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, EU commissioner for culture, is now bringing forward plans to tighten European broadcasting quotas and to ban advertising on new electronic information services. Mr Toubon accepts that some countries, such as Britain, will choose not to implement the 1989 'television without frontiers' directive, which says that a majority of TV programmes shown in Europe should be European-made. But, he insists, countries such as France which do apply the directive must be able to apply it to all TV signals they receive, as well as those which they produce. Otherwise, he says, someone like Mr Ted Turner, the US media magnate, can broadcast from UK territory by satellite 'into Europe, including those countries which apply the TWF directive, whatever programmes he likes, including 100 per cent American cartoons'. France has banned Mr Turner's products from its cable network, but the legal status of this decision is unclear. Mr Toubon wants the EU to ban such unauthorised cross-frontier broadcasts, and also to extend the directive to cover 'new information techniques, namely those which are generally called multimedia'. He also wants to expand the EU media programme to give increased EU and national aid to the production, and especially the distribution, of European films 'and, by extension, to the films of countries linked to Europe, for instance the southern film industries in Africa, Mexico, Brazil, etc'. His object, he explains, is 'to maintain the diversity of film production in the world'. He rejects the suggestion that 'all you need to do is make films that people actually want to see', arguing it is up to states, and by extension the EU, to ensure that people can still enjoy a real choice of films and television programmes rather than being limited to ones which reflect 'the same model, the same state of mind, the same aesthetic'. In this spirit he wants to negotiate a convention with other governments to make the mutual recognition of high school diplomas conditional on their inclusion of a compulsory second foreign language, alongside the inevitable English. Obviously he hopes that in many non-French-speaking countries French would be the most popular choice, but he suggests that Spanish and German also have much to gain. Mr Toubon hopes to enlist the support of the German presidency for these ideas during the Franco-German summit in Bonn today and tomorrow, which he will attend. After that he plans to use the French presidency to push them forward early next year, leaving his fellow-Latins from Spain and Italy to finish the job. He knows he has a fight on his hands with the UK government, but claims to have heard that even British delegates in Brussels are now adopting 'more conciliatory' positions.</p>

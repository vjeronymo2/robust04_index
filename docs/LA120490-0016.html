			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> PHILLIPS MAY PLAY IF PLAYOFFS POSSIBLE  </P> <P> Charger Coach Dan Henning said he would consider asking nose tackle Joe  Phillips to come back off injured reserve if the Chargers are still in the  playoff hunt when they play the Raiders in the season finale.  </P> <P> Phillips has been on injured reserve since he was assaulted in Mission Beach on  Sept. 26.  </P> <P> Phillips has been working out at the stadium the past several weeks. Henning  said he hasn't yet received word on when Phillips will be cleared by doctors to  play football.  </P> <P> Rookie tight end Derrick Walker has been more than adequate as a replacement  for Joe Caravello, who is out for the rest of the season with a knee injury.  </P> <P> "You would have no idea . . . that this guy is a rookie," Henning said. "He has  played the way you would expect a veteran to play at that spot."  </P> <P> Rookie cornerback Donald Frank, who was beaten badly on a 37-yard pass from Ken  O'Brien to Rob Moore in the fourth quarter of Sunday's victory over the Jets,  may have to put in some extra time in front of the chalk board this week.  Henning said Frank should have covered the outside on that pattern, but instead  went toward the middle of the field where he would have had help from the  safety.  </P> <P> "We've got to go back and lay the law down and tell him what the philosophy of  that particular coverage is," Henning said.

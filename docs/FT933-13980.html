			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Arts: Dvorak's 'Dimitrij' - Opera On first meeting Dvorak's opera Dimitrij (1882, much revised later), it was reassuring to find so many familiar characters from the Pushkin-Mussorgsky Boris Godunov (1869-72); for this is the story about what happened after the death of Boris. 'Dimitrij' is indeed the Pretender Dmitri, a lusty tenor still, falling in love with the Tsarina Xenia (a mature young woman now) whilst almost wedding Marina, the scheming Polish princess whom Mussorgsky added to Boris as female interest. Shuisky continues to scheme too, though he has become a baritone, and Dmitri's supposed royal mother Marfa is re-enlisted for new crises. I have been unable to learn whether Dvorak knew anything about Mussorgsky's ground-breaking work, but the evidence internal to Dimitrij would suggest not. Probably he and his librettist began from Pushkin alone. In Czech regions the piece was warmly received for a few years, but it scarcely travelled. Tuesday's Queen Elizabeth Hall concert performance by the Kensington Symphony Orchestra was in fact the opera's London premiere. Its conductor Russell Keable was responsible for the 1979 British premiere in Nottingham too, where the same hybrid version of the score was used: a brave, incomplete attempt to recover the 1882 original, settling for Dvorak's second thoughts whenever his first ones were unavailable. In dramatic terms, the differences between them are probably not very significant. Though Dimitrij has some fine, lofty passages of Dvorakian feeling - especially, and luckily, towards the end - it is theatrically hobbled by its clumping pace and its four-square rhythms. Also by its relentlessly conformist, academic four-part harmony, expanded sometimes into double-chorus stuff - devout Russians against crude, secular Poles (here the Vasari and the Elysian Singers struck no sparks off each other) - but not varied enough to let in any bracing air. And its deadly recitatives, too obviously pencilled in over Dvorak's chordal meditations: Peter Tyrrell's translation fails, as anybody's might, to jockey key words into the right musical places: again and again, where in Czech the emphases may be just, they had a dull, false ring in the Englishing. In effect that left the singers to sing stilted subtitles, instead of passionate admissions. Graeme Matheson-Bruce tackled the long, strenuous role of Dimitrij with his usual finesse, and calculated risks on top notes. His was the most searching performance of the evening - though in a white dinner jacket and in classy English, something of the false Pretender's inner plight was missed. Pauline Tinsley gave sterling moral weight as Marfa, and Peter Savidge the opposite as Shuisky. Bronwen Mills' Xenia was sensitive, frail and uneven; Maria Moll was a stentorian Marina, urgently musical even in her hefty, charmless fortissimo. There was sound, low-voice Establishment ballast from Tom McVeigh and Stephen Holloway, and as the would-be rapists David Tilley and Paul im Thurn were disarmingly tame. Eminently worth hearing, all of it; but no case for actually staging Dimitrij again has been made.</p>

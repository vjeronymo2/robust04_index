			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> FUTURE UNDECIDED, ROBINSON SAYS  </P> <P> Although Ram Coach John Robinson insisted that he didn't want to add more drama  to his job situation, he kept things intriguing by suggesting that he isn't at  all sure what will happen in the next few days.  </P> <P> Robinson is expected to meet with Executive Vice President John Shaw next week,  and until then neither side will predict whether Robinson's eight-year tenure  with the team will end.  </P> <P> "I don't have any idea," Robinson said, adding that he wouldn't have any  further comment "until it's decided one way or the other. . . .  </P> <P> "The (job situation) thing took on a life of its own. I think there were a lot  of things that were written that were not true . . .  </P> <P> "Obviously, it's going to be on everybody's mind and we will all make a  statement one way or the other at some point. Until then . . . I mean, I'm not  going to contribute to . . . something that's gone as far afield as it has."  </P> <P> Couldn't Robinson say something now that could stop the speculation?  </P> <P> "I don't think I can," Robinson said. "If you could give me some clue to what I  could say to slow down the snowball, I would be happy to say it."  </P> <P> Shaw, reached earlier this week, said that nothing had changed to warrant a  comment.  </P> <P> "Everything's the same as it's been," Shaw said, disregarding talk that  Robinson himself might decide to leave even if the front office wants to keep  him. "It's an ownership decision, and nothing has changed that." TIM KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

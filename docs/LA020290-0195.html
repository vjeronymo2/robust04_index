			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> AN OSCAR ROLE FOR SPIELBERG  </P> <P> Producer-director Steven Spielberg will participate in the 62nd annual Academy  Awards presentation -- but an Academy spokesman declined to elaborate, except  to say that Spielberg will do more than present an award.  </P> <P> This will mark Spielberg's fourth appearance on the show. In 1986, the director  received the Academy's Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, and he has presented  the best director award on two previous occasions.  </P> <P> Spielberg has never won an Oscar himself, though his films, "Close Encounters  of the Third Kind,"(1977) "Raiders of the Lost Ark,"(1981) and "E.T., The  Extra-Terrestrial," (1982), all garnered nominations for best director.  </P></p>

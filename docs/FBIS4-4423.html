			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Keeping the National Interest"; </F> part two of a continuing series entitled "Beleaguered Myth of  the Bureaucracy"]    [Excerpts] "That was, in fact, one of our ideas." This is  the claim of some Finance Ministry officials who recently  revealed the background to the "agreement on tax cuts and tax  system reform" which was reached among representatives of the  ruling parties on 8 February following a dispute within the  coalition over the proposal by Prime Minister Hosokawa to  introduce a national welfare tax.  <H5>  Trouble Settled as Planned </H5>   At a meeting of representatives of the ruling parties which  began 7 February, Hiroyuki Sonoda, who represents Sakigake  [Harbinger] and the Japan New Party [JNP], after holding a  meeting with the Finance Ministry, presented a tax system reform  plan almost identical to the prime minister's.    He said: "We propose to introduce a 7-percent national  welfare tax from 1997. It is possible the tax rate will change."    Although this proposal was scrapped because of opposition  from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], an agreement  was eventually reached among the ruling parties to "discuss tax  system issues--tax cuts and how to secure revenue sources,  including the possible new taxes--and enact a tax system reform  bill at the Diet by the end of this year." The final agreement  gave the impression that the Hosokawa and Finance  Ministry-sponsored proposal had been rejected by the ruling  parties. However, the situation went according to the Finance  Ministry's plan.    Finance Ministry Tax Bureau Chief Tadashi Ogawa joined the  meeting as it was about to conclude.    He said: "We will carry out 20-percent tax cuts, but this  will be limited to one fiscal year because there are no revenue  sources to make up for a loss resulting from tax cuts." His  comments stressed the ministry's position that it could not  maintain tax cuts unless revenue sources were secured.    Administrative Vice Minister of Finance Jiro Saito directed  Tax Bureau Chief Ogawa and the Director of the Finance Ministry  Secretariat Takeshi Komura to hold a behind-the-scenes meeting  with Mr. Sonoda and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  Secretary-General Ichiro Ozawa to lay the groundwork for an  agreement among the ruling parties.    Mr. Komura said that in behind-the-scenes moves they held  many meetings at a "certain place in Tokyo," at the offices of  the finance minister and administrative vice minister, and  eventually worked out a draft agreement.    Finance Ministry bureaucrats feared that "unconditional tax  cuts" might be carried out without revenue sources being  secured. To prevent this happening, they stuck to the position  that tax cuts should be carried only on condition that revenue  sources are secured. Although it was a considerable concession  for them to issue deficit-covering bonds to cover the loss  resulting from tax cuts, they performed a spectacular feat in  limiting tax cuts to one year and getting the "political  security" of a future tax increase. Senior Finance Ministry  officials said "we had no choice but to coordinate tax policy  because politicians tend to take the easy way out." Such a  remark reflects their self-conceit in thinking they have  protected the national interest.  <H5>  Policymaking Process Faces Public Criticism </H5>   The United States, however, which wanted to see the tax cuts  implemented three years ahead of a tax increase, expressed  disappointment at the agreement. On 17 February, following the  failure in Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, U.S. President  Clinton criticized the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] for "controlling Japan's  policies for several decades." Although Prime Minister  Hosokawa, speaking at the Budget Committee session of the House  of Representatives, defended the ministries by saying that  "officials in charge of tax policy did a good job in protecting  the national interests," the "prominence held by bureaucrats in  Japan" is becoming a major factor that is damaging "cooperation  with foreign nations" which is, in turn, the foundation of  efforts to protect the interests of the nation.    In the wake of a political confusion over the idea of  introducing the national welfare tax--which was proposed by the  prime minister at a late night press conference but finally  withdrawn, the public, too, began to have doubts about the  bureaucrat-led policymaking process.    Vice Minister Saito had no choice but to indicate a flexible  attitude, saying: "I will give careful attention to criticism  in a humble way."    According to a U.S. diplomatic source, the question has  arisen both at home and abroad "whether such policies really  serve the purpose of protecting the national interest." Yukio  Noguchi, former Finance Ministry official and currently a  professor at Hitotsubashi University, points out that there is a  harmful influence in Japanese financial policy that places too  much emphasis on ensuring financial security.    He says: "Promoting the national interest means to improve  the people's living standard by drastically increasing public  works projects in preparation for the aging of society. Solely  relying on tax increases to raise the revenue is a questionable  practice. The government should not grudge issuing more  deficit-covering bonds." [passage omitted on Tokyo-based  company's attempts to sell domestically made rice without a  license, and the Food Agency's reaction]    At a meeting of members of the Rice Price Council (an  advisory body to the agriculture minister) at a branch office of  the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [MAFF] on 25  March, one of the members stressed that the Food Control  Act-based administrative system for rice supply had to be  drastically overhauled.    He said: "More than 50 percent of rice held by rice farmers  flows to the black market. The Food Control Act, which is  supposed to control rice supplies, is in ruins." Even within  the MAFF, there is the view that "now that government-controlled  rice is not available, there is no reason to maintain the Food  Agency."  <H5>  More Emphasis Placed on Protecting Ministry Interests </H5>   The Food Control Act was enacted in 1942 amid intensified  government control of the economy as part of preparations for  all-out war. More than 50 years have passed, and it now seems  there is no need for the Food Control Act to protect the  national interest.    Nevertheless, bureaucrats stick to the view the act should  be  maintained.    According to MAFF Administrative Vice Minister Toshihiko  Tsuruoka: "If we had no Food Control Act, the rice supply  situation would have been worse."    Judging from his remark, one can see that the bureaucrats  are  trying harder to protect the interests of their ministries than  the interests of the nation.</p>

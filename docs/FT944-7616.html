			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Charter airline orders Boeings - Contracts and ventures Britannia Airways, the world's largest charter airline, yesterday announced orders and options worth Dollars 800m for eight Boeing 767-300 aircraft. The airline, part of the UK's Thomson Travel Group, has ordered four aircraft, to be delivered in the spring of 1996, and taken an option on a further four  -scheduled to arrive at the rate of one a year to the year 2000. The acquisition of the 767-300s continues a rolling programme of fleet modernisation, announced last year. The new aircraft will replace existing 757s and 767-200s, said Britannia, and will be powered by General Electric engines. The present fleet comprises 19 Boeing 757s and nine 767-200s with an average age of three years. The first four new aircraft will be used primarily on long-haul flights to Australia, New Zealand, Africa, the US and India, and will be configured with 328 seats for long-haul operations. Mr Roger Burnell, Britannia's managing director, said aircraft such as the 767-300 would enable Brittania to continue to offer low cost air travel, particularly on long-haul routes. The aircraft will be financed through a mixture of leasing and acquisition, but Britannia said the 'fine tuning' had yet to be worked out.</p>

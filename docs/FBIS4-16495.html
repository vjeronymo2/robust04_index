			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by V. Kostomarov: "NATO General Harry Johnson: </F> `Like Most Soldiers, I Am Happily Married'"]    [Excerpt] Kaliningrad Oblast was the last stopover in the  tour of Harry Johnson, commander in chief of NATO forces in the  North European theater of war operations. Prior to that, he  visited Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Severomorsk (Murmansk  Oblast).    On the final day of his visit, the British general toured  Baltiysk where he familiarized himself with the crews of the  patrol boat "Nesokrushimiy" and the squadron torpedo boat  "Nastoychiviy." On board the latter vessel, Harry Johnson and  Vice Admiral Viktor Kravchenko, first Baltic Fleet deputy  commander, who accompanied the general, answered journalists'  questions.    [Journalist] You managed to spend very little time in the  Baltic Fleet. Nevertheless, how do you assess the level of  constructiveness in the talks with its command?    [Johnson] This is my first visit to the Baltic Fleet.  However, my first meeting with Admiral Vladimir Yegorov,  current Baltic Fleet commander, took place 18 months ago in St.  Petersburg. In the presence of the press, I would like to  express my gratitude for the sincere and extremely warm welcome  that was given to me by the fleet command, Vice Admiral  Kravchenko, its first deputy commander, and all officers who  worked with our delegation. We had a good opportunity to visit  two combat ships. We were favorably impressed with their  equipment with the most up-to-date arms, and with its  maintenance.    You have asked me about cooperation that the future has in  store for us. Actually, this cooperation has already begun.  This year, a Baltic Fleet ship will participate in joint NATO  maneuvers under the coded name "Baltic Operation `94." During  the visit, we conveyed the invitation to Baltic Fleet Commander  Admiral Yegorov to attend the exercise of missile boats as an  observer, which are scheduled for this year.    During our stay in Moscow and meetings with General Colonel  Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the general staff of the Russian  Armed Forces, and Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of  the Russian Fleet, as well as with the Baltic Fleet command, we  saw that their attitude toward our cooperation was highly  favorable. Our current key goal is to work out the details of  interaction under the circumstances of reduced finances, which  is a pressing issue for both parties. It is these technical  details that I, as well as the officers of my staff, are engaged  in today. This is the key goal of our visit here.    Let me express my views as a soldier and commander in chief  of NATO forces in Northern Europe. It is the naval forces that  have a great potential for the development of our cooperation.  Our aim is to turn the zones of the Baltic and North Seas into  a region of true cooperation and interaction.    [Journalist] As you know, Russian Defense Minister General  Pavel Grachev visited this area recently. He referred to the  implementation of the idea about the creation of the so-called  special defense region in Kaliningrad Oblast in the immediate  future. You happen to be the first foreign guest after the  defense minister's visit. Could you, as a military person,  express your attitude toward this idea?    [Johnson] Unfortunately, I have no information about the  decisions that Russian Defense Minister Grachev adopted here  concerning the establishment of some special defense region in  Kaliningrad. However, this oblast is part of Russia, and it is  a matter of this country, its government and the defense  ministry to introduce such a defense regime which they deem  necessary. Even if I had some information, this is neither my  business nor my right to discuss and comment on decisions  adopted by the Russian Defense Ministry.    [Journalist] You just returned from a ship, the commander of  which has said that the crew will shortly participate in the  NATO exercise "Baltop `94." I would like to hear something from  the two military leaders about the perspective of our  cooperation.    [Johnson] I had a chance to tour a modern and well-equipped  ship. It has made an impression on me. The crew and the  commander are convinced of the ship's capacity to fulfill the  set tasks. I believe that its level of equipment with  up-to-date military facilities, guidance and navigation systems  allows this ship to perform any tasks in such an operative group  as the "Baltic Operation." This is a U.S. exercise, which, if  we follow its development, is expanding its scale and becoming  more complicated in terms of its tasks. I believe that the  participation of Russian ships in this drill will serve for our  closer military cooperation.    [Kravchenko] Any cooperation, particularly among the  military, will bring only benefits. This year, our ships will  visit several countries, including Finland, Belgium. and France.  The question of whether our ships will go to the Kiel week is  now being resolved. Here in Baltiysk, we also receive guests and  ships from other countries. All these contacts lead to a better  mutual understanding. The fact that a Russian ship is  participating in a NATO exercise for the second time reflects  the strengthening of this collaboration year by year. The time  will come when several vessels rather than a single ship will  take part in this enterprise.    [Journalist] We know the story of the establishment of NATO  and the Warsaw Pact. The latter is already nonexistent. What  is your opinion on the future of NATO?    [Johnson] The Warsaw Pact ceased to exist concurrently with  the breakup of the Soviet Union. Contrary to this, the  situation in NATO is slightly different. The European Union  continues to exist. Moreover, the process of integration among  these countries is expanding. At the same time, this leads to  the development of NATO. This development is progressing along  the line of defining its goals and tasks in accordance with the  current situation.

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Hosokawa stresses quality of life as goal of policy MR Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday said the country needed to bring down its current account surplus 'not just to maintain good external economic relations but also to improve the quality of Japanese life'. In his first policy speech to the Diet (parliament), he said he would seek to make Japan 'a country of quality and substance', at ease with the world and with itself. He also pledged political reform by the end of the year, in what is the main aim of the seven-party coalition, which this month displaced the long-ruling Liberal Democratic party. However, he was vague about the shape of the reform, over which the partners are still divided. His address contained no new initiatives but appeared to indicate a number of shifts in emphasis. He placed greater stress than before on the funding of parties and politicians as a source of corruption. Such contributions would be replaced by 'neutral, untainted public funding and other provisions', he said, in a reference to possible tax incentives for individual donors. The coalition's ability to curb corporate contributions without being seen as victimising the LDP was given a strong boost last week when the Keidanren, the leading business grouping, said it would stop acting as a conduit for political funds - nearly all of which went to the LDP. Mr Hosokawa took care to note the difficulties caused by Japan's high current account surplus in relations with the US and EC. He intended to seek its reduction by working for 'expanded domestic demand and improved market access, and for such consumer-oriented policies as rectifying the disparity between domestic and international prices and promoting deregulation'. This was the approach announced following a meeting of economic ministers last Thursday. The US Federal Reserve stepped in later that day to assist the Bank of Japan in stemming a rise in the yen, which Washington had recently been thought to favour as a way to curb Japanese exports. Although the countries deny having done a deal, the move also followed a telephone conversation that day between Mr Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. The two are to hold a summit in late September, following framework talks earlier in the month on trade issues which Mr Hosokawa said were crucial. Japan may again need the Fed's assistance before that - the yen rebounded by Y1.10 against the dollar in Tokyo yesterday to Y103.35. The prime minister was otherwise cautious on international issues. Noting that 'protectionist moves seem to be on the rise', he said failure of the Uruguay Round of trade talks would 'have a grave impact on the world economy'. But he referred only obliquely to the problem of Japan's refusal to open its rice market, saying agriculture was a difficult issue for all countries and he would seek a solution based on 'mutual co-operation under our basic policy'. Mr Hosokawa expressed remorse and apologies for war actions 'including aggression and colonial rule'. Under evident pressure from conservatives in the coalition, he added that there were also 'supreme sacrifices made during the war' by Japanese. For the future, he said Japan must avoid 'falling prey to great-power ambitions' but should become 'a country of unpretentious excellence' in government, business and everyday life. His phrase recalls the 'lifestyle superpower' envisaged by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, his LDP predecessor, but with a stronger commitment to social justice and consumer interests. Mr Yohei Kono, leader of the LDP, members of which heckled repeatedly during the speech, said afterwards: 'He speaks of reform but he is adopting a conventional policy line.' Mr Hosokawa said Japan's ageing society made a review of the tax structure a priority, to balance income, property and consumption taxes. The Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member, has opposed suggestions by some of its partners that consumption tax should be increased from the present 3 per cent. Reflecting the mixed signals from official data, Mr Hosokawa said there were indications that 'the domestic economy is finally emerging from the depths into which it was thrown' but 'it would not do to take economic recovery for granted'. His aim was to 'create a climate conducive to the freer exercise of private-sector initiative'.</p>

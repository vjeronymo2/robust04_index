			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (14): Quest for the right balance - Patrick Blum looks at the controversial privatisation programme FEW issues have been quite as controversial as the government's privatisation programme in spite of a broad consensus in favour of selling companies nationalised in the mid-70s. Though there has been some opposition to the privatisations from groups of former owners who are mostly seeking better compensation, and, on the left, from those who want to preserve a large state sector, in practice the government has had a free hand. This has allowed it to establish what must be the largest privatisation programme in Europe outside the former communist countries. Plans are to sell dozens of leading companies including banks, insurance companies, manufacturers of a wide range of products from cement to beer, chemicals to pulp and paper, steel and oil distribution companies, leading utilities including telecommunications, the tobacco monopoly, the state airline, shipping and bus companies, to the last state-owned newspaper. The scale of the programme has not really been at issue, rather criticism has focused on the way it has been undertaken. The government has been accused of selling companies on the cheap to foreigners, of inflating share prices to maximise revenues, of distorting the market by imposing rigid limits on the purchase of privatised shares by the same foreigners, of failing to protect adequately Portuguese interests, of going about it in a half-hearted way, and of failing to use privatisations as a means of restructuring the economy. It is an illustration of the difficulty of the task that in one way or another all of these conflicting criticisms can be held to be partially true. Local business groups have been most vocal in attacking the government for failing to defend Portuguese interests. They argue that the method of selling companies on the stock market combined with the high price set for privatised shares effectively rules out a greater role by Portuguese investors who do not have the financial clout of large foreign groups. The problem is that there are too few large Portuguese groups able to absorb the volume of privatisations planned even if prices were lower. One suggestion is that potential Portuguese investors should be given preferential credit terms to help them buy into companies. To counter the criticism that it is selling off the family silver to foreigners, the government has imposed rigid limits on the amount of privatised shares foreigners can buy, but this has proved ineffective. Foreign companies have indirectly through local alliances to win key if not majority stakes in most of the companies privatised so far. What the limits have done is to distort the process, make it less transparent, and push prices up further. Most critics believe the government's main objective has been to maximise revenues from the sales, which last year alone brought it revenues of more than Es140bn (Dollars 970m) in six operations. That figure is likely to look small if this year's programme which includes selling several banks and some leading companies is fully carried out, though this appears less certain now. The programme has unfolded in fits and starts, and has faced repeated delays. These have been exacerbated by the Gulf war, and several privatisations due in the first quarter of the year have yet to take place. A general election is due by October at the latest and this will increasingly occupy the minds of ministers. Perhaps the most serious charge is that not enough thought has been given to using the privatisation process to restructure important parts of the economy. The government's answer is that by privatising public companies it is doing precisely that and strengthening the market economy. Critics are not convinced  - 'privatisations in the financial sector, for example, are decided piecemeal,' says a leading economist. 'There is no overall strategy, but what we need is an active restructuring to prepare quickly the economy for the single (European) market. 'The government should intervene selectively to help the formation of Portuguese groups, otherwise we'll miss a unique opportunity.'</p>

Chiang left for Vietnam Saturday [26 March] in a new  effort to promote bilateral trade ties.    He will first visit Ho Chi Minh City and then proceed to  Hanoi Sunday.    Chiang said prior to his departure that he will meet with  Vietnamese officials on issues involving agriculture and  investment cooperation during his four-day visit.    Taiwan farm experts are looking to giving a helping hand to  Vietnam in such fields as aquaculture, ocean fishing,  forestation, and hog-raising, while the government's  international economic cooperation development fund is  considering providing soft loans for Vietnam's farm  mechanization projects, he elaborated.    On investment ties, he noted, one major concern is runaway  land prices caused by Vietnam's new land law, which became  effective late last year. Construction of an industrial complex  exclusively for Taiwan investors in Hanoi has been delayed  because of the land price increase.    Chiang added that state-run Taiwan Sugar Corp., I Mei Foods  Co. Ltd., and King Car Food Industrial Co. Ltd. will enter into  a joint venture with two Vietnamese sugar companies at the end  of this month. President Enterprises Corp. is also mulling a  food investment project in the Indochinese country.    The minister also pledged that he will consult with  Vietnam's  financial officials on the application by the Medium Business  Bank of Taipei to open a branch in Hanoi. The bank submitted  the application to the Hanoi government last May.    Currently, the International Commercial Bank of China has a  representative office in Ho Chi Minh City and the Cathay  Investment and Trust Co., Ltd. maintains a branch in Hanoi.    Other Taiwan banks including Chiao Tung Bank, the first  Commercial Bank, Chang Hwa Commercial Bank, the Farmers Bank of  China, and Chinatrust Commercial Bank are also gearing up to  follow suit.    Meanwhile, Chiang said he will discuss an agreement to avoid  double taxation and an accord on a temporary import system in  order to facilitate bilateral trade relationships.    Two-way trade between Taiwan and Vietnam totaled US$589.3  million in the first 11 months of 1993, with Taiwan enjoying a  surplus of US$311.1 million.    Taiwan was the largest foreign investor in Vietnam at the  end  of 1993 with 117 investment projects totaling US$1.53 billion.</p>

"The talks with the Germans were conducted in a good  atmosphere," said Polish Deputy Interior Minister Henryk Jasik  before his return to Poland from Germany on Wednesday morning.    Jasik said that contacts between the leadership of the  Polish  and German Interior Ministries have developed well, while Polish  Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski and his German  counterpart had a good mutual understanding.    According to the asylum agreement of May 1993, Poland has  promised to earmark half of German aid (out of the global sum of  120 million DM) for the purchase of equipment in Germany.    German firms, however, offered equipment which is on average  twice as expensive as that offered by other suppliers. The  delegation pointed to that fact during the present talks. The  German Interior Ministry is entitled to buy equipment from  German producers at reduced prices and the Polish delegation  asked the Germans to buy the equipment for Poland on the same  principles.    It cannot be ruled out that the two documents, that is the  technical protocol on readmission of people arriving in Germany  via Poland and the agreement on cooperation of the police and  customs services of Poland and Germany, will be ready for  signing in spring 1994. The second round of talks on the matter  is scheduled to be held in Warsaw in a few weeks time.</p>

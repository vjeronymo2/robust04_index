			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: Having their cake and spending it - For London's orchestras sponsorship is more than just the icing IT IS a fallacy that sponsorship is the icing on an orchestra's cake. Without it, there is no cake, as the London Philharmonic is finding. The LPO took up its residency at the South Bank in London last month, with its Arts Council subsidy more than doubled. 'But we would lose money on Festival Hall concerts without sponsorship,' said John Willan, the orchestra's managing director. 'The sums just don't stack up. It costs Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 70,000 for a concert with top-line performers and five rehearsals, and for a full house we can only expect as much as Pounds 30,000 from the box office.' The orchestras, for which ten years ago sponsorship was not even icing, merely a bon-bon, are having to spend more and more of their administrative time wooing sponsors. Without them, they know that the standards they have built up will collapse. But there are risks in wooing big sponsors. 'If you have a main sponsor and he changes his mind for one reason or another, you're suddenly left with a huge hole that may be impossible to fill,' Willan said. 'It's far better to have a basket of smaller ones.' His orchestra has been lucky with loyal supporters. Pioneer, makers of hi-fi equipment, has sponsored the LPO's Musician of the Year since 1979. The newest sponsor is Audi, the German motor manufacturer, which provides Willan with a Pounds 30,000 car, supports the LPO's youth orchestra and makes up much of the concert shortfall. The sponsorship enables the orchestra to keep seat prices in an affordable range of Pounds 4 to Pounds 28. Other sponsors include Marks and Spencer, National Westminster Bank, GKN, the car components and engineering group, Commodore Business Machines, Chelsfield, the property group, and a number of individuals including the LPO Trust's chairman, Elliott Bernerd. Altogether Willan can count on about Pounds 900,000 from sponsors this year, a quarter of the running costs, but the search for new ones to support the LPO's residency and ambitions is proving unrewarding. 'We believe the cachet of residency puts us in a good position to get sponsors, but we haven't had much success to this point. We're working hard on the 1993-94 season.' Elsewhere, the London Symphony Orchestra's residency at the Barbican Centre in London is ten years old and its managing director, Clive Gillinson, has turned the cultivation of sponsorship into a craft. He won this year's Garrett Award from the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts for his enterprising and imaginative schemes. The award carried a cash prize for the first time: Pounds 10,000 from Reed International to spend on the project of his choice. He spent it on a bassoon chair for the LSO because, he said, the bassoon was the only reed instrument in the orchestra without one. Gillinson probably won the award for his work in finding sponsorship for the Pacific Music Festival in Japan two years ago with Leonard Bernstein and the LPO's principal conductor, Michael Tilson Thomas. He pulled together a Dollars 15m (Pounds 8.7m) package, and the festival has been established as an annual event. But that was in the pre-recession days. 'It is very difficult to persuade new sponsors in now,' said Gillinson, who believes the Pounds 640,000 concert sponsorship he got this year will be reduced to, at best, Pounds 600,000 next year. 'Some have had to withdraw because of the recession - ICI is one who has been very good to us in the past, and want to come back as soon as they are able to make that decision. But we have been lucky with our long-term sponsors.' Peter Stuyvesant, for example, has been with the LSO for 30 years and Shell has just signed on for another four-year cycle of scholarships. This is a nationwide trawl for talented young players which focuses each year on a different area: woodwind, strings, brass and timpani/percussion. Sponsorship for the LSO is divided into three types: concerts, touring and education. Concert sponsorship will be down next season but touring support will be doubled, to Pounds 700,000, thanks to patrons from abroad. 'It is interesting that the last thing sponsors want to withdraw from is education projects, showing that sponsors' sense of community responsibility is stronger than their enjoyment of the big occasion,' Gillinson said. 'All public subsidy now is predicated on the understanding that you are going to raise a certain amount from sponsorship. We decided that we would not compromise ourselves artistically in going for sponsors, and to our delight sponsors have responded, so it turned out to be the right commercial decision, too.'</p>

At the  beginning of the meeting, his excellency the leader president  explained the reasons for increasing the state's purchasing  prices of wheat and rice crops from farmers, especially at an  early stage of the agricultural season. His excellency said:  The announcement of the price increases will encourage farmers  to pay more attention to fertilization, irrigation, and the use  of pesticides, which will increase the agricultural crop and  will show farmers a clear horizon to reassure them about the  fate of their products after harvesting.    His excellency said that it is a national, economic, and  technical duty of every one in this stage--a duty which will  remain a priority in the future--to continue to encourage  farmers to increase their production because agriculture  provides food for citizens. He said that providing food and  persisting in efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in food is a  vital part of national security that it should be followed up  with interest. His excellency said that it is not a luxury for  us to decide to increase the states' purchasing prices of the  basis agricultural crops. It is necessary to study the increase  in the state's purchasing prices for other crops, such as corn,  and industrial products.    In light of the instructions of the leader president, may  God  preserve him, it has been decided to increase the purchasing  prices of wheat and barley for the current agricultural season  as follows:    1. Wheat: The current price of 1 tonne of first-class wheat  is 5,000 dinars. The new price of 1 tonne is 8,000 dinars. The  current price of 1 tonne of coarse wheat is 4,750 dinars. The  new price of 1 tonne is 7,500 dinars. Regarding other kinds,  the current price of 1 tonne is 4,500 dinars. The new price of  1 tonne is 7,000 dinars.    2. Barley: The current price of 1 tonne is 2,500 dinars.  The new price of 1 tonne is 4,000 dinars.    The joint meeting of the RCC and the Council of Ministers  then discussed the current budget and the investment plan for  1994. In this regard, the leader president stressed commitment  to the requirements of the march, which will be crowned with  victory, God willing, if the ministries do not confuse the  immediate and existing projects and services with medium or  long-range goals. His excellency said: What is important is  that we should remain effective and manage our resources well in  this stage, and that after this stage, new and wide horizons  will be opened for us, God willing.    His excellency also explained that the importance of this  stage comes from the fact that the evil aggressors have been  exposed as boring and illogical before the whole. Therefore,  continuing to exert our utmost energy in production; in  maintaining machines, equipment, and material; and fighting  dissipation will increase the people's patience and  steadfastness. Decreasing expenditures in building and  operating projects, as well as choosing the least costly ways  and alternatives will mean an increase in the Iraqi dinar's  value, regardless of the size of the increase. The minister or  the manager, who succeeds in reducing the cost of a 1 billion  dinar project to 450 million dinars, for example, will feel the  sweetness of this result because he, in fact, will have  contributed to defending the homeland and the people.    His excellency also stressed the importance of increasing  transportation energy this year, as it is important in  transporting agricultural crops, industrial products, and  workers in all sectors. At the end of the discussions, the  meeting endorsed the current budget and the investment plan for  1994. The joint meeting was attended by several technical  cadres of the industrial sector.</p>

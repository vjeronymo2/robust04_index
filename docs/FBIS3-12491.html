			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Too Little, Too Late"] </F>   [Text] NATO has used force the first time to prvent the  violation of the "no-fly zone" set up by the United Nations over  Bosnia-Herzegovina about a year ago. Its planes have shot down  four Serbian military aircraft while they were returning after  shelling an arms factory under Muslim control in Bosnia. The  shooting was carried out after Serb pilots ignored the warning  to land. Six jets operating from a base in Italy were involved  in the assault mission.    The ban on flights over Bosnia was imposed by the UN  Security  Council on April 12, 1993. Since then NATO aircraft monitoring  the zone detected several violations of the restriction but  refrained from taking any action against the culprits. It was  a serious lapse and negated the very purpose of the mandate  given by the Security Council. Had force been used earlier  against the defiance of the ban. It would have certainly helped  in reducing the enormity of Sebian aggression and savagery  against the severeign government and people of Bosnia.  Meanwhile, a statement issued on Monday by the Pakistan  Government rightly points out that the UN ultimatum for the  withdrawal of heavy weapons from Sarajevo has not been fully  implemented. The Serbs are still keeping their heavy arms in  position at several points in the exclusion zone and these  continue to pose a threat to the beleaguered people of the  Bosnian capital. The Serbs are also redeploying the equipment  removed from Sarajevo against other Muslim enclaves in Bosnia.  The UN must act quickly and strongly to stop this criminal  adventure. Further, the removal of heavy arms from Sarajevo  alone will not bring an end to the misery and deprivation of  Sarajevo population. The world body ought to take appropriate  steps to ensure the restoration of essential services and  opening of routes to and from the capital. Equally vital is the  cessation of hostilities throughout Bosnia in order to  facilitate the process of peace. There is no denying that the  international community can do a lot in settling the Bosnian  conflict justly and equitably if it exercises the neccessary  resolution and firmness in this regard. Much of the onus falls  on the Western powers including the US. They must not hesitate  any more to match their words with deeds.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAHONY SUED BY UNION AFTER HE QUITS BARGAINING ON GRAVEDIGGERS  </P> <P> Two top Los Angeles labor officials accused Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger M.  Mahony on Tuesday of dishonesty and hypocrisy in the wake of his recent  decision to stop bargaining with a union that won a hard-fought victory to  represent workers at the archdiocese's 10 Los Angeles-area cemeteries.  </P> <P> The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union filed suit in Los Angeles  Superior Court on Tuesday, seeking an injunction to force Mahony to resume  negotiations on a new labor contract.  </P> <P> The suit was announced at a press conference that featured the strongest  invective yet in a bitter two-year fight between Mahony, long a staunch  supporter of organized labor, and local labor leaders over whether 140 cemetery  workers should be organized.  </P> <P> The struggle appeared to end last November when a three-member arbitration  panel, selected by the archdiocese and the union, ruled 2 to 1 that the union  should be the bargaining representative of the gravediggers. Mahony had  contested a close representation election won by the union last February.  </P> <P> Negotiations between the two sides on a labor contract did not begin until the  middle of last month. Then last week the archdiocese said it would no longer  negotiate with the union because of mounting complaints by cemetery workers  that they do not want union representation. Instead, Mahony announced, the  archdiocese would hold another election among workers.  </P> <P> Under a written agreement governing last year's election, the archdiocese has a  legal obligation to negotiate with the union on a contract for a period of one  year after the election. Had the election been supervised by the National Labor  Relations Board, that year would have started only when the appeals ended and  the election results were certified. However, the NLRB declined to supervise  last year's election, saying it does not have jurisdiction over religious  organizations. Instead, the election was conducted under the auspices of the  state Mediation and Conciliation Service, which allows parties to draft their  own rules.  </P> <P> Mahony now contends that the union's year of bargaining representation ends  Thursday -- on the anniversary of the vote, which the union narrowly won,  66-62. The archdiocese will hold a new election Friday.  </P> <P> Union officials on Tuesday called the second vote a stacked deck and said they  will refuse to participate. Instead, they hope to obtain an injunction  requiring Mahony to negotiate with them through November.  </P> <P> The archdiocese said its decision to hold a new election a year and a day after  the first one was made in response to anti-union petitions from 97 of 114  workers at six of the 10 cemeteries. Union officials accused cemetery  supervisors of misrepresenting the nature of the petitions to their workers,  saying that many workers were told they were simply signing a petition thanking  Mahony for raising wages, an action the archdiocese took last year.  </P> <P> William Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation of  Labor, said at the press conference Tuesday that Mahony is guilty of  "hypocritical attitudes."  </P> <P> David Sickler, an AFL-CIO regional director and one of the three members of the  panel that reviewed the election results, said he was "absolutely outraged" by  Mahony's actions and accused the archbishop of dishonesty for initially saying  last year's election should follow NLRB procedures "but then when he loses,  saying the hell with that."  </P> <P> Benjamin E. Goldman, a lawyer representing the archdiocese in the labor  dispute, said Mahony was simply interpreting the agreement between the two  sides literally. The agreement said the union would have bargaining rights one  year from the election, he noted. If the union is angry, it should be angry at  itself for not demanding more specific wording, Goldman said.  </P></p>

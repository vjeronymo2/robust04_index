			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch by Ahmad Idris in Islamabad] </F>   [Text] Severe differences have surfaced among Egyptian  Islamic groups regarding the warnings issued to foreigners that  they should leave the country. In a statement to our radio by  telephone, the official in charge of the Information Bureau of  the Conquest Vanguards Organization [tanzim tala'i al-fatah]  condemned, on behalf of the organization, the warning issued  three days ago by the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah to foreigners and  its threats to strike at foreign investors and their projects in  Egypt. He said:    [Begin recording] The Islamic masses and the whole nation  know that Islam -- as all scholars have always been unanimous --  has forbidden any act that harms the Muslims. Thus, striking at  the Egyptian economy and at legal investments will harm the  Muslim masses there. [end recording]    The statement notes that this will isolate the Islamists and  provide excuses to uproot them. The statement calls on the  Egyptian leadership to apply the Islamic law and wipe out  hotbeds of corruption to end armed confrontation and improve the  situation.</p>

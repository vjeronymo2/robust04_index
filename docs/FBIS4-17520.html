			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- Those who wish to  frustrate civic accord demand that the signing of the civic  accord agreement fixed for April 28 be put off. This view was  expressed by Sergey Filatov, chief of the Russian president's  administration, at a meeting with chief editors of the Russian  media in ITAR-TASS news agency on Thursday, the day the  agreement is discussed at a meeting of the State Duma.    Filatov said that 50 telegrams from chiefs of Russian  regions  who are ready to sign the agreement without any reservations had  been received in the Kremlin by now. He said the text of the  document had been supported by 12 trade union leaders, all  religious confessions, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the  Council of Veterans and other public organisations. Chiefs of  administrations of a number of territories and regions, as well  as leaders of some parties, sent to the president's apparatus  their proposals and remarks to the text of the document which  are discussed by the working group headed by director of the  institute of state and law of the Russian Academy of Science,  Boris Topornin. Filatov noted that the presidential  administration does not interfere in the activity of the group  for perfecting the draft agreement and brings no presure on it  whatsoever. He said the opposition took advantage of the pause  in the preparation for the signing of the civic accord  agreement. Therefore he believes that the document should be  adopted before May 1 and that as many signatories as possible  should be involved.</p>

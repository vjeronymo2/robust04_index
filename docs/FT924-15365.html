			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Major ready to postpone debate on ERM reform MR JOHN MAJOR has signalled he is ready to shelve debate on Britain's demand for reform of the European exchange rate mechanism until after this month's emergency summit in Birmingham. The prime minister's stance, set out in a confidential letter sent to fellow EC leaders, reflects his acceptance of other governments' fears that public discussion of changes might add to the mechanism's present strains. The emergence of Mr Major's letter coincided yesterday with a determined ministerial campaign to prevent this week's Conservative conference from degenerating into a civil war over the Maastricht treaty. In an interview with the FT, Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, warned opponents of Maastricht in the Tory party that Mr Major and his entire cabinet will 'come out fighting' to ensure that it gets through the House of Commons. That message will be repeated throughout the week by a succession of cabinet ministers. But a warning by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, that sterling's recent slide could not be allowed to continue indefinitely reinforced fears among nervous Tory MPs that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, could be forced to raise interest rates. Mr Lamont, who is preparing for a crucial speech to the party conference on Thursday, has said he would if necessary reverse the one percentage point cut which followed sterling's departure from the ERM. But an increase now could undermine fatally his position in the cabinet. Mr Clarke was echoed by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in a reminder to party activists who gather in Brighton tomorrow that the pound's devaluation will mean tougher controls on public spending. Alongside sharp cutbacks already agreed in capital spending on transport, schools, hospital and prison building, the Treasury now wants a cash reduction in the health service budget and a freeze in some social security benefits. As some ministers call for a public sector pay freeze rather than further reductions in capital programmes, Mr Lamont is expected to chair another meeting of the cabinet's public spending committee later today. Mr Heseltine, however, sought to dispel suggestions that the government is considering raising income tax to reduce a public sector deficit forecast at more than Pounds 40bn next year. In private, ministers will not rule out an extension of value added tax to areas such as domestic fuel and newspapers, but Mr Heseltine described the option of higher taxes as 'the least attractive to a Conservative government'. Mr Major's acknowledgment that there can be no immediate changes in the ERM came in the letter sent out to his European counterparts at the end of last week. In his role as the current EC president, he had wanted finance ministers to review the ERM's working at the Birmingham summit on October 16. But the letter said he now accepted that several other governments objected to the attendance of finance ministers. Instead the summit would discuss generally the recent turbulence on the financial markets based on an interim report by the Community's monetary committee. But most of the leaders' attention will be devoted to drafting a proposed declaration to give substance to the principle of subsidiarity  - the decentralisation of decision-making in the EC. Mr Major believes there is much greater impetus behind his demand for repair of the 'fault-lines' in the ERM than is publicly acknowledged by many governments. But the prime minister acknowledges that those governments whose currencies have been under speculative attack, including France, cannot afford to admit publicly that the mechanism is fundamentally flawed. The pressures on Mr Major were highlighted yesterday by two opinion polls on his performance as premier. The 33 per cent satisfaction rating found by Mori for The Sunday Times, and the 34 per cent satisfaction rating according to Gallup in The Sunday Telegraph are both sharply down on Mr Major's previous scores. A further Mori poll for The Times today suggests 68 per cent would have voted against ratification of the Maastricht treaty if a referendum were held.

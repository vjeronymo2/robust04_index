			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Crime Statistics -- An article on Wednesday erroneously said FBI statistics  show Thousand Oaks to be the safest U.S. city of 100,000 or more people, as  measured by the number of reported crimes in relation to the population in  1989.  </P> <P> The figures in the article were for the total number of crimes, not the rate  per 100,000 as the story stated. Thousand Oaks, with a population of 107,000,  had the fewest reported crimes among the cities. That does not necessarily mean  that it had the lowest rate. The figure reported for Los Angeles was greatly  exaggerated. The actual number of crimes per 100,000 population in 1988, the  latest for which data is available, was 6,861.  </P></p>

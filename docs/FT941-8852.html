			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: The Limited falls 20% to Dollars 196m in final quarter The Limited, the US clothing retailer that has been struggling to counter poor sales of women's fashions, reported a 20 per cent fall in net profits to Dollars 196m from Dollars 244m for its fourth quarter. Turnover rose to Dollars 2.4bn from Dollars 2.3bn, partly because Victoria's Secret and other specialty retailing subsidiaries did well and partly because the group opened more stores. However, this was not enough to outweigh the sharp decline in profit margins at the group's The Limited and Lerner New York chains. Earnings per share fell to 54 cents from 67 cents. The final quarter's poor performance produced a decline for the full year, pulling net income down to Dollars 391m from Dollars 455m and earnings per share to Dollars 1.08 from Dollars 1.25 - although turnover rose to Dollars 7.2bn from Dollars 6.7bn. The Limited said it added 198 stores last year and 1.57m sq ft of selling space.</p>

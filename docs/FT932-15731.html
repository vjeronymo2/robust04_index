			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Suter to sell industrial valves side for Pounds 36m SUTER is to sell its industrial valves and component business for Pounds 36m to enable it to pursue other areas of 'expansionary opportunity'. The sale, which will wipe out Suter's borrowings, may be followed by an acquisition. Mr David Abell, chairman, has refused to comment on Suter's ambitions towards James Wilkes, the engineer in which it has a 10.1 per cent stake. Suter would only say the sale would give it 'additional flexibility to develop its remaining core businesses and to pursue other areas of expansionary opportunity'. The valves business, which is being sold to a subsidiary of Tyco Laboratories, made a trading profit of Pounds 4.1m before interest and tax in 1992 on sales of Pounds 22.9m. Net assets were Pounds 10.3m. The business is to be sold for an initial Pounds 34m cash. Another Pounds 2m is payable in 1995. The final amount will be calculated as 20 per cent of the amount by which the aggregate sales of the business for the following two years exceeds Pounds 43m.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> DIMENSIONS DICTATE 'WORK TRIANGLE' PLAN  </P> <P> QUESTION: We are having our kitchen remodeled. We know there are several ways  in which the so-called "work triangle" can be arranged. Any special one you can  recommend?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Every basic floor plan has its adherents, but there is almost unanimous  agreement when it comes to kitchens. If you have a compact work triangle that  eliminates cross traffic, you have a good plan that will prove the most  satisfactory. The number of possible arrangements is limited by the dimensions  of the room and the location of doors and windows to adjacent rooms.  </P> <P> In an ideal work triangle, each major activity center is at one point of the  triangle. Again ideally, the sides of the triangle should add up to somewhere  between 12 and 24 feet. While this is not always possible, it can be roughly  achieved in almost any shape kitchen, whether a U, an L or a corridor.  </P> <P> In a one-wall kitchen, where all of the activity concerned is on a line, the  units should not be strung out too far. Areas over 12 feet in length become too  long to be efficient. You say you are having the kitchen remodeled, which means  it probably is being done by a contractor. Don't neglect his advice, especially  if he has been in business for some time.  </P> <P> Not Certain About a Third Layer of Shingles  </P> <P> Q: We have our roof covered with asphalt shingles. There are two layers of the  same kind of shingles there already, but our local roofer says the roof deck is  strong and will support a third layer. Should I believe him, even though I have  read that only two layers of shingles are safe?  </P> <P> A: If he is a licensed roofer, he should know whether the deck will support a  third layer. However, just to be certain, check your local rules on  construction. Some communities will not permit the use of a third layer of  shingles.  </P> <P> Turpentine a Good Wax-Removal Agent  </P> <P> Q: I have an old bureau that is in pretty good condition except for what  appears to be an accumulation of many layers of wax. I don't want to touch it  until I am sure of what I am doing. Turpentine has been suggested as a good  cleansing agent. Is it?  </P> <P> A: Yes. It will take off the wax and prepare the surface for rewaxing or  refinishing or whatever is necessary. You also can buy a commercial wax remover  for the purpose.  </P></p>

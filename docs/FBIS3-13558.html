			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yerah Tal] </F>   [Excerpt] Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir said  yesterday that in the Tunis talks, "progress was made in forging  renewed understanding between the sides and in examining the  possibilities for continuing the peace process." Savir said  that "Israel and the PLO understand that there is a need to  create an appropriate atmosphere in the territories to alleviate  the situation and instill a greater sense of security and trust  in the political process."    The Israeli representatives said that Israel is prepared to  make additional concessions toward the Palestinians and to agree  to expand the Palestinian police force to 9,000 men and increase  the number of weapons at its disposal. Israel had earlier  agreed to a 6,000-strong force. 'Arafat is not satisfied with  these steps and is demanding a series of additional moves, most  of which are unacceptable to Israel.    [Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew on 16 March, in a related  report by Pe'erli Shahar on pages 1 and 8, adds that "in the  delegation's meetings with Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis, it was made  clear to him that Israel has agreed to the deployment of  international forces throughout the territories, except for  Jerusalem, on condition that they are unarmed."]    Referring to the specific steps to be taken, Savir said that  Israel, for its part, took very tough measures against the  extremists, but added that "there are steps that must be  coordinated with the Palestinians to prepare the ground for the  resumption of the process." Savir noted that the Tunis talks  advanced the possibility of a direct dialogue on those issues.  "It is obvious that Israel is serious about its intention to  contribute to security on the ground for Arabs and Israelis  alike, and the Palestinian side made it clear that despite the  difficult obstacles along the way, it intends to implement the  Declaration of Principles, which will bring a drastic change on  the ground."    Savir also said that "those who speak about stopping the  process in the wake of the terrible massacre are, in fact,  caving in to extremists and murderers, and that is not in the  interest of either side." Savir believes, therefore, that the  process will continue to make progress and that the Tunis talks  were a step in that direction. [passage omitted]</p>

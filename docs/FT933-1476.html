			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses stage partial recovery after early fall LATE on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley expected the new Russian political battle to produce further strength in the dollar, and weakness in western European equity markets - 'the further east, the greater the risk.' So it turned out, initially, with the Eurotrack 100 index opening close to its low for the day, a little more than 1 per cent down, and the early-closing Vienna bourse registering a 2.8 per cent decline, writes Our Markets Staff. However, by yesterday, Goldman Sachs was saying that, although a Russian civil war would lead to a 5-10 per cent decline in European share prices, the absence of strife (more likely) would bring recovery. Supported by an early upswing in New York, the Eurotrack reacted accordingly. FRANKFURT, which had looked a little flighty on Monday and Tuesday, sustained more than the average setback before lunch, and managed less than the median recovery in the afternoon. The DAX index fell 32.85, or 1.7 per cent to 1,893.00 over the official session; in the post-bourse the Ibis-indicated DAX put on only 6.77 to 1,899.77. Turnover fell from DM8.4bn to DM7.5bn. Banks, closely linked in investors's minds to Russia and the risk of bad debts, all fell by more than 2 per cent; Commerzbank, traditionally seen as the least well-provisioned against bad debts, fell DMDM7.70, or 2.5 per cent to DM304.80. Mr Nigel Longley, an institutional adviser with Commerzbank, said that yesterday's decline in the broad market was more a matter of marking shares down than actual profit-taking. However, there was still room for special situations. AEG, the Daimler subsidiary dismissed as a break-up situation by the German news weekly, Der Spiegel, over the weekend, fell another DM3.50 to DM150 for a drop of DM16.20, or nearly 10 per cent over the past five trading days. PARIS, which had fallen some 1.4 per cent at the opening, recouped a significant percentage of the losses by the close. The CAC-40 index finished off 14.43 or 0.7 per cent at 2,079.96, after an intraday low of 2,059.63 and a high of 2,088.98. Turnover was strong at FFr4.2bn. In a generally weaker market overall Carrefour, the food retailer, went against the trend with a rise of FFr67 or 2 per cent to FFr3,350 following positive brokers' recommendations based on the group's long term outlook. The mood elsewhere was less bright although Havas gained FFr9.6 to FFr483 on reports that a magazine article, due to be published today, would reveal further information about a proposed share swap deal with Canal Plus, down FFr2 at FFr1,205. Lafarge Coppee settled off FFr5 at FFr405 after reports, later denied by the construction materials group, that it might have been interested in making a bid for CBR, the Belgian cement manufacturer. LVMH shed FFr41 to FFr4,092 ahead of today's announcement of interim results which are expected to show a substantial fall, while Ciments Francais was down FFr5 at FFr165 ahead of first half results which came after the close. AMSTERDAM recovered from an early fall with support from the heavily traded international stocks. The CBS Tendency index ended down 0.9 at 123.6 in turnover reported as moderate. Among the internationals, Royal Dutch gained 30 cents to Fl 178.30, Unilever lost 60 cents to Fl 200 and Heineken fell Fl 1.40 to Fl 181.60. ZURICH finished easier, but above early lows as investors returned to the market after an early round of profit-taking. The SMI index shed 17.2 to 2,414.6 after an intra-day low of 2,397.4. Mr Mirko Sangiorgio of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich said that while overnight political developments had a depressing impact early in the day, investors quickly resumed buying. Banks were easier with UBS SFr11 lower at SFr1,187 and CS Holding SFr25 lower at SFr2,870. Large sell orders left Swissair SFr17 lower at SFr723 after a local press report that shareholders were unlikely to approve the company's planned Alcazar alliance with three other European airlines under the terms proposed. Against the trend, Schindler bearers added SFr100 to SFr5,800 as the company announced plans for a new generation of lift systems. MILAN's decline was eased by a strong Olivetti performance as the Comit index shed 7.6, or 1.3 per cent to 589.94. Strong foreign demand late in the day took Olivetti L49 or 2.5 per cent higher to L1,974. Analysts, who noted that the company was expected to report further losses shortly, attributed the rise to the company's hopes of breaking into Italy's buoyant mobile telecommunications market. Gemina, the financial holding company, put on L28 to L1,490 in response to its announcement of higher full year figures on Tuesday. Sme rose L38 to L4,170 as the supermarket and restaurant chain said that revenues rose 6 per cent in the first eight months of the year. MADRID, a late closer, came out with one of the day's bigger declines, the general index losing 3.64, or 1.3 per cent at 283.90. Turnover rose from Pta17.8bn to Pta22.5bn. Mr Jose Manuel Arroyo, director of equities at Asesores Bursatiles in Madrid, said that the market was taking profits yesterday, especially in banks; he added that Madrid's above average fall was its usual reaction to dramatic events, as a small market susceptible to global investment decisions. STOCKHOLM was supported by a firmer local currency and further falls in domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 18.0 to 1,263.4 in turnover up from SKr1.1bn to SKr1.3bn. Ericsson, in telecommunications, and Astra in pharmaceuticals led the market's rise, the former's B shares gaining SKr8 to SKr418 and the latter's up SKr4 at SKr161. VIENNA's traders and analysts said they expected market uncertainty to continue until there are clear signs of one side coming out on top in the Russian power struggle. The ATX index closed 27.01 down at 949.79. ISTANBUL gained ground in late trading after the KOI, the organisation responsible for privatisations, announced that Kalkinma Bankasi, the state bank, could only sell its 5.4 per cent stake in Ergeli, the steel group, with its consent. The composite index finished up 295.3 at 14,483.9.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- September 22                                       THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes             Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1265.81   1267.66   1267.81   1268.41 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1337.13   1339.37   1339.88   1341.88  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1270.60   1273.53   1273.22   1271.99 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1344.89   1346.04   1346.85   1346.05  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Sep 21    Sep 20    Sep 17    Sep 16    Sep 15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1279.55   1278.06   1265.02   1257.07   1260.47 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1351.37   1351.78   1343.60   1335.87   1337.35  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1275.11 ; 200 - 1348.89 Low/day: 100 - 1265.40  200 - 1336.59.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

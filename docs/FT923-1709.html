			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Opt-out schools given cash pledge by Patten JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, has promised that opt-out schools will continue to get more cash than ordinary state schools. The move followed fears of a slowing down in the pace of schools' becoming grant-maintained under the government's flagship education policy because of concerns about funding. The 278 schools that have already opted out receive a significant budget advantage once outside town hall control. But this summer's white paper  - which provided a blueprint for all schools to opt out into a new system without local education authorities  - was unclear whether new grant-maintained schools would get the same preferential treatment. Critics say the clampdown on public spending made it unlikely, leaving heads and governors wondering whether opting out was worth the risk. Mr Patten has sought to maintain the momentum for opting out gained by the Conservative election victory. He told a party meeting in Aldershot on Friday: 'I intend to ensure that schools which are accepted for grant-maintained status continue to receive funding that recognises their extra responsibilities compared with LEA schools.' All opt-out schools would get a built-in advantage as part of the new common funding formula proposed in the white paper, he said in the little-publicised speech, which was not released until yesterday. 'It is important that parents and schools that are contemplating grant-maintained status are aware of all these factors when coming to new decisions,' he said. Mr Patten said although the future of opt-out schools was 'totally secured', there were question marks hanging over town halls as an independent commission led by Sir John Banham, former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, investigated their future role, if any. The government must start valuing teachers if its reforms are to improve education, the Rev Dominic Milroy, chairman of the Headmasters' Conference  -which represents 233 private schools  - said yesterday. He said at the opening of the organisation's annual conference in Bruges: 'There appears to be a tendency in the public mind, and even for the government, to lump teachers together as a profession which doesn't deserve the same respect as the medical, legal or financial professions.' Mr Milroy warned against the dangers of the 'exam league table mentality' and performance pay for teachers.</p>

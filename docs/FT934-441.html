			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Travel: A safe, content Club Med virgin - Michael Thompson-Noel in a village of the future I wouldn't be surprised if some time next century millions of people lived in villages modelled on the Club Med principle. Bright, shiny living space surrounded by exotic greenery. Excellent food. Non-stop sport, for the sportingly inclined - although none of it compulsory. Young and personable minders. Night-life every night. And the happiness and sense of safety that come from being cocooned in an environment from which the realities of the outside world are strenuously excluded. Until last September, I was a Club Med virgin. I had not visited a single Club Med village, though there are enough of them about, from Morocco to Malaysia, Mexico to Mauritius. If you had stopped me in the street and asked me what I thought Club Med signified, I would have said that I imagined it attracted the bronzed and the beautiful: swingers in their 20s wearing spangled g-strings with nothing on their minds but water-sports and sex. I would have added that I thought that most Club Med villages comprised palm-thatched huts set by a lagoon and that a Club-Med holiday was a relatively expensive one. I would have been almost entirely wrong. For a start, the average age of Club Med guests (says Club Med) is 38. Some Club Med villages attract a younger clientele than others. But the three I visited last September - all in Morocco: Marrakech, Ouarzazate and Agadir - were not in this category. The average age of those present was almost certainly over 40. Swingers in spangled g-strings? Well, perhaps one or two. Most people seemed quite normal. The clientele was predominantly French - one Frenchwoman with whom I played tennis in Marrakech was on her 22nd Club Med holiday - but there were also plenty of Italians, Germans, Scandinavians and other Europeans, plus a sprinkling of British - even a few Americans. Perhaps the British worry that the Club Med atmosphere will prove oppresively Gallic. But it doesn't; so they shouldn't. Palm-thatched huts? Some Club Med villages are built next to lagoons. But this palm-thatched business is a figment of my imagination. What impressed me most about my visit to the Club Med establishments in Marrakech, Ouarzazate and Agadir is that Club Med is, above all else, a hotel operator of the utmost professionalism. There is nothing formulaic about Club Med properties, which offer marked differences in style and atmosphere. In Marrakech, the Club Med property is very much an enclave, sheltered by high walls, close to the old city. In Ouarzazate the Club Med property is not an enclave at all but a small and modern-looking hotel built on a bluff with spectacular views across the valley of the Oued River. In Agadir, the Club Med 'village' is a large resort-hotel of considerable style and comfort built parallel to the beach. Expensive? Not at all. The key, as always, is value for money. As Club Med itself says: 'You may think that Club Med costs more than average, but . . . bear in mind that many all-in package holidays are seldom as all-in as they appear and people often end up spending almost as much again on extras. 'Club Med, however, really is all-inclusive. Apart from bar drinks, excursions and other optional extras, our prices include full board, meals with wine, insurance, sports tuition, return flights and transfers (unless you make your own travel arrangements), children's clubs, evening shows and nightclubs. Your choices become a matter of inclination, not a series of purchasing decisions.' All perfectly true. For instance, Club Med offers excellent sporting facilities, especially for water-sports, tennis and golf. (Green fees are an extra). In Agadir, playing tennis at the club's immaculate sports ranch, 5km from the village, I unluckily tore a calf muscle while playing in a tournament. With great stoicism, I got aboard the shuttle bus and returned to the village where I received prompt medical attention. I was on crutches for three days. There was no charge for this attention, and the nurse told me that Club Med's insurance would cover things if, back at home, any mischance stemming from the injury should happen to cramp my lifestyle. For 1994, prices per adult per week for those travelling from Britain start at Pounds 495 all-in (Marrakech), Pounds 605 (Ouarzazate) and Pounds 659 (Agadir). The company has a special brochure for Morocco. You can combine a stay in Marrakech with one in Ouarzazate by travelling via Paris. And long weekends can be booked at the Agadir and Marrakech clubs - three nights, Thursday-Sunday - with next year's prices starting at Pounds 351 per adult in Marrakech and Pounds 416 in Agadir. Considering what you get, these prices are extremely competitive. Obviously, the further afield you travel, the greater the charge, but a glance through Club Med's 1993-94 winter sun brochure reveals plenty of attractive deals. Examples: seven nights in the Maldives next month, Pounds 1,320 per adult; in Guadeloupe, Pounds 1,257. There is also a Club Med skiing programme featuring 19 hotels in France, Switzerland, Italy, the US and Japan. Was there a downside to my holiday in Morocco? I can recall only one. In Ouarzazate and Agadir, swimming towels were provided free; in Marrakech, not. At the sports ranch in Marrakech where you go to do your swimming, I had no choice but to pay Pounds 25 for an especially unluxurious towel, which pleased me not a lot.

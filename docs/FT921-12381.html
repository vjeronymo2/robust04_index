			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Piper Alpha families decide not to prosecute THE PIPER ALPHA Families' and Survivors' Association said last night it had given up trying to prosecute rig owner Occidental privately for culpable homicide. It attacked the Lord Advocate, Scotland's senior law officer, for failing to prosecute the company in the wake of the 1988 tragedy, which cost 176 lives. Legal advisers have told the association the chances of securing a conviction had been reduced by a failure to obtain all available evidence - debris and several bodies on the sea bed - and by the sale of the rig company. Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) was a subsidiary of Occidental, the US oil company. Its assets were sold to Elf Aquitaine and Enterprise Oil after the disaster and its name changed to Elf Enterprise Caledonia.</p>

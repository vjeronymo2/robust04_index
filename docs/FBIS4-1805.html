			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent Chu Yu (2806 7183): "The PLA </F> General Logistics Department Issues a Circular Calling for a  Reduction in the Financial Burdens of the Troops"]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Mar (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--In a circular  issued today to the logistics departments of all major Army  units and the direct-supply units of the General Logistics  Department, the General Logistics Department calls for reducing  the troops' financial burdens.    The circular points out that, in recent years, all levels  and  departments throughout the Army have conscientiously implemented  the spirit of the instructions of the Central Military  Commission on stepping up army building at the grass-roots  levels. Given the shortage of funds, they have done a great  deal of practical work for the troops and have been well  received by them. However, the problem of heavy financial  burdens is still fairly conspicuous. Now that combat units  below the army level are no longer engaged in business  production, the financial reserves at their disposal have  correspondingly decreased, and the contradiction between fund  supply and demand has become even more apparent. For this  reason, all levels and departments -- especially the leading  organs -- should conscientiously reduce meetings and documents  and work vigorously to cut administrative expenditures. When  holding exchange-experience meetings, on-the-spot meetings, and  commendation meetings, when running training classes, and when  launching goal-reaching activities, they are not allowed to  apportion the outlays to Army units or do it in a disguised way,  because the expenditure of higher levels should not be  reimbursed by lower levels. No organ (unit) or individual is  allowed to indiscriminately demand reimbursements or aid from  Army units for whatever reason or in whatever name. Army units  have the right to refuse, in accordance with the relevant state  regulations, the apportionment of charges or aid requests by the  local authorities.    The circular specifically prohibits the diversion of surplus  company funds for any other purpose. It is necessary to supply  in full funds allocated to the grass-roots units according to  certain criteria. The surplus food expenses of company units  should be concentrated and placed in safe-keeping at units above  the regimental level. Company units should nevertheless be  given ready access to the funds, and the diversion of the funds  for any other purpose is strictly prohibited.    The circular says that, when inspecting work in Army units,  higher-level organs should make overall arrangements, improve  planning, have a clearer objective in mind, and pay attention to  practical results. They should travel with a minimum of pomp  and pay table expenses according to regulations. Army units are  not allowed to give special treatment to people from higher  levels, including leading cadres. Financial departments have  the right to refuse to reimburse expenses incurred in violation  of the regulations.</p>

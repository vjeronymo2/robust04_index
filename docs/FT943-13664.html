			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Sino-Indian trade route reopens India and China yesterday agreed to reopen an ancient trade route after 32 years, as Mr Qian Qichen, China's vice-premier and foreign minister, said during a visit to New Delhi that he hoped border disputes between the two countries would be resolved soon. Mr Qian and Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, signed an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal and tax evasion. The agreement provides for lower rates of taxation for income generated by transfer of technology and investment, with guidelines to resolve tax disputes and provisions for exchange of information on tax evasion. An ancient trade route through the Shipkila Pass on the border of Kinnaur district in Himachal Pradesh was formally restored with the signing of a protocol by the two governments. The route, which was closed in 1962 after the occupation of Tibet by China and the Indo-China war, will be serviced by trading complexes at Chhapan on the Indian side and Jueva on the Chinese side. Mr Qian said he hoped bilateral trade, which increased to Dollars 675m (Pounds 433m) in 1993-94 from Dollars 220m the previous year, would register further dramatic growth. The two countries also agreed to strengthen economic and technical co-operation in the steel sector. India's iron ore exports to China touched nearly 4m tonnes in 1993-94. Mr Qian's visit is the latest in a series of talks aimed at improving relations between Asia's two largest countries. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, Indian prime minister, visited Beijing last September, when an agreement to maintain peace along the 4,000km Sino-Indian border was signed. However, the two countries have been unable to reduce troops along the border or resolve several long-standing disputes, including China's refusal to accept the merger of Sikkim, a state between Nepal and Bhutan, with India in the 1970s.</p>

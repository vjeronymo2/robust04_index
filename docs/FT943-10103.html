			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: Macbeth into EastEnders Of course it has been done before, but never so ineptly. Transposing Shakespeare's Scottish play into a blood and thunder set in modern gangland goes back at least to 1955 and the cinematic Joe Macbeth. A London gangster version of Macbeth now swelters in the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, thanks to a company called London via Stoke, whose journey may not have been entirely necessary. The setting of Tony Longhurst's adaptation is the 1950s East End when professional crime was carving out its territory, though the Krays could never have been as dull as this. The rationale behind the concept, I suspect, is to give a chance of playing Shakespeare to actors who might in normal theatrical circumstances not get their tongues around the Bard. Thus the cockney Macbeth lapses into excitable gabble, which is sometimes unintelligible. Banquo's emergence as a phantom in the witches' prophecy scene is marked by the most unvarying monotone since the Daleks. And the lesser characters utter their lines with determinedly chatty casualness as if determined to transform highlanders into EastEnders. The ploddingly slow production, with its gaps, pauses and lack of rhythm, is by Longhurst and Elle Lewis. This may explain the inclusion of the usually omitted Hecate whom Miss Lewis plays as a bedizened whooper in black draperies wearing a torch in her cleavage, who bounds on stage snarling, spitting and yowling, like Mme Arcati auditioning for Cats. We lose the porter (which this company might have done well) and Lady Macduff - the latter a shame since the women are better than the men. Jacqueline McCarrick's Lady Macbeth, in a succession of little black numbers, plays like a young Joan Collins but gets all her words out clearly; and Lucy Christofi's First Witch is thoroughly professional. The updating consists of depicting the witches as three old tramps, bagladies without bags, who make up their magic menus as they go along, contributing to the dustbin/cauldron from a bottle of booze or grit produced, Atherton-style, from their pockets. The Scots nobility is represented by embarrassed-looking men in grey suits who stand fixedly displaying true British stoicism until moving off, as if by numbers. There seems no point to the modernisation, and references to kingship, armour and magic sound absurdly out of place, even in this age when updated productions are the norm. Bright spots are provided by Robert Niero, apparently Italian but whose Duncan better at enunciating English than his colleagues; and James Osborne's Malcolm. Mr Osborne knows how to speak with variations of volume, pitch and pace, can express emotion, and understands what he is saying. This is that rare thing, a production of Macbeth where the England scene - that often interminable testing of loyalty by the exiled Malcolm - is a highlight of clarity and drama. Michael McKell has, according to the programme, an impressive background as song-writer for Elaine Paige and Paul Nicholas. To judge by his Macbeth, his foreground as actor is less imposing, except towards the end when the 'Tomorrow' speech patently moves him and therefore us. This production, most of which would not pass muster with the average amateur dramatic society, is mystifyingly sponsored by the Evening Standard, oddly identified in the programme as 'The Quality Writing Paper'. I shall stick to Basildon Bond.</p>

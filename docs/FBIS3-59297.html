			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ch'en Kang (7115 1511): "Confidence in the </F> Renminbi Insufficient, Renminbi Could Further Depreciate"]    [Text] The mainland's renminbi (RMB) recently has been  rather stable, making for a temporary lessening of official  pressure. But there still is danger of a further decline in the  RMB. Several experts have come out with analyses of this problem  and made proposals to the central department. But these  proposals have all been tied up in the upper echelon and the  experts all are upset.    The RMB Devaluation View Is "Killed"    What is worse, the mainland departments concerned have  recently told dissemination units that they may not report the  view that the RMB could be further devalued, making the  situation more mysterious. The analysis and opinion that this  reporter is expressing in this article is among the opinions  "killed."    Of course, this reporter has not written off the official  efforts to adjust and control the RMB. Actually, the Chinese  Government recently has adopted extremely strict measures and  ordered local banks to recall conversion funds and loans to  assure key projects and agricultural byproduct purchasing funds.  So, all the local banks are adopting measures to recall funds  one after the other. The RMB money market is extremely tight,  and the State Council has now issued a notice that within the  year it will abolish the foreign exchange quotas of foreign  trade enterprises, causing some enterprises with rather large  foreign exchange balances to sell off large quantities of  foreign exchange.    Strong Measures Only Reap Temporary Effects    In another previous period when the banks forced enterprises  that were hoarding foreign exchange to pay back, they also sold  off large quantities of foreign exchange one after the other and  rushed to convert it to RMB to pay back. With this background,  the RMB exchange rate went straight up. At the same time, the  Bank of China twice raised the savings interest rates, causing  savings interest rates to reach double digits and temporarily  calming the fear of devaluation of the RMB among Chinese  citizens. It certainly was temporarily useful in restoring  confidence in the RMB.    But it was all the temporary change of strict measures  adopted by central authorities. With the passing of time, these  central policies gradually lost their effectiveness and the RMB  was further devalued. Because in the present situation the RMB  is receiving more and more pressure, measures adopted by the  central authorities cannot thoroughly eliminate pressure on the  RMB.    The Balance of Payments Could Change From Surplus to  Deficit    As regards the overall foreign trade situation, China is  changing from a surplus to a deficit. From 1990 through 1992,  the mainland had three successive years of surpluses and  accumulated US$20 billion in foreign exchange. With the Bank of  China's foreign exchange supply added, it totalled US$40  billion. Since 1992 China's export situation has worsened.  Imports have increased by 25 percent, but exports have only  increased by 18 percent. This year the situation is even more  serious. Imports are clearly greater than exports and the  surplus is getting smaller and smaller. It is estimated that in  the last half of this year, a deficit in the balance of payments  will occur. Looking at the first half of this year, it is quite  obvious that the lowering of the exchange rate on the RMB to  help exports of Chinese enterprises by no means accomplished  this result. China's present reduction in the money supply is  leading to a rise in the RMB exchange rate and is even more  unhelpful to the exports of Chinese enterprises, and China's  balance of payments deficit could increase, thereby essentially  creating greater pressure on the RMB.    Sustained growth of China's imports could lead to greater  pressure on the RMB. According to mainland statistics for the  past thirteen years, three months after every 100 million yuan  increase in domestic investment, imports increase by about US$15  million. In the recent rapid growth of the Chinese economy, the  reason that the retrenchment policies adopted by the central  authorities have not had the necessary effect is because the  central authorities can only control the portion in the central  plan and they can by no means control the large portion of  provincial, municipal, and local investment and the investment  outside the plan. If the central authorities adopt total  retrenchment and administrative measures, it also could have a  serious impact on the domestic economy. So, future imports could  still increase greatly. Certainly, "restoration to the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)" also could force China to  lower tariffs, leading to a large increase in imports. This  obviously could increase pressure on the RMB.    It presently appears that the RMB exchange rate could  temporarily decline, but it cannot be sustained. And once the  RMB exchange rate declines again, the Chinese government  obviously cannot use economic force to sell off large quantities  of foreign exchange to safeguard the strength of the value of  the RMB. Because the Chinese Government understands this, the  exchange rate for the RMB will decline. It is necessary to  promote exports and it is necessary to cope with the vigorous  increase in imports after "restoration to GATT" and its impact  on national industry.    High Estimate of the RMB Value Leads to Black Market  Rates of Exchange    It is extremely obvious that China in not establishing a  favorable balance of payments base for the stability of  adjustments in the exchange rate, but using administrative  methods to control and limit foreign exchange prices, ultimately  can only create a high appraisal of the RMB. Individuals and  companies that have foreign exchange do not want to take their  foreign exchange to the adjustment market to sell, causing the  foreign exchange adjustment market "to have a price, but no  market." This situation can only promote the pouring of a large  amount of foreign exchange into the black market for sale and  China's black market value has for a time reached the high level  of 11 yuan to the U.S. dollar. So, China's reform of the  exchange rate will impel further devaluation of the RMB.  Eliminating the foreign exchange quota and changing "quota  controls" to "spot price controls" requires that the posted  exchange rate price of the RMB be devalued to the level of the  adjusted exchange rate, that is, from the current official rate  of 5.8 yuan to the U.S. dollar to approximately 9 yuan. This  will force the RMB exchange rate to be further devalued to  between 8.5 and 10 yuan.    Foreign exchange black market trends are determined from the  supply and demand relationship of RMB and foreign exchange. When  foreign exchange supply and demand are unbalanced, the RMB can  be devalued. But the domestic economy is presently contracting  and issuance of RMB is controlled. The RMB could increase in  value for a period of time and the the government could at the  same time adopt measures to reduce the economy. So, a policy to  tighten the RMB could temporarily support stability. But a  rather great number of Chinese economists agree with this  reporter that the goal of reducing the economy will not  necessarily be effective and it is not easy to be optimistic  about the situation. If it is not handled properly, serious  inflation could quite possibly occur and control of the issuance  of the RMB could be lost, causing further devaluation.    Agitation to devalue the RMB also causes Chinese citizens to  develop a mentality anticipating devaluation. This mentality is  extremely unhelpful to maintaining the stability of the RMB.  From the present situation it appears that mainland citizens  generally expect that the RMB could be devalued. There is  insufficient confidence in the RMB, although the monthly  interest on domestic foreign exchange deposits is only 3  percent, two thirds or more lower than the interest on RMB  deposits. But the vast majority of citizens still do not want to  sell large quantities of foreign currency to buy RMB. Rather  they have a tendency to save much foreign exchange to maintain  their worth. According to this reporter's statistics, mainland  citizens' private savings have reached US$10 billion, half the  national foreign exchange reserves. It can be affirmed that in a  short while, in addition to stocks, stockpiling foreign exchange  will be mainland citizens' future way of maintaining their worth  and the principal method of guarding against risks. With the  trend of this kind of mentality of Chinese citizens, it will be  very difficult to avoid further devaluation of the RMB.</p>

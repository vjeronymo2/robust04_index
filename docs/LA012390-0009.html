			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELIZATION OF CENTRAL COAST  </P> <P> Having grown up in Los Angeles during the 1950s, having lived in Santa Maria  attending Cal Poly at San Luis Obispo during the 1960s, and having resided in  San Diego County for the last 18 years, I am wondering if that makes one a  quasi-expert on the "Los Angelization" of the entire California coast?  </P> <P> There certainly has been a massive movement out of Los Angeles, both north and  south.  </P> <P> Nowhere more than San Diego County can this mass migration of Angelenos be  found. San Diego, formerly a sleepy little Navy town, having more in common  with Tijuana than Los Angeles, has dedicated itself to imitating its neighbor  to the north with accelerated yuppie fervor. Within a decade there should be no  more open land in San Diego. Within three decades decay should be setting in as  is happening in beautiful Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Now we read in your paper that Los Angelization is moving north into San Luis  Obispo County -- it certainly was inevitable (Part A, Jan. 7). Where else could  it go? It's too wet to the west, too dry to the east, and San Diego County has  already prostituted itself to the south. But still untouched is beautiful,  pastoral, quaint San Luis Obispo. Remember the old ad "Come North for the Slo"?  Times aren't changing "slo," they're changing rapidly.  </P> <P> Since I have also lived and traveled extensively in Northern California (I mean  the real north), I think I will just keep my memories and experiences to  myself. God forbid the "sophisticated" hordes from Los Angeles venture farther  than 200-300 miles from home.  </P> <P> PHILLIP A. HONISCH  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Triton Europe turns in Pounds 2.61m halfway Triton Europe, the independent oil and gas exploration and production group, reported after-tax profits of Pounds 2.61m for the six months to November 30. The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 28m in the corresponding period of 1990 although this figure reflected the benefit of higher oil prices resulting from the Gulf war and exceptional profits from the sale of the group's North Sea assets and an exchange gain on the subsequent reduction in bank debt. Net production over the interim period amounted to 949,700 barrels - an average of 5,200 barrels per day - which represented a decline of 6 per cent. Some 88 per cent of the output stemmed from the Villeperdue field in France where another four horizontal wells are scheduled later this year. Directors said they were undertaking a re-evaluation of the group's current licence interests and exploration commitments. Several licences would be farmed out or relinquished and some applications for new exploration acreage would be withdrawn. Earnings per share emerged at 3.17p (33.96p). No interim dividend is declared (1p).</p>

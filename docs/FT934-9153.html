			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / 'Hans van den Brittan' ends the Brussels feud MR HANS van den Broek, the European commissioner responsible for external political affairs, yesterday dropped his resignation threats and agreed to a truce in his long-running power struggle with Sir Leon Brittan, the Commission's chief trade negotiator, writes Lionel Barber. Mr van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister, was on the brink of quitting until a last-minute compromise brokered by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president. Under the deal, Mr van den Broek will take over management responsibility for the European Union's overseas delegations and will have a share in appointing Brussels civil servants to the 110 offices abroad. Mr Delors is said to be upset by the bickering between Sir Leon and Mr van den Broek who are both political heavyweights. Other commissioners have found the feuding a source of amusement - one insider's joke is that the only satisfactory way to separate the foreign affairs portfolio is to create a new commissioner called 'Mr Hans van den Brittan'. However, the Dutchman has failed in his wider gambit to put all overseas staff under the umbrella of DG1 A, his own Brussels directorate. Sir Leon and Mr van den Broek have been battling over the division of their responsibilities ever since they took up their posts 10 months ago. During the latest row, Sir Leon argued that it would be illogical to make all overseas personnel responsible to Mr van den Broek since 80 per cent of the EU's work deals with trade and commerce.</p>

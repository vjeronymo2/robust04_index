			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in BT3 the government's final 22 per cent tranche of BT - jumped to a healthy premium, although profit-taking later took the shine off the first day's trading. Dealers reported that, as expected, small investors were first in the queue to off-load their shares as trading began. With institutional investors ready to buy up available stock, the shares jumped to an immediate 20p premium. Some institutions had received fewer shares than they had applied for, the global share offer being five times oversubscribed. As the session got under way, there was also increasing arbitraging between the new partly-paid and ordinary shares. Turnover in the former reached 187m both ways out of the total issue of 1.22bn. The shares peaked in mid-morning at 175p, before profit-taking and a slackening in demand. They closed at 168p, a rise of 18 on the day. The ordinary put on 5 at 413 1/2 p in exceptionally heavy turnover of 72m. While the stabilisation programme being undertaken by SG Warburg, the government's adviser, will limit downward pressure, analysts are predicting a dull time for the new BT stock. 'Increased competition and regulatory concerns will be hanging over the issue for some months to come,' said one telecoms specialist.</p>

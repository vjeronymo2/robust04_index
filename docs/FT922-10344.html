			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Asia Pacific: Nikkei falls on light arbitrage unwinding SHARE PRICES finally closed lower on small-lot arbitrage unwinding after the Nikkei average fluctuated amid low volume as most investors remained inactive due to the Golden Week holidays, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 136.69 to 17,390.71 after a day's high of 17,581.79 and low of 17,363.81. The index was buoyed at the start of the session by buying prompted by the overnight strength in New York. However, index and arbitrage-related selling later depressed the Nikkei. Volume decreased to 220m shares from Tuesday's 250m. Activity thinned out in the middle of the holiday week: Tokyo's financial markets were closed on Wednesday and will be shut next Monday and Tuesday for national holidays. Declines led rises by 576 to 360, with 202 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 1.54 to 1,317.46. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.49 to 1,072.63. Blue chip high-technology issues were firm on light buying by foreign investors. Hitachi, the most active issue of the day, gained Y1 to Y850 and Matsushita Electric Industrial added Y30 at Y1,440. Leading large-capital stocks were sought by investment trust funds targeted for large-lot investors. Nippon Steel put on Y4 to Y309 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y5 to Y585. Ishihara Sangyo, a chemical manufacturer, closed Y22 higher at Y357. The issue has been popular recently among short-term traders buying on margin. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone retreated Y1,000 to Y635,000 on profit-taking. The stock gained ground on Tuesday on reports that the Ministry of Finance was considering a cut in the issue's minimum trading unit. Banks involved in the rescue plan for the ailing Toyo Shinkin Bank, a credit co-operative at the centre of a loan fraud scandal last year, rose as traders said the negative factors had already been discounted into share prices. Industrial Bank of Japan improved Y20 to Y1,850 and Fuji Bank Y10 to Y1,400. Both will forfeit 70 per cent of claims held against Toyo, and IBJ will provide Y50bn of low interest loans to Sanwa Bank, another leading commercial bank which will acquire a majority of Toyo's assets. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 65.90 to 19,806.56 in volume of 15.6m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y200 to Y10,400 and Ono Pharmaceutical lost Y100 to Y5,780. Roundup A THREE-MONTH high was attained by Australia, while other markets in the Pacific Basin were generally stronger. AUSTRALIA was boosted by expectations of a cut in interest rates next week. The All Ordinaries index added 26.1 at 1,655.9, but closed off the day's high of 1,661.6. Turnover came to ADollars 386.6m. Banks were strong: National Australia moved ahead 10 cents to ADollars 7.68, Westpac 7 cents to ADollars 4.05 and ANZ 8 cents to ADollars 4.44. BHP climbed 24 cents to ADollars 14.18 and CRA rose 32 cents to ADollars 14.38. HONG KONG saw early gains eroded by profit-taking. The Hang Seng index ended just 7.16 up at 5,369.57 in turnover of HKDollars 2.78bn. Second line stocks were the most active: Tian An China rose 5 cents to HKDollars 3.425 and Peregrine 7.5 cents to HKDollars 2.20. TAIWAN declined after the US said it would impose trade sanctions unless efforts were made to reduce piracy of US intellectual property rights. The weighted index lost 17 points to 4,496.19 in turnover of TDollars 15.9bn. The electronics sector was particularly weak because of its reliance on US exports. Acer Computer lost 30 cents to TDollars 22, Microtek International TDollars 2.50 to TDollars 52.50 and United Micro Electronics 80 cents to TDollars 45.40. SINGAPORE closed higher. The Straits Times Industrial index advanced 28.99 to 1,465.95. Banks and shipyard issues led the gains, with Far East Levingston Shipbuilding firming 25 cents to SDollars 5.55. SEOUL was stronger in heavy trade. The composite index put on 3.25 to 615.97 in turnover of Won491bn. Goldstar appreciated Won600 to Won12,100.

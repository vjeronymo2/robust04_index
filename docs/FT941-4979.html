			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Caribbean apparel sales to US soar Caribbean Basin countries increased the volume and value of apparel exported to the US by a quarter last year, as a result of special agreements for access and increased quotas. The region accounted for almost 14 per cent of the US market. The Caribbean's apparel exports to the US in 1993 totalled 12.3bn square metres, 24 per cent more than in the previous year and well ahead of the 6 per cent increase in worldwide apparel exports to the US last year. Earnings by Caribbean Basin countries from the US increased 23 per cent last year to Dollars 3.9bn (Pounds 2.67bn). 'The Caribbean Basin countries' share of the US apparel market grew to 13.74 per cent last year, compared to 14.9 per cent held by South East Asia's Asean group, 4.15 per cent by the European Union, 2.24 per cent by Latin America and 1.68 per cent by Africa,' said Mr Peter King, chairman of the Caribbean's Textile and Apparel Institute. 'Some of the major product lines were knitted and woven shirts, trousers and shorts, T-shirts, hosiery, underwear and foundation garments.' Most of the region's apparel exports to the US are produced under the 807 offshore assembly programme which allows garments to be assembled in the region from fabric made and cut in the US and re-exported to the US with duty paid on the value added in assembly. The main regional exporter to the US last year was the Dominican Republic whose shipments increased by 18 per cent to earn Dollars 1.4bn. Costa Rica's exports increased by 12 per cent to Dollars 650m, followed by Guatemala, up 2 per cent to Dollars 544m, Honduras up 43 per cent to Dollars 500m and Jamaica up 31 per cent to Dollars 381m. Mr King is forecasting another 25 per cent increase in volume and value of regional apparel exports to the US this year, despite fears the Mexican industry, using the North American Free Trade Agreement, could eat into Caribbean markets.</p>

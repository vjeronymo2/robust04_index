			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / International Company News: NTT slips 14.8% as competition intensifies NTT, the Japanese telecommunications group, yesterday reported a 14.8 per cent drop in unconsolidated pre-tax earnings to Y352.8bn (Dollars 2.7bn) for fiscal 1991. It predicted that profits will decline by 24.3 per cent to Y267bn in fiscal 1992 on unchanged sales as competition increases in the deregulated Japanese market. Net profit will drop by 28.5 per cent to Y134bn. The profits slide in fiscal 1991 was due to a 8.8 per cent fall in operating profit to Y528.7bn and a growing financial income deficit, which increased by 6.5 per cent to Y175.3bn. Net income fell by 16.5 per cent to Y187.3bn. Sales increased by a modest 1.6 per cent to Y6bn, reflecting telephone rate cuts and sluggish growth in new subscribers. NTT has been losing market share, particularly in the areas of long-distance calls and mobile telephone services, to specialised carriers. It was forced to cut long-distance rates in March 1991 to match lower rates offered by competitors. This contributed to a 3.7 per cent decline in call rate revenues, which account for about half of total sales. The growth in operating costs outpaced income with a 2.8 per cent rise because of expanded digitisation and efforts to improve customer services. NTT's growing net financial deficit reflected a 6 per cent fall in financial income to Y71.4bn, while financial expenses grew by 2.6 per cent to Y246.8bn due to a devaluation of NTT's securities portfolio. It will retain its dividend at Y5,000 per share. NTT is being opened to foreign investment, which will be limited to holding 20 per cent.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Suggestions To Woo Rightists Into Election -- Johannesburg  THE STAR in English on 24 February in a page-22 editorial  proposes "two changes in approach" to get the Freedom Alliance  (FA) to participate in the election: "First: asymmetry. Allow  a fractious province (kwaZulu/Natal) to exercise more power than  other provinces might wish to. Second: abolish the override.  The battle about where central power can override a province is  not worth the trouble. If the elected government of a province  fails to meet basic norms, leave the judgment to its voters.  Considerable efforts have been made to satisfy the FA. History  says: keep trying."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   `Little Chance' of Election Postponement -- "Political  opposition to the election is bound to be fanatical and violent,  even if there is unexpected progress in the last-minute efforts  to achieve an inclusive settlement," points out a page-14  editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 24  February. "But if the pro-election campaigns can capture the  public imagination, there must be a good chance that the  spoilers will be overwhelmed by the numbers of those who want to  choose South Africa's first representative government." The  Business Election Fund was launched this week, as well as the  publicity campaign explaining the role of the Independent  Electoral Commission, setting the country "firmly on course for  the historic poll in April. There now seems little chance that  it will be postponed, whatever the threats of disruption."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Homeland Amendment 'Vague and Impractical' -- "With the  inclusion of a `self-determination' clause in the amended  interim constitution, South Africa is sailing into dangerous  waters," warns a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on 24 February. "The problem is the ANC [African  National Congress] and the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] cannot  exactly spell out what they mean by self-determination. The  Right wildly lay claim to the OFS [Orange Free State], Transvaal  and Northern Natal as sovereign volkstaats [homelands] while  some negotiations vaguely speak about Afrikaner cantons. The  ANC gives the impression it is an issue it hopes will fizzle out  after the election. The criticism levelled by the PAC's  [Pan-Africanist Congress] Barney Desai at the World Trade Centre  this week is valid: The volkstaat amendment is a vague and  impractical promise unlikely to be fulfilled. It also leaves  the door ajar for other groups to make similar claims to self-  determination and territory and the Balkanisation of South  Africa."  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   Keys's Growing Economic Optimism -- Cape Town CAPE TIMES in  English on 21 February in a page-4 editorial says Finance  Minister Derek Keys's "growing optimism about the economy" is  encouraging news for the labor and business community, and it  "might be unduly cynical to suggest that such pronouncements  should be regarded in an election context." Only "two days ago"  economists expected the economy to grow by about 2-2.5 percent.  Now Keys thinks the 1994 growth figure will be 3-4 percent.  "It would be easy to dismiss such a shift as short term  expediency by a politician with creative accounting abilities,  but with Mr Keys this is unlikely. For starters, it is quite  possible that he will still be presiding over the economy during  the reign of the government of national unity. Far from  enhancing his reputation and that of the National Party, Mr Keys  stands every chance of becoming a scapegoat if buoyant growth  fails to materialise."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Standerton Community Provokes Black Majority -- A page-8  editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 18 February  argues: "The blame for the events at Standerton in which 30  people were injured must first and foremost be placed on the  shoulders of the right wing which decided unilaterally that the  town must be incorporated into the so-called homeland. The ANC  supporters who wanted to deliver a memorandum to the town hall  in protest against such plans were fully entitled to express  their dissatisfaction, provided that it was done in an orderly  manner. It is a pity that blacks in the town were forbidden  from doing so by the local magistrate declaring their march  unlawful. A small portion of the community cannot provoke the  overwhelming majority in this way and then expect no one to  protest." "What happened at Standerton must serve as a warning  to those who believe they can simply force unworkable plans on  others."   <H6>    BEELD </H6>   ANC Nurtures Communist Links -- Johannesburg BEELD in  Afrikaans on 21 February says in a page-6 editorial: "In his  first speech after his release, Mr. Nelson Mandela made a  gesture towards his communist allies from the past. One had  expected it. The `liberation front' had to pay its dues to  countries and leaders who had themselves not set an example for  freedom. However, one would not expect the ANC to still nurture  these ties a few years down the line. The whole world has  changed since then, with communism having collapsed, and with it  the tyrannical authoritarianism which formed such a large part  of the 20th century. But the ANC remains in alliance with the  South African Communist Party," says BEELD, and "further  evidence of how it holds alive the past are its ties with Cuba  and Libya, countries which the United States views as terrorist  states. In a draft document, the ANC's department of  international affairs again stands up for Cuba, asking that the  new government establish ties with Cuba and that the United  States lift its economic sanctions against Cuba." "With such an  approach the ANC will not attract international assistance to  South Africa to create prosperity. At some time or another the  ANC will have to choose between its friends and the interests of  the people of South Africa."    Violence Must be Stopped -- A second editorial on page-6 of  BEELD says: "In South Africa there is the reality are  politicial leaders who at gatherings plead the cause of  tolerance and free political participation. There is, however,  a second reality of intimidation and violence on the ground  which is raging on unhindered and claiming more and more  victims. Only last week the ANC complained that the death of a  Nelspruit National Party organizer should be investigated in the  ANC. At Creighton in Natal 15 ANC supporters died in a  bloodbath. Civilized behavior has clearly become the first  victim of the relentless power struggle being waged in the  country. Political parties must know, though, that what is  being sown by their followers today will be reaped by all in the  months and years ahead."</p>

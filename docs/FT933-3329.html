			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Upward momentum for Dow slows Wall Street US STOCKS saw their upward momentum that they had regained at the end of last week mainly slow to a halt yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average registering only a modest advance ahead of today's reports on consumer prices and retail sales, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close the Dow was 12.58 higher at 3,634.21. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained just 0.34 at 462.06. Secondary markets closed on a soft note, the American SE composite losing 1.76 at 454.30 and the Nasdaq composite shedding 3.99 to 740.32. Trading volume on the New York SE was 245m shares. With no significant economic news to digest, investors were looking forward to the release today of the consumer price index for August. The figures are expected to show that inflation at the retail level remains very low, reinforcing the impression left by August's producer price index, released on Friday. At the end of last week, sentiment was jolted out of the doldrums when the government reported that wholesale prices had declined by a surprising 0.6 per cent last month. The upbeat mood carried over to yesterday's opening. Once again equities took their cue from the bond market, where the price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue continued to firm in early trade before ending the day on a flat note. Share prices, following a similar pattern, slipped to mixed levels in late trading. But investors did not appear to be unduly troubled by what is expected to be a slight decline in retail sales for August. Paramount Communications was one of the most actively traded stocks, following an agreement by Viacom to acquire the entertainment company for Dollars 69.14 a share. On the NYSE, Paramount rose Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 64 1/2 with 3.2m shares traded. On the Amex, Viacom 'A' voting stock was down Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 64 1/8 and the 'B' non-voting lost Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 56 3/4 . Car issues were given a lift by news that Ford Motor had made progress in union contract negotiations which will set a pattern for the industry. Ford advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55, General Motors Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 47 1/2 and Chrysler Dollars 1 to Dollars 45 1/2. In the health care sector, share prices edged lower on the release of further details of President Bill Clinton's reform plans. Warner-Lambert shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 66 5/8 , Pfizer lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 60 3/8 , Merck was down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 31 3/8 , Johnson &amp; Johnson slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38 5/8 and Schering-Plough receded Dollars 1 to Dollars 60. Canada TORONTO finished lower in fairly heavy trading due to a continued slide in gold stocks. The TSE 300 index fell 29.9 to 3,971.8 and declines outscored advances by 461 to 273. Volume rose to 64.4m shares from Friday's 55.8m but trading value declined to CDollars 430m from CDollars 590m. The gold shares index plunged 5.38 per cent as the bullion price dropped a further USDollars 7.45 an ounce in New York.</p>

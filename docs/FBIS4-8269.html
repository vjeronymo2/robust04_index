			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 10 (CTK) -- Most of the expert  reports and surveys commissioned by the Czech Television Council  (RCT), as well as its own observations shows that Czech  Television (CT) provides government politicians with more air  time than it is usual in standard democracies, the RCT annual  report for 1993 says.    This stems from the fact that "the activity of government  representatives is very important and interesting from viewers'  point of view" and "in a number of important political,  economic, and social issues no independent experts and observers  exist," states the report, which was submitted to the parliament  this week. Therefore, their role is taken by government  officials or even ministers, the report adds.    Further causes are that recently most opposition parties  have  been dealing with internal problems and that controversial views  exist even within the coalition, the report states.    "The RCT does not consider the current state to be optimal,"  the report says. However, it is possible to say that  objectivity in news coverage has increased, while the occurrence  of concealed commentaries within the news reports has declined.  The work of foreign correspondents has improved as well, the  report says.    CT holds a unique position in the production of original  dramatic programs for adults, the report notes. "For long years  to come, no private TV company will be able to produce what the  CT can make in a single year," the report says, specifying that  the CT has produced 63 premieres of feature films, shown seven  theater performances, and 11 serials.    CT shows were watched by 85 percent of the Czech Republic's  population, the report says. Virtually every adult person  watched CT, while the largest interest focused on CT 1 channel  (79 percent of viewers). Forty-nine percent watched CT 2, and  11 percent CT 3. People aged 50-59 watch the most CT.    The decline in watching CT recorded in 1992 stopped in the  second half of 1993, while the degree of satisfaction with  broadcast shows has increased, the report says.</p>

Properly handling the relations between reform,  development, and stability is of crucial importance to  accomplishing all tasks this year.    We have learned from the experiences we have gained from  reforms and opening up during the past decade or so that reform,  development, and stability are closely related; that nothing can  be achieved without a stable social environment; and that  stability can be fundamentally maintained only when we persist  in carrying out reform, opening up to the outside world, and  developing the economy. China's national economy has enjoyed two  consecutive years of high growth, and our success has caught  worldwide attention. Meanwhile, certain conditions for economic  growth have become more stringent as a result of a "bottleneck"  hindrance and increasing pressure from inflation during our  economic development; and how to maintain a sustained, rapid,  and healthy national economic growth, ensure the successful  implementation of all reform measures, and maintain social and  political stability have become major problems to which all  party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, must  attach great importance and exert themselves to resolve.    This year is crucial for implementing the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decision and changing  the economic structure. Various major reform measures for  establishing a socialist market economic structure have been  introduced since early this year. The mission from now on is to  make meticulous efforts in organizing their implementation.  According to the objectives of establishing a socialist market  economic structure, many reform measures to be carried out this  year are preliminary in nature and we must follow the right  direction and exert ourselves in establishing the new structure  from the very beginning. Efforts must be made in this regard  while reforming the financial, taxation, banking, investment,  planning, and foreign trade systems so that a framework of the  new structure can be set up. We must continue to implement the  "Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations Governing the Change of  State-Owned Industrial Enterprise Operating Mechanisms," and  exert positive efforts in changing the state-owned enterprises'  operating mechanisms and exploring effective ways to establish a  modern enterprise system. We must expedite price reform in a  timely manner and develop a consolidated, open, competitive, and  orderly market system. The basic way to solve the outstanding  problems and deep-seated economic problems lies in deepening  reform. Without a deepened reform, it is unlikely we can  expedite development and achieve stability. Leading authorities  at all levels must rally and lead the broad masses of cadres and  people to take a clear-cut stand in supporting reform, actively  throw themselves into reform, and work earnestly and  meticulously in pushing forward reform. To make sure that all  reform projects can proceed healthily and successfully, we must  sternly criticize and resolutely correct those who have  disregarded the requirement of overall importance, gone their  own ways, and acted erroneously -- such as recklessly raising  prices -- by flaunting the banner of reform.    The purpose of speeding up the pace of reform toward  establishing a socialist market economic structure is to  liberate and develop productive forces even further. We must  firmly focus on economic construction and concentrate our  efforts on boosting national economic development. Under no  circumstances should we waver in this regard. Development is  the last word. We need new ideas and ways to achieve  development. While setting economic development targets, we  must make sure that mental emancipation and being pratical are  unified, that we attach greater importance to higher quality  when pursuing higher total output, and that we never return to  the old path of seeking high output value and expanding  investments unscrupulously. We must steer our economic  construction to the track of counting on scientific and  technological progress and improving workers' qualities; make  great efforts to readjust structures and achieve higher returns;  and achieve higher growth through improving management,  upgrading technology, and improving quality. Only growth  achieved in such a way is solid. We must continue to strengthen  and improve macroeconomic regulation and control,  comprehensively coordinate economic operations, and maintain a  basic balance of economic aggregates. A sustained, rapid, and  healthy national economic development is the foundation of  social stability; and it can also create an economic and social  environment favorable for the reform process.    To deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, and  promote national economic and social development in all  quarters, we must continue to consolidate political stability  and unity and maintain social stability. The deepening of  reform and the development of the economy certainly will give  rise to readjustments of the patterns of interests in certain  sectors and changes of mentality, and they will inevitably touch  certain deep-seated contradictions and encounter many complex  situations and issues never encountered before. We must  correctly distinguish and handle the two different types of  contradictions, and pay particular attention to knowing the  development of things from small clues and checking erroneous  ideas at the outset so that problems can be properly resolved  when they are still in the bud. We must oppose bureaucraticism  and subjectivism. We must go deep into the realities of life to  investigate and study, to understand the people's mental state  at all times, and to intensify and improve ideological and  political work. We must establish close ties with the masses,  care about their livelihood, and always be concerned with their  well-being. While our reform is in line with the fundamental  interests of the overwhelming majority of people, not everyone  in all strata can enjoy the same interests and benefits at the  same time during the reform process. Moreover, the levels of  economic development are also very uneven in different areas.  This being the case, we must pay special attention to caring  for and assisting those who are not well off, or may even be  quite badly off, for the time being. Upholding the principle of  being firm in "promoting material civilization and socialist  ethics at the same time," we must intensify building a socialist  spiritual civilization and a democratic legal system, and  harshly crack down on crime. We must remain sober minded and  persist in cracking down on hostile forces' sabotage activities.    In short, development is our objective, reform is the  dynamics, and stability provides the guarantee. These three are  an organic whole. Understanding and grasping the inner ties  among them constitute the level and art of leadership which  leading cadres at all levels, especially senior leading cadres,  must have. During this new year, we must, under the leadership  of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  core, firmly adhere to the guidance provided by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and that provided by the party's basic line,  comprehensively implement the guidelines laid down by the 14th  national party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, and seize new and even greater  victories in our cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.</p>

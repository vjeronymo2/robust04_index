			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Nissan UK suffers 61% fall in profits Nissan UK, the former importer and distributor of Nissan vehicles which is controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, suffered a 61.3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 24.87m in the year to the end of July 1992 from Pounds 64.2m a year earlier. The company, which was at the heart of Britain's biggest corporate tax fraud, is fighting in the High Court against a petition from the Inland Revenue seeking to put it into liquidation. The High Court has appointed Mr Colin Bird and Mr Dipanka Ghosh of accountants Price Waterhouse as provisional liquidators of Nissan UK. This appointment was extended yesterday pending a hearing of the case. Nissan UK is challenging the appointment of the provisional liquidators and the winding-up petition. According to the company's latest annual report, turnover in the year to July 1992 fell by 47.7 per cent to Pounds 307.6m, from Pounds 588.6m a year earlier. The company was deprived from the end of 1991 of the lucrative franchise to import and distribute Nissan vehicles in Britain. According to its latest directors' report signed at the end of last month, the company is now engaged chiefly in property and in the leasing of dealerships to car retailers. The report states that it intends 'to maximise income and profits from the company's property portfolio in the hope that the market for retail garage properties will improve'. After losing the Nissan franchise, the company completed the disposal of its parts business and remaining vehicle stocks by February this year, says the report. The previous seven-man board has been reduced to two. These are Mr Botnar and Mr Manfred Weder, a Swiss lawyer. The annual report shows that Mr Botnar was paid Pounds 316,000 by Nissan UK in 1991-92. It also reveals that another unidentified director received emoluments totalling Pounds 1.89m excluding pension. Mr Botnar, aged 80, who remains chairman of the company, has been living in Switzerland and has not returned to the UK since January 1992 when a warrant was issued for his arrest. The report shows that Mr Michael Hunt, former assistant managing director of Nissan UK and a significant individual shareholder in Nissan UK Holdings, resigned from the board on June 28. He was jailed on June 30 for eight years for his part in the tax fraud. He is to appeal against both his conviction and sentence. Mr Hunt was convicted for conspiring to defraud the Revenue of Pounds 55m in corporation tax. The Revenue has issued an estimated assessment against the company of Pounds 238m, but the company claims in its latest annual report that it is contesting 'vigorously' the assessment 'as having no basis in fact'. Mr Hunt's co-defendant Mr Frank Shannon, a former finance director with the company, was sentenced to three years at the end of June after pleading guilty before the trial began to one offence of cheating the Revenue.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Kode 11% ahead at Pounds 1.14m Profits of Kode International, the electronics and computer services group, rose to Pounds 1.14m pre-tax for the year to December 31, an improvement of 11 per cent over the previous year's Pounds 1.03m. The directors said, however, that the result was 'disappointing' bearing in mind the considerable increase achieved in the opening half year. Turnover of continuing operations improved from Pounds 20.92 to Pounds 24.92m - the comparative figure included Pounds 2.58m from acquisitions. A fall in earnings to 7p (8.6p) reflected the number of shares in issue following the rights issue in 1992. A final dividend of 4p makes a 6p (5.5p) total. With the market for maintenance business remaining 'extremely competitive' the directors said they were 'very cautious' about the outlook for the immediate future.</p>

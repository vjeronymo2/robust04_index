			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRUSTRATION BUILDS OVER RATE HIKES AT MOBILE HOME PARK;  </P> <P> HOUSING: FIXED-INCOME RENTERS IN WESTMINSTER SAY THE LATEST ROUND OF COST  INCREASES MEANS THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE THERE AND CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE OUT.  </P> <P> Annette Smock survives on $439 a month in Social Security disability benefits,  but like many on fixed incomes at the West Grove Mobile Home Park near the  Garden Grove Freeway, it may no longer be enough.  </P> <P> Last September the Mel Mack Co., owner of the mobile home park on Hoover  Street, began charging residents fees for water and trash collection, then  raised the monthly rent by $30 per mobile home in January. The company owns  seven mobile home parks across the county and implemented the charges at every  park.  </P> <P> Like about a third of the other senior citizens who live at the park, which  houses 97 coaches, Smock, 53, is on a fixed income. Smock said that since her  husband died last August she has had to borrow money from friends for living  expenses and to help pay her late husband's medical bills.  </P> <P> "I can't borrow any more money because I can't pay them back," she said, her  eyes welling with tears. "It's terrible. It's just terrible."  </P> <P> Smock's current rent is $347.50 a month, but with the additional charges the  cost of her rent and utilities fluctuates between $384 to $392 a month. And  with other living expenses, she will be spending more than $550 a month.  </P> <P> "My bills don't even include my food," she said.  </P> <P> Smock, who worked at Los Alamitos Race Track for 11 years, has not been able to  work since 1984 because of back and neck problems. She has spasms in her right  arm from nerve damage and suffers from arthritis. She also has a chronic, mild  spinal disease.  </P> <P> "I've been a worker all my life and I love to work," she said. "I would if I  could. Now, I've been saving soda cans and bottles to help (support myself)."  </P> <P> In previous years, Mel Mack has raised the rent at its mobile home parks by $20  a month and never charged for water and trash collection, according to the  manager of one Mel Mack-owned mobile park manager who did not wish to give her  name. The company owns mobile home parks in Santa Ana, Westminster, Buena Park,  Anaheim, Garden Grove and Stanton.  </P> <P> "Orange County is the most expensive place to live," said the manager, who  operates the company's Santa Ana Gables Mobile Home Park. "Even though these  people are complaining, they are getting the best deal around. We never have  raised rent more than once a year. We will probably never have one this high  again."  </P> <P> The Mel Mack Co. referred The Times' inquiries on the issue to its attorney,  who failed to respond to repeated telephone calls.  </P> <P> But in a five-page statement sent out to mobile-home owners last week, the Mel  Mack Co. told residents to "look at what has happened in Orange County these  last few years. . . . We are one of the most popular places to live in the  entire United States. Housing costs are going up at a phenomenal rate. . . .  Compared to what the typical person has to pay to live in Orange County, you  have a great housing value."  </P> <P> It also said, it is "very common in other parks to separately charge for such  things as water, sewer and trash. One reason is so that you can see how  outrageous these governmental-approved utility charges have become and realize  that we are as helpless as you to do anything about them. If you want to get  mad or blame someone, talk to the utility companies and your local governmental  representatives."  </P> <P> Brent Swanson, an attorney who represents Mel Mack Co., said the company has a  renters' assistance program and said "we told the residents last week that  there is financial assistance available."  </P> <P> "No residents have come to us saying that they can no longer afford the rent,"  he said. "Our rent increase is the same or comparable with other mobile home  parks."  </P> <P> Smock said she called Mel Mack recently to ask about financial aid.  </P> <P> "At first, the person on the phone didn't know anything about housing  assistance. So, they took my number and called me back with the name and number  of someone with the Orange County Housing Authority. I'm still trying to get  through," she said.  </P> <P> Smock said she has been trying to get financial assistance from the Department  of Housing and Urban Development but was told that there was a three-year wait.  She said she will make an appointment to see if she qualifies under Social  Security for a widow's pension.  </P> <P> The Housing Authority helps people obtain rental assistance. It is funded  through HUD and there is a two- to five-year waiting period before assistance  can start, according to a housing authority staff member.  </P> <P> Lois M. Goley, 91, another West Grove resident on a fixed income, said that  after 17 years at the park she wants to sell her mobile home and move because  she cannot afford the rent.  </P> <P> Goley said her rent was $315, but it increased to $347.50, plus the additional  charges. In total, she said, her bills and rent come out to more than $400 a  month.  </P> <P> "I can't afford that kind of rent," she said.  </P> <P> Some residents, like Goley and Smock, said they would like to move out but are  having trouble selling their home because Mel Mack Co. requires that the homes  be repaired before they are sold.  </P> <P> In the same statement sent to each home, management said it is "only very  rarely that someone who is shopping for a mobile home wants to buy a  'fixer-upper.' This is one of the reasons why we ask people who have their  homes up for sale to clean and fix them up. Obviously, if they'll do this,  their home will sell much faster and for a higher price."  </P> <P> But Goley and Smock say they don't have enough money to make the repairs, and  say they could sell their homes quicker without spending the money doing so.  </P> <P> Smock said her mobile home's roof leaks, there are termites, its furnace is  cracked and the paint is peeling.  </P> <P> "In the contract (with Mel Mack Co.), you have to keep the place up," she said.  "I can't afford to fix things around here."  </P> <P> Smock called Westminster city officials and asked about the Deferred Loan  Program. She said that under that program, city crews will make the necessary  repairs on her home.  </P> <P> For low-income people who own their mobile homes, the city will make basic  repairs, said Don Dastal, Westminster public works director. The first $2,000  in repairs is funded through a grant and any costs after that are repaid  through a no-interest loan when the mobile home is sold, he said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, many residents who say they could barely afford to live in  their homes before say they now feel trapped: They can neither afford the rent  nor come up with the money to move.  </P> <P> "I just live day to day. There's not much I can do," Smock said. "I feel  helpless."  </P> <P> Goley said, "Up until now, the last six months, we've never had any problems. I  never asked (Mel Mack) for anything. I always pay my rent promptly."  </P></p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: AGF Assurances Generales de France played a shrewd hand to win its 25 per cent blocking minority in German insurer AMB without paying a premium for control. But yesterday's 24 per cent fall in interim net profits bears the scar of a less successful venture, its 48 per cent stake in Italy's MAA. As with the FFr190m first-half provision for poor property loans made by Banque du Phenix, the question is whether the FFr87m provided for pulling out of Italy will be enough. Given that the capital gains which sustained French insurance company profits in the 1980s do not appear to have markedly slowed, investors are likely to be most worried about when the domestic market will turn. Yesterday's results from AGF suggest the company has been more picky about new risks than some of its competitors, and that underwriting losses are moving in the right direction. The process of recovery, though, promises to be slow.</p>

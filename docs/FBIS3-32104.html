The Sandinist transportation workers agreed  tonight to end the national transportation strike "to contribute  to the nation's stability." Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo  said the workers' agreement came in exchange for the  government's willingness to negotiate in the coming days the  demands that prompted the strike.    The minister agreed to hold multilateral and bilateral  meetings with the sector's businessmen to discuss the strikers'  demands, which include freezing fuel prices and restructuring  the transportation sector.    Lacayo, President Violeta Chamorro's son-in-law, and leaders  of the National Transportation Commission (CNT-Sandinist),  announced the end of the strike tonight during a news conference  at the Presidency.</p>

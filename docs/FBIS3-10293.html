He is accompanied  by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and a group of high-ranking  officials from his cabinet. Itamar Franco is the first head of  state to be received by Rafael Caldera as Venezuelan president  after taking office one month ago. Sources close to the  Brazilian Government said the objective of a working meeting on  Friday is to develop the economic foundations for the creation  of a trade agreement to be known as Merconorte. Despite the  importance of the meeting, the presidents do not plan to sign  any agreements since the two countries already have more than 36  agreements ranging from cultural exchanges to technical and  trade cooperation.</p>

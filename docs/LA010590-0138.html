			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIANNE KLEIN: YOU CAN STICK IT TO THEM IN STYLE WITH 'NUN-CHUCKS'  </P> <P> I saw the movie "Colors," so I know that cops are pretty macho guys.  </P> <P> When Robert Duvall was showing the gang punks that he was just as macho as they  were, he would whip out his side-handle baton, otherwise known as a billy club,  and start rapping it, slowly, in the palm of his hand.  </P> <P> David Dye, a senior police officer in Costa Mesa, tells me that Duvall had it  right. When Dye tells me about the macho cops he knows, he makes a fist and  slugs it into the palm of his other hand.  </P> <P> This apparently is a variation on the Duvall-executed macho sign, but it is one  I understand equally as well. Macho types, even if they are women, feel  especially macho when they are brandishing something with the potential to  inflict pain.  </P> <P> But Dye says that the baton has its drawbacks. It's bulky, heavy and not all  that versatile. Plus even civilian machos can pick it up and hit someone. Maybe  even the arresting officer.  </P> <P> So Dye is spreading the word about nunchakus, which you may remember from the  macho cult films of martial-arts master Bruce Lee.  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa Police Department has been using them for more than two years  now. Laguna Beach and Seal Beach have them and so do those lone rangers of the  Orange County Transit District police in the event that a disgruntled bus  passenger gets especially unruly.  </P> <P> Nunchakus, in fact, seem to be catching on like wildfire. San Diego just made  them standard issue and Dye, a freckle-face redhead who looks about as much  like Bruce Lee as I do, is in demand these days as a media spokesman and expert  on the things.  </P> <P> Affectionately dubbed "nun-chucks" by the guys who tote them, the nunchakus are  two 12-inch, polycarbon plastic sticks connected by a double nylon cord. The  whole thing weighs 12 ounces.  </P> <P> A plainclothes detective can carry it inside a suit jacket just as easily as an  aerospace engineer might stash a slide rule or a six-pack of pocket pens.  </P> <P> True, these nun-chucks don't look like much, but when you stare at them for a  while, your mind tends to conjure up all sorts of potentially painful uses.  </P> <P> And if it's macho you're talking, mirror, mirror on the wall, the nunchakus are  the most macho of them all.  </P> <P> Just take in some Bruce Lee films -- "Enter the Dragon" is a good place to  start -- and you can see their potential for sweatless destruction. When the  master swings his nunchakus at his foes, his arms take on the lethal force of a  chain saw.  </P> <P> And to hear Dye tell it, these two sticks have psychic powers as well, having  given the cops of Costa Mesa the inner peace of Zen masters.  </P> <P> "The officers feel confident," Dye says. "When people see the nunchakus, they  have a respect for them. Bruce Lee is the first thing they think of."  </P> <P> Dye, who incidentally, is a black belt of varying degrees in aikido,  aikijujutsu, judo and karate, does a few demonstrations for me.  </P> <P> He twists my wrist, vise-like, between the sticks and calls it the chopstick  maneuver. He poses, Bruce Lee style, with his nun-chucks in the defensive  postion. Then he whips them around in something like a high-speed  loop-the-loop.  </P> <P> I am impressed. I want some. I am imagining all sorts of practical household  uses.  </P> <P> When my daughter refuses to relinquish the tube of toothpaste that she is  smearing all over the rug, I can whip out the nunchakus and quickly dislodge  her hand from around the offending tube.  </P> <P> Like the officers in more than 30 police departments in seven states, thanks to  the nunchakus, I will have accomplished my mission quickly without resulting  harm to the suspect or to myself.  </P> <P> When my husband is standing there with his arms crossed in front of his chest  telling me, "No, I don't want to go to the mall with you. The Hawks are playing  the Celtics," I can wedge the nunchakus between his arms and twist it behind  his back. I think about making him say "uncle," but maybe I'll make him say  something like, "whatever you want."  </P> <P> But Dye quickly squashes my fantasy. He says that unless I am a police officer  or am enrolled in some martial-arts class, it would be a felony for me to be  caught with the nunchakus.  </P> <P> I can buy them, he says, at a martial-arts supply store. I just can't possess  them.  </P> <P> I should have figured as much. Possess the nunchakus and one possesses the  epitome of macho.  </P> <P> How's that for Zen?  </P> <P>  Dianne Klein's column appears Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Not guilty verdict brings down curtain on City epic: Acquittal of Thomas Ward in final Guinness trial deals blow to Serious Fraud Office strategy - Prosecution criticised as 'misplaced' COURTROOM eight at the Old Bailey was virtually empty at 4.50 yesterday afternoon as the curtain finally came down on the Guinness affair. Seven years before, a blaze of publicity greeted the drinks group's purchase of Distillers for Pounds 2.6m - the largest ever UK takeover. The first criminal trial that followed was dubbed the 'City trial of the century'. Yesterday Mr Thomas Ward, the last man involved in the saga to stand trial, was barely noticed as he picked his way around a cleaner mopping the courtroom steps before walking out on to the streets to face a handful of photographers. The not guilty verdict ended the City's longest brush with the criminal justice system, a six-year epic which started in high drama but was to tail off into disarray. The jailing in 1990 of two prominent business figures - Mr Ernest Saunders and Mr Gerald Ronson - shook the financial world to its foundation. A third man, stockbroker Mr Anthony Parnes, was also jailed, while the businessman Sir Jack Lyons was fined Pounds 3m. For the fledgling Serious Fraud Office it seemed to vindicate the most ambitious attempt ever made to prosecute malpractice in the financial markets. For the first time a jury was asked to understand and pass judgment on a highly complex case which even financial experts would have had trouble following. But from that high point the prosecutions arising from the Distillers takeover quickly tumbled into farce, culminating in the final reversal for the SFO yesterday. Like a movie producer failing to live up to a glittering triumph, the Guinness prosecutors attempted a string of sequels which never matched the success of the original. Guinness Two saw Mr Roger Seelig, one of the stars of the takeover boom of the 1980s, fight himself into a state of mental and physical exhaustion while conducting his own defence. The trial was called off and his co-defendant, Lord Spens, later acquitted. Guinness Three never saw the light of day as charges against Mr David Mayhew, another prominent takeover adviser, were dropped. But that did not stop Guinness Four, the ultimately unsuccessful prosecution of Ward. The case has hung over the SFO since its creation in 1987, and has helped shape the way important fraud trials are prosecuted. Early on the SFO appeared to adopt a scatter-gun approach, firing a range of charges at defendants in the hope that at least some of them would stick. The four defendants in the first trial faced 24 charges between them, whittled down from a longer list. By the end of the Guinness saga the scatter-gun had become a single rifle-shot. Mr Ward faced one charge of theft, in part a reflection of the desire of prosecutors and judges to reduce the length of fraud trials and to present juries with a simpler case. Yesterday's verdict shows that this strategy carries no guarantee of success. Coming at the same time as the long-running Blue Arrow trial, the Guinness case has also had a profound effect on attitudes to the conduct of fraud trials. The judge in the first two trials, Mr Justice Henry, was moved to go public with a series of radical suggestions for reform. Many of these have now been officially sanctioned in a consultative paper produced by the Lord Chancellor's Department. The judge's suggestions included introducing time limits to trials and earlier disclosure of defendants' cases. The judge in the Ward trial will make his feelings known today. For the City, the Guinness affair is a trauma safely left to historians. One City lawyer said: 'To most people, the Guinness saga ended when Ernest Saunders went to jail. It remains a warning against gung-ho behaviour, but people have long since moved on.' Nevertheless, the saga has left its imprint on the way business is conducted in the financial markets. The Guinness case brought home for the first time the fact that leading financial advisers employed by the City's most respected houses could be hauled into the dock. Whatever the final outcome in terms of convictions, this has helped to change attitudes about the conduct of takeovers. With the takeover market in a prolonged lull, however, it is impossible to tell how immediately effective the lesson. Guinness itself has long since put the affair behind it. It was forced by the Takeover Panel to pay Pounds 85m to former Distillers shareholders who were judged to have been misled, and agreed a Pounds 92m settlement with Argyll, the rival group that it pipped to the post in the Distillers takeover. Since then sweeping management changes have restored the group's reputation and the company has built on the Distillers takeover to transform itself from a medium-ranked brewer and ragtail retailer into the most profitable drinks group in the world. With the benefits of the Distillers restructuring, pre-tax profits between 1987 and 1991 soared from Pounds 408m to Pounds 956m, while earnings per share grew from 14.7p to 33.6p and dividends rose from 4.6p to 10.8p. When Sir Anthony Tennant, brought in to replace Mr Saunders as chief executive, finally retired last year, he left behind an entirely different company from the demoralised and scandal-torn one he had inherited.</p>

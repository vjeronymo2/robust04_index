			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- The Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) will submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet of  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata after passage of the fiscal 1994  budget through the Diet, a senior party official said Tuesday.    "Mr. Hata's role will be over once he passes the budget  through the Diet," Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the main  opposition party, told a news conference. Mori blamed the  cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for the long  delay in the Diet budget debate, saying it put off the  formulation of the budget from the usual year-end till this year  to give top priority to political reform. "At the time, Mr. Hata  was deputy prime minister," he said, indicating Hata should also  be blamed for the delay in passage of the state budget, which is  six weeks overdue.    Mori also said the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP)  [SDPJ], a member of Hosokawa's ruling coalition that collapsed  in April, share a perception that Hata's minority government  does not reflect the will of the Japanese people.    The SDPJ also sees the Hata cabinet as one to only handle  the  budget, Mori added.    The SDPJ walked out of the coalition shortly after Hata was  elected premier in late April, in protest against the formation  by other coalition partners of a new parliamentary group  excluding the SDPJ. After the withdrawal of the SDPJ from the  coalition, the LDP and the SDPJ, archrivals for decades, have  moved to cooperate to put pressure on the Hata administration.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Italy's DC party becomes Popular Italy's Christian Democrats (DCs) yesterday transformed themselves into the Popular party, in an effort to distance the party from the discredit of years of corrupt rule under successive Christian Democrat governments. The bulk of the party followed Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the outgoing Christian Democrat leader, in forming the new political group. However, a small minority decided against the move and set up on their own, calling themselves the Centre Christian Democrats, in a split related more to personalities than to ideology. The break-up of the Christian Democratic party, which was founded in 1942, underlines the problems faced by politicians seeking to mould disparate forces of the centre into credible alliances to fight the general elections on March 27. Matters are likely to be complicated further if Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, decides to enter the fray. He is reported to be close to announcing his decision to stand as a parliamentary candidate either in Milan or Rome, backed by the series of political clubs he has founded up and down the country. The clubs are called Forza Italia - literally 'Go on Italy', the exhortation used by football crowds and based on his Milan team's supporters' club. The fact that he has held back from a decision for so long indicates that he is under pressure from both the business community and the political establishment to refrain from direct involvement. Yesterday, the Ciampi government bowed to a rising tide of protest about the election day coinciding with the Jewish Passover. As a concession the government is now expected to reintroduce, on an exceptional basis, voting over two days. One-day voting was part of last August's electoral reform.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC NEWS: THREE SUMMER FESTIVALS REVEAL ARTISTS, REPERTORY  </P> <P> Now that summer is actually upon us, our options are growing. This week, news  from three of our California boutique festivals: artists and repertory are now  complete.  </P> <P> In Santa Barbara, midsummer festivities given by the four-decade old Music  Academy of the West will attract music-lovers of different stripes to the  downtown Lobero Theatre.  </P> <P> A six-concert chamber music series will be offered Tuesday nights, July 4-Aug.  1, featuring the Academy's distinguished faculty -- among them violinists James  Buswell, Zvi Zeitlin and Stuart Canin; violist Donald McInnes; cellist Stephen  Kates, and pianists Jerome Lowenthal and Edward Auer -- and students.  </P> <P> Under Lawrence Leighton Smith, the Academy's music director and conductor, the  Festival Orchestra will give four concerts on Saturday nights, July 15-Aug. 19.  </P> <P> Two operatic productions will be offered this year: Haydn's "L'Infedelta  Delusa," will be sung July 21 and 22, and Smetana's "Bartered Bride" will be  given four times, Aug. 12-15. Both works will be sung in English.  </P> <P> Seven concerts in Smothers Theatre at Pepperdine University, Malibu, comprise  the sixth summer season of the Strawberry Creek Music Festival. Music director  and festival founder Yehuda Gilad will conduct five of these events, July  29-Aug. 12. Among the soloists will be violinists Eudice Shapiro and Mark  Peskanov, and cellist Peter Rejto. The season proper will be preceded by a  concert at the Arnold Schoenberg Institute at USC by the Strawberry Creek  Chamber Players, July 26.  </P> <P> In the High Sierra, Music From Bear Valley offers its 21st summer season, July  29-Aug. 13. Now under the artistic direction of Carter Nice of the Sacramento  Symphony, the festival promises 10 separate programs, beginning with an  appearance by pop singer Glenn Yarbrough, and ending with a symphonic program.  Among the soloists will be pianist Jeffrey Kahane, violinist Zina Schiff and  harpist Susanna Mildonian. On Aug. 10 and 12, Thomas Conlin will conduct two  performances of Puccini's "Tosca," with a cast including Starleigh Goltry,  Gregory Kunde and Peter Van Derick.  </P> <P> BELLS: The centuries-old art of carillon playing will be featured on the fourth  annual Music by the Tower series at UC Riverside this summer. The five Sunday  evening concerts, beginning July 2, will offer recitals at the base of the  university's 161-foot bell tower, followed by performances by visiting  ensembles.  </P> <P> One of only four cast-bronze bell carillons in California, UC Riverside's  48-bell system is operated mechanically by a carillonneur.  </P> <P> The bells, which weigh between 28 and 5,091 pounds apiece, are played from a  cabin just beneath the carillon. The carillonneur uses foot pedals as well as  his fist to strike the keys.  </P> <P> According to UCR carillonneur David Christensen, cast-bell carillon systems are  rarely installed because of their size, and their expensive and complex  operation.  </P> <P> "There isn't much opportunity to hear mechanical carillon playing in California  because there are so few," Christensen explained.  </P> <P> "The other cast-bell carillons, in Berkeley and Stanford, are so far away, and  I don't think UC Santa Barbara has a concert series, so our series is probably  the only place you can go to see performances in Southern California."  </P> <P> Since the first series in 1986, the UCR summer concerts have attracted large  audiences. Last year, an average of 1,500 people attended each performance. The  concerts, which are scheduled each Sunday in July at 5:45 p.m., will consist of  45-minute performances by four different carillonneurs.  </P> <P> BRIEFLY: New in the impresarial field is the New York-based Entertainment  Corporation. Its birth was announced last week by its parent organization, the  Entertainment Corp. Limited of London. Charles Dillingham, until recently  executive director of American Ballet Theatre, is the president and chief  executive officer of the new producer. . . . Donald Johanos, music director of  the Honolulu Symphony, will open the new Hong Kong Cultural Center, in  performances with the Hong Kong Philharmonic, next week. . . . The Andrew W.  Mellon Foundation has announced a new $600,000 program in support of  period-instrument orchestras in the United States. The foundation says the aim  of the program is to "enhance the institutional development of the orchestras,  particularly their capacity to increase earned and contributed income in their  communities." Fourteen ongoing orchestras in nine states and the District of  Columbia have been awarded two-year matching grants to help them "strengthen  their administration and provide new performance opportunities." Among the  groups are the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra, Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra of  San Francisco, and Banchetto Musicale of Boston.  </P> <P> Calendar intern Nicole Atkinson contributed to the research for this column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jaime Murillo] </F>   [Excerpts] During a closed-doors session, the Senate  yesterday approved the promotion of two police chiefs to the  rank of general. MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] and  Condepa [Conscience of the Fatherland] senators walked out of  the session that dragged on until nearly midnight because they  challenged the promotion of two officers. Those promoted to the  rank of general are Colonel Luis Rocha Martinez -- who is  mentioned as the most likely candidate for the post of police  commander -- and Colonel Rogelio Vargas -- whose candidacy was  questioned by MIR and Condepa due to his involvement in the  thwarted burning of precursors in the Huanchaca case. The  Senate did not approve the promotion of Colonel Willy Arriaza --  whose candidacy was also questioned by the parties that walked  out of the session. [passage omitted]    Condepa Senator Andres Solis Rada said:    [Begin recording] I want to report that Condepa and MIR  senators walked out of the Senate session because senators of  the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] and UCS [Solidarity  Civic Union] ruling coalition joined forces with ADN  [Nationalist Democratic Action] to promote Col. Arriaza, who  worked as Arce Gomez's [interior minister under General Luis  Garcia Meza] aide at the time of the terrible Harrington Street  massacre which claimed the lifes of eight young MIR members.  [passage omitted].    They even wanted to overrule the Bolivian Police command who  believe only two officers should be promoted. Our decision to  leave the session was instrumental in making the Senate stop and  think about this. In the end only two officers were promoted.  [passage omitted] [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

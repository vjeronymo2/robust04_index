			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 20 February edition of the Belgrade  daily POLITIKA, on page 9, attacks an article that appeared in  the Podgorica, Montenegro, daily POBJEDA "the day before  yesterday" calling for the secession of Montenegro from the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. POLITIKA states that the POBJEDA  article's author, Dragan Hajdukovic, a resident of Switzerland,  is remembered for his pamphlets, published in Switzerland,  calling for "the bombing of Belgrade" and requesting the  "imposition of sanctions against his own country." Now he "makes  an appearance in the domestic press," and, "at a time of paper  shortages," publishes on "two entire pages" of POBJEDA a  political program for the "renewal of the Montenegrin state,"  instructing the Montenegrin people "to secede from Yugoslavia."  Hajdukovic disregards the fact that the large majority of the  inhabitants of Montenegro declared themselves in favor of a  joint state, POLITIKA remarks, adding that the editorial staff  of POBJEDA has already disassociated itself from the article,  calling it a "glaring error."</p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VIRGIL HILL, VICTOR IN BOUT WITH HYPERGLYCEMIA, TO DEFEND TITLE  </P> <P> Undefeated Virgil Hill, recovered from a bout with hyperglycemia, will make the  seventh defense of his World Boxing Assn. light heavyweight title Tuesday  night.  </P> <P> Hill (25-0) will meet James Kinchen (44-6-2) in a scheduled 12-round bout at  the Bismarck Civic Center.  </P> <P> The fight was to have been held in August but was postponed when the champion  was determined to have hyperglycemia -- abnormally high amounts of sugar in the  blood -- that Hill blamed on a poor diet and stress.  </P> <P> Proper diet has brought the problem under control, Hill said, and he is back in  top form.  </P> <P> Hill, who won the title from Leslie Stewart in September, 1987, said the  five-month layoff since May 27 when he stopped Joe Lasisi in the seventh round  should help him.  </P> <P> "The layoff was better for me because I've been so consistent in my fighting,"  he said.  </P> <P> Kinchen, 31, is best known for a controversial loss to Thomas Hearns on Nov. 4,  1988. It is his first shot at a major world title in a nine-year career in  which he has fought as a middleweight, super-middleweight and light  heavyweight.  </P> <P> "This fight is as important to me as all the others," Kinchen, who will be at a  seven-inch reach disadvantage, said. "Virgil is quick, but so am I. So we're  just going to have to do some things to slow Virgil down a little."  </P></p>

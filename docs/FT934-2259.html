			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Cuba and Caricom in bid to increase trade Cuba and the Caribbean Community have signed a controversial agreement establishing a joint commission to increase trade and technical co-operation between the island and its neighbours. The commission, which has been attacked by the US State Department and by several US legislators, will oversee co-operation in several areas, including trade and the development of the region's sugar cane industry. The agreement, which was signed on Monday, is aimed at increasing the volume of trade between Cuba and Caricom, improvement in sugar cane yields, co-operation in developing livestock and fisheries, and will combine research in biotechnology, particularly for agricultural and technical applications. The commission represents several years of work by the Cuban government to raise the level of contact with its neighbours, many of which have been slow to entertain the Cubans because of concern over a negative reaction from Washington. Mr Ricardo Cabrisas, Cuba's external trade minister, said on Monday that the establishment of the joint commission will allow Caribbean companies to make use of new economic opportunities in Cuba. 'Our economic and commercial space resulting from the opening of our economy is being occupied by capital and markets of diverse origin, and we would not like the Caribbean to arrive too late,' he said. 'We invite the Caribbean not to waste this opportunity to link ourselves more closely and create better conditions with a view towards a future economic integration of the Caribbean.' The region's private sector was told by Mr Edwin Carrington, secretary-general of Caricom, to pursue investment opportunities in Cuba, and in other countries with which Caricom has similar agreements. Jamaican hotel companies have invested heavily in Cuban tourism.</p>

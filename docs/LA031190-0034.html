			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GREAT AMERICAN'S TROUBLES CAST A SHADOW OVER S.D.  </P> <P> For many San Diegans, the recent headlines on the financial problems of Great  American Bank had an unpleasantly familiar ring.  </P> <P> In a city that has long suffered from a civic inferiority complex, a feeling of  being a poor second cousin to the world-class clout of Los Angeles and the  allure of San Francisco, the news that San Diego-based Great American -- the  nation's eighth-largest thrift -- was seeking outside help in raising capital  to meet federal standards seemed like a new chapter in an old story.  </P> <P> Indeed, in recent years, San Diego has seen some of its most prominent local  businesses -- among them, Pacific Southwest Airlines, Oak Industries, the  Wickes Corp. and Signal Companies -- either leave town or be swallowed up by  larger corporations amid the merger craze of the '80s. With San Diego's  political and business leaders already battling vociferously to prevent San  Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. from being added to that list, the possibility  that Great American might be acquired by outside investors produced hard  swallows from City Hall to corporate board rooms.  </P> <P> Though Great American's future remains uncertain, its recent actions have been  tantamount to posting a "for sale" sign on the San Diego institution. That  possibility, only one of several that could become reality by mid-spring, has  generated glum speculation about the possible loss of a century-old major  corporate citizen ingrained in virtually every facet of San Diego life.  </P> <P> Inevitably, similar questions are posed about the man atop the Great American  empire: Gordon Luce, a 64-year-old native San Diegan who over the past 20 years  built the bank from a four-branch local operation to a 214-office giant with  assets of $16.1 billion.  </P> <P> Few have so legitimate a claim today to the title of "Mr. San Diego" as Luce,  whose name has long been identified with the highest echelons of the city's  political, business and social circles. A tall, slender, gray-haired man with a  self-effacing modesty and a ready smile, Luce has been a confidant of one  President and a friend to another; a prolific fund-raiser for myriad causes  ranging from politics and the arts to health care and education; a man who, as  San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor puts it, "has been there every time -- every  time -- his community needed him."  </P> <P> While Luce says that "it is a little premature" to write an unhappy ending to  the Great American story, the thrift's problems undeniably threaten to severely  undercut the personal power and prestige that he developed over the past two  decades as the bank's chief executive officer. By parlaying his shrewd  instincts, political connections and his own bank's meteoric rise, Luce has  helped set policy throughout the entire savings and loan industry, and today is  widely recognized as one of its powerhouses.  </P> <P> "If you were to name the five most influential people in the industry, Luce  would be one," said Barry M. Rubens, chief executive at California Research  Corp., a Santa Monica-based savings and loan and bank consulting firm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Financial Woes  </P> <P> Great American's current financial quagmire is a direct result of its 1986  acquisition of Home Federal Savings of Tucson, a purchase that brought on a  harvest of woe in the form of bad loans stemming from economic problems and  severe overbuilding of Arizona real estate. Forced to write down the loans'  value to reflect the precipitous drop in real estate prices, Great American  last year suffered a $123.9-million loss.  </P> <P> The losses have reduced Great American's capital level to the point that, as of  Dec. 31, Great American's capital was deficient in all three of the tough new  capital adequacy tests applied by regulators in the aftermath of last summer's  $160-billion rescue bill for the nation's troubled savings and loan industry.  Then last week, Great American's auditor, Deloitte &amp; Touche, decided it  wanted to extend its audit of the S&amp;L's 1989 loan-loss provision, a review  that will probably result in deeper losses. Federal regulators in the Office of  Thrift Supervision are also reviewing Great American's loans.  </P> <P> With Arizona's real estate and loan values continuing to drop, industry  analysts openly question Great American's ability to survive. In announcing  that it hired an outside investment banking firm to help it raise capital,  Great American all but admitted that its ownership may soon change. Some  observers predict a forced merger with another savings and loan or with a bank  such as Wells Fargo.  </P> <P> Within banking and business circles, some suggest that Great American's woes  were unavoidable, that the sinkhole that the Arizona financial scene has become  could not have been foreseen. Others argue that Luce's outside political  activities may have caused him to, as one termed it, take his "hands off the  ball" at a critical juncture. And still others pointed to what they say is  Luce's hands-off management style and tendency to delegate authority.  </P> <P> Luce vehemently denies both assertions, saying he has devoted virtually all of  his time to the S&amp;L over the last five years. Major decisions at Great  American are made, he said, only after input from executive committees.  </P> <P> As Great American searches for a solution to its financial morass, various  what-if scenarios -- most of them unpleasant to contemplate -- have been  discussed among the city's political and civic leaders. In particular, one  question that is drawing increasingly nervous speculation is what impact would  be felt by San Diego if Great American were ultimately acquired by outside  interests.  </P> <P> The possibility of a takeover has spawned hand-wringing among some city leaders  who fret that it could reinforce the city's branch-town image. In the past  year, of the county's 15 largest publicly held businesses, eight have either  left town, been taken over or face the threat of acquisition.  </P> <P> Concern on that score, however, is a minority viewpoint, as Great American's  uncertain future has not aroused the same kind of passions spawned by the  proposed merger of SDG&amp;E with Southern California Edison.  </P> <P> "The city's identity or pride isn't wrapped up as much with a bank -- even one  as big or important as Great American -- as it is with a utility that has the  city's name in its title," O'Connor said. "That doesn't mean there's not  concern. It's just on a different level."  </P> <P> For most San Diegans, concern over Great American's corporate fate probably  begins and ends with questions over whether the bank's woes endanger its  depositors' accounts, which it clearly does not, thanks to federal deposit  insurance. "If Great American got bought and its name changed, I don't think it  would mean a damn thing to the average person," former Mayor Roger Hedgecock  said.  </P> <P> But if a change in Great American's corporate structure would not rank as a  civic trauma, a takeover could create a significant void with far-reaching  ramifications.  </P> <P> Throughout its history, Great American has been one of San Diego's most  generous corporate citizens that annually contributes slightly less than $1  million to a wide range of social and civic programs. The bank's list of local  beneficiaries -- complemented by, in many cases, Luce's personal contributions  -- includes the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, the Urban League, the  Greater San Diego Sports Assn. and numerous local cultural organizations, as  typified by last year's $50,000 donation to the Soviet Arts Festival. In the  late 1980s, Great American sponsored a much heralded education program aimed at  increasing attendance among junior high students -- "Miss School, Miss Out" --  that was honored at a White House ceremony as one of the nation's best  private-sector projects.  </P> <P> Steven Brezzo, director of the San Diego Museum of Art, emphasized that, given  San Diego's scarcity of corporate headquarters, Great American "would be very  hard to match or replace" in terms of its continuing commitment to the arts.  </P> <P> It is a measure of the depths of Great American's problems that some openly  question, not only whether the thrift will be in a position to continue its  charitable-giving, but also whether Luce himself will continue to head the  institution.  </P> <P> "It's almost as American as apple pie, baseball and motherhood that you change  managers, the guy at the top, when the team doesn't have a winning record,"  said Peter Davis, president of the Bank of Commerce of San Diego.  </P> <P> If such a change was made, it would be one of the few blemishes on Luce's  family history since his ancestors arrived in San Diego County more than a  century ago. Luce's grandfather, Moses Luce, was a pioneer lawyer, and his  father, Edgar, was a state senator, Superior Court judge and co-founder of one  of San Diego's oldest and most prestigious law firms, Luce Forward Hamilton  &amp; Scripps.  </P> <P> Luce was introduced to banking at San Diego's Home Federal Savings.  </P> <P> During his 10-year tenure at Home Fed, Luce rose to become senior vice  president of marketing. Luce soon became Home Fed's major political operative,  arranging campaign contributions and working for local Republican candidates.  Using his growing personal prestige and that of Home Fed, Luce developed a  reputation as one of the city's most important and irresistible fund-raisers.  </P> <P> "He has been chairman of half of the major fund-raising activities in town. He  had a lot of chits because he has done a lot of things for people, businesswise  and socially," said Norman Roberts, a longtime friend and fellow Republican  activist. "If you get a call from Gordon and he asks you for money, it's  difficult to say no because you know someday you're going to be calling him."  </P> <P> That fund-raising ability figured significantly in Luce getting the title of  San Diego County treasurer of Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. And  it was during one fund-raiser for Goldwater in La Jolla that Luce was to meet  the man with whom he was to become so closely identified: Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> After the Goldwater debacle, Luce was one of a handful of key Southern  California businessmen who took an interest in Reagan's political career and  who encouraged him to run for California governor. Luce followed Reagan to  Sacramento in 1966, becoming Secretary for Business and Transportation, quickly  establishing himself, along with Casper Weinberger, as one of Reagan's most  trusted lieutenants.  </P> <P> "I attended every Cabinet meeting in my six years in Sacramento and had the  opportunity to watch all the players, and it was clear to everybody that Luce  and Casper Weinberger" had Reagan's ear most often, said Edwin Gray, then a  Reagan press secretary who would later become a Great American executive and  still later Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman.  </P> <P> But after three years in Sacramento, Luce yearned to return to San Diego and to  business. Eleven years later, when Reagan became President, that preference for  the private sector caused Luce to gently deflect inquiries about his interest  in either a Cabinet-level post or ambassadorship.  </P> <P> "They called me the Reluctant One," Luce recalled, chuckling. "I would always  say, 'Maybe next year.' Then when next year came, I'd say, 'No, I'm still too  busy.' "  </P> <P> After leaving Sacramento in 1969, Luce became chief executive of San Diego  Federal, which in the 1980s would be renamed Great American Bank.  </P> <P> Luce wasted little time putting his imprint on San Diego Federal, embarking on  statewide expansion to capitalize on California's rapid population growth. The  success of the plan, Luce realized, would depend largely on creating a  standardized image for the S&amp;L's branches, akin to that of McDonald's and  Holiday Inns. In keeping with that strategy, Great American adopted a  coordinated style for all of the branch architecture, uniforms and employee  training, Luce said.  </P> <P> Luce also put Great American at the vanguard of the automated teller machine  revolution, claiming to be the first California financial institution to  install a statewide ATM network.  </P> <P> Great American also earned high marks for being the first San Diego County  S&amp;L to establish branches in Southeast San Diego and San Ysidro, two  low-income areas of San Diego that at the time suffered from redlining, the  practice of refusing loans in geographically prescribed areas.  </P> <P> But Luce's rapid growth strategy -- the S&amp;L's assets grew from $4.4 billion  in 1982 to $16.1 billion as of Dec. 31 -- ultimately landed Great American in  trouble. Much of that growth was accomplished by acquiring 16 outside thrifts,  and one of the acquisitions, Home Federal of Tucson, has turned out to be a  financial black hole that could cost Great American its independence.  </P> <P> Great American is by no means alone in its Arizona misery. There are only three  S&amp;Ls left in Arizona that have not been taken over by regulators, said  William Ferguson, a S&amp;L consultant based in Irving, Tex. Other large  financial institutions, including First Interstate Bank, have stumbled there as  well. U.S. Postmaster Gen. Anthony M. Frank, who from 1971 to 1988 was chief  executive of First Nationwide Savings in San Francisco, and who preceded Luce  as president of the state S&amp;L league, said even banks and thrifts using the  most conservative lending practices have stumbled badly in Arizona.  </P> <P> Despite his appraisal of Luce being "likable, a professional manager and  certainly the most astute politically on the Republican side that the industry  has," Frank said Luce ultimately has to accept responsibility for the Arizona  problems.  </P> <P> "I would say Luce took his hands off the ball," Frank said. "The S&amp;L  business is, all things being said, a detail business. When you start to be too  much of an elder statesman, then you start turning details over to other people  and it justs seems that that doesn't work out very well."  </P></p>

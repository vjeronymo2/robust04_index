			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Veselin Simonovic, Miroslav Mikuljanac, and </F> Vukan Simonovic: "Everyone Together or No One at All!"]    [Text] Ten days after the elections it is certain that the  Serbian citizens have failed to live up to the expectations of  the Serbian president who had hoped that his party would win an  absolute majority and would form a government without any  problems. The Socialists hope that, although relative victors,  Slobodan Milosevic will give them the mandate. This will  probably happen, since none of the opposition parties have  expressed the desire to form a party [stranacka] government or  even a coalition government.    All parliamentary parties have also announced that they  would  not support a Socialists' minority government. Zoran Djindjic,  chairman of the Executive Council of the Democratic Party [DS],  is the only one currently proposing a solution that could  perhaps save the day. His proposal to form a government of  national salvation (in which neither the mandator nor the  majority of the ministers would be from the Socialist Party of  Serbia [SPS]), has been decisively rejected only by the SPS and  the Radicals. If the Socialists continue to insist on ruling  alone, all the opposition leaders foresee new elections as early  as spring.    According to constitutional procedure, the new parliament  should meet 20 days after the final electoral results are  announced. In the meantime, the president of the republic  should appoint a mandator for forming the government, after  which the deputies would have two months to discuss the forming  of the new government. If they are unable to do this within the  allotted time limit, the assembly is automatically dissolved and  new elections are held.  <H5>  "The Montenegrin Recipe" </H5>   The Socialists announced their electoral victory as early as  the electoral night of 19 December, after which they announced  that they would form the new government alone. The euphoria,  however, did not last long, and, just a few days after Ivica  Dacic's statement that the SPS would not form a coalition with  anyone, they sobered up and announced the "Montenegrin recipe."  Yesterday Dacic said that the Socialists might offer a  ministerial department or two to everyone except the Radicals.    Since all the parties have stated that they do not wish to  be  part of a Socialist government, the SPS might employ another  maneuver, and, under the pretext of an expert government, win  over certain opposition parties. According to Dacic, however,  this is in Slobodan Milosevic's domain and not the SPS's.    For the time being, the SPS is still considering a mandator  from its own ranks. The names that have come up are those of  Dragan Tomic, manager of Simpo, Oskar Kovac, Zeljko Simic, and  even Radoman Bozovic. In case this is not accepted, the SPS  might consider a new Panic, or Zoran Djindjic, as the "least of  opposition evils."    The Socialists have lately been toying with the possibility  of securing the necessary three votes with the deputies from  ethnic minority parties. The coalition of the two Albanian  parties from southern Serbia has decisively denied the  possibility of supporting the SPS. Moreover, the Socialists  will not get the three votes from the Democratic Community of  Vojvodina Hungarians [DZVM]. Caba Sepsej, DZVM vice president,  said for BORBA: "I personally think, and I believe that this  opinion will be accepted by my colleagues from the party, that  we are not the ones who should make decisions about the  government in Serbia. This is an issue that should be solved by  the parties of the majority people. We are, of course, always  in favor of democratic options, the end of the war and  integration into European trends, yet it seems we have no  influence over any of this. The majority people's parties are  unanimous in this, just as they are in relation to minorities."  <H5>  Djindjic Is Ready </H5>   Some opposition parties see Zoran Djindjic as being the  "savior" of the Socialist majority. In a statement to BORBA,  Djindjic decisively rejects the possibility of DS deputies  supporting a minority government of the Socialists or any other  coalition government in which the Socialists would have the  majority.    In order to have a capable and efficient government, which  we  have not had so far, it has to be trusted by the majority of the  parties in the parliament. Parties that wish to form a party  government do not respect the will of the people and show that  their only goal is power.    The greatest responsibility lies with the largest party,  adds  Djindjic. First of all we need to establish the concept of the  new government and find the smallest common denominator, which  at the moment is solving the basic problems of the people. If  this were the new government's program, every party would  support it. In order to form a government of national salvation  everyone should take a step back from party interests in favor  of national interests. I am ready to support such a government  even if not a single one of our members is in it, claims  Djindjic. He also stresses that he is ready to take on the  responsibility and role of mandator of such a government. In  response to accusations of SPS leaders that he is courting the  Socialists, Djindjic says that this is illogical and strange,  even for Seselj, who is known for his "strange logic." "If I am  proposing a solution that will end the SPS's monopoly on power,  I fail to see how this could be interpreted as courting the  Socialists. The SPS must be ready to make the greatest  sacrifices," says Djindjic.  <H5>  Discontinuity of Power? </H5>   The new DS leader hopes that he will win the support of the  Democratic Movement of Serbia [Depos] and the Democratic Party  of Serbia's [DSS] support for such a government: "with the  exception of cadre issues, they cannot have a different approach  from us. A discontinuity of power must occur. A moderate  variant of such discontinuity is possible only with a government  of national salvation."    However, the other political power in Serbia -- Depos --  does  not expect the president of the state to give them the mandate,  and it seems that they also do not believe in the possibility of  a coalition government of everyone with the exception of the  SPS. Commenting on the proposals currently in circulation,  Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] spokesman Ivan Kovacevic said  that he did not believe that anyone would vote for an SPS  minority government, but he does not reject the possibility of  discussing a government of the type proposed by the DS.    Two years ago we proposed a government of national  salvation.  Such a government should primarily create conditions for the  first democratic elections. Such a government cannot be formed  by the SPS and they cannot have the majority in it.    The DSS is convinced that the government will be formed by  the SPS. That is a certainty, says Milorad Jovanovic, DSS  spokesman, just as it is certain that the opposition will be  against this government. Deputies of minority parties and  perhaps some other parties could secure the majority for the  SPS. The DS has, for example, showed the most affinity for such  a possibility, whereas the DSS is the last one on the list of  those who could agree to something of the kind. The SPS is in  dire need of support, but judging by everything it does not have  the possibility of forming a stable government, says Jovanovic.  <H5>  Is a Parliamentary Crisis in View </H5>   The Serbian Radical Party [SRS] is convinced that the  electoral results will lead to new elections. Vojislav Seselj,  president of the SRS, says that there will be no support for an  SPS minority government, but he also does not believe in the  possibility of an opposition government or a government of  national salvation. In response to what the Radicals role in  this situation is, Seselj said that "we will continue along our  path; we will neither support the SPS, nor will we oppose them  in coalition with the DZVM."    Rumors that Milosevic will soon summon for consultations all  party leaders with the exception of Vojislav Seselj testify to  the fact that the Socialists will try to win over other parties  for their "expert government." Milorad Jovanovic (DSS),  however, believes that the SPS is not ready to look for a  coalition partner and that is why he foresees "new elections,  new hassles, and finally, the SPS deputies' loss of even the  relative majority in the assembly. The current 123 will boil  down to a realistic 80 to 90 mandates," says Jovanovic.    Ivan Kovacevic (Depos) also does not foresee a stable  parliamentary future. "What will follow is a brief  parliamentary crisis and new elections in the spring." Djindjic  says that the only salvation for the Socialists' government  would be for the parliament never to hold a session and to be  dissolved immediately. In that case, the elections would take  place as early as May. The Socialists probably expect that the  sanctions will be lifted in the meantime, which could be an  electoral point for them. Not all citizens will live to see  that, and those that do survive will not be aware that elections  are taking place, says Djindjic.</p>

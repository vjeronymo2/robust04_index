			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Petrochemical in the red in first half MITSUBISHI Petrochemical, the Japanese plastics and chemical producer, reported a Y5.4bn (Dollars 50m) pre-tax loss for the first half to September, as leading customers demanded price reductions during a difficult trading period. In the same period last year, Mitsubishi Petrochemical had a pre-tax profit of Y6bn, but it slipped into the red as sales in the first half this year were down 9.6 per cent to Y169.7bn, partly because industrial customers were hurt by the yen's appreciation and the advantage of cheaper imported raw materials was lost. Profits were eroded by maintenance work at a petrochemical complex. .For the full year to March, it is forecasting a pre-tax loss of Y5.5bn, against a profit of Y8.3bn last year, on sales of Y350bn, down from Y372bn. It said an interim dividend would not be paid. Asahi Chemical Industry, the chemicals, plastics and synthetic fibre producer, said its pre-tax profits fell by 50 per cent to Y8.77bn during the half year to September and sales by 6.3 per cent to Y456.4bn. It expects profit for the full year of Y22bn, down from Y35.2bn last year and from its previous forecast of Y30bn. Teijin, Japan's leading maker of polyester, suffered a 33.2 per cent fall to Y6.06bn in pre-tax profit for the first half. Textile sales fell 13.7 per cent and chemical sales 9.5 per cent. Total sales slipped 8.8 per cent to Y154.8bn, and sales for the year are forecast at Y320bn, a fall from Y332bn last year. Pre-tax profit for the year is expected to be Y11.5bn, compared with Y17.5bn last year.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (10): Triumph tinged with irony - Rising prices for the paint ingredient, titanium dioxide / This year is on course to be one of triumph for manufacturers of titanium dioxide a vital ingredient in paint, plastic and paper manufacture - is pushing the average price around the world towards Dollars 2,000 a tonne. But the triumph is tinged with irony: so deep were the price cuts during the early 1990s, that even at Dollars 2,000, the price is barely what it was four or five years ago. For the first time since the start of the decade, titanium dioxide producers have managed to make price rises stick. Most recently, US producers, led by Hanson subsidiary SCM, last month raised prices by three cents a pound, or from about Dollars 1,920 to Pounds 1,990 a tonne. This rise followed a price hike by European producers last year. They attempted to raise prices by up to 20 per cent and succeedded in implementing 10 to 15 percentage points of that. They are beginning to push the rest through now, according to Mr Jim Fischer, president of New Jersey titanium dioxide consultancy consultancy, International Business Management Associates. The European price rise was so much higher than that in the US partly because they were a response to falls over the previous 12 months that were some of the sharpest in recent history. The partial collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism in late 1992 and 1993 'ratcheted down' titanium dioxide prices in Europe, says Mr Alan Pedder, chief executive of ICI subsidiary, Tioxide. As currencies of countries which have titanium dioxide manufacturing plants fell - they included sterling and the escudo - titanium dioxide prices across Europe tended to fall to match the new lower prices. According to Mr Fischer, prices fell by 25 per cent in Europe during 1993 before October's rises. In the Asia Pacific region, the trends have been similar although prices are historically below the levels in the western hemisphere, thanks to a combination of low labour costs and, in some cases, very modern plant. Prices recovered from about Dollars 1,600 a tonne to Pounds 1,800 and still rising. The causes of this turnaround in world prices for titanium dioxide are only partly economic recovery: changes in capacity and patterns of demand have meant that some plants are approaching maximum output much more quickly than they would have done five years ago. Total world capacity is 3.7m tonnes a year, if the published capacities of the world's titanium dioxide plants are added up. According to Mr Fischer, this over-states real capacity by almost 300,000 tonnes a year because many manufacturers have allowed some plant to fall into disrepair during the last few years of chronic low world price. Even then, world consumption is less than 3m tonnes a year, implying over capacity of 400,000 tonnes a year. But some plants are already operating at very close to capacity because of the high demand for one kind of titanium dioxide, that produced by one of the chloride process of manufacture. Titanium dioxide, made by the chloride process, is in greater demand that that made by the alternative sulphate process because of its technical characteristics such as durability and glossiness in paints. Research by Mr Fischer suggests that the average chloride method plant is operating at 93 per cent capacity which the average sulphate plant is operating at about 73 per cent. This helps explain why US price rises have been led by SCM and in Asia by Du Pont, which are highly dependent on the chloride method. In the past, the arguments over which of the two methods is better have centred on the apparent ecological unfriendliness of the sulphate method. Mr Pedder argues that environmental laws mean that any sulphate plants still operating are as clean as their chloride rivals. He defends the sulphate process, perhaps not surprisingly because Tioxide has more sulphate capacity than chloride. He says that sulphate-produced titanium dioxide is more suitable for dyeing fibres and that in any case 70 per cent of consumption has a choice of using the material from either source. In the end, it may simply be price that decides if manufacturers continue their trend towards relying on the chloride process. Mr Fischer says that the sulphate process is an inherently higher cost method of production. This is bad news for most European manufacturers which still use it to a great extent. Although there are some high efficiency sulphate plants, such as Tioxide's in France and Spain, and Rhone Poulenc's at Le Havre in France, most of the impetus of the European price rises in Europe, says Mr Fischer, were 'cost-driven.' The US and Asian producers, especially SCM and Du Pont, on the other hand, have been able to raise price simply because they could. 'They were market-driven rises,' he says. In the short term the effect looks the same to the consumers of titanium dioxide. But the 70 per cent of titanium dioxide customers that are free to use the output from either process may yet have the last word. Eventually, price bargaining and discounting will once again take the centre of the titanium dioxide stage, and then the growing profit margins of the chloride producers could severely damage the health of the higher cost sulphate plants.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Paris tries to melt Beijing ice: Balladur wants warmer relations Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, could have picked a better week to visit Beijing for talks aimed at celebrating a warming of Sino-French relations after the iciness of the past year or so. China's announcement on Monday that it was investigating its most prominent dissident for new, and as yet unspecified, crimes has cast a considerable shadow over the visit. Mr Balladur, due to arrive in Beijing today, can hardly avoid broaching with his Chinese hosts the subject of Mr Wei Jingsheng's incarceration. At the very least, the continued detention of Mr Wei would preclude any possibility of a visit to France this year by China's Premier Li Peng. French officials have been contrasting the relatively low-key Balladur mission to China with that of Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl last November. Mr Kohl arrived in Beijing with a clutch of German industrialists who then proceeded to sign deals worth about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.35bn), including a Siemens agreement to build the Guanghzou subway. Mr Balladur, on the other hand, will be travelling with a relatively small delegation including Mr Alain Juppe, his foreign minister, and Mr Gerard Longuet, trade and industry minister. But this is not to say the Balladur mission is without commercial importance. France is anxious to lay the groundwork for a revival of business relations chilled following the 1992 decision of the previous French government to allow the sale of about Dollars 2.6bn worth of armaments to Taiwan, including 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighters and 1,500 surface-to-air missiles. A furious Beijing ordered closure of France's consulate in Guanghzou, and discriminated against French companies bidding for Chinese contracts. Mr Balladur's ministers have made little attempt to disguise the impulses that led to the mid-January Sino-French declaration which placed a moratorium on further arms sales to Taiwan and opened the way for restoration of what were described as 'friendly relations'. Mr Juppe, in an interview last November with the French newspaper Les Echos, asked with Gallic pragmatism: 'Shall we place our bets on a country with 20m people or one with 1.3bn people? One that is the world's third largest economy? The choice is clear. France wants to re-establish trusting relations with China.' France's disquiet over its diminishing stake in business with China is borne out by trade figures which showed its share of China's imports fell to just 1.6 per cent in 1993 compared with 3 per cent in 1980. Mr Longuet estimates that contracts worth more than FFr3bn (Pounds 354m) were lost during the 1992-94 chill. The Patronat, the French employers' federation, puts the tally at almost double official estimates. French business will be hoping that the Balladur mission will at least improve access in what is proving a highly competitive market. France's powerful energy, utilities and communications groups hope to derive early benefits from the Sino-French rapprochement. 'It is clear that we have been at a disadvantage compared with other western groups,' said an executive of a French engineering company. 'Now we have the opportunity to compete on an equal footing.' Electricite de France and Framatome, suppliers of technology for China's Daya Bay nuclear complex, as well as Alsthom, the engineering group, are all jostling with international competitors to supply China's energy needs. Alcatel is similarly enthusiastic about Beijing's plans to raise almost tenfold the number of its telephone lines over the next five years. Aerospatiale, the aircraft group, is also seeking to break into China's growing aerospace market. But French officials in Beijing say France will make it clear to China that the soft loans used in the past to sweeten commercial deals will not be made available quite so readily in the future. Concessional loans from Paris to China total about FFr35bn, France's biggest exposure abroad. Officials say France does not intend to use its facilities to engage in 'cut-throat' attempts to secure business at the expense of its fellow-Europeans. Mr Balladur's other mission will be to oil the political relationship with Beijing and improve the consultative process between fellow Security Council members. 'We became marginalised in relations with Beijing,' said a French foreign ministry official, adding that 'it is worrying when one considers the growing diplomatic and regional importance of China.' But French and Chinese wishes to make a fresh start in relations are certain to be bedevilled by the human rights issue, especially if Mr Wei continues to be held for questioning during the Balladur visit. Mr Juppe told Le Figaro last week: 'France has no intention of closing its eyes to the problems of human rights in China.' France's overtures to Beijing have been based on pragmatism. The limits of that approach will be tested this week.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 6 SAPA -- Mr Justice Richard  Goldstone should be suspended or dismissed and a commission of  inquiry appointed to investigate his activities, the Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] demanded on  Wednesday.    In a statement issued by its Executive Council, the AWB said  it had been the first organisation to "publicly state its  disgust" at the Goldstone Commission. "The alarm bells are now  ringing, even among the legal fraternity, over the nefarious  activities of Goldstone's Commission. We demand that Goldstone,  who is the only legal official in the Western world to be  prosecutor, judge and executioner all in one, be suspended or  dismissed as a matter of urgency."    The AWB further demanded a commission of inquiry be  appointed  to investigate Judge Goldstone, which should include an  investigation into his present and past political affiliations.  "For too long this man, who was appointed by (State President)  FW de Klerk and is responsible to De Klerk only, has vilified  our esteemed army and police generals without them being charged  in a court of law or given an opportunity to defend themselves,"  the AWB said.    This was an apparent reference to the commission's "third  force" investigation implicating top Police Generals Basie Smit,  Johan le Roux and Krappies Engelbrecht.    The AWB called on the National Party caucus to place "volk  [Afrikaner people] and country" before personal financial gain  by dismissing Mr de Klerk, "Goldstone's boss". "For God's sake,  do this now, before this man is responsible for more chaos and  bloodshed in our beloved fatherland," the AWB said.</p>

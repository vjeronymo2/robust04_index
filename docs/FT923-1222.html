			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumezahead 2% in first half LYONNAISE des Eaux Dumez, one of France's largest industrial companies, saw net profits rise by a modest 2 per cent from FFr697m in the first half of 1991 to FFr711m (Dollars 139m) in the same period this year. Lyonnaise has had problems with its Dumez construction interests following the downturn in the European building industry. Dumez's difficulties were chiefly responsible for a fall in the group's net profits from FFr1.4bn in 1990 to FFr1.17bn last year. The construction sector remained depressed during the first half of this year, producing a loss of FFr38m. Lyonnaise was also burdened by a steep increase in financial charges from FFr290m in the first six months of last year to FFr500m in the same period of 1992. However, the group's other interests fared reasonably well. It succeeded in increasing sales by 14 per cent from FFr38.6bn to FFr44bn and operating profits by 37 per cent from FFr803m to FFr1.1bn. The company recently announced a rationalisation programme for Lyonnaise's investments which will include selling its 3.9 per cent stake in Havas, a leading French media group, and eventually ceding control of United Westburne, its Canadian construction materials sub-sidiary.</p>

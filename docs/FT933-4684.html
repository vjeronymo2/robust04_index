The corporation, whose chief executive Mr Duncan Hall dismissed science parks as 'somewhat passe', said the energy park is a new concept which will establish Teesside as an international R&amp;D centre for the energy industry. Under the plans, a communications network will link the park at Stockton-on-Tees to more than 30 universities and educational institutes in the US, Japan and Europe.</p>

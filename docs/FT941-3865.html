			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Tapie questioned in murder probe Mr Bernard Tapie, the politician and owner of Olympique-Marseille football club, has been questioned by police about the murder of a corruption-fighting woman MP, investigators said yesterday, Reuter reports from Marseilles. He had been named by Mrs Yann Piat, who was shot on February 25, in a letter to an aide in which she said she feared assassination. Mr Tapie was not immediately available for comment but last week he denied any connection, telling French television: 'What now? Why don't you accuse me of being responsible for the war in Bosnia?' The investigating judge has placed two minor Toulon underworld figures under investigation for suspected murder but made clear he believes there was a wider conspiracy, possibly including politicians. Police have also de-tained four other people with underworld links for questioning in the investigation. Mrs Piat, who began her political career in the extreme-right National Front before switching to the Union for French Democracy (UDF), earned a reputation for denouncing alleged links between organised crime, property speculation and politics on the French Riviera.</p>

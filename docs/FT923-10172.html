			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Europe's satellite makers are knocked out of orbit: US manufacturers have been able to achieve economies of scale and undercut rivals across the Atlantic Europe's satellite manufacturers have been left languishing on the launch pad by US rivals which are establishing dominance over the rapidly expanding industry. Over the past 18 months, only two of 27 international civil telecommunications satellite contracts went to European contractors. In Europe's deregulated satellite television market, six new satellites have been ordered, all American. Abandoned by their customers, European companies are being forced to restructure. British Aerospace last month cut 600 jobs - about half the workforce - at its Stevenage satellite-manufacturing plant. This week, Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) said it was interested in acquiring the satellite division, which has not won a new order since last year. To succeed, Dasa will have to beat off Matra-Marconi, a joint venture between GEC of the UK and Matra of France which has stalked BAe's space business since last year. The Matra-Marconi alliance was itself created as a response to the 'growing intensity of competition in space markets', says Mr Richard Wignall, its deputy managing director. Dasa's German rival ANT, the space subsidiary of Bosch, has also been in talks to join forces with Matra-Marconi. But even a three-way alliance between BAe, Matra-Marconi and ANT would be only half the size of Hughes Aircraft, the General Motors subsidiary that is the world's biggest telecommunications satellite maker. Even France, Europe's leader in space industries, has felt the pressure. Alcatel invested between Dollars 30m and Dollars 50m (Pounds 15.7m-Pounds 26m) over the past three years in a new telecommunications technology - very small aperture terminals (VSATs), which reduce the size of dish needed for satellite communications. Earlier this year it abandoned the project, blaming US competition. Alcatel now plans to market VSATs made by Hughes. The divergent fortunes on either side of the Atlantic are largely the result of US military spending and other government contracts. This has provided a stream of orders and allowed US satellite makers to achieve economies of scale. They have thus been able to undercut European rivals by up to 40 per cent in contract tenders. The size of the US industry and the importance of defence expenditure is clear in 'Aerospace Alley', an area surrounding the offices of the United States Air Force Space Systems Division in El Segundo, central Los Angeles. The division is devoted to procurement and has an annual budget of more than Dollars 7bn. Total US government space spending is four times that figure, and six times the combined amount spent by Europe's governments. Big money in US defence has created big companies. Hughes Aircraft, one of El Segundo's defence contractors, employs about 9,000 people working on a satellite order book worth about Dollars 3bn. It has the world's only mass production line for telecommunications satellites. The defence contracts which fuelled the growth of Hughes and its El Segundo neighbours have so far remained secure in spite of cuts in US defence spending. In particular, long-term projects - such as the Defence Department's 24-satellite Global Positioning System which allowed General Norman Schwarzkopf to navigate across a featureless desert in the Gulf war last year - are yet to be completed. Fears of a decline in military contracts however, have, pushed US manufacturers into the civil sector. 'Four years ago, we did 85 per cent of our business with US government agencies,' says Mr Steve Dorfman, president of Hughes Aircraft's Space Systems division. 'Now it is nearer 50-50.' This shift is visible across the US industry. TRW, another El Segundo satellite manufacturer, with annual sales of Dollars 3bn, is proposing to build a 12-satellite global mobile telephone network. Motorola, the electronics and cellular telephone company, plans to put 77 miniature satellites into orbit to provide a similar service. The US manufacturers' move into the civil sector is well timed. More civil satellite contracts are going to open tender and are not restricted to domestic manufacturers. The world market for civil telecommunications satellites, for example, worth about Dollars 8bn in the 1980s, will almost double in the next decade, says Euroconsult, the Paris-based space consultancy Over the next few years, the biggest buyers on the open market are likely to be the international communications co-operatives, Intelsat, Inmarsat and Eutelsat. These organisations, owned by national telecommunications bodies such as British Telecom, Deutsche Bundespost and AT&amp;T, provide most of the world's satellite telecommunications links. They owe no national allegiances, and are free to buy from anyone. European manufacturers fear that this freedom will result in more orders for US rivals. In response they are demanding protective measures. Eurospace, their trade association, has called for a 'comprehensive, collective space policy' in Europe to help 'resist foreign domination'. It seeks preferential treatment in international tenders from European satellite buyers. But protection is unlikely to provide a solution. Import controls are out of the question because satellites do not legally cross any frontiers. Even if such a policy could be enforced, international telecommunications co-operatives remain free from obligations to buy from particular suppliers. European satellite makers can rely on a trickle of orders from their own governments. BAe, for example, is expecting to win a Ministry of Defence contract for the Skynet IV military communications satellite. And there would still be some subcontracting work for US-based companies: Inmarsat's latest generation of satellites is being built by GE-Astro of the US with Matra-Marconi making the radio equipment. But for Europe's satellite industry this is survival in the second division and, in an industry where size is increasingly what counts, probably unsustainable. The response from senior executives in many European satellite companies is to seek co-operation and alliances with their American rivals. Some deals have already been struck. Alcatel and Aerospatiale of France, together with Alenia of Italy, last year paid Dollars 182m for a 49 per cent stake in Space Systems/Loral, the commercial satellite business of defence contractor Loral, the third-biggest US satellite maker. Last month, Dasa, the aerospace arm of Daimler Benz of Germany, paid Dollars 57m for its own 12 per cent stake in Space Systems/Loral. More alliances are likely to be formed over the next few years as European companies fight for a share of the growing market. For Mr Olof Lundberg, director-general of Inmarsat, they have little choice. 'In Europe, there is clearly too much satellite manufacturing capacity. A restructuring is inevitable,' he says.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China was  concerned with the situation in the Balkan region, and held that  the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Balkan states  should be respected.    The interests of the minorities in every country of the  region should also be protected, Qian told Arjan Starova, deputy  foreign minister of Albania during their meeting.    China hoped that the countries in the region, keeping good  relations, would properly handle their problems to benefit peace  and cooperation in the peninsula, as well as the development of  each country, Qian said.    After relations between China and Albania became normal a  year ago, they continued to expand and develop, Qian said,  adding that China would like to further the bilateral links in  various fields, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  co-existence.    Starova arrived here on June 4. During his stay, Chinese  Vice-Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo has had discussions with him  on Sino-Albanian links and international issues of common  concern.    Dai and Starova also signed an agreement to cement the  cooperation between the two foreign ministries.    Starova is to visit north China's Tianjin city, and leave  for  home on June 9.</p>

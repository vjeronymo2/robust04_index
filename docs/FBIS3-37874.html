NATO found itself in  a complex situation. The adversary for whose deterrence the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization had been created disappeared.  NATO became confronted with the task of finding a new objective  for its existence and new functions.    The dramatic development of events in former Yugoslavia  highlighted the "security vacuum" problem, which had taken shape  in the Central and Eastern Europe zone. The former Warsaw Pact  states and the newly created Eastern European states had to deal  with the task of guaranteeing security in fundamentally new  conditions. Some of them -- the countries of the Visegrad Group  and the Baltic states -- see a way out for themselves in joining  NATO and the European Community [EC] as soon as possible. One  of their major considerations has been the hope to achieve a  rapid economic integration into the European structure and to  enjoy the ensuing advantages.    In 1993, attempts by those countries to join NATO quickly  met  with increasing opposition on the part of Russia. The prospect  of finding the North Atlantic Alliance close to the country's  borders was categorically objected to. Since the early autumn  of 1993, Moscow's position with regard to the prospects of  Central and Eastern European countries joining NATO became more  inflexible.    It was precisely under those circumstances that the United  States, which plays the most influential role in determining the  future of NATO, came out with the "Partnership for Peace"  initiative. As a matter of fact, the "Partnership" program is a  compromise between the desire on the part of Central and Eastern  European countries to join the Alliance and its members'  attempts to avoid a deterioration in relations with Russia,  something, which, in their opinion, would be detrimental to the  position of reformers in Moscow.    On 10 and 11 January, a summit held by the NATO members in  Brussels adopted a framework document "Partnership for Peace."  In accordance with the decisions adopted at the summit, all  European countries, including nonaligned ones, were invited to  participate in the "Partnership for Peace" program.    On 8 February 1994, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs  Anatoliy Zlenko put his signature to the "Partnership for Peace"  program. It must be pointed out that Ukraine was the first CIS  country to join the "Partnership." In his speech after the  signing, the head of the Ukrainian external political department  stated this: "By joining the 'Partnership for Peace' program,  Ukraine has confirmed its fundamental political priorities and  its choice in favor of returning to Europe, from which we had  been artificially alienated, and joining the family of European  nations."    What possibilities will open up to Ukraine after it joins  the  "Partnership?"    The participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program  will  make it possible to achieve greater openness, will raise the  degree of confidence in military-political relations, and will  promote changes for the better in relations between the NATO  leadership and Ukraine.    Participation in the "Partnership" will enable Ukraine to  become active in various spheres of NATO activity and will  facilitate the tasks of restructuring and modernizing the Armed  Forces and raising them to the standards of NATO.    The program envisages cooperation in training troops and in  preparing them for carrying out operations within the frameworks  of the United Nations and the CSCE for the purpose of  maintaining peace, participating in search operations,  humanitarian tasks, and so on.    One of the principles of the "Partnership for Peace" is the  treatment of every member country on an individual basis. The  working plan, which Ukraine must devise, will conform to its  national interests and the possibilities of financing the  necessary transformations in the Armed Forces, exercises,  training, and joint maneuvers.    The "Partnership" provides for a possibility of NATO  consulting active participants in the program in case of a  direct threat to their territorial integrity, political  independence, or security. There is no doubt that the  possibility of such consultations will contribute to  strengthening Ukraine's security.    The expansion and strengthening of cooperation in the sphere  of security is an indispensable precondition for Ukraine's  gradual integration into European structures. When Ukraine  achieves the status of an associate member of the EC, this will  become yet another stage on this road. Of course, this will  only become possible in the case of a successful implementation  of market reforms and the country's steady development toward  democracy.    The European security system is an ideal that Ukraine  strives  to achieve.    As Zlenko emphasized in his speech following the signing of  the "Partnership for Peace," Ukraine looks upon this program as  a "two- way road." Adapting itself to NATO standards, Ukraine  expects that, in the final analysis, "NATO must irreversibly  change its essence in the process of cooperation with its  partners." In the opinion of Ukraine's minister of foreign  affairs, precisely this will enable NATO "to play a major role  in the new architecture of European security and form its  foundation." It is precisely in such a security system that  Ukraine strives to find its place.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Management: Chewing over the fat - Health Check There is more to obesity than meets the eye. Simply being overweight does not in itself increase the dangers of heart disease unless it is accompanied by high blood pressure, diabetes or high levels of cholesterol. There are different types of obesity, and some are more risky than others. There are two main sorts of fat distribution: 'android' apple-shaped distribution, where most of the fat is concentrated around the waist, and 'gynoid', which is more pear shaped with the fat distributed all over, although particularly on the lower part of the body. Evidence over the last two decades suggests that apple-shaped people are more vulnerable to heart disease than the pear-shaped type. Some studies conclude that an otherwise slim person with a bulging mid-drift may be in greater danger than someone who is fat all over. Women are at less risk than men: they can carry up to 25 kilograms more fat without increasing their chances of heart disease because of their more pear-shaped distribution. To find out which type you are, take your waist measurement and divide it by the hip measurement. Men are classified as 'upper body obese' if the waste-hip ratio (WHR) is more than 0.95, and women, if they are more than 0.85. The best remedy, as with all weight problems, is gently to cut the number of calories consumed, and to increase the number used up through regular exercise. Remember that your bathroom scales will be of no help, as muscle is heavier than fat. This means that as you exercise, you may find you gain weight. Instead use the WHR - or attend to how tight your belt is - to gauge your success. The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.</p>

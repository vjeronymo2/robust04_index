			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Technology: A crackdown on originality - Beginning a series on innovation in the recession, Charles Leadbeater looks at how the economic climate has affected investment in research and development Bombarded by the pressures of recession British managers might be forgiven for putting plans for innovation to one side. But they would be gambling with their company's future. As the director of one of the UK's leading electronics companies puts it: 'We cut back research and development for 1988. We are still reaping the harvest of this decision, which has left us 1.5 product generations behind the competition. We are faced with the choice of leapfrogging generations or getting out of the business.' Innovation is becoming increasingly central to competition. It is no longer enough to produce low-cost, high-quality items. Product ranges must be renewed constantly to take advantage of the quickening pace of technological change and create distinctive products which can command a niche in international markets. The Confederation of British Industry's Innovation Trends survey* published on Monday showed that UK companies have had little success in reducing the time it takes them to develop new products. Yet the need for new products is becoming more pressing. Companies reporting that the lifespan for their products had shortened outweighed those who said it had lengthened by almost 10 to one. About 40 per cent said they needed to replace their product ranges within three years. The innovative capacity of an economy is a key index of its strength. The impact of the recession upon the UK's innovative potential will have implications for the health of the economy long after the recession is formally declared over. Cuts in investment in 1990-91 might allow dividends to be maintained in the teeth of recession. But by the mid-1990s companies may find their product development pipelines have run dangerously dry. Britain entered the recession with a record for innovation which was at best mixed. The main source of industry's renewed competitiveness in the last decade was a leap in productivity. Between 1980 and 1987 output per person employed in the UK rose in real terms by 24 per cent, compared with 22 per cent in Japan, between 12 per cent and 14 per cent in Germany, Italy and France and about 7 per cent in the US. But have British manufacturers become more efficient at developing new products? A House of Lords select committee report** published earlier this year says that many UK manufacturers invest too little in new or improved products, plants or systems. 'They rely on doing what they have done in the past and fail to seize new opportunities created by changing customer demand. As a result their competitiveness declines.' Gross domestic expenditure on research and development fell in the UK between 1981 and 1988, but rose in France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US. Public spending on R&amp;D fell markedly while industry spending rose from about 1.2 per cent of GDP to about 1.25 per cent. This compares with a rise in German industry's expenditure from 1.4 per cent of GDP to 1.8 per cent. British electronics groups such as GEC have been criticised for avoiding technologically important areas such as the mass production of semiconductors. In retrospect this looks like a sensible decision as all the big European semiconductor manufacturers - Siemens of Germany, Philips of the Netherlands and SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian joint venture - are losing money hand over fist on chips. At best Britain's relative technological decline may have been arrested. It has definitely not been reversed and there are signs that it has continued. Is the British innovation system strong enough to withstand the battering of recession? Over the last 15 months the outlook for innovation has deteriorated in line with the fall in confidence among manufacturers, according to the CBI. In October 1989 a balance of about 35 per cent of manufacturers expected to increase their expenditure upon innovation in the year ahead. By January of this year the balance had turned negative - more companies expected to reduce their expenditure than those expecting to increase it. Yet it seems possible that innovation may not be cut back as far as other costs and the cuts will fall unevenly across the economy. Throughout last year manufacturers remained quite bullish about their spending on innovation even though they had become deeply pessimistic about the business outlook. This may mean that innovation spending could get away with a shave rather than a cut, as long as confidence recovers soon (see graph). Moreover cuts in innovation are likely to be spread unevenly across the economy. The recession will widen the gap between those sectors where Britain has well-established strengths, built upon heavy research and development spending, and those where it is weak because it has underinvested in the past. The recession will amplify the difference between these two sectors. Chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturers are the most buoyant about the outlook for innovation. A positive balance of 20 per cent of companies in the chemicals sector still expect to spend more on innovation in the coming year. Only 18 per cent think their spending is less than adequate. The UK entered the recession with a strong position in chemicals and pharmaceuticals and is likely to retain it. In contrast the mechanical engineering sector is among the weakest in manufacturing, with one of the poorest investment records in the 1980s. In this sector the outlook for innovation is poor. A negative balance of 10 per cent of companies expect to spend less on innovation. About 44 per cent of companies believe their innovation spending is inadequate. This sector will be made weaker by the recession. Yet it would be complacent to assume that areas of traditional strength will escape unscathed. The defence-related areas of aerospace and electronics are cases in point. Within the overall recession is a specific defence recession brought on by cuts in military expenditure. Defence accounts for 51 per cent of UK government spending on research and development and 20 per cent of total UK research and development. Defence is one of Britain's specialisms. Military research feeds much of the civil aerospace and electronics industries. Thus the British innovation system will be particularly hit by cuts in defence-related research. A development which may counterbalance the decline in defence is the increase in foreign investment in innovation in the UK. The share of British R&amp;D accounted for by foreign companies rose from 4 per cent in 1967 to 13 per cent in 1986. In areas such as consumer electronics and automobile assembly the UK has become almost wholly dependent upon foreign groups. In the long run the prospects for innovation in the UK will increasingly turn upon whether large foreign groups choose to complement their UK manufacturing plants with research facilities. Small companies may fare worse than larger groups. The CBI survey found that 45 per cent of companies which employ fewer than 50 people felt their spending on innovation was inadequate, compared with 30 per cent of companies employing between 1,000 and 5,000. Innovation is the product of a complex process involving a range of ingredients. It seems likely that companies will cut back on some elements of innovation, while continuing to invest in others. According to the CBI, in manufacturing as a whole investment in formal R&amp;D will fall this year. Yet there could be an expansion in the resources devoted to other elements of innovation such as training. David Lees, chairman and chief executive of GKN, the automotive and industrial services group, says: 'In 1980 we cut back on training. This time we will not do that.' Joint ventures with foreign companies are set to expand. About 50 per cent of manufacturers are planning to put more effort into joint ventures which bring access to technology, according to the CBI. Some groups such as Smiths Industries in aerospace and John Brown in engineering pride themselves upon being highly skilled buyers, integrators and appliers of technology to specific markets rather than inventing it in house. Perhaps most importantly the best British companies have developed a management culture of continuous, incremental improvement to products and processes which will continue through the recession. Indeed one beneficial side-effect of this recession may be to expose the relative fragility of the British approach to innovation. In the wake of the 1980-81 recession government policy and management effort was directed at improving labour productivity, through trade union reform, de-manning and the introduction of reformed working practices. The recession of 1990-91 may well yield a different, and altogether more complicated, task - to shore up and strengthen the British capacity to innovate. * CBI Innovation Trends Survey, Issue Number 2, available from Centre Point, New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU.

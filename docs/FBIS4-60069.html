			<p>BFN     [Text] Two soldiers were killed this morning south of the  Erez junction when shot by terrorists from a vehicle which left  the Gaza Strip and returned there following the shooting. The  fatalities were reservists. One soldier was named as Moshe  Bukhra of Netanya, while the name of the other fatality has not  yet been released.    The soldiers were deployed with a third soldier at a  temporary roadblock south of the Erez junction when a Peugeot  car suddenly appeared from the south and opened fire at them.  The two soldiers died on the spot while the third managed to  return fire at the assailants. The vehicle returned to the Gaza  Strip. No chase was given because there were no additional IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers there.    The representative of the Palestinian police force in the  Gaza Strip told AP by telephone that the Palestinian police  force did not open fire, and said that from the point of view of  the Palestinian authorities in the Gaza Strip the incident is  over.    Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad  claim responsibility for the attack. Hamas said in  announcements made in Gaza mosques that the assailants belonged  to 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam. A different announcement made to the  foreign press in the Gaza Strip said they belonged to the  Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip.</p>

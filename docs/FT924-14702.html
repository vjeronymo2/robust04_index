			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: CFTC confirmed as US futures market regulator - Laurie Morse on new rules and exclusions passed by Congress AFTER a three-and-a-half-year battle, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission is finally about to get a new lease of life. The Futures Trading Practices Act is set to pass into law this week, reauthorising the regulator for another two years. Congress voted in favour of the bill - one of the few important pieces of securities legislation this year - on Friday, with the the Senate expected to ratify it later this week. Besides confirming the CFTC as regulator of the US futures exchanges, the bill specifically excludes over-the-counter swap and hybrids markets from the CFTC's remit. It also introduces stronger protections for customers of US futures exchanges. In an interview, Mrs Wendy Gramm, chairwoman, said the bill would bolster US competitiveness in global derivative markets, and would allow US futures exchanges to uphold their reputation as financial innovators. Mrs Gramm spoke strongly in favour of free markets that have a minimum of regulation. 'What this (Act) does first is put to rest uncertainty in the regulatory system internationally. Now we can all focus on developing innovative new products,' she said. 'One thing is that it gives us more flexibility. We will be able to provide appropriate exemptions for certain products. This is important because we don't want to stifle innovation,' she added. The legislation affirms previous CFTC rulings that over-the-counter instruments such as swaps and hybrid instruments are not futures, and so are not subject to CFTC supervision. Mrs Gramm rejects claims that this leaves the OTC markets totally unsupervised. 'They may not be regulated directly by a government agency, but the banks and other institutions trading these products often are regulated,' she said. According to Mrs Gramm, the exemptions in the bill will also allow US futures exchanges more freedom to develop new products and trading systems without regulatory hinderances. In the past, for example, CFTC rules requiring futures trades be made openly and competitively had hindered exchanges who wished to implement block trading procedures in their stock index futures pits. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange did manage, after long negotiation with the CFTC, to design large order execution procedures for its S&amp;P 500 stock index futures. Under the new rules, those procedures can be made less cumbersome, and might apply to other contracts and exchanges. The new legislation also allows US futures exchanges to keep day-to-day margin-setting authority for stock index futures, with the CFTC and the US Federal Reserve gaining powers to determine margins in emergency situations. The reauthorisation debates have allowed Congress to impose tighter trade practice rules on the big US futures exchanges. The new bill directs the CFTC to require closer trade-tracking to detect and deter trading floor abuses. It increases monetary penalties for CFTC rule violations, and it requires futures exchanges to distribute records of its disciplinary actions against members more broadly. It also contains provisions against insider trading and 'dual' trading, and prohibits floor brokers from engaging in the potentially abusive practice of executing customer orders with their own business partners.</p>

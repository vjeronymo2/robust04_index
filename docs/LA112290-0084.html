			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> SENIORS' AGENCY GETS NEW DIRECTOR  </P> <P> A Simi Valley resident has taken over the helm of a Thousand Oaks senior  citizens social service agency whose executive director resigned three months  ago over a cut in his workweek.  </P> <P> Rick Fields, 38, has assumed the position of executive director of the Conejo  Valley Senior Concerns Inc., a nonprofit agency that operates a senior citizens  day-care center and Meals on Wheels program.  </P> <P> Fields, the former executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Simi  Valley, is chairman of the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District Board of  Directors.  </P> <P> Fields hopes to boost the revenues of the agency, which plans to open an  expanded day-care center for frail elderly people.  </P> <P> Senior Concerns needs money to continue running a hot line for senior citizens  and a thrift store, he said.  </P> <P> Don Hegarty resigned as director in September after budget cuts forced Senior  Concerns to trim his hours to 30 a week. Hegarty worked for Senior Concerns for  five years.  </P> <P> More than $25,000 was trimmed from salaries because of a drop in revenues, said  Fields, who declined to state his salary. The agency now has a $280,000 budget.  </P> <P> Fields said Senior Concerns is expecting a dramatic jump in its operating costs  next year when it opens the 5,600-square-foot Fitzgerald House. The new center  at Hodencamp Road and Hillcrest Drive will more than quintuple the size of the  existing Fitzgerald House at 591 E. Hillcrest Drive. PSYCHE PASCUAL  </P></p>

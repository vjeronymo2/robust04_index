			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Delors hails 'strong foundation' for union MR JACQUES Delors, president of the European Commission, last night welcomed the French vote as giving a strong foundation to moves towards closer European monetary and political union. Speaking in Paris, he said: 'May they (French voters) be thanked for France, for Europe, for democracy, for progress, for history.' 'The fact that the French have ratified by a direct process gives a stronger foundation to the legitimate construction of Europe, even though it is necessary to take account of the fears and anxieties of those who have voted No,' he said. Mr Delors, who had threatened to resign if the French had rejected the treaty, also hit back at accusations of over-centralisation levelled at the Commission by opponents of the treaty. He said: 'It is the Council of Ministers and representatives of the 12 governments who must explain Europe in each country.' Other European leaders reacted with immediate relief to the French approval of the Maastricht Treaty, echoing Mr Delors' reaffirmation that the project of a deeper, broader and politically united Europe remained on course. However, approval of the French referendum result among EC governments was tinged with concern at the narrowness of the outcome and apprehension about the prospects for ratification of the treaty elsewhere in the Community, notably in Britain. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, said that despite the narrowness of the vote, the result was a 'new boost' for Europe and pledged to work on expanding the EC. 'Along with the deepening of the Community, we want in the next few years to realise the second great goal of our European policy quickly: that is the expansion of the future union with the Efta (European Free Trade Association) states that have applied for membership,' he said. Mr Kohl said he was sure that Germany would ratify the Maastricht Treaty before the end of the year. Other German leaders nevertheless cautioned that the narrow vote gave cause for reflection. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, while calling the vote a 'decisive step forward', cautioned that 'we must, however, think over a few things'. His warning was echoed by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, who said that 'a narrow majority is significantly better than a narrow minority, but added that the margin was 'no cause for triumph'. Mr Jack Lang, the French education minister who co-ordinated the Socialist government's Yes campaign, hailed victory minutes after the first computer projections indicated voters had approved the treaty. 'I am proud that a majority of the French people have chosen Europe. It is a victory for France, a victory for Europe,' he said. However, leaders of the No campaign were equally quick to focus on the narrow margin of the vote. 'It's a pseudo-success, a mediocre Yes,' said Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the National Front. The European architects of the Maastricht Treaty immediately greeted the French approval with strong declarations that momentum towards European unity had been sustained. Mr Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, said he 'breathed a sigh of relief' at the likely Yes result. 'If the French electorate had not voted Yes, the work of 40 years would probably have been undone, causing irreparable damage,' he said. However, Mr Piet Dankert, the Dutch deputy foreign minister, described his reaction as 'sombre'. He told Dutch television that 'the problem is that it is a very small majority, and does not get us in the clear.' He said the treaty still faced stern tests in Britain, where it must be ratified by the House of Commons, and in Denmark, where a referendum has already rejected the treaty. Mr Karel van Miert, a member of the European Commission, also sounded a pessimistic note, saying 'the damage has been done'. He said he was worried that the Community was 'drifting apart and losing credibility'. He said: 'When things start sliding, it is difficult to stop them.' Denmark, which voted against the Maastricht Treaty in a referendum in June, hoped that the Yes vote would help it persuade other EC members countries to accept its need for special arrangements with the EC, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, said last night. 'We could be very difficult for the other countries, but we have to ask ourselves whether this would be clever,' he said. 'I think it should now be easier for Denmark to obtain a special arrangement with the European Community,' he said. 'The European landscape today is totally different from what it was in early June.' Speaking in Paris, Mr Delors reasserted his belief that monetary union should happen as quickly as possible. 'What happened on the exchange markets a week ago was due to the absence of real and effective consultation between the major currencies.' He said the difference between US and German interest rates was also to blame. But 'that doesn't mean to say that the European monetary system is useless. On the contrary. But under those circumstances economies which are not the healthiest suffer,' he said.</p>

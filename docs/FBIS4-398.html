			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The night seems to have been calm in Kigali,  although some sporadic fire is reported.    Yesterday, 400 Belgian paratroopers took off to take part in  the evacuation. The Rwandan Government has officially  authorized our planes to land, but, according to the Belgian  Defense Ministry, it is not at all clear whether the Rwandan  Army is obeying the new government's orders. Kigali airport  remains blocked, and the situation is becoming more and more  dangerous for Belgian nationals. Jean-Philippe Seti of Radio  Suisse Romande reports from Kigali:    [Seti] The white population is not being directly targeted,  but it is becoming increasingly dangerous to step out into the  street, since you can be murdered for your valuables. There is,  however, a new element: The hunt for Belgians has begun. It is  very dangerous to be a Belgian in Kigali. I have been stopped  at several checkpoints and brutally asked whether I am Belgian.  It is clear that Belgians are being targeted. The Belgians are  particularly afraid. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Two plays that flopped in New York are delighting critics and audiences at the  Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland. Edward Albee's "The Man Who Had Three  Arms" and Michael Cristofer's "The Lady and the Clarinet," which were New York  flops in the early 1980s, have won the Scotsman newspaper's coveted Fringe  First awards, given weekly to the best of the Fringe's many openings during the  festival's three weeks. However, not every unsung American play has its  reputation restored in Scotland. Beth Henley's "The Wake of Jamey Foster," a  short-lived Broadway entry early this decade, got mixed-to-poor reviews at this  year's Fringe, and David Rabe's "Hurlyburly," a Broadway success, was denounced  in the Scotsman as "exploitative, bad-mouthed, and boring." The 422 plays being  offered in the 43rd annual Festival Fringe include a number of American  classics and Broadway hits, from "Long Day's Journey Into Night" to more recent  works, including "Agnes of God" and "Night, Mother."

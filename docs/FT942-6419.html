			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Kohl increases poll lead A series of opinion polls yesterday showed Chancellor Helmut Kohl pulling ahead of Mr Rudolf Scharping, his challenger in the October elections, helped by an improving economy and stronger support in eastern Germany. The respected Allensbacher monthly poll showed one in five Germans still questioning the government's leadership ability, compared with one in three at the beginning of the year. In eastern Germany the doubters fell from 22 per cent to 15 per cent over the same period. One of four polls published yesterday showed Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leading by 42 per cent over 39 per cent for the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD). Three other polls showed the CDU leading with smaller margins while the Allensbacher monthly poll showed the SPD ahead but falling from 40.6 per cent to 36.3 per cent in April alone.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Arts: Wildest Dreams - Scarborough This is the first time that I have seen an Alan Ayckbourn play on his home ground of Scarborough. Ideas, jokes and characters in the Stephen Joseph Theatre in the Round pop up all over the place, which is what Ayckbourn is about. Wildest Dreams is his 42nd full-length play. It is a bit long and doubtless will be refined before reaching London, but it is still worth seeing in its raw state. The basic idea is to juxtapose a quasi-supernatural board game with someone playing a more sophisticated game on a computer. Eventually they may hit the same target, though what that is remains obscure. 'The Game,' as it is called, consists of four players sitting round a board with a set of primitive figures. Between them the players and the figures may move as the spirit takes. It is is played regularly every Thursday evening under the aegis of the schoolteacher, Stanley Inchbridge, and his wife, Hazel. Or at least it is until an outsider intervenes in the form of the blonde, Marcie Banks, for whom Stanley falls. Hazel reacts by reverting to babyhood. In the background, one of the younger players is communing with spirits through his computer. There is a good deal about family relations, though it is not always clear who is related to whom and how. Hazel and Stanley regret not having had children of their own: perhaps the game is a substitute. Stanley also has a curious brother-in-law called Austen who appears to have jinxed their honeymoon by following them round the Norfolk Broads with a camera. Austen pursues Stanley, the English teacher, still with a series of linguistic challenges like what is the other meaning of the word 'fugue'. The brother-in-law subsequently disappears from the plot for no very obvious reason. On another part of the stage is a breaking marriage. Marcie, the blonde, is taking refuge from a pugilistic husband. She says in passing, again for no obvious reason, that both her parents are MPs. A further mystery is the house wherein she finds herself. It appears to belong to an old schoolfriend  -one of the players of the game - who has inherited it from her family, but chooses to live in the basement; the computer whizz-kid lives up in an attic. More family symbolism, no doubt. If you ask how all this all this hangs together, the answer is 'loosely'. There is plainly a link between the primitive nature of the game and the hi-tech almost extraterrestial pursuits of the computer. Equally there is a kind of dyslexic linguistic game going leading to confusions between tumulus and cumulus and a splendid of-the-cuff definition of 'punctilious': nit-picking. An orgu, we learn, is a 'hardy specimen of limited intelligence, either discarded or occasionally kept as a pet'. Perhaps intelligence, in the pure sense of the word, is the theme. Ayckbourn has used modern technology on stage before: the electronics in his first London play, Mr Whatnot. Appropriately this production is sponsored by ICI Computer Systems Ltd. Barry McCarthy as Stanley is a wonderfully puzzled schoolmaster. Rebecca Lacey does her best to make sense of the wholly incomprehensible part of Marcie. Ayckbourn directs.</p>

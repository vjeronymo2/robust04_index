			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Christophe Lamfalussy: "Charlemagne Building </F> Under Surveillance"]    [Excerpts] Soon, official documents will be classified and  security investigations will be carried out. The transparency  of the Twelve is not without its limits. The 2,000 officials  working at the Council of Ministers, most of whom work in the  Charlemagne Building in Brussels, will soon be subjected to  security regulations aimed at reducing access to confidential  documents and screening the trustworthiness of some of its  staff. [passage omitted]    The Council is where European policy is coordinated and  where  the memoranda of each government end up. The implementation of  the Maastricht Treaty, which makes the Council responsible for  the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and for  cooperation on issues of justice, has effectively increased its  power. [passage omitted]    The Twelve envisage creating four categories of document --  top secret, secret, confidential, and restricted -- which would  remain classified for five years. The top secret documents  would contain information that unauthorized divulgence would  have extremely serious consequences for the essential interests  of the Union and its member states.    The Staff Committee simply wants to abolish the "restricted"  category, the definition of which is so broad that its  implementation would mean that neither the media nor the members  of the European Parliament would no longer have access to  significant information.    Another focus of discontentment is that the Twelve intend to  make the secret services responsible for conducting security  investigations of all those officials authorized to consult  confidential documents. [passage omitted]    Since there is no European secret service, the Staff  Committee has suggested that the Belgian secret service do the  investigating. Such procedures have existed within the European  Commission since 1958 due to the Euratom Treaty, which delegated  powers in the area of nuclear safety.</p>

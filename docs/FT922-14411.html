			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Whitbread In recent months, Whitbread has managed to establish itself as the most harried of the UK brewers. Yesterday it produced two more pieces of bad news, one perhaps less serious than it looks and the other more so. The Pounds 37m exceptional write-off of loans to the free pub trade - around one-sixth of annual net profits - implies a further sharp fall in pub values in London and the south-east at a time when Whitbread still has 1,250 pubs to release from the tie. But this will doubtless be addressed by leasing deals. Meanwhile, the company comes close to promising that there will be no further provisions in the annual figures due next month. The news that Whitbread is cancelling several hundred million pounds worth of investment in Pizza Hut on the continent may be more significant. European retailing was to be Whitbread's big strategic growth area. The announcement leaves it with just 45 restaurants and a hotel in Germany. Given the way the shares have underperformed the sector of late, it might be thought that the worst is in the price. It is just Whitbread's luck that its dependence on eating out in London and the south-east also makes it the brewer most exposed to a Labour victory.</p>

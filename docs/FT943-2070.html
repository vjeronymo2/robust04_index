			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Observer: Danger man's meaty memo What precisely is Gunther Burghardt's game? Earlier this year, the boss of the new Brussels directorate of external political affairs was patting himself on the back, telling the European Commission's internal magazine what a significant contribution his DG1A, as it is called, had made to a common European foreign policy. The impression was of a clued-up operation, dispatching secret telegrams hither and thither and generally functioning like any national foreign ministry. So has DG1A had its feet up this summer? The question arises because of the content of a memo circulating at the highest level of the Commission presenting a rather sorrier state of affairs. It whinges about an 'almost total lack of strategic planning, a repeated disregard for agreed EU rules, coupled with regrettable ups and downs in the performance of the Council Presidency system'. It lays into France for acting unilaterally in Rwanda, Britain and Italy for getting into a huddle on eastern Europe, and Greece for slapping a trade embargo on Macedonia. The draft concludes: 'The very notion of a common foreign and security policy sounds increasingly hollow.' Could it be that the author hates the whole idea of closer co-operation? Actually no, since the memo is penned by none other than G. Burghardt. In which case it looks suspiciously like a ploy to bolster the Commission's foreign policy role ahead of the 1996 review of Maastricht. There is fighting talk of more funding for EU budgets and even of introducing an element of majority voting on foreign policy matters. All anathema to the French and the British. No, DG1A has not had its feet up all summer.</p>

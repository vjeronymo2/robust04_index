			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / High flier takes control of grounded airline: Air France's new chief has plenty of experience of militant opposition at home and abroad MR Christian Blanc, due to be officially confirmed today as the head of Air France, has clashed with striking workers on the Paris underground and dealt with militant separatists in an overseas colony. But he may still be forgiven for having qualms about his new challenge. He takes over the loss-making airline when it is mired in a bitter industrial dispute. His predecessor, Mr Bernard Attali, was undermined by the French government which decided to scrap a recovery plan he deemed essential for the airline's survival. Mr Blanc now has three months to draw up a new package to restore health to the airline and resolve the strikes which have paralysed the state-owned national carrier. It is hardly an enticing prospect. The strength of union opposition to restructuring measures was clearly illustrated yesterday in a show of force, dubbed 'Black Tuesday' by the French press, which saw the airline's operations halted by co-ordinated action by groundstaff, airport workers, pilots, cabin staff and union members at Air France's domestic airline subsidiary. Mr Blanc, however, has some useful cards up his sleeve. As former head of RATP, the Paris bus and metro operator, he has experience of managing a public sector group and of implementing reforms in the face of powerful union opposition. During his tenure at RATP, between 1989 and 1992, Mr Blanc succeeded in decentralising the group's operations, reducing the number of management layers from seven to three, and rationalising pay scales, a particularly sensitive issue for the unions. But he also experienced the risks of reform. In 1992 he was faced with a strike by workers on the Paris metro as a result of his attempts to guarantee a minimum level of service during industrial disputes and to reduce pay for striking employees. After failing to win support from the Socialist government of Mr Pierre Beregevoy, he resigned. 'The experience of the strike of 1992 shows two things about Mr Blanc,' says one executive at RATP. 'He is determined to introduce management reforms and he will not compromise.' Another former colleague says he is likely to have demanded a free hand in managing Air France. But this may be a tall order, particularly in the light of Mr Attali's sudden loss of government support. If RATP was a turbulent period for Mr Blanc, it was peaceful compared with his previous challenge in New Caledonia. In 1988, he was appointed by Mr Michel Rocard, then Socialist prime minister, as head of a mission to resolve a conflict sparked by an independence movement in the South Pacific colony. The mission played a large part in the conclusion of the Matignon Accords which defused the dispute and represented one of the successes of the Rocard administration. Mr Blanc's achievement in New Caledonia and his stint at RATP should provide valuable experience at Air France. So, too should his political contacts. As a close friend of Mr Rocard, now the leader of the Socialist party, it may appear curious that he has been picked by Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right government to resolve its first serious industrial dispute. His reputation as a tough negotiator is the most important explanation. His left-wing credentials might also help in negotiations with the hitherto implacable strikers. Mr Blanc should not, however, take this for granted. Mr Louis Viannet, general secretary of the Confederation Generale du Travail, one of the union groups spearheading the protests at the national carrier, issued a stern warning yesterday. 'Mr Blanc should not try to do at Air France what he sought to do at RATP,' said Mr Viannet in a radio interview. He said the Air France chief should take into account the 'errors that have been made' at the airline and should discuss fully with the unions any measures he plans to take. That leaves Mr Blanc in a difficult position. The government, despite its climbdown, still says it wants to implement the 4,000 job cuts envisaged in Mr Attali's plan, although it has said the cuts can be achieved without forced redundancies. The airline, which is forecast to lose more than FFr5bn (Pounds 580m) this year, remains in urgent need of restructuring. Mr Blanc's first three months - the time the government allowed for a new recovery plan to be drawn up - are therefore likely to represent the sternest test of his negotiating skills.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Reassurance for Pentium chip users Microsoft and Lotus Development, two of the leading suppliers of personal computer software programs, said yesterday that users can continue to use Pentium-based PCs without concern, following disclosures of a flaw in the Intel microprocessor chip. Microsoft said the Pentium flaw, which affects mathematical functions, will not cause problems for most PC users including those who use Microsoft's Windows, word processors and database programs. It said it is addressing possible concerns of Microsoft Excel spreadsheet customers by making available a patch that avoids the Pentium flaw. Lotus Development also issued instructions for Pentium PC users on how to avoid errors by circumventing the flaw.</p>

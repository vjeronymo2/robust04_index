			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Talks on Ulster to reopen today SIR PATRICK MAYHEW, Northern Ireland secretary, faces a tough meeting with the province's political leaders today that may decide the future of the government's latest attempt to resolve political differences by dialogue. If a dispute between unionist and nationalist leaders over procedure cannot be resolved, Sir Patrick will soon face the choice of imposing his own decision or shelving the five-week-old initiative. A sub-committee set up last week to resolve the differences appears to have made some headway, but it is unclear whether its proposals will be acceptable to party leaders. The row is over when to move from debate on government in the province to the planned second 'strand' of talks - the point at which the Irish government would enter to discuss Northern Ireland's relations with the south. Sir Patrick is expected to be less tolerant of delays than his predecessor, Mr Peter Brooke. He may decide to force the pace - by deciding unilaterally on a date for strand two, for instance - or to suspend the initiative in the hope that it could be revived later. Even if a solution is found, the gloom surrounding the talks is a setback for government hopes that distrust between nationalists and unionists had eased sufficiently for an agreement on new political structures in the province. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two unionist leaders, are understood to be worried at the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party's proposals for giving the Irish government a role in the affairs of Northern Ireland. Many in the SDLP believe the unionists are deliberately delaying progress because of their nervousness about talking to the Irish government.</p>

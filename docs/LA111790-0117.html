			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: USC, UCLA OFFICIALS SEEK PUBLISHERS OF  PARODY  </P> <P> Administrators at USC were searching for the publishers of a sexually explicit  and racist parody of UCLA's Daily Bruin student paper, officials at both  schools said Friday.  </P> <P> The eight-page tabloid was distributed Thursday at USC and on the Westwood  campus.  </P> <P> Staff members of USC's newspaper, the Daily Trojan, said the bogus tabloid may  have been produced by a group led by a former Daily Trojan writer who was  disappointed that the rival schools chose to end the longstanding tradition of  lampooning each other's student papers.  </P> <P> Because of increasingly offensive material published in recent years, students  agreed to cease distributing the mock newspapers, which traditionally appeared  just before the annual UCLA-USC football game, which is today.  </P> <P> Writer bylines and photographer credits in the bogus Bruin contained racial  slurs. Advertisements contained crude references to homosexuals. About 2,000  copies were distributed at each campus.  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japanese low-alcohol tax sinks EC spirits  -Community whisky producers are angry at what they see as further discrimination / Scotch and water has prompted a new trade dispute IN SCOTLAND they tend to drink it straight. In the US they prefer it on the rocks. But in Japan, whisky is usually consumed diluted with water, a custom which has become the focus of a growing controversy with the European Community over anomalies in the Japanese alcohol tax system. Mizuwari, or whisky diluted with water, has become the latest thorn in the side of foreign whisky producers struggling to increase their share of Japan's drinks market amid a persistent slowdown in consumer spending. It has also become a symbol of Japan's continuing reluctance to implement a Gatt recommendation to harmonise its alcohol taxes and remove discrimination against imported drinks. The growing row over mizuwari centres on a move by domestic producers to sell whisky already diluted with water. To help their cause, they have convinced the tax authorities that mizuwari should carry a lower tax burden than full-strength whiskies since it has a lower alcohol content. The EC has been protesting to the Japanese authorities that a low-strength whisky tax not only discriminates against foreign producers, who would not be able to take advantage of it, but is a step backwards in the trend towards alcohol tax harmonisation. Mr Ronald Brown, chairman of the European Business Community Alcohol Committee, points out that in the EC the definition of whisky is that it has to be at least 40 degrees proof. Thus, the lower tax for diluted spirit 'can be construed as discriminatory'. The mizuwari dispute, however, is just the latest example of Japan's failure to live up both to the spirit and the letter of a Gatt recommendation which aims to remove what is seen as discrimination against European products. In 1989, the government amended the country's alcohol tax system but left considerable tax differentials both between imported and domestic spirits and between white and brown spirits. The Japanese market for white spirits, for example, is dominated by a domestic product, shochu. The tax on shochu is Y83 (48p) a litre for high quality shochu and Y46 a litre for low quality. This compares with Y330 (Pounds 1.92) for non-shochu white spirits, most of which is imported. The tax on whisky is Y980 (Pounds 5.73) a litre. 'We are just asking for fair treatment,' says Mr Brown. 'We are not saying we want equal rates, but we want a fair rate. The consumer should choose, based on taste preferences not on tax preferences.' The Japanese government has tried to counter EC pressure to harmonise its alcohol taxes further by pointing to the political difficulty of bringing the tax rate on shochu in line with that on other white spirits. 'At a time when the opposition party controls the lower house (of the Japanese parliament),' says an official at the Finance Ministry, 'it would be politically difficult to raise the tax on a 'people's drink' like shochu.' The Japanese excuse has been that since shochu is made in rural areas it would be politically risky for the governing Liberal Democratic party to introduce steps that might hurt producers. However, the producers of most popular-selling shochu are large corporations. 'It is amazing that Japan continues to believe it is appropriate to protect domestic industry with high taxes,' Mr Brown says. The Japanese government also claims that it would be just as difficult to reduce the tax on other spirits at a time when its revenues have suffered in the economic downturn. As for the lower tax on mizuwari, this is based on the same system used in the EC for taxing drinks with lower alcohol content. 'You have whisky and lemonade, or whisky and ginger ale (in Europe). In Japan, we are going to have whisky with mineral water, so it's the same thing,' according to Mr Kabun Muto, chairman of the Tax System Reformation Promotion Headquarters of the LDP. Since the Japanese government introduced changes in 1989, foreign whisky producers' share of the market has risen from between 8 and 10 per cent to between 23 and 25 per cent. However, their sales in Japan have diminished over the past 12 months as consumer spending has slowed down. Further harmonisation of the tax system is thus seen as an important step towards improving their prospects further in the Japanese drinks market. The EC has said that it will be seeking full implementation of the Gatt recommendation. The only question was when. 'At a time when the trade deficit is running so much in favour of Japan,' says Mr Brown, 'our submission is that this is a very good time.'</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Schools feel the pinch as boarder numbers decline The numbers of boarders in UK schools dropped 5.2 per cent last year as independent schools continued to be squeezed by the recession. Following a fall of 6.2 per cent last year, boarding numbers have now dropped by almost an eighth in two years. However, the Independent Schools Information Service claimed that the figures, which it released yesterday, heralded a 'sooner-than-expected recovery' because the number of day pupils rose 0.1 per cent. Total pupil numbers fell by 0.96 per cent following a drop of 1.5 per cent last year. Mr David Woodhead, director of Isis, said the impact of this month's tax increases on parents' disposable incomes would now be critical to recruitment for next September. He said: 'Tax is one of the great imponderables . . . parents are looking at their choice of schools very pragmatically.' The decline was sharpest in boarding preparatory schools. Among boys there was a drop of 13.4 per cent in 10-year-old boarders from 2,526 to 2,188, while the number of boarding 11-year-olds fell 10.2 per cent to 3,467. Mr Roy Chapman, headmaster of Malvern College and chairman of the Headmasters' Conference, which represents the largest boys' schools, said: 'Boarding schools have to face up to the realities of the marketplace in a way which they've never done before.' He added that in those 'halcyon' days schools had 'leapfrogged' each other to produce new capital developments. Spending on buildings and equipment peaked in 1991. This year it was cut by 9.6 per cent, from Pounds 513 to Pounds 468 per pupil. Rising use of funds from the government's assisted-places scheme, and from school bursaries and scholarships, emphasised the impact of the recession, with 127,522 pupils - 27.3 per cent of the total - receiving some aid. Take-up of the government scheme rose by a further 2.4 per cent, with a record 32,307 pupils now receiving state help. Nursery education was the only significant area of growth, with the number of two-year-olds in independent schools rising 12 per cent from 3,082 to 3,452 while the number of 3-year-olds increased from 9,570 to 10,383. Heavy marketing in the far east and eastern Europe led to a 10 per cent increase in foreign pupils coming to the UK - to a record of 6,422 compared with 5,859 last year. The numbers recruited from continental Europe rose from 1,537 to 1,796, while recruits from the Far East outside Hong Kong increased from 1,140 to 1,261. The drop in numbers occurred in spite of a sharp fall in school fees inflation, which at an average of 2.6 per cent rose less than national average earnings for the first time since the survey began in 1983. But Mr Michael Oakley, chairman of the Independent Schools Bursars' Association, predicted that fees inflation might increase as private schools would feel obliged at least to match the 2.9 per cent pay award for state teachers.</p>

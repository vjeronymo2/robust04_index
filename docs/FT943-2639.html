			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Fashion: Hooked on simple Irish elegance - Jane Mulvagh explains how the under-stated knitwear worn by fishermen inspired a sought-after fashion range Informal elegance these days is elusive, especially since few now pursue the traditional pleasures of field sports which once supplied a panoply of appropriate off-duty ensembles. Modern leisurewear seems polarised between the uniformity of American cotton sportswear and the horrors of the nylon shell suit. But, since more of our time is being spent in casual dress, even in the workplace, perhaps we should look beyond the confines of the locker room and, instead of posing as athletes no matter what our physical condition, find a relaxed informality without sweaty association. Tarlach de Blacam, the owner of Inis Meain Knitwear, offers just such an informal elegance. His knitwear is loosely inspired by the native dress of the Aran Islands' fishing community, some 30 miles from the Galway coast. As long ago as 1907 JM Synge admired the islanders' natural elegance. 'The simplicity and unity of the dress,' he wrote, 'increases in another way the local air of beauty.' De Blacam has tapped both the sense of design and the knitting skills of the people on Aran to create bi-annual collections of knitwear that look as beguiling on a Wall Street banker as on a fisherman. Banish from your mind the notion of chunky, scratchy, shapeless fishermen's jerseys sold in roadside tourist traps. Instead, picture butter-soft alpacas and cashmeres for winter and linen-silk mixes for the summer piled high on the shelves of exclusive department stores, such as Liberty in London or Bergdoff Goodman in New York. Inis Meain Knitwear is worn by discerning men and women from Tokyo to Capri. The colours are inspired by the dry-stone walling on the Aran Islands. Traditionally its men wore natural colours, indigos and slate greys, its women, madder red and navy. To this de Blacam has added the tar-black of the curragh hulls, the infinite blues of the glittering seas, the greeny-browns of its saline weeds, and the myriad hues of the wild and rare flowers - those shy, pointillist specks of colour sheltering from the salty sprays between the limestone shards: gentian-blue, cranesbill purple, stone bramble-vermilion, sea bindweed and mayflower pinks, and the singing yellow of biting stonecrop. De Blacam is a practical dreamer. He has fused the romanticised notions of traditional celtic life, passed down to him by his grandfather, with the opportunities of Japanese computer technology and the harsh financial realities of the fickle fashion market. 'We have enormous disadvantages operating from this place - communications, basic financial services, such as banking are all poor,' he explains. Initially, knitwear was rowed to the mainland on a curragh before being jetted around the world but now de Blacam has brought an aircraft service (1975), as well as electricity (1978) and water (1981) to serve the island's 300 inhabitants. To meet all these costs and make enough profit to keep in business he had to target the top end of the market and go for innovative, high-quality design and rich raw materials. 'But apart from that,' says de Blacam, 'if we just churned out old fishing knits I'd be bored stiff after a week and give up]' De Blacam taps the local skills of 22 employees, mostly women, from whom he culls endless stitches and patterns handed down through the ages. And because he is marketing direct from Inis Meain there is a good opportunity to exploit and romanticise the story of knitting on the Aran Islands. 'But,' he cautions, 'although the romance is a bonus it is the quality that sells the product. The romance is just the sizzle on the sausage.' Initially de Blacam, now in his 40s, was seen as a madman. 'The 1980s was the decade of whizz kids in the big cities. All they wanted was suits and labels. 'They did not know how to dress casually. Believe me, in the 1980s it was difficult to sell our knits. It is only now in the 1990s that people see an alternative way and have become environmentally convinced. Ireland is now seen as very chic. To some extent, my time has come.' Canniness led de Blacam to target the discerning and fashion-sensitive Italian and German markets. 'Selling into Europe is a discipline and I always guessed that if I could sell to them I could sell anywhere. Whereas, in the English-speaking world, because you are Irish and a knitwear manufacturer, you are perceived as ethnic-Irish and your knitwear as bog-standard, so I had to make my name elsewhere.' One myth that de Blacam is keen to dispel is that there is a resistance among these isolated peoples to working in a modern way. Because of the numerous failures among small industries in the west of Ireland, many of which were subsidised by the EC or the Irish government, they are now seen as high-risk areas. 'The workforce is always blamed. But in my opinion it's the management and the sales team who are unable to cope with working from a remote location. The workforce, believe me, is second to none.' De Blacam and his wife and partner, Aine, have, in 20 years, created a company producing 20,000 units a year with an annual turnover of Pounds 1m. In the next year they intend to employ another 15 islanders and have stemmed the tide of emigration. 'We've given the place a sense of belonging and something to contribute to the world. 'The islanders are not a drag on the national or the European exchequer. We make a contribution of about Pounds 100,000 a year to the exchequer and that gives these people great pride and means they can stay where they belong rather than having to go off to look for work. 'This means we can keep our society here better balanced and not, like many Irish villages, filled with just the very young and the very old.' One of the distinguishing features of the fiercely independent islanders is that they were always, despite their poverty, immaculately dressed. Aine, a native islander and niece of the island's poet, says: 'If you look at the photos of the islanders during the numerous famines of the 19th century you see that they were always extremely well turned out compared to the mainland. The women were self-sufficient and made their own clothes with great care and attention. Their menfolk and children always looked well.' Tarlach and Aine have simply tapped into that sartorial pride and, as we pass two fishermen coming from the beach wearing their Inis Meain jerseys, he points out their innate elegance. 'They always go for the subtle, single-colour ones. They know that the jazzy patterns are for the tourists.' And, in turn, these are the very styles that Yohji Yamamoto, the Japanese designer, has chosen for his next boutique collection which will be sold under the I M label. All jacket and cardigans cost between Pounds 180 and Pounds 190, jerseys between Pounds 150 and Pounds 160 and waistcoats between Pounds 110 and Pounds 120. Stockists include: In the UK: Liberty of Regent Street, London W1; Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1; and Simpson, Piccadilly, London W1. US: Bergdoff Goodman, Barneys and Paul Stuart in NYC; Louis in Boston. Italy: Top Ten, Turin; Giusto, Bologna; and Cantorelli, Perugia. Japan: Ginza boutiques in Wako, Tokyo. France: Aberdeen in Deauville and Alain Martiniere, Paris. Ireland: Inis Meain, Aran Islands, Co Galway and Brown Thomas, Dublin.</p>

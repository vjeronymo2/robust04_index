			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Leak reveals plan to axe post offices The Post Office is planning cuts in its branch and sub-post offices in the next five years, according to an internal document leaked yesterday by the Union of Communication Workers. Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, said the paper painted a 'worst-case scenario' that was unlikely to happen because of the government's plans to give the corporation commercial freedom in the private sector. He said the document was prepared earlier in the year to show what would happen if the Post Office did not achieve the commercial freedom it needed to develop. However the union said the document was drawn up in May and sent to Post Office regional managers on August 15, two months after publication of the government's consultative document. Mr Cockburn said some rural sub-post offices were closing because they were too small to run profitably, but added: 'The government's decision to allow post offices to sell a wider range of services has secured the rural network.' He pledged to help open 40 to 50 part-time rural post offices a year. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, backed the Post Office management's desire for commercial freedom in the private sector in a green paper published before the summer break. It set out the government's 'preferred option' of a sale of 51 per cent of the Post Office. A further 10 per cent would go to employees and sub-postmasters. The leaked forecast suggests branch or crown offices would have to be cut from 717 in this financial year to 397 by 1998-1999 with a reduction in the number of sub-post offices from 18,055 in this financial year to 17,005 by the end of the decade. The document says this would ensure Pounds 70m of savings in the next five years. It forecasts a corresponding increase in the number of 'converted' or franchised post offices from 800 to 1,180 in the same period. The union said the figures were a 'recent projection of how the network will shrink if the government's preferred option of break-up and privatisation set out in the green paper on the postal services is introduced'. Mr Cockburn said the document showed that there would be more post offices in five years because of the increase in franchising, which had led to the opening of post offices in supermarkets. He said he would monitor carefully the future of post office franchising on a 'case-by-case, community-by-community basis'.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: New contracts and sales expansion lifts Ushers Ushers, the Wiltshire-based brewer, yesterday published its pathfinder prospectus and reported a 35 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the year to October 31. The pre-tax line rose to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 7.76m) on turnover up 12 per cent to Pounds 54.7m (Pounds 48.8m), as the company attracted new brewing contracts and increased sales of Ushers beers through its estate of 466 pubs. The company, bought from Courage by a team of former Grand Metropolitan managers for Pounds 71m in 1991, is expected to have a market value of about Pounds 100m from the placing and open offer. Mr Roger North, chief executive, said: 'Our work since the buy-in has improved volumes and profits. We have new customers for our contract brewing business and we are making good progress in upgrading the quality of the tied estate.' Operating profit at the brewing and wholesale division rose 20 per cent to Pounds 7.72m (Pounds 6.42m), while the estate division reported operating profit up 8 per cent to Pounds 7.54m (Pounds 6.96m). Ushers' current brewing contract with Courage will fall from 210,000 barrels this year to 50,000 in 1997. The brewer hopes to replace the Courage volume with new contracts, which are expected to rise from 8,000 to 40,000 barrels in the current year. It also hopes to lift sales of Usher brands to its tied estate, where margins are five times higher than the Courage contract. Volumes sold through the estate increased 10 per cent since the company established its own distribution and telesales systems in April. Cash raised by the flotation will be used to clear the brewer's existing debt of Pounds 35m, on which interest rates have been fixed within a band. Interest costs in the year to October 31 stood at Pounds 4.82m (Pounds 5.62m). It will also free the brewer to double its estate of tied pubs, which offer a 21 per cent return on capital. The main shareholders are Schroder Ventures and Swiss Bank Corporation. The directors do not intend to sell their shares, and are likely to own about 8 per cent of the equity after flotation. The share price is expected to be announced on December 1, with dealings beginning on December 15. The flotation is sponsored by NatWest Markets and the broker is NatWest Wood Mackenzie.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Minister to head trade visit in Far East this month MR RICHARD Needham, the trade minister, is to lead a delegation of 25 business executives on a five-day export promotion mission to the far east at the end of the month. This was announced by Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry minister, in the Commons yesterday when pledging full government backing for the efforts of British companies to maximise their share of the world's fastest-growing market. He said South Korea was among the 17 countries to which ministers would be leading trade missions in the next 12 months. Mr Leigh said British exports to China had doubled in the first two months of this year, and Mr Needham, who had been there three times in the last year, was planning an early return visit. Mr Leigh said Britain's share of world trade had stabilised in volume terms after three decades of decline. In the first quarter of this year visible exports to non-EC markets were up 12 per cent on the corresponding period in last year. Giving further details of the reorganisation of the department's export services, Mr Leigh said 30 of the 100 'export promoters' to be seconded by private industry were already in place. This 'infusion of new blood' from the private sector would be of great value to the department in implementing the recent decision to establish two export promotion divisions. Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour spokesman in the debate, suggested that the improved export performance of the last few months was largely attributable to the devaluation of sterling after its exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. Condemning the government's mismanagement of the economy, which had resulted in a Pounds 17bn trade deficit, he warned of the danger of higher interest rates, an overvalued currency and further periods of 'economic gloom and doom'.</p>

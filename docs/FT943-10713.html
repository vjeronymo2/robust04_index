			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Thai refiner valued at Bt25bn Bangchak Petroleum (BCP), the first oil refiner and distributor to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand as part of the country's privatisation programme, was valued at Bt25.32bn (Dollars 1bn) on the first day of trading in the shares yesterday. BCP shares closed at Bt48.50, bettering the initial public offering price of Bt31 but falling from yesterday's high of Bt57 after disappointing second-quarter results. After the flotation, 20 per cent of the shares are held by local and foreign investors, but the government retains control of the company: the finance ministry has 48 per cent, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand 24 per cent and Krung Thai Bank 8 per cent. BCP recently expanded capacity at its refinery in Bangkok to 120,000 barrels a day from 80,000 b/d and is investing aggressively in retail outlets around the country. BCP's latest financial results, however, disappointed investors. Figures released yesterday showed that net profit rose only 6.8 per cent to Bt352.7m in the first half of this year from Bt330.4m a year ago. Stockbrokers blamed heavy interest payments relating to BCP's expansion programme for the lacklustre performance, and said the cash from the initial public offering should reduce debt for the rest of the year. Second-quarter net profit rose to Bt171.7m this year from Bt136.2m a year earlier, suggesting that the company's forecast of more than Bt830m in net profit for the whole year will be attainable only if net earnings improve sharply in the third and fourth quarters.</p>

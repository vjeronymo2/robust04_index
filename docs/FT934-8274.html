			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average declines by 2.3% as region advances THE NIKKEI average lost 2.3 per cent on worries over political reform negotiations, arbitrage selling and unwinding of margin positions, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index was down 418.94 at 18,074.61 after a day's high of 18,506.95 and low of 17,952.20. Volume was 280m shares, against 438m. Weak futures prices triggered a wave of heavy arbitrage-linked selling, which constituted one third of the volume. Declines led gains by 833 to 208, with 123 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 26.42, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,539.65 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.43 to 1,237.71. Traders said many investors were concerned about the prospects of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, achieving a breakthrough in political reform talks with the opposition Liberal Democratic party. 'If the political reform bills do not pass through the lower house in the next few days, there will be a big delay in decision making regarding measures to boost the economy,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Analysts also pointed to the absence of public funds, which had been the main support for share prices until East Japan Railway was listed last month. Mr Makoto Takano, an analyst at Daiwa Research Institute, estimated that the postal insurance and welfare organisation, which invests postal insurance funds for the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, only had around Y600bn (Dollars 5.65bn) left to invest in stocks this fiscal year to March. If public pension fund managers were to place 5 per cent of the market turnover per day, this would only leave 34 to 45 days worth of funds available, he said. JR East weakened Y16,000 to Y462,000, while NTT shed Y26,000 to Y773,000. Railway stocks were lower, with Keisei Electric Railway dropping Y33 to Y896. The yen's rise to the Y105 level against the US dollar prompted selling in export-oriented stocks. Hitachi fell Y13 to Y798 and Sony declined Y80 to Y4,810. Toyota Motor retreated Y20 to Y1,770 and Nikon dipped Y40 to Y830. Banks fell on arbitrage-related selling. Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y50 to Y3,180 and Sakura Bank Y40 to Y1,600. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 317.78 to 20,288.58 in volume of 18.5m shares. Roundup MOST of the region's markets began the week in strong form. HONG KONG established another record close, although profit-taking trimmed gains after the Hang Seng index breached 9,800. The index ended 32.09 higher at 9,733.34, having peaked at 9,825.50 during the early afternoon. The upbeat tone was set by Beijing's vow to speed market-style reform and by hopes that the forthcoming meeting between the Chinese and US presidents will improve links. HK Telecom accounted for the bulk of the index's retreat, ending 40 cents down at HKDollars 16.50, having been 20 cents ahead at one stage. SEOUL finished at a year's high for the fourth consecutive session on the back of an across-the-board buying spree pared only by light profit-taking. The composite stock index added 14.07 at 810.72. Buying interest was strong in heavily weighted financial shares and securities houses, taking the securities sub-index 115.40 higher to 2,748.07, but expensive blue chip manufacturers faced consolidation. TAIWAN set a new five-month closing high, helped by weekend news that the Finance Ministry would allow a further batch of commercial banks to invest in the market. The weighted index advanced 57.91 to 4,329.05 in turnover of TDollars 47.5bn. Foreign institutions were active in the electronics sector, with Acer closing limit up at TDollars 32.10 after last week's news that it was to raise its 1993 profits target by 25 per cent. KARACHI was sharply higher on strong buying of blue chip stocks. The KSE index added 16.74 at 1,717.07, its best level in 23 months. COLOMBO retreated after the recent bull run as foreign investors were unnerved by heavy army losses in last week's Tamil rebel raid. The all-share index relinquished 22.18 to 895.74. KUALA LUMPUR weakened in reaction to continued restrictions on purchases and the lower Tokyo market. The composite index dipped 11.10 to 961.37. SINGAPORE fell on profit-taking, leaving the Straits Times Industrial index 16.45 lower at 2,095.55. MANILA improved, with some interest seen in oil stocks. The composite index rose 18.19 to 2,384.89 in turnover of 1.2bn pesos. AUSTRALIA lost a large proportion of early gains on late profit-taking and the All Ordinaries index finished a net 8.9 up at 2,082.9. Turnover was a thin ADollars 328.4m. Fairfax ended 2 cents down at ADollars 3.17 ahead of announcing a 124 per cent jump in first-quarter profits after the market had closed. NEW ZEALAND fell back as most investors continued to await the final outcome of last week's general election. The NZSE-40 capital index slipped 11.17 to 1,998.71.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurance move questioned THE REVELATION that Transatlantic Holdings, the insurance group owned jointly by Liberty Life of South Africa and UAP, the French insurance group, had increased its holding in Sun Alliance, the composite insurer, to 3.01 per cent, triggered a surge of speculative buying in Sun Alliance. The speculators piled into Sun stock after Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of Transatlantic, described the holding as a 'strategic stake', triggering rumours in the market that this could presage a full takeover bid. Sun Alliance leapt 15 to 350p after heavy turnover of 5m shares. Insurance sector specialists, however, were not wholly convinced that the Transatlantic move was quite so decisive. One leading analyst said that investment groups often declare big stakes in possible targets, without necessarily intending to seek a full-scale takeover. He believed Sun Alliance was not at risk of a takeover, adding that a take-out price for Sun would be between Pounds 3.2bn and Pounds 3.8bn and 'Transatlantic just does not have the funds. And UAP has its own problems with Group Victoire.' Another analyst said the rise in Sun Alliance shares, as well as big gains in other composites, was a reflection of the sector's underperformance in the last month. Other composite insurers followed Sun Alliance higher with dealers adopting the view that even without the bid speculation surrounding Sun Alliance the sector had been oversold during the recent past. Two were among the FT-SE 100's 10 worst performers over the past month, with Royal Insurance down 8.4 per cent and Guardian Royal Exchange down 6.7 per cent. Commercial Union rose 12 to 588p, on 1.5m traded, General Accident were 11 firmer at 582p and Guardians added 3 to 178p. Royal Insurance put on 4 to 289p with the nil-paid rights 5 better at 34p.</p>

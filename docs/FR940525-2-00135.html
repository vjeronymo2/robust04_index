			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=69 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=41 g=1 f=1 -->  <RINDOCK>[Docket No. 50&hyph;397]</RINDOCK> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 -->  <DOCTITLE>Washington Public Power Supply System; WPPSS Nuclear Project No. 2 Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuing an exemption from the requirements of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 in response to a Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) request for the WNP&hyph;2 nuclear plant, located in Benton County, Washington. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action would grant an exemption from the requirement of Section III.D.3 of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J for Type C testing of new containment purge supply and exhaust valves with metallic seats each refueling shutdown. It would extend the maximum interval for Type C testing from 24 months to 27 months for these valves. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's March 25, 1994, exemption request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The licensee needs the proposed exemption because the present requirement forces the licensee to test the new metal-to-metal seated containment purge supply and exhaust valves at least every 24 months. Testing these valves every 27 months does not increase the risk to public health and safety and accommodates the unique WNP&hyph;2 refueling schedule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed exemption would not adversely affect primary containment integrity. Thus, it would not increase the potential for radiological releases to the environment in the event of a severe plant transient or hypothetical accident, including a fuel handling accident or design basis accident. Calculated offsite radiological doses at the plant exclusion boundary and low population zone outer boundary will continue to meet 10 CFR part 100 criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee indicated that industry experience shows the new valves are capable of maintaining design leakage requirements over an extended time. The licensee also indicated that they will require the replacement valves to meet even tighter permissible leakage limits. Extending the maximum allowable interval between tests to 27 months allows for variations in the approximately annual operating cycle length due to weather. Issuing this exemption will not increase accident probability or result in any environmental impacts beyond those evaluated in the WNP&hyph;2 Final Environmental Statement. Therefore, the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing in connection with this action was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14901). No request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any alternative with equal or greater environmental impact does not need to be evaluated since the Commission has concluded that the environmental effects of the proposed action are not significant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce the facility's environmental impact, and would result in a larger expenditure of licensee resources to test containment purge and exhaust valves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not use resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement related to operation of the Washington Nuclear Project, Unit No. 2 dated December 1981. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and consulted the Washington State official. The state official had no comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the March 25, 1994, request for exemption which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 19th day of May 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Theodore R.

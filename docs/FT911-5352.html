			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Shamir plans Palestinian autonomy MR YITZHAK Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, who has come under pressure from the US to help launch Middle East peace negotiations, was reported yesterday to have formulated proposals for Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories. structure of Palestinian ministries similar to Israeli government ministries. The Israeli newspaper Al-Hamishmar reported that Mr Shamir said in an interview to be published in full later this week that the proposals offered the Palestinians more than the autonomy envisaged in the 1987 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt. It held out the possibility of political parties and a Palestinian police force, along with control over a range of affairs from trade to education. Palestinians, who have repeatedly rejected any formula which does not ultimately offer them full independence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, are unlikely to see much new in the proposals. In keeping with his long-standing position, Mr Shamir said he was not offering sovereignty. Foreign affairs, defence and what he described as security would remain under Israeli control. But Mr Shamir, who will meet Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and other European leaders in London this week, when he visits for the inauguration of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, hopes to persuade the US and its allies to accept his plan for limited autonomy, postponing discussion of a final settlement in the territories for at least three years.</p>

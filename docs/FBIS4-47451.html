Studies conducted in  the past few years have demonstrated that capsaicin reacts with  the C-fibers of the autonomic nervous system, facilitates the  removal of substance P from the latter, and thereby lowers a  patient's sensitivity to pain. Capsaicin has also been shown to  affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and smooth  musculature. Toxicity studies have established that capsaicin  has a DL[.sub]50[/] of 1.1 to 120 mg/kg, guinea pigs being  most sensitive to it (DL[.sub]50[/] = 1.1 mg/kg) and hamsters  being least sensitive to it (DL[.sub]50[/] &gt;  120 mg/kg). Its  toxicity is highest when injected intravenously [IV] and lower  when administered rectally or applied cutaneously. Three minutes  after IV injection into Sprague-Dawley rats, capsaicin is  already detectable in their brain, spinal cord, and liver in  amounts several times higher than in their blood. When injected  subcutaneously, capsaicin reaches its maximum levels in the  tissues and blood after 5 hours. After 48 hours, rats that had  received capsaicin in doses of 20 mg/kg had excreted 8.7 percent  unchanged and in the form of eight metabolites. Capsaicin has a  lasting antinociceptive effect. When administered in an aerosol  (2-5 mol/l), capsaicin stopped coughing in test subjects  without altering the depth or frequency of respiration. When  used as an inhalant, it has been shown to increase the minute  volume and average frequency of respiration. In anesthetized  dogs, capsaicin injected IV in doses of 10 to 300 mg/kg has  induced a short-term increase in mean arterial pressure followed  by a long-term decrease. Its hypotensive effect in dogs and  rabbits has been attributed to cholinergic mechanisms but not  linked to any effect on the heart. Capsaicin has also induced  relaxation of an isolated band of porcine coronary artery that  was accompanied by hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle only  in the presence of endothelium and has had various effects on  isolated segments of guinea pig ileum depending on the  concentration in which it was administered. Capsaicin's main  targets are the central and peripheral nervous systems. When  injected intraperitoneally into guinea pigs in doses of 0.125 to  0.15 mg, it attenuates behavioral responses to irritants in  areas such as the eye and nose. Practical application of  capsaicin is based on its predominant reaction with the  peripheral receptors of formations of sensory nerves. It is  highly selective, and it maintains its stimulating properties  when diluted to concentrations as low as 1:11,000,000.  References 31: 1 Russian, 30 Western.</p>

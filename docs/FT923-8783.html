			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Third day's fall in NTT shares hits Nikkei ANOTHER drop in Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone (NTT) dampened sentiment, prompting selling in other leading blue chips, and the Nikkei average closed sharply lower, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei fell 408.17 to 15,518.27, down 2.5 per cent on both the day and the week. It opened at the day's high of 15,882.08 and fell steadily as dealers unloaded speculative stocks, slipping to a low of 15,451.32 just before the close. Activity remained dull, with 180m shares changing hands against 185m. Declines led advances by 897 to 58, with 88 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks lost 26.09 points to 1,181.23 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.76 to 959.52. NTT posted its third consecutive fall, losing Y42,000, or 7.6 per cent to a new all-time low of Y509,000. Traders said that individual investors who had bought NTT on margin were liquidating holdings due to margin calls. Short-selling by investors who expect a further fall in NTT has also driven the shares lower. Many investors hoped that the government's lifting of the ban on foreign ownership of NTT shares would prompt foreign buying, but they have been disappointed by the lack of response. 'The stock is still too expensive, and the yield is too low to be attractive to foreigners,' said Mr Craig Chudler at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Traders added that speculators, who faced margin calls on positions in 'theme' stocks, were liquidating high-priced NTT shares to generate cash. Meanwhile, dealers sold off holdings in speculative issues. Meiji Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, fell Y31 to Y765 and Okamoto Industries, lost Y39 to Y901. High-technology blue chips were lower on small-lot selling. Hitachi fell Y18 to Y740 and Fujitsu lost Y8 to Y557. Meanwhile, large capital issues lost ground on institutional selling, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries falling Y21 to Y504 and Nippon Steel down Y2 at Y264. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 532.43 to 16,947.11, below 17,000 for the first time since October 1986. Volume rose to 18.6m shares from 17.3m. Roundup DECLINES in cautious trading were the general rule of thumb in the Asia Pacific region yesterday. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index lost 42.9 at one stage on an interim loss at Hutchison Whampoa, but it finished well off the day's lows on bargain-hunting in selected blue chips. It closed 14.34 lower on the day, and 0.5 per cent down on the week, at 5,850.93. Hang Seng Bank rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 55.50 ahead of next Thursday's interims. Turnover improved from HKDollars 1.87bn to HKDollars 2.19bn. AUSTRALIA also closed above its lows, as weekend bargain-hunting left the All Ordinaries index only 1.9 down at 1,586.7, 1.9 per cent lower on the week. Golds rose 4.1 to 1,154.3 after bullion held above its resistance level of USDollars 348 an ounce in Hong Kong. NEW ZEALAND felt the weight of the share price slump at Fletcher Challenge, which ended another 14 cents lower at a six year low of NZDollars 2.82. The NZSE-40 index ended 11.97 lower at 1,543.35. SEOUL fell back below the 500 mark despite a government announcement of market-boosting measures which boosted prices. The composite index shed 4.82 to 495.22, down 2.9 per cent on the week, in turnover of Won133.3bn. TAIWAN fell in cautious trading, as the weighted index closed 39.88 down at 4,082.90, down 0.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was thin at TDollars 19.2bn. SINGAPORE regained some lost ground after its recent losing streak. The Straits Times Industrial Index rose 7.76 to 1,424.59 in volume of 40.94m shares. KUALA LUMPUR's composite fell 1.16 to 597.11, down 0.7 per cent on the week. BOMBAY rebounded 61.09 or 2.4 per cent to 2,590.68 on institutional buying.</p>

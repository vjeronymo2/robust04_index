			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BENGALS' WILSON SUSPENDED FOR LIFE  </P> <P> Stanley Wilson, the Cincinnati running back suspended for drug use on the eve  of the Super Bowl, was permanently banned from the NFL today for his continuing  substance abuse problem.  </P> <P> The action amounts to a lifetime ban for the 27-year-old Wilson, who had also  missed the 1985 and 1987 seasons because of drug problems and is being treated  at a Phoenix clinic.  </P> <P> League spokesman Joe Browne said, however, that it is possible he could apply  for reinstatement if he presents evidence of his rehabilitation.  </P> <P> "In view of Wilson's history, this permanent ban can't come as a surprise to  him," Browne said.  </P> <P> Under the NFL's drug policy, a player who fails a drug test once is not  suspended but can be tested regularly for cause. If he fails again, he is  suspended for 30 days; a third failure means a permanent ban with the option to  reapply for reinstatement after a year.  </P> <P> Browne would not say, however, if Wilson's suspension resulted from the drug  policy or from conditions given him in April, 1988, when he was reinstated  after agreeing to what the league called "certain conditions." Bengals coach  Sam Wyche said the day of Wilson's Super Bowl suspension: "Part of the  situation coming into the season was that it was a final chance."  </P> <P> Wilson began last season as Cincinnati's starting fullback but injured a knee  and lost the job.  </P></p>

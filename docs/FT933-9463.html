			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Harrods rebuffs prison's cheese JUST AS THE government's programme to involve the private sector in Britain's prisons had recovered from jokes about prisoners escaping when transported by security companies, it yesterday ran into another potential embarrassment. About cheese. Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, last week launched an innovative scheme at East Sutton Park prison, Kent, where women inmates have been trained in cheesemaking. They are producing mozzarella and ricotta which will be marketed by Mr Edgardo Pasquali, a private-sector partner of the Prison Service, through his company Mama Mia. At the inauguration of the scheme Mr Pasquali said products would go to 'only the best' outlets, including many leading London stores, hotels and restaurants. But Harrods, one of the up-market outlets named by Mr Pasquali, asserted yesterday: 'We do not stock this cheese and it is unlikely that we will do so.' Mr Pasquali, whose enthusiasm for the quality of the cheese being produced by the prisoners is evident, remained convinced yesterday that few suppliers will be able to resist stocking it. But he admitted that it remained a matter for negotiation. Mr Pietro Pesce, whose company Danmar has been asked to handle the distribution of the cheeses in central London, said yesterday that he had just returned from holiday and had not yet discussed final arrangements with Mr Pasquali. Mr Pesce said: 'Harrods and many other leading London outlets are customers of ours, and are the sort of suppliers we would offer the cheese to. It is a good, locally produced product and I am sure they would wish to consider it. But obviously we cannot force any customer to take a particular product.' The Prison Service says many checks were made before it entered into the partnership. 'We are satisfied that the product is good and the venture is a sound one,' it said. One of the intentions of the project is to help prepare prisoners for future employment. Yesterday's developments suggest that skills learned on the scheme might extend far beyond cheesemaking into the complex world of negotiations between producers, distributors, retailers and public and private-sector partners.</p>

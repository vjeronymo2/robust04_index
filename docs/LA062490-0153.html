			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVES ON L.A. ARCHITECTURE;  </P> <P> DO THE 'ART POLICE' HAVE A ROLE?;  </P> <P> THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO MORE PLACE DICTATING THE AESTHETICS OF PRIVATE BUILDINGS  THAN TELLING A PAINTER WHAT STYLE TO USE.  </P> <P> President Bush, sitting a few months ago in the Roosevelt Room of the White  House, praised American architecture, saying, "Its rich variety of styles and  regional differences is as diverse and as dynamic as the American people  themselves; the spirit of our country can be seen in our architecture."  </P> <P> This admirable spirit is under siege in Los Angeles. City Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky is among those rejecting a proposed building in his district purely  on his dislike of the architectural design, saying, "We have a right to be  involved in the design review process, because we are the ones who have to look  at the building for the rest of our lives, onceit's up."  </P> <P> The councilman has it wrong. Government-controlled art and architecture are a  disaster for any community or nation. Germany produces some of today's best  architects, but it took decades to recover from the Third Reich's bombastic  "Aryan" art dictates and oppression of the free, creative spirit.  </P> <P> Even in a democracy, a strong group can beguile and mesmerize a public that is  already beset by fears that high density of development and freeway traffic  jams are ruining the quality of life. Such groups have the answer: Interfere  with development, file lawsuits, make it expensive and eventually the project  will go away. The owner grows disgusted and gives up; at the least the building  will be delayed indefinitely.  </P> <P> Many tools are available to the zealot; but here we are only interested in the  government's role in dictating, prescribing and approving the aesthetic design  of privately owned buildings.  </P> <P> The city's design review board process was established to interfere in just the  wrong ways. Since aesthetic judgment is subjective, the zealot on the board can  object to any project he or she wishes, often disregarding vested rights.  </P> <P> And why do the design review boards (appointed by the City Council) even exist?  Because some true travesties have been built: developments that should never  have been allowed because of their impact on the neighborhoods. However, they  should have been prevented because of their negative social impact and not  because of the subjective judgment of some people who disliked a particular  design.  </P> <P> It is not possible to legislate excellence or beauty in buildings, just as it  is not possible to legislate excellence in the fine arts -- or even in  politics. What can be legislated is careful planning. Clear land-use and  development standards are designed to protect the interest of the public: the  health and welfare of society. This must be done by updating the city's General  Plan and its individual community plans -- not over the next 10 to 15 years,  but now.  </P> <P> But while protecting the public, these planning laws must not control the  thinking and the product of the design community.  </P> <P> Free the designers and Los Angeles will develop an eclectic style that reflects  its heterogenous, multi-ethnic history and composition. Aesthetics is simply  not the politicians' arena.  </P> <P> Will we still end up with some "bad" building designs? Of course. Will we also  produce some extraordinary building designs? Absolutely, because no art police  will be standing by to pull the designer down to the lowest common denominator.  The designs that emerge will create urban beauty that reflects this era, these  times; it will be the truest reflection of our society and civilization.  </P> <P> Los Angeles can display its boundless creative energy, fashioned in a  democratic society rather than the rigid and one-dimensional order of an  autocratic system of government, or of one councilman's concept of "beauty."  </P></p>

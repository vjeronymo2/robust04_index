			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 Feb (MENA)--A ranking Libyan diplomatic  source in Cairo has denied that Libya is any way connected to  the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'aytah in  Lebanon recently.    The source said in statements today that Libya condemns  terrorism in all its forms and that it has cut off all relations  with any groups that follow a course of violence instead of  dialogue and peaceful negotiations. He denied the presence of  Abu-Nidal's [Sabri al-Banna] group on Libyan territory. He also  denied that any Libyan officials had met with any members or  leaders belonging to Abu-Nidal's group recently.    The Libyan source believes that raising Libya's name in  relation to the assassination of the Jordanian diplomat, as some  newspaper reports have done, is an attempt to sour  Jordanian-Libyan relations, especially during this phase of  peace. He stressed Libya's interest in its relations with  Lebanon.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Petrochemicals under pressure in South Korea SOUTH Korea's petrochemical companies are seeing a contraction of their profits in spite of expanding capacity and a high level of exports, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. The Trade and Industry Ministry said Korean companies exported petrochemicals worth Dollars 1.1bn in the first five months of this year, a rise of 82 per cent from Dollars 605m for the same period in 1991. The ministry hoped petrochemical exports would reach Dollars 2.4bn in 1992. However, according to a preliminary study by Daewoo Securities, many companies, including Hanyang Chemicals and Lucky, were expected to report only small increases or a fall in earnings for the first half of the year, even though their sales were expected to rise by about 10 per cent. Dongbu Chemicals was expected to report a loss, said Mr Lee Bong-shik, a manager at Daewoo Securities. A supply glut has forced companies to cut prices of some products to half the previous year's levels. To compete with low-cost south-east Asian producers, Korean companies have been shipping products at prices which cover only essential costs. Korean petrochemical companies ship 80 per cent of their exports to the south-east Asian region, where many petrochemical plants are under construction. But other south-east Asian countries are expected to restrain imports to protect their fledgling industries.</p>

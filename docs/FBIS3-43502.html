It seems President Eyadema was a prime  target for the guerrillas but escaped with his life. Sporadic  firing went on for much of yesterday. The Togo authorities  claim that the raiders came across the border from neighboring  Ghana but did not point a finger directly at any opposition  group or the Ghana Government.    But yesterday there was shooting along the border and the  Togo Government has now issued an angrily worded statement. On  the line to Lome, Alex Martin asked our correspondent Ebow  Godwin what the statement says:    [Begin recording] [Ebow] Well, the Togolese authorities have  been accusing Ghana of acts of flagrant aggression. They say  that a group of armed men including Ghanaian soldiers yesterday  evening opened fire on the Togo border post along the Aflao  border with Ghana, and that they also opened fire on Togolese  soldiers but they asked their soldiers not to return fire, in  order to avoid what could have been a bloody confrontation. A  government communique was issued by Togo's minister for foreign  affairs, Ouattara Fambare Natchaba. He said that Togo has  actually lodged official protest with the Ghanaian charge  d'affaires in Togo and asked for explanation.    [Martin] Has anyone else been saying anything?    [Ebow] Well, according to the Togolese authorities the  Ghanaian charge d'affaires has denied Ghanaian involvement in  the incident. Well, Mr. Kokou Koffigoh has come out today to  confirm the incident -- the border incident -- and says that  Togo has taken notice of Ghana's denial but has appealed to the  Ghanaian authorities to match their words with action and  comportment because Togo desires to live in peace with her  neighbors.    [Martin] But according to other reports, there was fighting  precisely last night from 10 o'clock onwards along the border  near the security post. What explains the extent of fighting?    [Ebow] As at now, I have no evidence of any extensive  fighting along the border. What I know of is that the Togolese  authorities, especially the security forces, have been mounting  a manhunt for fleeing fugitives -- for those who took part in  armed attack against Togo. Reports say that some of them are  hiding in houses along the Togolese side of the border and they  are looking for opportunity to slip into Ghana. There have been  a lot of shooting along the Togolese side of the frontier but I  am not aware of any heavy fighting between Togo or Togolese  soldiers and any other combatants. [end recording]    Every time there is trouble in Togo it seems the finger gets  pointed at Ghana with veiled, or as in this case not so veiled  allegations. On the line to Accra, Alex Martin asks Foreign  Minister Obed Asamoah if Ghana was involved in the latest  trouble:    [Begin recording] [Asamoah] As far as we are concerned there  is nothing yet to confirm that indeed any persons crossed from  Ghana to Togo. If you consider the intensity of the fighting,  it would be difficult not to ascribe the fighting to internal  divisions within the military in Togo.    [Martin] It does seem very likely however that elements  opposed to the government of President Eyadema could have  crossed over the border from Ghana?    [Asamoah] Well, we do not have any evidence pointing to that  at the moment. And I do not want to speculate on that.    [Martin] Is it possible that there are small training camps  hidden along the border for opposition to President Eyadema's  government to train supporters to launch this kind of attack?    [Asamoah] There is no such thing as far as I know.    [Martin] What about the Togolese refugees who are based in  camps in Ghana. Do you think these could be hotbeds of defense  to President Eyadema's government? [sentence as heard]    [Asamoah] You know, the refugee camps are open places, I  mean, along the main roads. Anybody can walk in there. And,  you know, I cannot imagine that these camps are training camps  for any dissidents. I do not think anything of that nature is  going on in those refugee camps.

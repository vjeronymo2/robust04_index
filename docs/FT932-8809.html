			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Prospect of 25% payout for Payroll creditors SOME OF London's leading financial institutions stand to retrieve a quarter of the Pounds 25.3m they lost last year when Payroll Services went into liquidation, having failed to forward their clients tax and national insurance contributions to the Inland Revenue. The first instalment follows a novel agreement between 388 of the 390 creditor banks and agreed in the High Court. Clifford Chance, the law firm, and Touche Ross, the joint liquidators, believe they have established new precedent in the way that liquidations are carried out. Touche Ross estimates the voluntary agreement has saved up to three quarters of a million pounds in professional and liquidation costs. The agreement will give creditors a much earlier sight of their share of the claim than would have been possible under a normal liquidation, which would usually involve legal procedures against the insolvent company. Lord Justice Parker, ruling on May 10, gave the two financial institutions which have not supported the agreement 28 days in which to object. The SFO is investigating Payroll Services and allegations of misappropriation of client funds. Payroll Services was supposed not only to pay its clients' employees - which failure to do so would have led to early detection - it was also supposed to forward PAYE and national insurance contributions to the Inland Revenue. It is believed some of the missing money went into property investments. The financial institutions leading the liquidation committee and among the more significant creditors are;- Credit Agricole, Creditanstalt, Yamaiichi Sakura Finance and Cantor Fitzgerald. Touche Ross said it could not say at this stage how much of the balance of the missing funds will be retrieved for creditors and when.</p>

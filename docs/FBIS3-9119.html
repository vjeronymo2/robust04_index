			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kazimierz Dziewanowski under the "Always on </F> Saturday" rubric: "A Few Useful Lessons"]    [Text] Prime Minister Pawlak's unexpected trip to Moscow  caused quite a lot of confusion. So I would like to make a few  remarks on the topic of that visit; these remarks will deal with  some very important issues.    Remark Number One: Contrary to some other  journalists, it is not my view that the customs duties declared  by the Russians (immediately after the visit) on many goods  exported by Poland were intended to be a deliberate affront to  the prime minister. These customs duties had been announced  before, so the concurrence of the two events is merely a  coincidence. But, as people surrounding the prime minister  argued, if an improvement of the situation of Polish trade with  the East was the main purpose of the visit, one must say that  the situation is worse than it was before; ergo, the visit's  main goal was not achieved.    Remark Number Two: That disadvantageous effect  was caused by a few serious things. First is the false view,  which is shared by a few of the prime minister's advisers,  several members of the government, and some Sejm deputies, that  Poland's problems in its trade with the East are due to mistakes  in policies committed by previous governments. That view is  proof of ignorance of the real situation by those who espouse it  and of their certain political pigheadedness, which it never  pays to go by. It is enough to familiarize oneself with the  problems faced by Finland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany,  France, and many other countries in their trade with Russia to  be able to assess how true that argument really is. Our trade  with Russia suffers from problems primarily due to Russia's  economic collapse and the inability of the Russian financial  system to service commercial activities. So one must look for  ways to improve trade settlements between our two countries, but  the visit did not result in any progress in this field.    Remark Number Three: The trip was poorly  prepared. It is a trivial thing to say that the prime minister  of a country should not go on a trip to a country as important  as Russia, whose relations with us have recently become quite  difficult, if the signing of some minor protocols is to be the  visit's only result. The point is that, if a trip is not well  prepared or thought through, then, as a net result, it creates  the impression of deterioration (which may not be justified)  instead of bringing about an improvement.    Remark Number Four: Every country in the world  tries to avoid conveying the impression that its authorities are  conducting several foreign policies that are independent and  uncoordinated with one another. But that is exactly the kind of  impression one is bound to have when the president learns from a  television report about an important foreign trip by the prime  minister. The point is neither in stressing pragmatic rules of  bureaucracy and official behavior nor rules of courtesy that,  after all, are indispensable and worth observing. The real  point is that, when you have an official guest visiting a grand  capital and the hosts can see that the guest failed to come to  an agreement over the visit with other forces in his country,  his position is weak and his credibility shaky. If elements of  domestic infighting among different political parties become  visible on the international level, it is the country itself  that is harmed the most, but participants in these games are not  strengthening their positions, either. On the contrary, they  lose prestige, both domestically and internationally. Such are  the iron and permanent principles in the arena of international  politics, which are observed by all experienced players. One  must say with sorrow here that the rules have been violated by  Poland a few times in the past. The results of that are always  disastrous.    One Final Remark: Russian customs duties show  that customs duties are a double-edged sword. Those in Poland  who persistently speak in favor of protective customs duties  ought to keep in mind that we are not living in a vacuum. It is  no accident that the most reasonable politicians and economists  around the world are in favor of the gradual elimination of  customs barriers, or that the GATT agreement was signed, or that  wars over customs duties and trade issues are regarded as  considerably harmful. Poland, in turn, is a country that should  be very eager to develop its exports.    So we received several useful lessons this past week. Now  the point is for us to get them into our heads, and fast.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Observer: Small print Christopher Fell, a retired pharmacist and keen FT reader with a life-long interest in basic economics, makes a helpful suggestion as to why the current generation of Tory politicians may be getting into hot water over illegitimate children; it is in fact the fault of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. Fell points out that the dictionary only carried entries for 'condom' and 'French letter' in the 1983 addendum of the 1973 edition. 'By that time most ministers had finished their education and were in politics . . .' So John Major's emphasis on education in his back to basics message has a private morality spin after all.</p>

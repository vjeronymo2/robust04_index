			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Partisans prepare for guerrilla campaign: Mountain conflict 'could spark unrest throughout north Caucasus' If Russia's troops try to take Grozny by force they risk being drawn into a protracted guerrilla war in Chechnya's mountainous terrain which could spark unrest throughout the Islamic peoples of the north Caucasus, Chechen resistance fighters say. In a village outside Grozny, Mr Ayub Khansulatov, a 30-year-old Chechen who is carefully placing pins into a set of hand grenades, says: 'We have to get ready.' Pointing to a stash of armour-piercing rockets, machine guns and Kalashnikov rifles lying a few feet away, he adds: 'These are for Yeltsin.' As Moscow's ultimatums to the Chechen people expire, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of partisans like Mr Khansulatov are preparing to wage a guerrilla war. Along the roads out of Grozny are groups of fighters dressed in full battle gear huddling round fires of burning tyres to keep warm in the sub-zero temperatures. 'I have been ready to fight for a week but now we have been ordered to take to the mountains and fight a guerrilla war,' Mr Khansulatov says, boasting of his skirmishes with Russian troops. Many of Grozny's 400,000 inhabitants have already left for the mountains to the south. On Chechen television, bearded soldiers urge the rest of the population to leave the town to the troops. They say the crowds of civilians, which have been mobbing Russian forces to persuade them to turn back, should move out of the way of fighting. One soldier reads from an instruction manual indicating the most vulnerable points of a tank. Mr Khansulatov says his detachment of 150 men would fight for as long as it took to make the Russians leave. He says he has already moved his wife and three children to seek shelter in the south. 'I have taken my belongings to the mountains. If I die, my son will get them,' he says, standing in his house bare of all furniture except two beds, a load of weapons, and a television and video recorder on which he plays a tape of his brother's wedding celebrations. 'Why cannot they let us live in peace. You see how good life can be?'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Alfredo Saenz [chairman of Banesto]  speaking today in the Congress of Deputies, the sale of  Banesto's stake in media companies will "generate losses."    Banesto's chairman confirmed that negotiations for selling  Banesto's stake in Antena 3, Grupo Zeta, and Tele 5 are under  way with Bankers Trust. The American bank will not be  responsible for the sale of EL MUNDO and EPOCA.    According to Saenz, the Banesto corporation "does not  correspond to what an industrial group should be" and until  definitive data is available, its 1993 loses may amount to  120,000 million pesetas.</p>

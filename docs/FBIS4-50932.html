			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 24 KYODO -- Two inspectors from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Beijing on  Tuesday [24 May] for Pyongyang where they will join three other  inspectors monitoring the ongoing refueling of a North Korean  nuclear reactor.    Delegation leader Perricos Demetrius said that technical  discussions with North Korean officials are expected to last two  to four days and that all five IAEA inspectors hope to be coming  out together.    The three-member IAEA team arrived in Pyongyang last week  and  immediately reported that refueling of the 5-megawatt Yongbyon  experimental nuclear reactor had begun.    It is widely believed that discussions will center on  allowing the IAEA to inspect and measure fuel rods in order to  ascertain whether or not any fuel has been diverted to a  suspected nuclear weapons program.    The arrival of the two IAEA inspectors coincides with  renewed  talks at the United Nations in New York concerning the 15-month  nuclear impasse between the U.S. and North Korea.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / BA profits fall 80% to Pounds 20m in third quarter BRITISH Airways' pre-tax profits fell 80 per cent to Pounds 20m in the third quarter compared with Pounds 100m in the same period last year. The sharp decline was largely caused by the significant depreciation of sterling following Britain's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. This alone accounted for more than half of the Pounds 80m profit fall. The third quarter performance was at the top end of City expectations. Analysts had forecast earnings anywhere between a Pounds 20m profit to a Pounds 20m loss. BA shares closed 3p lower at 276p. Although passenger traffic on scheduled services rose 7.3 per cent to 6.18m passengers, the increase fell short of the airline's capacity in the third quarter. Sir Colin Marshall, BA chairman, also said traffic growth was concentrated on lower yielding economy passengers, with demand for high yielding first and business class tickets below last year's levels. Passenger yields fell by 4.9 per cent, reflecting fares wars in the airline industry as well as the continuing trend of passengers trading down from first and business class to economy class. However, Sir Colin said that the benefits of the weak pound were beginning to show through and 'sound progress continues in the cost reduction programme'. But he also warned that trading conditions remained difficult and that the fourth quarter was traditionally the weakest of the year. Group turnover rose by 4.5 per cent to Pounds 1.37bn in the third quarter compared with Pounds 1.31bn the year before. Operating profits fell 36.9 per cent to Pounds 70m from Pounds 111m in the third quarter, while after-tax profits dropped 51.2 per cent to Pounds 40m from Pounds 82m the previous year. Earnings per share in the quarter were 5.1p on a fully diluted basis, down 48 per cent. Pre-tax earnings for the first nine months of the year were 13 per cent lower at Pounds 247m, compared with Pounds 285m the year before. After-tax profits for the first nine months totalled Pounds 222m compared with Pounds 234m the year before. Earnings per share were 26.5p on a fully diluted basis. After funding capital expenditure, there was a net cash outflow of Pounds 183m in the first nine months compared with a cash inflow of Pounds 399m the year before. The group wrote off Pounds 48m of the cost of taking over Dan-Air, the former Gatwick-based airline, against reserves. Lex, Page 18</p>

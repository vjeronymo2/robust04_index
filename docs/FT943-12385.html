			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Business treads warily across Quebec divide: Concern that a likely separatist campaign after poll may be bad for economy The head of a Canadian think-tank offered a word of advice at a recent dinner party to the new public relations chief of a Toronto mining company: Make sure, he said, that your chairman keeps his mouth shut on Quebec. The election in the francophone province, called by Premier Daniel Johnson for September 12, will have a profound impact on Canada's business climate. The question of what role business leaders should play in the campaign and in the period after the poll has become a pressing issue in executive suites. The separatist Parti Quebecois is now well ahead of the ruling Liberals in opinion polls. The PQ has promised if it wins it will hold a sovereignty referendum within a year. Polls show that a clear majority of Quebecois do not favour independence. Their support for the PQ appears to be based mainly on the desire for a change in government after nine years of Liberal rule. Nevertheless, a PQ government can be expected to step up the pressure to wrest more powers from the federal government in Ottawa and to create as many trappings of sovereignty as possible. Mr Jacques Parizeau, the PQ leader, responded to the election call by pledging to end Quebec's participation in efforts to overhaul Canada's social security system and other federal initiatives which require the provinces' co-operation. The PQ's interventionist economic platform, which has so far received little attention on the hustings, has also raised concerns in business circles. Mr Parizeau has said that he plans to make fiscal discipline a lower priority than economic growth. Measures to contain the budget deficit are expected to centre on higher taxes rather than spending restraint. Uncertainty over Quebec's future has already had an unmistakable economic cost. Interest rates have risen more sharply in Canada than the US this year. Investor nervousness is especially evident in the provincial bond market. Medium-term Quebec bonds offer a yield 92 basis points (92/100ths of 1 per cent) higher than equivalent government of Canada bonds. The spread on bonds issued by neighbouring Ontario is only 45 points. Business leaders worry that a PQ victory could cloud the investment climate for years to come as the independence debate rages on. Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman of Bombardier, the Montreal-based transport equipment maker, told his company's annual meeting last month that the PQ's agenda 'will bring with it high risks of skidding, of numerous setbacks (and) of confrontation within Quebec, and between Quebec and its partners'. Fears of political and economic paralysis in the run-up to an independence referendum are likely to feature prominently in the Liberals' campaign over the next seven weeks. Mr Beaudoin added that 'those of us who believe that by choosing (sovereignty) Quebeckers are taking the wrong direction should now express their opinion publicly.' Few have heeded his call so far. Indeed, corporate chiefs in Toronto and other parts of English-speaking Canada think that following Mr Beaudoin's advice may do their cause more harm than good. Mr Tom D'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues, which represents the chief executives of Canada's 150 biggest companies, says that 'outside involvement in the debate on the election issues would not be terribly productive, and could be counter-productive'. While BCNI members 'are doing our homework, we're doing it quietly'. Separatists have in the past skilfully turned warnings about the cost of independence to their advantage by accusing big business of blackmailing and frightening Quebecois. The most celebrated example took place in 1992 at the height of a referendum campaign on the Charlottetown Accord, a package of constitutional changes that were designed to mend fences between Quebec and the other nine provinces. Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, was vilified in Quebec for releasing a study which concluded that 'political disunity' could slash Canada's gross domestic product by 18 per cent within eight years and shrink incomes by an average of CDollars 4,000 (Pounds 1,869) a person. Mr Beaudoin's outspokenness is even the exception in the clubby world of Quebec business and politics, where pressure in the francophone community to stand together against outsiders is strong. Tactics are likely to change however, if and when a PQ government sets a referendum campaign in motion. 'The home-town team now, the national team later,' says Mr D'Aquino. The risk is that once a separatist government is installed in Quebec City, the momentum towards a breakaway will become more difficult to stop.</p>

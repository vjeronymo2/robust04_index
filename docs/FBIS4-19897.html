			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 24 (A.A) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin denied on Sunday [24 April] claims of some newspapers that  he and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller had a disagreement on the  Cyprus issue.    Answering questions of the press in the airport, before  departing for Azerbaijan, Cetin said that the prime minister had  called him this morning. `The P.M. called me this morning and  said that she and U.S. President Bill Clinton had not talked  about Cyprus during their tete-a-tete meeting in Washington,' he  said. During their telephone conversation, Premier Ciller also  wanted the foreign minister to tell her the details of a daily's  report on Saturday who quoted U.S. President Bill Clinton saying  that he and Ciller had discussed the Cyprus issue and that  Ciller promised him to resolve the matter soon. `We have  already reviewed the issue and found out that Clinton has not  said these words,' Cetin said.    He added that the Cyprus coordinator of the U.S. state  department, Robert Lamb, had called the Turkish Embassy in  Washington and briefed the embassy on the talks made between  Clinton and Greek Premier Papandreou in his presence. `I  reviewed these minutes and could not find anything which would  yield such a meaning,' Cetin said.    Cetin pointed out that all these rumors were a result of the  distortions of the Greek press. `I know it from my own  experience that the Greek press distorts my own statements from  time to time,' he said.    Cetin recalled that Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  President Rauf Denktas and Turkey had initially accepted in  principle, the confidence-building measures formulated by the UN  secretary general. `However,' he said, `additions made to the  package, which can be categorized under four broad groups, are  all giving certain advantages to the Greek Cypriots and TRNC  President Denktas, rightfully has said that this was not the  original package. `Turkey has supported the stand of Denktas.'    The second package, proposed by the UN on March 21 as a  `non-document document' gives the control of roads leading to  Maras [Varosha] to the UN, gives the control of customs to a UN  official in Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport and Maras, limits Turkish  planes using the Lefkose Airport and gives other priorities to  Greek Cypriots.    The original package of July 1993, had foreseen to open the  Lefkose Airport to international traffic and to place the  uninhabited Maras section of the TRNC to the UN monitoring.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading A late afternoon rally in government bonds helped stock index futures close off the day's low point after the March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index crashed through another support level, writes Joel Kibazo. The reading on the March contract on the FT-SE 100 at the official close of trading was 3,323, having earlier reached a low for the session of 3,302. A setback in bond markets, together with an uncertain outlook on domestic interest rates, reversed an initial advance in the contract. A trader said that 'the contract was relentlessly sold down for most of the morning' and it fell through the 3,340 support level. At one stage it recorded an 18-point discount to the underlying cash market, which followed it lower over the lunchtime period. The keenly awaited speech from the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, which helped to lift the bonds out of the doldrums, brought bargain hunters for the contract, helping to reduce earlier losses. March was at a 7-point discount to cash at the finish. Volume at the official close was 17,231 lots. Activity in traded options improved and turnover rose to 47,384 contracts, of which 23,473 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 5,703 in the Euro FT-SE option. Guinness was the busiest stock option at 2,481 contracts dealt. In the FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract on the OMLX, volume was 140 lots.</p>

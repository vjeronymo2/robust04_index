			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: WestLB takes stake in Kiel bank WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank, the state bank for North-Rhein-Westphalia, with the Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, its Baden-Wurtemmberg associate, will take a 49.9 per cent stake in the Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein in Kiel, it was announced yesterday. The move is the latest in a protracted bout of rationalisation within the German public banking sector which has been lent added complexity by a scramble to take over the state banking functions for the new Lander, or states, in the eastern part of Germany. No price was given for the deal, which has been expected in one form or another for some months. The shape of the final agreement was surprising, however, in that it excluded any participation from the Norddeutsche Landesbank, the Hanover-based state bank which was to have joined forces with the WestLB to buy a minority stake in the Schleswig-Holstein bank. Mr Bjorn Engholm, prime minister of Schleswig-Holstein, said yesterday he regretted that Norddeutsche's participation remained 'out of reach' despite intensive negotiations which concluded on Sunday. Negotiations had failed because it had proved impossible to arrange an equitable distribution of the holding. Under the final agreement, SudwestLB is to take a 9.9 per cent stake and WestLB a 40 per cent holding in the Kiel-based bank.</p>

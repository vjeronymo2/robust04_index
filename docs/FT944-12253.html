			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Housing recovery helps Westbury advance 55% The continuing recovery in the new housing market helped Westbury, the Cheltenham-based building group, lift pre-tax profits 55 per cent in the six months to August 31. The advance, from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 5.76m, came on sales up 14 per cent at Pounds 80m (Pounds 70m). Mr Richard Fraser, chief executive, said that the more stable market conditions were enabling the company to achieve its growth targets. The average selling price rose from Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 63,000 over the year, although this was mostly due to the group selling larger properties. 'Interest has picked up, but is still limited,' said Mr Fraser. He added that worries about employment and interest rates were subduing prices. 'There is minimal house price inflation at the moment,' he said. Cost pressures, which had been prominent at the beginning of the year, had eased. Mr Fraser estimated that material and labour costs were up by about 5 per cent year-on-year. Westbury's land bank with planning permission remained stable at 6,400, with the purchase of more than 1,100 plots at an average price of Pounds 14,200. Stiff competition in the land market had prevented further replenishment. However, the strategic land development stock had risen by 800 plots to 5,300 since the year-end. The interest charge jumped from Pounds 455,000 to Pounds 817,000, while there was also a Pounds 700,000 leap in the tax charge to Pounds 1.93m. Earnings per share rose 57 per cent to 5.8p (3.7p). The interim dividend goes up 0.15p to 1.9p. Mr Fraser said he would be disappointed if the full-year figure was not increased as well.</p>

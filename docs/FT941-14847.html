			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Survey points to rising investment in Latin America International investors with debt and equity holdings in Latin America expect to raise their exposure to the region over the next couple of years, encouraged by strong economic growth prospects and relatively high yields, according to a survey published yesterday by Euromoney Publications*. While Mexico, Chile and Argentina are considered among the most developed of the emerging Latin American markets, the smaller markets of Uruguay, Panama, Costa Rica and Bolivia are expected to attract increasing attention over the next five years. Some investors, though, voiced concerns over logistics, noting problems with executing trades and with diversification. 'Overall, investors seemed most concerned about the poor execution capacity of Latin American equity markets and the relatively weak price-to-book values/ratios. 'Economic and political risk, historically the main obstacles to investment in Latin America, were seen as less of a worry than the lack of liquidity and adequate diversification,' the report says. The survey is based on questionnaires sent to more than 110 international investors around the world, who were selected on the basis that more than 5 per cent of funds under management were invested in Latin America. Overall, survey participants invested 23.24 per cent of their funds in Latin America in mid-1993, and expect their total exposure to be 23.97 per cent by mid-1995, representing an increase of 3 per cent. Mexico is likely to maintain its position as the main recipient of foreign capital. However, its overall share is likely to decline as part of a general move away from the developed, highly-capitalised markets towards growing, under-capitalised markets such as Colombia and Brazil. Currently over 80 per cent of investment in Latin America is in the form of either debt or equity, with debt instruments accounting for 43.05 per cent and equity 42.10 per cent. Investors expect this emphasis to change, predicting that equities will be 46.68 per cent of total investment in Latin America, against 39.62 per cent for debt by mid-1995. 'This movement is a reflection of the developments of the two markets. For, while the yield spread between Latin debt and US Treasuries has gradually tightened, return on equity investments has often increased,' the report says. 'In addition, with equity widely perceived as more risky than debt, the switch to equities can be seen as a sign of increased investor confidence in the region's growing economic stability.' Investors described Mexico as the most attractive Latin American country for equity investment, awarding it high marks for company quality, research and liquidity, while Peru was seen as the least attractive. * Latin American Investment 1994 Research Report by Global Research, the research division of Euromoney Publications.

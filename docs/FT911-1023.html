			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Bush's condition blamed on thyroid gland PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday started tests and treatment for an overactive thyroid gland which doctors have now said is responsible for his irregular heart beat, writes Peter Riddell. Mr Bush briefly returned to Bethesda Naval Hospital yesterday morning for tests. His doctors have said his thyroid conditions should be easily treatable and that this should clear up his heart problems. He experienced a third, brief episode of irregular heart beat late on Tuesday and is now taking Coumadin, an anti-coagulant drug, as a precautionary measure.</p>

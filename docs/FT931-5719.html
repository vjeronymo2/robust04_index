			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: US agricultural group bids for Greencore stake THE Irish government confirmed yesterday that it had received an offer from Archer Daniels Midland, the US agriculture conglomerate, for its remaining 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, the Irish sugar and foods company, but appears to have bowed to political pressure in throwing open the stake to other offers until March 24. Greencore's shares resumed trading yesterday, closing at 269p up 24p from their suspension price. Mr Joe Walsh, the agriculture minister, said yesterday 'We will have to await the price which any company is prepared to pay for the shares, and then (consider) the strategic long-term interest .. We are giving an opportunity to Irish companies particularly to make a bid for this remaining stake, because the only interest shown so far is that of ADM'. He said there has been interest by some Irish companies 'but the only precise bid' had been made by ADM. 'We have an offer on the table of 260p per share, but that is a once-off sale, and that is not what the government is interested in.'</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Beatrice foods chief dies aged 50 MR REGINALD LEWIS, who died on Wednesday of a cerebral haemorrhage aged 50, was one of America's richest men, and its most prominent black businessman, writes Laurie Morse in New York. The majority owner and chief executive of TLC Beatrice International Holdings, he was a resident of Manhattan and Paris, and a 1968 graduate of Harvard Law School. Mr Lewis acquired Beatrice for Dollars 1bn in 1987, via a remarkable buy-out, after a career as a corporate lawyer, financier, and take-over artist. Since then, he was an active manager of the company, selling less profitable operations and concentrating profit centres in Europe. TLC Beatrice operates food companies in 18 countries, and had 1991 sales of Dollars 1.54bn and operating income of Dollars 115m. Mr Lewis and his family had control of 51 per cent of the stock. The remainer is closely held. The Beatrice buy-out was built on a smaller take-over success. In 1983, after years of providing legal advice in similar transactions, Mr Lewis purchased the ailing McCall Pattern Company from Chicago-based Esmark for Dollars 22.5m in a leveraged buy-out. He contributed Dollars 1m in personal savings to the deal. Four years later, he sold the revamped company to the John Crowther Group of Britain for Dollars 63m, reaping a personal gain of Dollars 50m. His experience with McCalls and an alliance with Drexel Burnham Lambert led to the TLC Beatrice deal in 1987.</p>

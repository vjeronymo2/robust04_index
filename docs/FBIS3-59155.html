			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the Greek  Cypriots are trying to have the Turkish Cypriots accept  everything before sitting at the negotiating table, and then  play a game of bargaining for gaining even more advantages.    Denktas was speaking at Ercan [Tymbou] Airport before he  went  on a private visit to Istanbul this morning. He said that in  today's papers he read that the Greek Cypriots will not attend  the meetings on the confidence-building measures. However, he  added, I do not have any official information confirming this.  I hope this is not true.    Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side expects the Greek  Cypriots to place their views on the table, approach, the points  they accept and those they do not accept, and also, if they have  any reservations, to inform the UN secretary general of them  with a letter, like the Turkish Cypriot side did. He added: In  this way, the duty of Mr. Clark and Mr. Feissel would be to work  together to eliminate any conflicts there might exist in the  documents posited by the two sides.    Denktas revealed that the United Nations found the Turkish  Cypriot letter and document favorable. It is obvious, the  president stressed, that the Turkish Cypriot side is showing its  intent to reconcile.    Denktas pointed out that if he receives official information  about the attitude of the Greek Cypriot side, and if he learns  of the reasons of this attitude, then he can reply to them.    The president said that he did not have another telephone  conversation with Joe Clark.    In a statement on arrival to Istanbul, Denktas reiterated  that the Turkish Cypriot side has adopted a conciliatory  attitude regarding the Cyprus problem. He pointed out that he  held positive talks with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's  special envoy in Cyprus. Denktas added that the Turkish  Cypriots will continue to show their goodwill.    The president recalled that the Turkish Cypriot side  informed  the UN secretary general with a letter that it will participate  in the work on the confidence-building measures with a  constructive and positive attitude. He said: The right thing  to do, the natural thing to do, is for Kliridhis to write in a  letter what he accepts, and if there is a difference of opinion  between us, then we must sit at the negotiating table and  resolve it between ourselves.    Denktas said he learned that Kliridhis did not find the  Turkish Cypriot letter satisfactory and will therefore not  attend the meetings. Denktas added: If Kliridhis is saying  that he will not sit at the negotiating table unless the Turkish  Cypriots concede to a certain line, and if he is trying to make  us concede to that line without him making any concessions, then  this is a distorted approach.    Replying to a question, Denktas said that the use of the  Lefkosa [Nicosia] International Airport -- under UN observation  -- by Turkish Cypriots is included in the agreement. Ercan  Airport will continue to function too, he added.</p>

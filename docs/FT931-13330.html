			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Walton tribute - Concert IN A few weeks' time ten years will have passed since William Walton's death. It probably seems more: most of his major works, including the First Symphony, the Violin Concerto and Belshazzar's Feast, date from the 1930s and it is the style of that decade that one takes away so vividly from almost all his music - its cinematic sweep, its unabashed romance, the echoes of jazz, the violent premonitions of impending disaster. This was the decade in which music in Britain might be said decisively to have broken with its insular past. Walton was the first to shake off conservatism and it might be thought that the international flavour of his music would have ensured an international following after his death. But that is not quite how it has worked out: apart from Previn and Slatkin, there are few conductors from overseas who get beyond the most obvious handful of Walton's works. To that select group, however, one more can be added. Vladimir Ashkenazy has shown an unexpected willingness to forage in Britain's musical heritage during his years in London as a conductor, taking in a number of performances and recordings of Walton's music. To mark the composer's death he has put together two complete Walton programmes and, if the second is as good as the one on Thursday, they will constitute an important tribute from a non-British musician. The main item was Belshazzar's Feast. This favourite work more or less selects itself, as Walton produced so few full-scale concert scores, but the performance had a panache that made it out-of-the-ordinary. When Solti conducted Belshazzar, he gave it a primeval violence worthy of Stravinsky; Ashkenazy reminded me more of Rakhmaninov's Symphonic Dances (1940) in the music's glorying of rhythm and orchestral glamour. It was a joyous performance, well supported by the Brighton Festival Chorus and John Connell, the bass. Some very fine playing from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (resplendent brass, warm strings) was already presaged in the Suite from Henry V. Too much pastiche is incorporated for this to be regarded as valuable Walton, although the composer seems to have retained an interest in his film scores (I recall him making a special visit to see his Hamlet at the Aldeburgh Festival in the 1970s). What ensured this first concert of the pair was an important event, as opposed to a merely enjoyable one, was the deeply-felt performance of the Cello Concerto, which came in between. To judge from the heady atmosphere they created from the opening bars - sultry evenings on Walton's Ischia perhaps, tempered by pensiveness and melancholy - Mischa Maisky, the cello soloist, and Ashkenazy would seem to have a hot line to Walton's unique sound-world. If the next ten years are to see a widening of Walton's popularity, this Concerto looks a good place to start. Sponsored by NEC (UK) Ltd. Second concert of the pair January 30</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rashid Khashanah: "Fatah Central Committee Urges </F> 'Arafat To Move to Jericho"]    [Text] Tunis -- An informed Palestinian source has told  AL-HAYAH that members of Fatah's Central Committee tried hard to  persuade President Yasir 'Arafat to move to the autonomy areas.  These attempts were made during the Central Committee meeting in  Tunis last Saturday [18 June]. The meeting was devoted to  discussion of completion of the arrangements for transporting  some of Fatah's cadres to the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area.    The source said that 'Arafat did not give a specific answer  to the members' request but they understood that he linked his  decision to the results of the visit of Ahmad Quray'  (Abu-'Ala'), head of the PLO's Economic Department and economy  minister in the Palestinian Authority, to the United States and  his talks with World Bank officials on the aid the bank intends  to give the Palestinian Authority.    A Fatah Central Committee member said that 'Arafat would  probably move to Jericho around the middle of next month after  his visit to Paris on 6 July to receive the Houphouet-Boigny  peace prize along with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, and after a clear and accurate  picture emerges about the financial situation of the Palestinian  Authority in the light of the meeting of the donor states in the  second week of July.</p>

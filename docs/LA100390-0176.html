			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SOVIET MEZZO AT WILSHIRE EBELL  </P> <P> With virtually no advance notice, one of the major luminaries of the San  Francisco Opera and the Metropolitan Opera stopped in Los Angeles to give a  recital Sunday night at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre.  </P> <P> Soviet mezzo-soprano Elena Obraztsova, who, according to available records, has  not appeared in this city before, made her local debut in recital with pianist  Michael Margovsky.  </P> <P> At 53, the veteran singer has retained a powerful vocal presence as well as a  stage manner both gracious and commanding. She looks handsome even standing  behind a music stand.  </P> <P> There were no printed programs. An announcer gave the agenda, item by item,  over a microphone at center stage while singer, pianist and page-turner looked  on. When the announcer mispronounced "Gianni Schicchi,", many in the audience  corrected her, loudly. Several times during the concert flowers arrived --  between songs -- and were immediately placed on the piano behind Obraztsova. It  was that kind of evening.  </P> <P> The mezzo-soprano, as witness her operatic performances both live and on film,  was ever one to give too much. And her reputation as a hypervocalist remains  deserved.  </P> <P> Still, and despite inconsistencies in register and dynamic control, her voice  seems to have maintained its strength and timbre. She warmed up slowly, but to  good effect.  </P> <P> Sunday, in a dozen Russian-language Romances -- by Glinka, Liadov and  20th-Century composers -- Obraztsova entertained her audience with touching  performances of musical material classy, sentimental, tragic and humorous.  </P> <P> In between -- the Romances began and ended the event -- she offered operatic  excerpts, first the predictable but welcome arias from Gounod's "Sapho,"  Bizet's "Carmen" and Saint-Saens' "Samson et Dalila," then "O mio babbino caro"  (!) from "Gianni Schicchi" and "Voi lo sapete" from "Cavalleria Rusticana."  </P> <P> Oddly enough, the uncharacteristic Puccini aria gave the most aural pleasure of  the evening.  </P> <P> Offering preludes by Scriabin and an etude by Rachmaninoff as an "interlude" --  the English- fracturing announcer's description -- pianist Margovsky showed  himself a competent if uninspiring soloist. As accompanist to the singer, he  proved only prosaic. DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

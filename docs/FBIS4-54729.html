			<p>BFN     [Text] Elblag, May 3 -- The leader of the national  commission of the "Solidarity" trade union Marian Krzaklewski  asked union members on Tuesday to support Solidarity's struggle  for "the right system in our country".    During the meeting with 200 unionists in Elblag, Krzaklewski  emphasised that "in Silesia hundreds of thousands of people are  protesting against the incorrect realisation of the reforms and  the system which causes our families to become impoverished."  Krzaklewski said that he believes in the wisdom of workers and  challenged them not to be afraid of the comments of "the parties  and unions in power." The union leader said he did not support  the idea of this particular constitution being approved by a  parliament which is in its majority composed of post-Communists.</p>

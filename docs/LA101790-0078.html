			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE  </P> <P> The labor organization that represents the San Diego County Sheriff's  Department accused sheriff's candidate Jim Roache Tuesday of trying to  discredit its membership.  </P> <P> In a letter signed by nine of its officers, the Deputy Sheriff's Assn. asked  Roache, a sheriff's captain, to stop asserting that his opponent, Assistant  Sheriff Jack Drown, coerced members into supporting Drown for sheriff.  </P> <P> Drown and Roache are running to succeed Sheriff John Duffy.  </P> <P> In a vote taken earlier this year, 96% of the DSA membership endorsed Drown  over Roache.  </P> <P> The DSA officers said that Roache has tried to intimidate the membership into  voting for Roache and has unfairly suggested that the DSA is part of a "corrupt  political machine attempting to unlawfully influence the election."  </P> <P> Roache denied those contentions Tuesday.  </P> <P> "When Duffy decided not to seek reelection and hand-picked Jack Drown to run  for sheriff, Drown intensely lobbied DSA for their endorsement and had them  believe that Duffy was going to help Drown win through his political clout,"  Roache said.  </P> <P> "I have not intimidated anyone. I have not tried to discredit the DSA. I'm a  member, and they represent my interests as well."  </P></p>

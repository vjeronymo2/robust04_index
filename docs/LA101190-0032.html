Director Steve Barron and producer Simon  Fields claim they were guaranteed 10% of net profits plus salary in an  agreement they signed with distributor Golden Harvest Films Inc. in January,  1989. The Superior Court suit filed Tuesday alleges that Barron and Simon were  fired from the film crew without explanation in November. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

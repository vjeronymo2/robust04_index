			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 15 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Salvadoran  Army today admitted the existence of armed groups comprised of  former guerrilla and Army members and said it is only waiting  for orders from President Alfredo Cristiani to begin engaging  them.    Deputy Defense Minister General Roberto Tejada Murcia told  journalists the gangs were operating in Cerro Guazapa, north of  San Salvador, and in Morazan Department, in the eastern part of  the country. He claimed the Army has information concerning  activities by dissidents of the Armed Forces and the Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), which became a political  party in December 1993.    "The armed men have been spotted in different places  throughout the country, but most of all in Guazapa," Tejada  Murcia emphasized.    He said the Armed Forces have not begun moving against them,  but he added, "they will be fought, if the president so orders  it." Tejada explained that patrols to prevent this type of  activity would fall under the guidelines of the National  Civilian Police (PNC).    Following the signing of the January 1992 peace accords  between the government and the then-guerrilla movement, the  Salvadoran Constitution assigned the task of defending national  territory to the Army and the task of safeguarding public  security to the PNC.    The agreements also led to the dismantling of the FMLN  military machine, which had approximately 8,000 armed men, as  well as reducing the Army's military strength from approximately  60,000 to 30,000 men.    Armed groups have kidnapped a number of farmers in Guazapa  over the past few months, while in Morazan they have threatened  to kill FLMN leaders. There also have been a number of  robberies along the highways -- robberies in which anyone who  resists is killed.</p>

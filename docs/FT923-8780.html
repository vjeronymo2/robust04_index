			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Filings for personal bankruptcy soar THE NUMBER of individuals filing for personal bankruptcy jumped 80 per cent to more than 8,000 in the first six months of 1992 compared with the same period last year. As the recession continued to bite, the number of companies petitioning to be wound up rose by 6 per cent to more than 11,000 during the same period, according to figures from the Lord Chancellor's Department. While the government reaffirmed its determination to keep a tight grip on the economy in a speech by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, the new figures were used by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, to attack chancellor Mr Norman Lamont. 'How many more personal bankruptcies does the chancellor think is a price well worth paying?' Mr Cook asked. 'How many companies have to go under before this government changes direction?' Mr John McQueen, chief executive of the Bankruptcy Association, which represents individual bankrupts, said the figures were 'absolutely disgraceful'. In a further indication of the effects of the recession, separate figures released by the Department of Trade and Industry show the number of company insolvencies - businesses officially deregistered - 8 per cent up over the same period, and individual bankruptcies approved by the courts up by 49 per cent. Mr Steve Hill, a partner with Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, said that much of the increase in filings was the result of the recession. However, he stressed that over the past two years it had also become far easier for people to file for bankruptcy, as the government's insolvency service had reduced the level of investigation it conducted before approving petitions. Debtors' bankruptcy petitions in the English and Welsh courts were 8,225 to the end of June, compared with 4,564 in the first half of 1991. There was some evidence, however, that the rate was beginning to slow, with the number of bankruptcy petitions dropping slightly between the first and second quarters of this year - from a total of 4,395 to 3,830. Seasonally adjusted statistics from the DTI, which are published by the British Chambers of Commerce, showed that 5,816 companies became insolvent in the second quarter this year, compared with 5,835 in the first. Ms Fiona Johnson, from the Chambers' policy office, said at best there was a levelling-off in the insolvency trend. 'There are no grounds for complacency. We can't say this constitutes a new downward trend. The increase on last year is very worrying.' Critics attacked, Page 5</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Observer: Marking time Not content with being out of sync with Moscow politically, the Ukraine yesterday rooted itself in a different time zone. Russia moved its clocks on an hour in a belated attempt to compensate for short winter days, but the Ukrainians stuck to the old time. They are now only one hour ahead of most European countries whereas Moscow is two hours ahead - which will please Ukrainian politicians keen to move their country towards the west and away from their former masters.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunaiskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- The command of the Black Sea  Navy has asked the Ukrainian Defence Ministry to pay before  April 10 all the debts of the Ukrainian military units which  consume electric power through the Black Sea Navy, as well as  the debts of Ukrainian Defence Ministry customers to the  building department of the Black Sea Navy.    The telegram, addressed to Ukrainian Defence Minister  General  Vitaliy Radetskiy, says that on March 28 the debts of Ukrainian  units to the Black Sea Navy amounted to 4 billion karbovanets  for the consumed electricity, and 16,709 billion karbovanets for  the completed construction jobs.    The cable says that if the debt was not paid before April  10,  "the Black Sea Navy Command will be compelled to consider the  question of stopping all building and assembly works, carried  out by the Black Sea Navy construction department for the  Ukrainian Defence Ministry, and of switching over all the  Ukrainian units, consuming electric power through the Black Sea  Navy, to their own power sources".    "The Black Sea Navy Command holds," the cable says, "that  the  Ukrainian Defence Ministry has breached the summit agreements on  the joint financing of the Black Sea Navy and is trying to solve  its own problems at the expense of the Russian Navy".</p>

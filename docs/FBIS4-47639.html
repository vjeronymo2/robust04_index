			<p>Indicating      his frustration at the lack of progress in  implementing the March ceasefire plan and the postponement of  talks with separatist Serbs on confidence building measures,  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has issued an ultimatum  demanding that control of the UN Protected Areas (UNPA's) be  returned to the Croatian Government by September.  In a 21 May  speech, he pledged that the Croatian Government would "do its  utmost" to regain control of Serb-held territory--the so-called  Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK)--"in a peaceful way," declaring  that this process must be completed "within the current mandate"  of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) that expires on 30  September.  If negotiations fail, he warned, Croatia "will use  all means to which it is entitled as an internationally  recognized and sovereign" state to establish legal control over  "every inch of Croatian soil" once the current UNPROFOR mandate  expires (Zagreb TV, 21 March).  In recent weeks Tudjman and his  government have expressed growing frustration with UNPROFOR's  "inefficiency" in halting the "crimes" of the "Serb terrorists  and occupiers" and complained about the lack of progress in  holding the talks envisioned by the 30 March ceasefire agreement  (Zagreb TV, 15 and 20 May).      Tudjman's 21 May remarks mark a sharp break with the policy he  had followed since November 1993 of avoiding threats to use force  to reintegrate the UNPA's.  At that time, Tudjman had announced a  "peace initiative" on 2 November 1993 to seek a "political  solution", after acknowledging that his government's policies had  created an impression with "parts of the Serbian population" of  Croatia that the conflict with the RSK would be resolved by  "military means" and "ethnic cleansing" (Zagreb TV, 2 November).  In the following months, he and other Croat leaders, while not  giving an absolute guarantee that the Croatian government would  eschew an eventual military solution, had carefully avoided  threatening to use force against the Krajina Serbs (Trends, 15  December 1993, pages 47-51).

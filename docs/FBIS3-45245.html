The Xiang Shan Conference, an annual high-level scientific  meeting held in the Xiang Shan (Fragrant Hills) outside Beijing,  will organize about 20 seminars this year compared with eight  last year when it was first initiated and sponsored by the  Chinese Academy of Sciences for discussing the direction of  scientific research.    "The conference aims at foreseeing the development of  frontier sciences, especially cross-discipline sciences," said  Cao Xiaoye, of the organizing committee.    Cao said the organizing committee is requesting suggestions  on seminar subjects nationwide. The first seminar this year is  expected to be held in April.    Any Chinese scientists can apply to host or attend the  conference.    "Foreign scientists and Chinese scientists working or  studying abroad are also eligible to apply," Cao said.    Meanwhile, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) is  considering inviting some Nobel Prize winners to address the  conference this year or next year.    The conference is part of the effort to make China one of  the  scientific powerhouses in the world.    Cao said that China has many good scientists, but needs some  leading scientists who are capable of guiding the country's  scientific research.    "Our conference is targeted at opening the minds of  scientists and nurturing a group of leading scientists," he said.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DOZEN WELLS TO BE BUILT NEAR CLOSED ARLETA DUMP;  </P> <P> WATER: RESIDENTS FEAR THAT TOXIC MATERIALS COULD SEEP FROM THE DUMP INTO THEIR  WATER SUPPLY. CITY WATER OFFICIALS SAY CONTAMINATION IS NOT A THREAT.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Friday approved a controversial plan to drill  12 water wells in Arleta to replace contaminated North Hollywood wells, despite  the project's proximity to a closed garbage dump.  </P> <P> The $33-million Tujunga Well Field Project, which has drawn scattered  opposition from nearby residents, was approved without dissent by the council.  </P> <P> Several council members said the wells would provide much-needed drinkable  water for all sections of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> However, Gordon Murley of Woodland Hills, representing the Federation of  Hillside and Canyon Assns., questioned whether water from the wells in the 8800  block of Arleta Avenue could be guaranteed to be pure, since the site is about  3,000 feet from the closed Sheldon-Arleta landfill.  </P> <P> Unlike modern dumps, the bottom of the Sheldon-Arleta facility was not lined to  prevent seepage, and Murley and others suggest that toxic materials could  percolate down to the water supply.  </P> <P> City water officials "have never been able to say where the contamination" that  has forced closure of nearby wells "comes from," Murley said.  </P> <P> But Duane L. Georgeson, Department of Water and Power assistant general  manager, said, "We've checked carefully, and at present there is no  contamination. We are confident that the project can be constructed with no  threat to the water supply of our customers."  </P> <P> Georgeson said the water will be tested regularly for contamination.  </P> <P> Even if limited contamination is discovered, he said, the water supply can be  filtered or diluted with water from other sources to keep it drinkable, he  said.  </P> <P> At a hearing last month before the council's Environmental Quality and Waste  Management Committee, several residents complained that noise from the well  pumps would disturb them in their homes and would lower property values.  </P> <P> They also complained that a 3-million-gallon water storage tank to be built as  part of the project will visually blight their residential neighborhood.  </P></p>

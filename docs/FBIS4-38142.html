			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F> Patrick Sabatier in Paris on 24 June -- first paragraph is  LIBERATION introduction]    [Text] Yasir 'Arafat will be able to come and pray in  Jerusalem: Yitzhaq Rabin gave this assurance on Friday [24 June]  in interviews with two Israeli journalists, in the name of free  access to places of worship, while stressing that "the problem  is the date of such a trip, because of the security  implications." At the same time, Israeli Deputy Foreign  Minister, Yosi Beilin, in an interview with LIBERATION during a  visit to Paris, confirmed the prime minister's statement, after  having given a very positive report on Israeli-Palestinian  relations. A member of the labor party's left wing, of which he  is one of the most active cadres, Beilin also provides a  progress report on the implementation of the Oslo agreement, of  which he was one of the main authors.    [Sabatier] What have you to report, one month after Gaza and  Jericho gained their autonomy?    [Beilin] We are very satisfied. The most important result is  the significant drop in the level of violence. There may be  people who want to resort to violence, and we cannot be sure  there will not be such people in the future. However, the  inhabitants of the West Bank are pleased with the new situation.  They do not encourage those who want to violate the agreement  and act against Israel. They do not provide terrorists with  asylum, which has made terrorist activities more difficult than  before. The people of Gaza go to the beach and to the  restaurant, the curfew is over, and they feel that they can  decide their future. An important change has been made. So far,  autonomy has been a success.    [Sabatier] Is the Palestinian police force efficient and is  it cooperating well with the Israeli Armed Forces?    [Beilin] I was hoping for this cooperation without being  absolutely certain that it was possible. The fact that it has  come is very encouraging. It proves that people accept the  orders of the Palestinian police force, rather than proving the  efficiency of this force. The joint patrols and committees have  been very effective. The fact that we are talking to try and  find solutions on the ground is one of the most important  results of the agreement. It shows that, on both sides, we are  capable of implementing what we have signed.    [Sabatier] What are the chances for success of the  negotiations on the second stage of autonomy that start on  Monday [date not specified]?    [Beilin] Our timetable is very clear. We must discuss a  permanent solution before 4 May 1996 and implement it before 4  May 1999. I am not sure that we will be talking about the  second phase as of Monday. First of all, we have to see whether  the Palestinians are ready for the elections that would pave the  way to complete autonomy in Gaza and the whole of the West Bank,  or if they prefer to wait and implement a partial devolution of  authority in just five domains out of 19. This second option  would mean two levels of autonomy. That is one possibility, but  I would rather there were elections.    [Sabatier] Will the Israeli Army be redeployed outside of  the  urban centers in two months time, as planned?    [Beilin] That depends on the elections. The agreement  provides for this redeployment to take place on the eve of the  elections. If there are no elections, we will have to decide  unilaterally whether or not we will do this. The feasibility of  this redeployment does not pose a problem. The decision will  depend on the level of violence...    [Sabatier] Negotiations for Gaza and Jericho took six  months.  Are you not afraid that the negotiations on the rest will not be  much longer and harder, given the close proximity of the peoples?    [Beilin] The hardest thing has been achieved -- mutual  recognition and direct dialogue with Yasir 'Arafat. In  addition, the Gaza-Jericho agreement has created a precedent and  many problems have been resolved in this area. However, it is  true that the geographical configuration is harder for the West  Bank.    [Sabatier] Will you not be obliged to settle the issue of  the  colonies in this stage of negotiations?    [Beilin] We will only settle this issue in the framework of  the final settlement. Despite the problems, the colonies will  remain in place during the interim period.    [Sabatier] What about Jerusalem? Will you talk about it  earlier than planned?    [Beilin] This will be the last point to be discussed,  because  it is the hardest point to settle. Anyone raising the issue now  will pay dearly for it. It is better to settle the easy issues  first, as we have always done in the past.    [Sabatier] Last year, you mentioned the possibility of  granting some form of autonomy to the inhabitants of East  Jerusalem. Are you still considering that?    [Beilin] Yes, but that is a personal idea of mine. We must  keep Jerusalem a united municipality, under Israeli sovereignty  and the capital of Israel. However, we cannot ignore the rights  of non- Jewish people. From a religious point of view, there  must be free access for all denominations and arrangements to  satisfy them. On the political level, the Palestinians must be  granted, just like the other communities, the right to  administer the zones they live in and to elect representatives  to a council placed under the authority of the municipality of  Jerusalem and empowered to settle day-to-day issues.    [Sabatier] What will happen to the Palestinian institutions  of Jerusalem? Do you want to close the "Orient House"  (LIBERATION editor's note: PLO headquarters in East Jerusalem)?    [Beilin] That depends on what the "Orient House" is. If it  serves as a community center for East Jerusalem, then there is  no reason to close it down. However, if it becomes the center  of Palestinian authorities for the Occupied Territories, we  cannot tolerate it since this would be a violation of the  agreement.    [Sabatier] Will the Palestinian leaders be able to visit  Jerusalem, or will they be restricted to Gaza and Jericho?    [Beilin] At the current time, anyone who does not live in  Jerusalem cannot go there. However, Rabin has just said this  very morning that 'Arafat has the right to come and pray in  Jerusalem, as he has said he wants to do, on condition that he  coordinates this visit with the Israeli authorities. This is an  important statement.    [Sabatier] Has the date for 'Arafat's return to Jericho been  decided on?    [Beilin] Not as far as I know.    [Sabatier] Will you accept the presence of heads of state or  foreign figures in Jericho for the event?    [Beilin] If it does not cause any violence or meet with  opposition, why should we prevent anyone from going to Jericho  on that day? However, is it wise to make such a big deal of  this return? Is it not, at the end of the day, more important  to make progress in the negotiations? At the moment, everyone  is talking about 'Arafat's return rather than the negotiations...    [Sabatier] Why do you thank 'Arafat is delaying?    [Beilin] I hardly ever wonder about that, and quite frankly  it is not at the top of my list of questions...</p>

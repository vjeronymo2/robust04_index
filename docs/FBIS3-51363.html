			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 18 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Tuesday  [18 January], the Guatemalan Army denied advising its Mexican  colleagues in the counter insurgent struggle; although it  admitted holding routine meetings ever since the peasant  rebellion began in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas.    Guatemalan Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez said  Mexico does not need "our experience" of more than 30 years  fighting the Guatemalan guerrillas, and that the meetings held  have been the usual ones.    The dailies PRENSA LIBRE and SIGLO VEINTIUNO, who quote  sources close to the Army, said high-ranking Mexican military  officers had been to Guatemala in early January and they had  travelled to Ixcan, an area of conflict located in the northern  Quiche Department.    "To provide military advice is a political decision. If the  Mexican authorities request it, I must ask the president for  authorization," the minister said, pointing out that the  meetings were not about the Chiapas situation.    Gen. Enriquez denied Guatemalan military officers had  travelled to Mexico to learn about the situation caused by the  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) rebellion, although he  said that way "we would have more reliable information." In  relation to the surveillance along the area bordering Mexico, he  reiterated the troops remain in a state of alert because the  Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) "has concentrated  its forces in that area."    The military command in Huehuetenango is coordinating  surveillance in the border area, which has been divided into  seven zones, and therefore, "it has not been necessary to send  reinforcements," according to Army spokesperson Edith Vargas.    As of 5 January, the EZLN rebels have been in Guadalupe  Tepeyac, some 800 meters from the Guatemalan border, north of  Huehuetenango Department. In this area, Military Zone No. 19 is  in charge of security and defense but the border is also guarded  by troops and detachments which depend on the central military  zones located in the northern Quiche, Alta Verapaz, and Peten  Departments.    According to the Guatemalan defense minister, "the entire  border is a shield for subversion. We fight them in Ixcan and  they show up in Mexico," where military intelligence has  detected hospitals for treating the guerrillas as well as arms  caches.    The daily SIGLO VEINTIUNO quotes a Guatemalan military  document which says the arrest of a "terrorist criminal" in  Cacahuatan, Chiapas in July 1984 led to the dismantling of a  "clandestine surgical hospital."    Enriquez ruled out the URNG as having the capacity for  organizing a rebellion like the EZLN rebellion in Chiapas State  on 1 January because "it is militarily weak." He also said  Guatemalan military attaches in Mexico have not reported on the  alleged Guatemalan guerrillas who were fighting with the  Zapatists, and he voiced concern about the arrest of Dr. Ruben  Alejandro Bailey. The medical doctor was arrested on 10 January  and accused of forming part of the Revolutionary Workers  Clandestine People's Union Party (PROCUP), which the Mexican  authorities have accused of terrorist actions.</p>

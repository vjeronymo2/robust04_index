			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Lloyd's faces resistance to deal Efforts by Lloyd's of London to reach a deal to end legal action by lossmaking members are facing resistance from those who would have to pay most of the bill, the insurance market's ruling council is expected to hear tomorrow, Ralph Atkins writes. It emerged yesterday that Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, last Wednesday met 'errors and omissions' insurers - providers of negligence cover to professional agencies being sued - as part of his efforts to increase the pressure for a new settlement. Although E&amp;O insurers are understood to be divided over whether fresh negotiations are in their interest, the majority believe firmly that they have no incentive to enter talks at this stage. Tomorrow's council meeting is expected to decide whether attempts to forge a new deal should be stepped up. Earlier this year Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - rejected a deal worth Pounds 900m and have subsequently pursued court actions for claims totalling about Pounds 3bn. The E&amp;O insurers argue that the sums available to fund any deal have not changed and that lossmaking Names continue to have unrealistic expectations about how much they might eventually receive - either through court action or a settlement. Much of the E&amp;O cover was provided within the Lloyd's market, funded by other Names.</p>

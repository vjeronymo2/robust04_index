			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Cambodia guerrillas in peace gesture KHMER ROUGE guerrillas are willing to join Cambodia's new national army to try to bring peace to the country, according to Mr Khieu Samphan, the faction's president, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. He also told reporters that Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the head of state, had offered the Khmer Rouge ministerial posts in the new government. 'We have proposed to establish a quadripartite army so as to avoid clashes and confrontation on the military field,' he said after talks with the United Nations military commander and the deputy peacekeeping chief. 'We see it as the only way to solve and avoid clashes and confrontation.' A diplomat warned, however, that the Khmer Rouge may be putting a rosier glow on its new-found friendship with the government than was warranted. 'It sounds as though only one concession has come out,' he said. But he noted with concern that the Maoist group's willingness to join a united army did not mean it would give up the 15 per cent of Cambodia that it now controls, or even allow free access to the areas. Mr Khieu Samphan returned to Phnom Penh yesterday after an absence of three months and met Prince Norodom Ranariddh, joint leader of the interim power-sharing government. Mr Khieu Samphan said the Khmer Rouge sought a role as advisers rather than cabinet posts.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Inchcape beats rights issue forecast with 6% improvement to Pounds 185.2m INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, increased pre-tax profits by just over 6 per cent to Pounds 185.2m in 1991 in spite of tough conditions in several of its vehicle markets. The profit figure was about Pounds 5m ahead of the forecast made with the 1-for-3 rights issue in December. That raised Pounds 376m to buy Tozer Kemsley Millbourn, the motors and retailing concern, from Brierley Investments of New Zealand. With the TKM deal not completed until this month, it made no contribution to the 1991 figures. These included a 10 per cent advance in turnover to Pounds 3.64bn and a 9.6 per cent increase in earnings per share to 28.5p (26p), after a reduced minority charge. Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive, was confident of further progress this year, even though he saw no economic recovery in the UK until 1993. Domestic sales only accounted for 30 per cent of the group total. Pre-interest profits of Pounds 192.1m (Pounds 193.4m) were affected by a Pounds 17m fall in property profits and reduced contributions following the sale of a stake in the Assam tea business. The tea disposal helped to reduce interest costs by Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 6.9m. Net debt stood at Pounds 99m at the year-end, giving gearing of 18 per cent. Motors, including the Mann Egerton dealerships and Toyota distribution, accounted for almost 60 per cent of sales, while operating profit inched ahead to Pounds 112.1m (Pounds 110.6m). Toyota (GB) increased its market share from 2.1 to 2.6 per cent. During 1993, the first year of production at the Burnaston factory in Derbyshire, Toyota will increase its stake in the UK distribution business from 5 to 25 per cent. Mr Mackay said that last year 150,000 of the 220,000 vehicles sold by the group were Toyotas. TKM would add about 150,000 non-Toyota sales. The strongest performance came from the services side, including Bain Clarkson in insurance, shipping and environmental testing. Divisional profit grew by 51 per cent to Pounds 42.1m. Marketing contributed Pounds 57.2m, up from Pounds 52.7m. with the best progress in Japan, Hong Kong and China. A proposed final dividend of 7.5p makes a total of 12.5p, up from 11.8p.

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Paramount board backs Dollars 9.7bn bid from QVC The board of Paramount Communications has recommended that shareholders reject a controversial Dollars 9.2bn offer for the entertainment company made last Friday by cable company Viacom and accept a rival Dollars 9.7bn offer from QVC Network. The decision, announced on Wednesday night, does not settle the five-month takeover battle, since shareholders may accept either bid and Viacom could still make a higher offer by February 1, the date set for final bids. However, the board's re- endorsement of QVC's offer maintains the psychological advantage the television home shopping business has enjoyed. That was when the Paramount board, which had supported a friendly merger with cable company Viacom, switched sides under pressure from the courts and said QVC's offer gave shareholders better value. After Wednesday's board meeting, Mr Martin Davis, Paramount's chairman, did not address claims by QVC that Viacom's new offer violated the bidding rules. However, he said any future bids would continue to be 'rigorously reviewed with regard to their compliance with the bidding procedures.' Last Friday night, shortly before QVC's tender offer was due to close, Viacom announced a new bid which increased from Dollars 85 a share to Dollars 105 a share the cash it is offering for 50.1 per cent of Paramount's stock, but sharply cut the value of the securities it is offering in a 'second step merger' for the remaining 49 per cent. Simultaneously, it announced an Dollars 8.4bn merger agreement with video rental group Blockbuster Entertainment, which is providing Dollars 1.25bn to finance the higher cash offer. The new Viacom bid offers Dollars 13 a share more cash than QVC, but the total value of its offer is some Dollars 5 a share less than the QVC bid.</p>

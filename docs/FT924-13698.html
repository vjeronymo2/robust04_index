			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Producer prices rise by 3.2%: Slowest increase in factory gate prices for 24 years THE GOVERNMENT received encouraging news on inflation yesterday as official figures showed that prices of goods leaving Britain's factories rose at their slowest rate for more than 24 years. A report from the Central Statistical Office showed that prices for UK manufactured goods in September were unchanged on the previous month. They rose by 3.2 per cent in the year to September compared with 3.4 per cent in the 12 months to August. Excluding the volatile prices of food, drink and tobacco, the output price index rose by 0.1 per cent last month, bringing the annual rate of increase to 2.6 per cent, compared with 2.7 per cent in the year to August. The prices of imported raw materials and fuels rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent in September, compared with the previous month. The figures provided the first indications of the effect of the sterling devaluation on September 16. In markets yesterday, combined with a stronger performance by the pound, the better-than-expected news on producer price inflation fuelled hopes of a further cut in banks' base rates from 9 per cent. An announcement by Abbey National that it was to cut mortgage rates a further 0.35 percentage points to 9.6 per cent gave a fillip to the FT-SE 100 share index which closed up 27.5 at 2,584.7. The pound, also buoyed by earlier comments from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that he intended to pay close attention to the exchange rate, closed up a pfennig in London at DM2.52. In late New York trading, it was quoted at DM2.514. But after gloomy news of coal pit closures, job losses and more business failures, the government suffered further attacks yesterday for its handling of the economy. Lord Prior, a former Conservative cabinet minster, accused the Treasury of failing industry and warned of 'serious social problems' as unemployment continued to rise. The government was also criticised by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, who said businesses were increasingly frustrated at the lack of a thought-out industrial strategy: 'We support the government's anti-inflation stance and we support the government's aspirations to be at the heart of Europe. But what we have been asking for time and time again is some recognition that the government needs to set priorities for growth which will address the underlying weaknesses of the economy.' The 0.2 per cent monthly rise in the prices of raw materials and fuel followed a 0.7 per cent fall in August. The full impact of more expensive imported commodities, however, has yet to feed through. It is likely to be felt over the coming months but the increases will not be passed on automatically to finished goods. With consumer demand still very weak, manufacturers are expected to absorb the higher costs generated by the pound's devaluation. 'The input index will pop up quite sharply over the next few months, but it will take a while before manufacturers pass that through,' said Mr Kevin Gardiner, economist at SG Warburg Securities. On an annual basis, input prices continued to fall albeit at a slower rate. In the year to September the prices of raw materials fell by 0.4 per cent. This compares with a fall of 1.5 per cent in the year to July and a fall of 1.1 per cent in the year to August. Confidence falls, Page 13</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 28 February carries the  following reports on the combat situation in the Republic.    The studio announcer introduces a report from the Zivince  Press Center on attacks at Dubrave airport in Tuzla. An  unidentified correspondent from the press center says that "the  defense lines are exposed to sporadic provocations, while  important buildings like Dubrave airport are the target of  artillery attacks. Howitzer shells were launched from Drvenik  at the wider area of Zivinice. Owing to this, a general alarm  signal was sounded. The enemy attacks did not have any  consequences and all the defense lines remain stable."    Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "the  fiercest fighting, hand-to-hand fighting is in progress on the  south and southeastern fronts, where the aggressors -- vicious  animals -- are attempting infantry breakthroughs. Up to the  time of filing this report, two women have been killed, while  five civilians, three of them children, have been seriously  injured."    Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac and says that "this  morning, the chetniks once again viciously attacked the  defenders' lines on Grabez, [name indistinct], Hasin Vrh, and  the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau. They are again attempting  breakthroughs in the region of the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau  from the areas of Livaci, (?Brtnik), and (?Grmusa). Our  defenders are resisting heroically." Provocations on the  demarcation lines with the army of the so-called Kladusa  autonomy have escalated since last night, particularly in the  areas of (?Trst) and Pecigrad in the Cazin Commune. Since this  morning, they are using mortars and are bringing in fresh forces  and equipment.    Viktor Boban reports from Zavidovici and says that "an  artillery attack from all of the aggressor's available arsenal  began at 0900 [0800 GMT] this morning. The attack from the  well-known chetnik positions was directed at the town center.  Around 30 destructive shells, of which 16 were 122-mm howitzer  shells, were fired in less than 40 minutes. The material damage  in residential areas is immense. The morning hours on the  Hajdarevici front were marked by fire from a chetnik Bofors.  The situation is similar in Maholj, were the enemy is using  antiaircraft machine guns."    Gorazde correspondent Fahrudin Bekic reports that "the  chetniks continue with their dirty work. From their positions  in Medena Glavica they used 82-mm mortars to pound civilian  targets in Ogleceva. The usual provocations went on on the  Rogatica route, while the enemy forces from Ustipraca used  antiaircraft machine guns to target Gajevi. Provocations were  also registered on the demarcation line toward Cajnice and Foca."</p>

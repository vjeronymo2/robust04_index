			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Sport: Harlequin's last bow - Rugby Union IF SIMON Halliday has as good a game against Ireland at Twickenham this afternoon as he had against Scotland two weeks ago, then the Irish had better look out. At Murrayfield, Halliday was not just the dominant back nor the dominant Englishman but arguably the dominant figure on the field. He gave a performance of all-round play the like of which I have not seen for many years. Let us count the individual touches of England's right wing. They began with Halliday catching the ball deep in his own half and near the right touchline. Not much room to work with here. Boom] Halliday right-footed the ball 40 yards down the touchline and into touch, a distance and accuracy that a stand-off or full back would have been pleased with. It was a reminder that he was good enough to kick two penalties for Oxford in the 1980 Varsity match. This was followed by some mazy running. Halliday is 6 ft tall and strong with it and on occasion is used to burst on to a flat pass at full speed. Then he is about as easy to stop as a runaway car. Against Scotland he more often demonstrated the art of elusive running, easily and light-footedly shimmying past tacklers in a way that belied his 14-stone plus. One remarkable run when he linked with Jeremy Guscott led to the try by Dewi Morris. In between this was some stout tackling in defence. 'Yes' said Halliday last week when he cast his mind back to the Calcutta Cup match. 'In terms of doing things right or wrong it probably was my best game in the five-nations' championship. It was very satisfying, that game. I have played at Murrayfield five times for England. The first time, 1986, was a record loss - 33-6. The last was a record victory - 25-7. Since it was the last time I shall play an international there it was nice to finish like that.' Then Halliday was wearing the white of England. Now he was dressed in a dark, double-breasted suit, the uniform of the City. Then he was intent on doing his bit for England. Now he spoke quietly and seriously over lunch in a City restaurant, a drop kick from his office at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. His open face was marked by the hint of a scar running down the side of his right eye and blobs of bloodiness in the eye itself. The stitches, he explained, were the relic of a collision with his Harlequins' team-mate and England captain Will Carling. Halliday ran a finger tenderly down the fading scar. 'A pure accident, of course,' he said. He attacked his fillet steak. 'But that was not the best game I have played for England,' he said. 'My best game was against Romania in Bucharest. I laid the ball off well. For a centre that is the first responsibility. And I helped to operate a smooth back line. That is another of a centre's responsibilities.' Alongside him that day was a young Englishman making his debut, Guscott. Thanks in part to the service he received from his mentor, Guscott scored three tries. Halliday, laying the ball off well, scored none. There is a school of thought that says that the precocious Guscott has lost his cutting edge in games for Bath since Halliday moved to Harlequins for the start of the 1990/91 season. Not until Bath beat Leicester in December did Guscott look as though he had recovered from the departure of his old team-mate. Halliday the Harlequin. There is a touch of the gilded youth about him, an all-rounder on and off the pitch, one to whom things come easily. A graduate of Oxford where he got a third in modern languages and classics ('you can say I got an honours degree if you like') he speaks French well enough to have acted as England's interpreter after the tense game against France in the quarter-final of the World Cup. He also represented Oxford at cricket and got close to a blue for squash. He is, says a friend, devastatingly quick at crosswords, as is Rory Underwood, the other England wing. Halliday's rugby career has been hampered by injuries and selectoral quirks such as not picking him. Paradoxically his ability to play both centre and wing at the highest level counted against him. Perhaps life mirrors sport after all. A strength of Halliday's is that he is good at teamwork, doing what is best for a team without more than the odd cheep of disapproval. It began at Downside School when he had one year as a wing and two as a full back. It has continued for England  - 15 caps as a centre, five as a wing. It is true at his job. As a salesman handling equity funds on behalf of clients he works closely with five colleagues. 'You need an ability to work in a structure and though others must say whether I am a team man I think I have an ability to work in a team. I hope so.' Halliday will be 32 in July. This is his last season for England. It is a good time to finish. The World Cup is over. An England B team will tour New Zealand this summer and he has no desire to be in it. He began his club rugby with Harlequins and will end it there this season. Life turns full circle. It is time for a change.</p>

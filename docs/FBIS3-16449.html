			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of decree by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on </F> cancellation of Crimean poll]    [Text] We have just received a decree by the president of  Ukraine, which is titled: On the Decree of the President of the  Republic of Crimea, Dated 10 March 1994, on Conducting a Poll of  Citizens of the Republic of Crimea on 27 March 1994. The decree  states that the president of the Crimean Republic adopted, on 10  March 1994, Decree No. 05 on conducting a poll of citizens of  the Republic of Crimea on 27 March 1994 on issues of renewing  the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea,  dated 6 May 1992, that determined the regulation of mutual  relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine on the  basis of a treaty, and agreements and renewing the provisions of  the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, dated 6 May 1992,  which declared the right of citizens of the Republic of Crimea  to dual citizenship. The mentioned provisions of the decree of  the president of the Republic of Crimea contravene Ukraine's  Constitution and the law of Ukraine on an all-Ukrainian and  local referendums.    The president of the Republic of Crimea has virtually made a  decision to hold a [words indistinct] poll of citizens of a  consultative referendum under the guise of a poll of citizens  that is being conducted only in order to ascertain public  opinion that is specified by Article 47 of the law of Ukraine on  an all-Ukrainian and local referendums. According to the  legislation of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea, the results  of such a referendum are to be considered, and must be taken  into account when decisions are made by relevant state bodies.    Such a conclusion is based, first of all, on the preamble of  the decree. In it, the president of the Republic of Crimea  noted firstly, that in adopting the decision he is relying on  the principle of sovereignty of the people, [narodovladdya] in  accordance with which the single source of state power of the  Republic of Crimea are the people; secondly, the aim of the  decree is to take into account more fully the will of the  citizens of the Republic of Crimea when deciding important state  issues; thirdly, it is guided by Article 2 and 34 of the  Constitution of the Republic of Crimea where it speaks about the  implementation of state power by the people and its  participation in managing the affairs of society and state.    (?In accordance with) Article 46 of the Ukrainian law on an  all-Ukrainian and local referendums, the manifestation of the  will of citizens when deciding important issues of a general  state and local significance is a consultative poll of citizens  through a consultative referendum. According to Points 1 and 2  of Article 2 of the decree, citizens of the Republic of Crimea  are recommended to reply to a question on the constitutional  bases of mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea and  Ukraine, and the rights of citizens of the Republic of Crimea to  dual citizenship, that is to say, to questions that are  exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Council of  Ukraine, [according to] Articles 31 Points 2 and 15, and Article  97 of Ukraine's Constitution that are, therefore, subject to an  all-Ukrainian referendum according to Article Three of the  Ukrainian law on an all-Ukrainian and local referendums.    In accordance with Article 6-1 of the Ukrainian law on an  all-Ukrainian and local referendums, the holding of referendums  on issues that are not under the jurisdiction of the Republic of  Crimea is not permitted. An adoption, a change, or a  cancellation of a decision on issues that have been referred to  the jurisdiction of the Republic of Crimea by Ukrainian  legislation may be the subject of a republican and local  referendums in the Republic of Crimea (Article 3-1 of the  Ukrainian law on an all-Ukrainian and local referendums). In  addition, it must be taken into account that the provisions of  Article 9 and Part 2 of Article 17 of the Constitution of the  Republic of Crimea in the version dated 6 May 1992, whose  renewal has been touched upon in the decree of the president of  the Republic of Crimea, were changed by the Supreme Council of  the Republic of Crimea on 25 September 1992, insofar as they did  not conform to the Constitution of Ukraine.    In addition, the fact that certain provisions of the decree  of the president of the Republic of Crimea do not conform to  Crimean legislation is also mentioned in a resolution from the  Central Electoral Commission on the election of the Supreme  Council of the Republic of Crimea, dated 12 March 1994,  concerning the aforementioned decree. Proceeding from this, and  in accordance with Point 7-2 of Article 114-5 of the  Constitution of Ukraine, I resolve:    1. To cancel Points 1 and 2 of Article 2 of the decree of  the  president of the Republic of Crimea dated 10 March 1994 No. 05  on conducting a poll of citizens of the Republic of Crimea on 27  March 1994, insofar as it does not conform with the Constitution  of Ukraine and the law of Ukraine on an all-Ukrainian and local  referendums;    2. The decree acquires validity from the date of signing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An Iranian bombing suspect denies any involvement  in a foiled attempt to car-bomb the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok  on March 11, saying he was in Phatthaya on that day,  Metropolitan Police Bureau Commissioner Chaisit Kanchanakit said  yesterday.    Hossein Shahriarifar, 26, however, allegedly implicated two  other Iranians arrested with him in the southern tourist town of  Hat Yai on Friday as taking part in falsifying passports, Pol  Lt-Gen Chaisit said.    Shahriarifar and another Iranian suspect, Mohammadi  Lotfollar, who is still at large, were sought under arrest  warrants issued by the police last week on charges of conspiring  to commit premeditated murder, robbery resulting in the death of  others, and making and possessing explosives.    The warrants were issued after the police said they had  evidence to prove the two were behind a plot to car-bomb the  embassy.    The bombing plan ran into trouble when the bomb-laden  six-wheel truck allegedly driven by Hossein accidentally hit a  motorcycle-taxi near Central Chitlom department store a short  distance from the embassy.    After failing to negotiate with the motorcycle driver, the  truck driver, said to be an Arab-looking man, fled the scene.    The truck from a rental company was then taken to Lumphini  police station where it was left for about a week before its  owner found a water tank containing C-4 plastic explosives wired  to a diesel fuel tank.    The body of Chom Thila, a Thai employee of the rental firm,  was found in the tank.    Nine witnesses yesterday identified Hossein, detained at the  Metropolitan Police Private School in Bang Khen, as the truck  driver, according to Pol Lt Gen Chaisit.    Shahriarifar and his two Iranian friends, Babak Taheri and  Basr Kazemi, were caught early Friday morning at the Inthra  Hotel in Hat Yai.    A source at an immigration office in Songkhla's Sadao  district said Shahriarifar held a valid passport issued by Iran  under the name Pajiri Mahmed and entered Thailand through the  immigration checkpoint on Thursday.    Since Shahriarifar's photo in the passport allegedly looked  similar to a sketch produced by Lumphini police station and  distributed to immigration offices across the country, an  immigration officer advised Hat Yai police to keep a close watch  on the man who checked-in at the hotel later on Thursday.    The source said Shahriarifar had entered and left Thailand  through the immigration checkpoints in Sadao and Su-ngai Kolok  districts more than 10 times under different names.    The immigration officers, however, earlier could not  identify  him because they did not have his photograph.    Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar, believed to have left  the country after his failure to allegedly bomb the embassy,  came back because he had fallen in love with a Thai woman in Hat  Yai.    The suspect also might have thought that the Thai police had  called off their investigation.    Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar did not implicate the  other suspect as being involved in the embassy bombing plot.    He said the police found the gang had its command centre in  Malaysia where one of its leading members had been caught by  Malaysian police on charges of falsifying documents.    The Metropolitan Police Bureau is looking for additional  witnesses and evidence against Shahriarifar in Bangkok and  southern provinces.    Investigations will be completed in seven days and the  suspect will then be charged in the Criminal Court, Pol Lt-Gen  Chaisit said.    Metropolitan Police Bureau deputy commissioner Sophon  Waratchanon dismissed concern that Shahriarifar might try to  kill himself, saying the suspect did not seem not under stress.    Neither the Iranian nor the Israeli embassies have contacted  the police since the arrest of Shahriarifar, he said.    Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said in Cha-am  yesterday that the car-bomb attempt was connected with some  "Thai people in Bangkok".    "I thought there would be a lot more to come. Something  strange would happen," Gen Chawalit said. He did not elaborate.    He said the Interior Ministry had told the Iranian Embassy  that the Thai police were proceeding with the case.</p>

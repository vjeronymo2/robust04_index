			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Battle lines drawn for Commons debate on Maastricht TORY Euro-sceptics yesterday took up the challenge offered by Mr John Major's determination to ratify the Maastricht treaty by pledging a war of attrition against the government once the legislation returns to the House of Commons. As the Labour party signalled that it would oppose any move by Mr Major to 'guillotine', or limit discussion, on the legislation, the Euro-sceptics promised an avalanche of amendments as part of a wrecking campaign. Some will demand a referendum while others will aim to qualify ratification of the treaty by demanding additional parliamentary approval if it results in the transfer of powers to Brussels. The prime minister's move to reassert his authority on the subject of Europe marked the start of a protracted tactical battle between government whips and the rebel MPs over the legislation. The first encounter will be the planned debate on the principle of ratification later this month. That will be followed at the turn of the year by the much longer line-by-line debate. As Mr Major worked on his speech to the Conservative party conference next Friday in Brighton, ministers stepped up the offensive to rally all but the hardened Euro-sceptics behind his stand. The whips meanwhile were promising what one admitted would be a 'ruthless' campaign to isolate the opponents. But the Tory rebels were cheered by Labour's commitment to fight any government attempt to curtail debate. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's deputy leader, said yesterday that it would be 'outrageous' for ministers to try to impose a guillotine. There were signs that the Lib-eral Democrats' pro-European stance might not prevent them opposing a guillotine. That would put the government's majority of 21 severely at risk. The Euro-sceptics are convinced that unless the government can limit debate, the bill will be lost. Government whips, however, are already working on ways to detach the less committed rebels. By contrast, the Euro-sceptics claim that while some of the 80 Tory MPs who signed a Commons motion calling for a 'fresh start' on Europe after the Danish referendum result have bowed to pressure from the whips, a large proportion are prepared to hold firm. They will seek to table emergency motions at the party conference to rally support for their stance. Major defiant, Page 7 Quiet alliance marred, Page 8 Fears grow over coal job cuts, Page 6</p>

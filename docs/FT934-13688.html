			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wall St helps drug shares THE Wall Street factor was one of the main forces fuelling a strong performance in pharmaceutical issues yesterday as US investors boosted confidence in the sector. In London, drugs stocks got off to a confident start on the back of a good overnight performance in the US market. Positive sentiment in the US was boosted by good results from American Home Products and ripples from Merck, which had announced its results the previous day. Currency considerations with the strength of the dollar also pulled in some US buyers to the stocks. SmithKline Beecham 'A' also had the boost of satisfactory results and moved ahead 9 to 414p. Glaxo appreciated 13 1/2 to 694 1/2 p and Zeneca advanced 24 to 777p. One analyst put some of Zeneca's gain down to a shortage of stock, however. Wellcome, which continues to benefit from interest ahead of its New Orleans conference later this week, gained 9 at 775p. Its results are due at the end of next week.</p>

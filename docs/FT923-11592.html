			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (2): Rich agricultural region gears up for change - Irrigation will have far-reaching effects on farming WHETHER it is the water melons of Diyarbakir, the apricots in Malatya or Gaziantep's famous pistachio nuts, the 'Antep fistigi', Turkey's south-east region, is already well known for its farm products. With the advent of modern irrigation methods, the area promises to become a bread-basket for cereals and vegetables and an industrial greenhouse for horticultural products and exotic export crops. The first 40,000 hectares on the Harran plain adjoining the Syrian border will be brought into the scheme next summer, or when water levels in the Ataturk reservoir allow. From a figure of less than 4 per cent today, the Gap area when complete will account for a third of Turkey's public and private lands under irrigation. For the agronomists and soil scientists trying to anticipate these changes from the research centre at Cukurova University near Adana, the challenge is considerable. Remote sensing of the region's soil populations is not yet complete. Research has started on possible crop patterns, vital if those soils are to be properly conserved. The farmers, long used to rain-fed agriculture, have still to learn the new techniques of irrigated farming. As the region's humidity increases, so pest problems will multiply. This will mean more pesticide and other requirements, which will increase the farmers' need for capital, putting new pressure on existing credit systems. More broadly, it will mean the government will have to reassess its subsidy policy if, as seems likely, much of the surplus farm production is to compete in export markets. Whatever the policy choices, the Gap project, with 1.7m ha coming under irrigation, is set to transform the region's economy. Today, farmers face a six-month dry season. Few can cultivate more than one cash harvest a year. With irrigation, two or perhaps three annual harvests will be possible. But as farm outputs increase, farm incomes will also rise. The project will create demand for seeds. Many of the big foreign names have already invested in the area, using sophisticated technologies to produce hybrids, which they sell on a royalty basis to state and private seed retailers. Longer term, the project will provide the raw material for industries such as cotton ginning and textiles or processed food canning, cigarette production and sugar refining. About four fifths of the Gap's 5.2m people are in farming. Some regions are more intensively farmed than others. Sanliurfa, for example, has 450,000ha of first class land, compared with just 22,000ha in Siirt province. Moreover, the proportion of available land under cultivation is much higher than the national average in the south-east provinces, another indication of the scarcity of alternative employment. Among the project's eight provinces, only the economy of Gaziantep is not dominated by agriculture. The region's cold winters, while unsuited to citrus, are ideal for other fruits and vegetables. Large quantities of pomegranates, almonds and sesame find their way to Turkey's markets. The remote mountainous area around Siirt, the most easterly of the Gap provinces, produces more than 15 per cent of Turkey's pomegranate crop. Given water supplies, improvements in marketing, and other modern inputs, the authorities predict that from the Harran plain alone the project will add more than Dollars 5bn to Turkey's annual agricultural export earnings. The government master-plan, drawn up by the Japanese firm Nippon Koei, envisages 'step wise' implementation of the irrigation services, given the limited capacity for on-farm development. The plan is based on the cultivation of cereals, pulses and cotton and three other crop types - oil seeds, fruit and vegetables and forage crops, and feed grains for livestock production. Crop rotation, a practice which is unknown in rain-fed areas, is being introduced. Winter vegetables, oilseed and pulses, will be alternated with cotton as the summer crop, for example. The plan foresees that the area under wheat and pulses will be dominant, but that cotton production will rapidly expand as irrigation services become available. According to official projections, the Gap will increase Turkish wheat production by more than 50 per cent, barley by a similar figure and the production of cotton by more than four times by 2005, when full irrigation is expected to be operating. This will add some 60 per cent to Turkey's current cotton output. Infrastructure will be an initial constraint. Roads and railway links, a key factor in the transport of perishables, are not yet developed. Storage capacity is limited and, according to Mr Onur Erkan, the economics professor at Cukurova, there is not a single packing plant in the Gap region. As for the the broader environmental impact, this is a subject which has yet to be properly addressed. The Gap authority contracts a number of specialist consultancy firms. The German firm AFC is studying market strategy - how to sell the expected food surpluses, which crops should be encouraged, and which export markets should be targeted. Tubitak, the Turkish science research institute, is looking at credit mechanisms for the Gap. Cheap credit is an important ingredient in Turkish agriculture policy, but it also represents an increasing burden on the budget. The French group Compagnie National Bas Rhone Lanquedoc is surveying the main canal system. Alexander Gibb, the only UK concern working in the Gap, has a contract to look at the road network. Alexander Gibb is also one of several companies likely to bid on a irrigation management contract, which the Gap authorities say will go to tender later this month. The project will look at issues which include the extension skills that will be needed as farmers change to irrigated techniques. The choice of irrigation is perhaps the most pressing issue. Following recommendations by Rhone Lanquedoc, on the regulation of the main canals, the Gap authorities have modified the system on the Harran plain to increase water conservation, but the main system will remain a network of open canals, which will be subject to greater water loss through evaporation. However, considerable apprehension remains, particularly given the increased salinity associated with large scale gravity or surface irrigation programmes. Professor Osman Tekinel, dean of the Cukurova Agricultural University, says the farmers should be left to decide. An expert on irrigated farming, Prof Tekinel believes farmers will upgrade to the more water-efficient sprinkler and drip methods once labour rates pick up and they begin to reap the financial benefits of yield improvements. None of these issues seems insurmountable, given adequate time and research. But with the first hectares due to come under irrigation next year, when the colossal Urfa tunnels come into operation, there is a growing urgency to find solutions.</p>

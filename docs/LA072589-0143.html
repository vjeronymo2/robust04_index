			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NEW GINGRICH COMPLAINT PROBED  </P> <P> The House Ethics Committee, already studying a complaint against Rep. Newt  Gingrich (R-Ga.), may also look into his decision to double the salaries of  aides who worked on his political campaigns without pay, the committee's senior  Republican said today.  </P> <P> "We'll have to take a look at it. . . . The committee will review it. . . .  That's all I can say," Rep. John T. Myers (R-Ind.), said. Asked if he had made  similar pay changes among his staff, he replied, "I sure haven't."  </P> <P> A report in the Washington Times by the Atlanta Business Chronicle said today  that Gingrich temporarily increased the salaries of two staff members after  they returned from a leave spent working on his 1988 reelection campaign.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Swearing-in ceremony of Gustavo Roosen, new presidential </F> commissioner for the reform of the financial system, by  President Rafael Caldera at the Miraflores Presidential Palace;  date not given; broadcast in progress--recorded]    [Text] [Caldera]...Gustavo Roosen has been designated as  the presidential commissioner for the reform of the financial  system. Do you solemnly swear to faithfully uphold the  Constitution and comply with the duties assigned to you?    [Roosen] Yes.    [Caldera] If so, may God and the fatherland reward you. If  not, may you answer to them.    The national government is aware of the importance of the  delicate task assigned to Dr. Gustavo Roosen with this  appointment and has to thank him for his willingness to serve  the country by first taking on the presidency of the Banco  Latino Board of Trustees and by now accepting this appointment,  which will increase his responsibilities and duties.    The financial system's problem has been perhaps one of the  most dire and serious problems encountered by the government I  have presided over since starting my term in office. I must  admit that Dr. Gustavo Roosen has been fundamental in giving  Venezuelans the necessary confidence in this system, which is  indispensable for the economic existence of any country. On this  issue too, the affirmation of a fact--of which we are totally  convinced and have clearly stated--has stood out: Social  solidarity is indispensable, and in this case it has worked.    Although we have had difficulties appointing the General  Bank  superintendent and the president of FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee  and Banking Protection Fund] due to the restrictions of the law,  which was promulgated during the past government to select those  officials, and, although the partial reform of the emergency law  proposed by the Executive Branch is still pending, I have to  admit that had we not achieved a basic understanding between the  Executive and Legislative Branches, between the financial and  the public sectors, and between the consumers and those  responsible for the management of the country's life, Venezuela  would not have been able to handle such a complicated, delicate,  and difficult situation as the one we have confronted. However,  we have to emphasize that the revival of confidence is a fact.  We have recovered that confidence despite the fact that  sometimes statements and proposals were presented, perhaps a bit  too hastily, which jeopardized the country's trust in its  banking institutions.    We must still--it is undeniable--anticipate and solve many  serious problems before we can really say we have definitely  recovered solidity in this sector, which is so very important to  the country's life. Thus, I have wanted to highlight the  decision we have now made. Dr. Gustavo Roosen will work closely  with the national government, especially with the finance  minister who, according to the Banking and Financial  Institutions Law, has direct responsibilities in this field. On  our part, we will offer Roosen all the necessary support and  cooperation in his tasks, which are to benefit the country. I  wish to reiterate that the country's immense fiscal and  financial sacrifices to save the financial system have been made  to benefit the people, the account holders. They have been made  so that all those who participate in the complicated activities  of the economy can have confidence in the system and have a  trustworthy, satisfactory mechanism or institution that will  allow things to march as they should.    I want to thank Dr. Roosen for accepting this mission and to  express my confidence that the Executive Branch's decision to  appoint him special commissioner for the reform of the financial  system will contribute decisively to strengthening the current  favorable opinion regarding this problem.</p>

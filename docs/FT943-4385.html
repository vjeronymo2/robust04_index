			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / PM fails to woo hardline sceptics Rightwing Conservative MPs yesterday gave a mixed response to Mr John Major's speech on the future of the European Union, in which the prime minister denounced calls by French and German politicians for the creation of an 'inner core' of European states. By taking a tough stand on Wednesday against a 'two-tier Europe,' Mr Major impressed those Tory MPs who had feared that France and Germany were bidding to dominate the European Union. Mr Jim Cran, a prominent Euro-sceptic MP, said he was 'very pleased indeed' that the prime minister was pressing home his call for a more flexible European constitution in which member states could choose those parts of the European Union project in which they wished to participate. 'I am getting more and more confident that the prime minister shares my views,' he said, 'though I will wait to see how this is matched by deeds in the run-up to the Inter-Governmental Conference (in 1996).' However, other Tory right-wingers were far less impressed by the speech, saying that the party's policy on Europe was now more confused than ever. Mr Ian Duncan-Smith, one of the most Euro-sceptic MPs in the party, admitted Mr Major had 'at long last recognised that there is powerful push for central government inside the European community.' But the speech was 'too little, too late,' the Maastricht treaty had already committed Europe to moving in a highly centralised direction. 'Nothing short of rewriting the Maastricht treaty and returning powers to national parliaments will convince me that we are on the right course,' he said. A Gallup poll in The Daily Telegraph today gives Labour another record lead over the Tories. Labour support is unchanged from a month ago at 56.5 per cent but the Conservatives have dropped one point to 22 per cent. Liberal Democrat support was 17 per cent, compared with 14.5 per cent. The survey was based on a sample of 1,045 voters.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: DEATH, TAXES -- SEQUELS  </P> <P> "Rocky V" finally begins production for United Artists in early November,  re-teaming director John Avildsen (from the very first "Rocky") with Sylvester  Stallone. This one has Rocky playing mentor to a kid named Danny Durrock, a  product of foster homes and a prison stint. When Danny (not yet cast) returns  to his errant ways, it's up to you-know-who to set him straight.  </P> <P> But not in the ring, Stallone tells us. He said this one will wrap "with the  biggest street fight since 'The Quiet Man.' " It's due next May. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

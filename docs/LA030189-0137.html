			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NORTH KNEW HE WAS BOUND BY LAW -- SINGLAUB  </P> <P> A retired general testified at Oliver L. North's trial today that he and the  former Marine lieutenant colonel decided in 1985 "to assume the worst" -- that  North's actions were covered by a law forbidding official U.S. aid to the  Nicaraguan resistance.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, however, a prosecution witness, Robert W. Owen, testified  that he made many trips between Washington and Central America for North,  carrying instructions from the presidential aide for how the guerrilla war was  to be fought, and carrying maps and money.  </P> <P> Owen said North told him he acted with the knowledge and approval of superiors.  The courier testified at one point that North said he had then-President Ronald  Reagan's approval, but he said later that testimony was wrong, that North never  got more specific than "superiors."  </P> <P> </P> <P> General Not Restricted  </P> <P> Retired Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, an ardent anti-communist who directed spy  activities in three wars, said he and North agreed their actions should be  governed by the assumption that North was covered by the congressional Boland  Amendment, meaning Singlaub would work with the Contras and North would merely  be kept informed.  </P> <P> The retired general helped raise millions of dollars for the Contras -- some  from foreign countries.  </P> <P> Singlaub was the fourth witness in the trial which resumed despite serious,  still-unresolved, national security issues that halted testimony for nearly two  days.  </P> <P> Defense lawyer Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. has renewed a motion to declare that a  federal law designed to protect state secrets from being divulged in the  courtroom is unconstitutional as applied to the North case.  </P></p>

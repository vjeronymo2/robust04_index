			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures recover SHORT-DATED sterling futures bounced sharply yesterday after the pound staged a mild recovery against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges, writes James Blitz. Throughout the week, the March contract has been steadily bid down to yesterday's low of 93.91 as dealers continue to assume that the pound's weakness eliminates any chance of a cut in UK base rates. The March contract recovered yesterday to close at 94.01, partly reflecting sterling's rise above the the historic lows that were reached in foreign exchange trading on Wednesday. One London-based dealer said that it would be hard to push the contract below 93.75, because dealers buying the contract below this level would be assuming some tightening of monetary policy by the middle of next month. However, another dealer suggested that the contract could easily move 50 basis points either way in the next few weeks. 'The pound is so weak that you cannot exclude the possibility that base rates will rise in the next few weeks,' he said. Dealing in the cash market was relatively quiet and 3-month money again closed at around 6 1/8 per cent. However, a very large shortage is expected today and, according to one dealer, 'it could be pretty nasty.' With the end of the month approaching, liquidity conditions in money markets are always tight. However, one dealer said that a large number of bills are due to be drawn by corporates and institutions today, and the discount houses will have plenty to offer the Bank of England. However, if the shortage is very large, the Bank may be under pressure to offer a shorter-dated repurchase to ease conditions. European interest rate markets were quiet. German call money rose sharply to over 9 per cent yesterday after the Bundesbank drew a large amount of liquidity in its weekly money market operations on Wednesday. However, the Bundesbank's move was only technical, designed to ease the transfer to easier reserve requirements after this weekend. The March Euromark contract closed 5 basis points higher at 91.88. The steady drip-drip of the March French franc contract continued: it closed at 88.13, down 5 basis points on the day.</p>

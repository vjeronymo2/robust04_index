			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television 'Unashamedly biased. And unashamedly jaundiced.' John MacUre is the writer of Cardiac Arrest (9.30 BBC1) a new six-part drama series about working in the NHS, He adds: 'It is a tale that any junior doctor will tell.' He should know - he is himself a practising junior doctor. In the first episode, a young houseman's idealised sense of health care buckles under the weight of a chaotic system trying to save lives - including the NHS's. 'People will hope it is make-believe. But it's not,' Doctor MacUre says bleakly. Oh, really? Tell us about it. Before plunging into a sea of medical troubles, brace yourself with Class Act (9.00 ITV), which continues the comic adventures of a mismatched trio starring the lovely and talented Joanna Lumley. Romance is in the air this evening - but is it the real thing? Who cares - Miss Lumley is real enough for anyone to love. And if you want to stick around long enough for another dose of professional angst, Street Legal (12.35am ITV) is a Canadian drama series which follows the personal and professional lives of four trial lawyers.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY;  </P> <P> KICKING THEIR WAY TOWARD EXPERIENCE;  </P> <P> DANCE: THEY AREN'T PROFESSIONALS, AND DON'T PRETEND TO BE. THE NEW LA  JOLLA-BASED ENSEMBLE OF YOUNG DANCERS IS CONTENT TO HAVE A PLATFORM ON WHICH TO  PERFORM.  </P> <P> Patricia Hoffmann thinks she has found a niche to be filled in the local dance  scene. Young dancers who are somewhere between the student and professional  level need a platform on which to perform.  </P> <P> Hoffmann realizes she's fighting several factors, including paltry support for  home-grown dance troupes and a paucity of male dancers, but she's got  confidence in Jazzart Dance Company.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the newest troupe of her West Coast Ballet will debut with a pair  of performances at La Jolla High School's Parker Auditorium. Curtain times are  2:30 and 8 p.m.  </P> <P> But, as Hoffman, the former director of the defunct San Diego Ballet, explained  in an interview last week, Jazzart harbors no lofty goals for professional  status -- at least for now.  </P> <P> "We're just a training ground to give opportunities to choreographers and  teen-age students," she said. "Most dancers will still leave (when they  mature), and the best I feel we can do is to give them experience.  </P> <P> That's not really different from the other dance companies around, she said.  "We're just one of the first ones to acknowledge what we are. We're not calling  it a professional company, just a well-trained one."  </P> <P> According to Hoffman's description of the fledgling ensemble, "Jazzart is  primarily a jazz group, but all our students study ballet, and some study  modern and tap."  </P> <P> Consequently, for Jazzart's maiden concert, Hoffman has enlisted a strong cadre  of nine choreographers to create a slate of works that will show off her  aspiring dancers in all their diversity.  </P> <P> This something-for-everyone show will feature jazz, compliments of Los  Angeles-based Jimmy Locust (whose credits include working with Michael  Jackson), contemporary ballet in Mieczyslaw (Misha) Morawski's upbeat mode, and  a taste of Lorna Diamond's brand of classical ballet.  </P> <P> Also on the roster is Pam Thompson's tap-happy work, a raucous rhythm piece for  the entire company, and a modern dance by Three's Company's Terri Shipman.  </P> <P> Guest artist Cameron English will wear two hats at this coming-out concert. The  former member of TV's "Fame" show and featured dancer in the film version of "A  Chorus Line," will strut his stuff in a jazzy solo. His dance designs for eight  dancers are also on the program.  </P> <P> "There will be about 28 kids and adults in the show," Hoffman said, "but this  is definitely not a school recital. We only have three men in the company, but  all the dancers are really coming along.  </P> <P> "We couldn't do justice to a professional company," she acknowledged. "This is  a semiprofessional youth company, and we're living up to that. We'll have to  impress (the public) before we can build it up any further."  </P></p>

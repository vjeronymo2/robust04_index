			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: UK tops November government bond league Gilts were the top performing government bonds last month showing a return of 2.15 per cent in local currency terms, followed by Japanese government bonds (with gains of 2.07 per cent) and Belgian government debt (2.05 per cent), according to figures compiled by JP Morgan Securities. The UK government bond market was boosted by favourable inflation news and a 0.5 percentage point cut in the base rate to 5.5 per cent a week ahead of the Budget. Gilt returns since the start of the year have amounted to 17.76 per cent. Continuing signs of economic weakness and a sharp fall in the Tokyo stock market fuelled hopes of an easing in interest rates by the Bank of Japan and drove the Japanese government bond market higher last month. Among continental European bond markets, Belgium turned in the strongest performance in November, propelled by government measures to curb social spending, keep wage increases under control and tackle unemployment. The measures enabled the Belgian central bank cut its key interest rates. Italy showed the worst performance last month with a loss of 2.17 per cent, mainly in response to the municipal election results, which sent foreign investors scurrying out of Italian government paper. However, the high-yielding bond markets of Spain and Italy have been the top-performers since the start of the year in local currency terms, with returns of 28.26 per cent and 25.25 per cent respectively.</p>

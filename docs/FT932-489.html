			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Court questions redrawing of voting districts THE US Supreme Court yesterday called into question the redrawing of congressional electoral boundaries so as to ensure greater representation for minorities. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the 5-4 majority, said 'racial classifications of any sort pose the risk of lasting harm to our society'. Racial gerrymandering, even for remedial purposes, demanded close judicial scrutiny, she said. The court, which earlier this year had ruled that the creation of minority districts did not violate the 1965 Voting Rights Act, sent back to the lower federal courts a challenge brought by five white voters in North Carolina who claimed they had suffered discrimination as a result of redrawing of electoral districts by the state legislature in 1991. Justice O'Connor did not uphold this claim per se, but advised that such reapportionment should not be so 'irrational that it can be understood only as an effort to segregate voters. . . because of their race'. One of the two new North Carolina districts has a bizarre 160-mile elongated shape. Last year's elections saw contests in more than 20 new districts nationwide with black or Hispanic majorities. As a result 13 new black and six new Hispanic members of congress were returned, bringing total representation to a record 38 blacks and 17 Hispanics in the House. Both new North Carolina seats elected blacks. The fine division on this case underlines how evenly the court is now balanced. Of the three pivotal moderates, Justice Anthony Kennedy joined Justice O'Connor in the conservative majority while Justice David Souter was among the dissenters. So was Justice Byron White, who retires this summer and who is due to be replaced, pending Senate confirmation, by Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, President Bill Clinton's nominee.</p>

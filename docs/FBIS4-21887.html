			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Benoit Charpentier report: "France Is Supply Base for </F> Islamic Salvation Front"]    [Text] With caution made obligatory by the Kraouche  syndrome, police officers are continuing their investigations  into the branches of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] in  France. Careful to avoid any shows of triumph, they recently  arrested two suspected sympathizers of the Islamic Salvation  Front in Lille.    At Place Beauvau, as in the 14th Antiterrorist Brigade of  the  Paris public prosecutor's office, the affair is considered to be  "important." Chaib E., an Algerian national, and Ahmed S., a 27  year-old Frenchman, were imprisoned by Judge Bruguiere for  "criminal involvement in terrorist action."    In the course of a drugs investigation, police officers of  the Lille regional Crime Squad seized over 1,000 blank Algerian  administrative documents and a number of weapons.    Drugs, the FIS, and false papers -- this increasingly common  cocktail sheds light on both the way in which the fundamentalist  movement is set up in France and the way in which drugs have  become a scourge of the Lille region in such a short period of  time. Its closeness to Amsterdam is a principal reason.  <H5>  Heroin and Illegal Immigrants </H5>   In the opinion of one judge, "the Lille metropolitan region  is an ideal hub for drugs traffickers." Last December,  investigators dismantled a major network of heroin dealers,  implicating 47 people, most of them illegal immigrants. They  had already been working for several weeks on a new heroin line  when they were taken in for questioning on 21 and 22 March.  Chaib and Ahmed were ringleaders of a flourishing network that  offloaded at least 1 kg of heroin every 10 days and which has  since led to the questioning of 25 people, most of whom have  been placed under a committal order. This large- scale  operation had several surprises in store.    During the raid on Chaib's home, Crime Squad officers  dicovered 500 blank Algerian identity cards and 600 blank  attestations from the High Commission of Algerian national  service. On the same day they arrested Ahmed, and in a raid on  his home in Persan-en-Beaumont in Val-d'Oise [Paris region],  they found an Israeli-made Galil assault rifle, handguns,  primers and boxes of cartridges for 9-mm automatic weapons,  stamps for manufacturing false documents, a batch of Algerian  adminstrative documents, and documents written in Arabic. The  latter are now being examined by Judge Bruguiere after having  been passed on to the 6th Division of the Central Crime Squad by  the Interior Ministry in Paris.    These papers immediately attracted the attention of  antiterrorist experts in the capital.    They allegedly prove that the two traffickers are members of  the FIS. A senior government official in Paris stated: "The  FIS does not issue membership cards."    Their fingers burnt for reasons that are only too-well  known,  the police prefer to ironically talk of suspected sympathizers.  Chaib and Ahmed are, however, thought to belong to the French  Algerian Fraternity [FAF], one of the FIS' subgroupings which  was jointly led by Djaffar El Houari and Moussa Kraouche, who  was also its spokesman. The Lille region appears to be a happy  hunting-ground for the Islamic fundemntalists. As a judge  remarked: "It opens directly onto Belgium and the Netherlands."  Fundamentalism has developed considerably among the region's  60,000 Muslims, most of whom live in the Roubaix-Tourcoing zone.  This area has a number of makeshift places of worship as well  as eight real mosques, some of which regularly welcome over  1,000 worshippers. The Koran schools are overflowing, and the  Chador is increasingly worn by adolescents.    Already on several occasions, police officials have swooped  on this fertile FIS area. Eight people were taken in for  questioning during the national haul of last November, while on  1 March, accused of the same "criminal involvement in terrorist  action," eight more suspects appeared in Lille before an  Investigation Commission led by Parisian Judge Roger Le Loire.  All to no avail.  <H5>  `Afghans' </H5>   Magistrates and the police now almost dare to hope that,  with  the arrest of Chaib and Ahmed, they will finally be able to  unravel the threads of a web that seems to be getting more and  more complex as the months go by.    The Kraouche affair proved that there is very little  evidence  to catch supposed members of the FIS red-handed. A judge who  knows these cases well said: "We cannot talk of a centralized  organization. There are almost as many FIS and Armed Islamic  Group [GIA] cells as there are regions, even if most  fundamentalists are to be found in the Paris region, Orleans,  and, now, Lille." Neither the FIS nor the GIA present a united  front.    Leading the way in terrorist action in Algeria, the GIA  claimed responsibility for the murder of two French surveyors on  21 September in Sidi Bel Abbes, and the taking hostage of three  other French citizens. Its most fanatical members -- which  inlcude the "Afghans," Algerian Islamic fundamentalists who  fought in Afghanistan -- cannot even be controlled by the  fundamentalist leaders. These fanatics even planned the  assassination of Rabah Khebir, the FIS spokesman exiled in  Germany.    Judge Bruguiere's investigation will attempt to find out  whether Chaib and Ahmed played an active organizational role.  An analysis of the weapons seized should reveal whether they  were used in France in hold-ups or to settle scores, or even if  they have been used in Algeria -- unless, of course, the two  suspects turn out to be mere pawns. A Parisian official in the  antiterrorist squad told us: "Many people orbit the FIS, going  about their own business, drugs or something else, but helping  the fundamentalists out with gifts or false documents. Unlike  the Kurdish Workers' Party [PKK], we cannot formally say that  the FIS is financed by drugs in France, unless it is indirectly."  <H5>  Algerians Seeking Asylum </H5>   In 1993, France recorded a rise in the number of asylum  seekers from Algeria and Egypt, according to the latest figures  from the Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless  Persons (OFPRA). According to the OFPRA, the rise in the number  of requests by Algerian nationals (1,098 in 1993, as opposed to  144 in 1990) "is probably due to the arrival of people fleeing  local instability and persecution by the FIS." However, "as is  the case for Egyptian requests (up 249 percent)," the rise in  requests could also be "linked to the reinstitution" of economic  emigration channels.</p>

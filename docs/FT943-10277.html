			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Italian statesman who broke political mould: Obituary, Giovanni Spadolini Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the Republican politician and intellectual who was one of the leading figures in post-war Italy, died in a Rome hospital yesterday aged 69. Politicians from all parties paid tribute to his career as Republican politician, contemporary historian, newspaper editor and latterly as bon vivant elder statesman. His body was brought to lie in state in the Senate, where he was a life senator and speaker from 1987 until this year. Mr Spadolini was the first prime minister from outside the Christian Democrat party in the post-war republic. He was appointed in 1981 to head a five-party coalition after Italy's political establishment was shaken by the scandal of the P2 secret masonic lodge, a parallel power structure controlled by the shadowy figure of Mr Licio Gelli. His strong personality held the coalition together for 405 days before being reshuffled. It then lasted another 82 days. Three times a minister in different governments, he latterly played an important role as speaker of the Senate, enlivening debate with his erudition and crusty humour. After the March general elections he challenged the new Berlusconi government to retain the speaker's post, losing by a single vote. Mr Spadolini was born in Florence and began his public life as an academic teaching contemporary history, subsequently producing more than 60 books, mostly on this subject. He switched to journalism and at 30 became the editor of Il Resto di Carlino. After 13 years on the central Italian daily newspaper he moved to edit the prestigious Corriere della Sera. He always regarded himself as an intellectual on loan to the world of politics and entered politics comparatively late, in 1972, being elected as an independent senator in the Republican lists. Mr Spadolini took on the leadership of the Republican party in 1979 on the death of Mr Ugo La Malfa and held the post for eight years. His death will be a great loss to the Republicans who are struggling to find a role in Italy's fast-evolving political landscape.</p>

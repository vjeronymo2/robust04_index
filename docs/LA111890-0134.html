			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A SENSITIVE ARTICLE  </P> <P> Nora Zamichow's recent article ("In a Second, His Life Changed for the Worse,"  Nov. 12) on head injury survivor John Joseph Luz and his family was  outstanding. As the parent of a daughter who sustained a traumatic head injury  at age 16, and as president of the San Diego Head Injury Foundation, I read  avidly any news coverage given this topic.  </P> <P> Ms. Zamichow's work was exceptional in that she captured the pain, frustration  and "torment," as Mr. Luz so thoughtfully put it, of life after head injury,  with all its attendant cognitive and physical impairments. It was a most  sensitive article.  </P> <P> Head injury survivors and their family members need a great deal of support  from loved ones and friends, and from self-help organizations such as ours.  </P> <P> The San Diego Head Injury Foundation offers a monthly newsletter, educational  meetings, support groups and an informational telephone line: (619) 569-5699.  We invite your readers with questions to call.  </P> <P> PATRICIA MARSHALL  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> San Diego Head Injury Foundation  </P></p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Pay curb 'to hit living standards' WORKERS covered by the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector settlement pay limit will start experiencing cuts in living standards when the limit is implemented for most groups this autumn, according to the latest analysis from the Public Finance Foundation. The foundation, an independent research body, says most public servants will receive the 1.5 per cent rise at a time when inflation will be back to 3 per cent and private-sector pay will be rising at about 4 per cent. The foundation estimates that by next January inflation will be up to 4 per cent and private-sector pay to 5 per cent. Although the public-sector limit has so far been accepted with little opposition, Mr Chris Trinder, the foundation's research director, says that could change when the depressant effect on real earnings - combined with next year's increase in National Insurance - starts to become apparent. He also warns the government against the temptation of imposing a second year of a settlement limit just because the first year has run so smoothly. The Fire Brigades Union is, so far, the only big group to threaten resistance to the limit. The RMT transport union is also holding a strike ballot of its British Rail members against the limit but officials do not believe they will win a strike mandate. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, was strongly committed to not repeating the fixed settlement limit. Since his departure officials have continued to insist that, while there must be no 'catch-up' on public-sector pay, there will be a more flexible approach next year. The Confederation of British Industry, which was an important influence behind this year's 1.5 per cent limit, is also keen to see a mixture of restraint and flexibility. CBI officials say they want to see a ceiling on public-sector organisations' pay bills, rather than on each individual's pay rise. Northumbrian Water yesterday announced that it is extending into a fourth year its agreement to give pay increases pegged to the inflation rate. The previous RPI agreement had covered 1991-1992 to 1993-1994. 'The company council deserves credit for this forward-looking agreement and it is good news for both the employees and the company', said Dr Jon Hargreaves, Northumbrian Water managing director.</p>

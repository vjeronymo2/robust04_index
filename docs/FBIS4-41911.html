			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 28 Jun -- "I am not yet president and so many  people have already gathered," said Ukrainian presidential  candidate Leonid Kuchma opening a news conference on the results  of the first round of the elections.    A representative of the presidential candidate's team at the  news conference said the outcome of the first round demonstrated  that "the new course proposed by Kuchma enjoys popularity among  the people." The candidate himself added: "It also shows that  most of the other deputies are using none other than my program  in the preelection contest."    Leonid Kuchma underscored that opportunities to use the  state  mass media in the preelection campaign were not equal. Asked  about his own use of the private mass media in Donetsk and Kiev  and his appearance on Ostankino TV, Mr. Kuchma replied that  "Leonid Kravchuk did it on a much larger scale".    The outcome of the election in Crimea was described by Mr.  Kuchma as crucial. There, as we know, over 83 percent of the  electorate voted in favor of his candidacy. "Crimea has proved  to be an absolutely normal part of Ukraine," Leonid Kuchma said.    "My aim is not winning. My aim is, under the conditions of  an information blockade, communicating to the public at large my  own views and opinions on the situation in the state," Leonid  Kuchma concluded.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BEATHARD, O'NEAL TALK, BUT NOT ABOUT DEAL  </P> <P> Bobby Beathard, Charger general manager, and outside linebacker Leslie O'Neal  had a 30-minute meeting Wednesday, but talk was cheap. A new contract wasn't  discussed.  </P> <P> "We just sat around and talked," said O'Neal, a 20-day holdout. "I've seen him  once before, so this is the second time we've really even talked to each other.  </P> <P> "Sometimes you have to go out and make an extra effort so somebody can know a  little bit about you as a person, and they can feel comfortable dealing with  your situation."  </P> <P> Said Beathard: "He wasn't here to talk about his contract, he was just here to  talk. He seems real nice. I don't know if it helps negotiations."  </P> <P> O'Neal, who played in the Pro Bowl last season, said he thinks his agent,  Marvin Demoff, and the Chargers are close to an agreement but said he wouldn't  make predictions.  </P> <P> "It's a difficult situation for both parties involved," O'Neal said.  "(Beathard) really wasn't here last year to watch me play."  </P> <P> O'Neal sat out all of 1987 and half of 1988 with a knee injury. He played nine  games in '88, starting one, then returned to start all 16 games last season,  making 161 unassisted tackles.  </P> <P> Beathard is scheduled to meet with Demoff today.  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Guard Mike Simmonds dislocated his kneecap in the afternoon practice on  Wednesday and was taken from the field on a golf cart. Simmonds spent the  second half of last season on injured reserve after dislocating his kneecap  against the Washington Redskins on Oct. 22. "He'll be all right," Charger Coach  Dan Henning said. "I don't think it's that serious from what the doctor said."  . . . Henning said he would play his starters for about 50% of Saturday's  exhibition against the Rams in Anaheim. . . . Because of injuries, Henning said  outside linebacker Billy Ray Smith (bruised thigh) will have to be ready to  play Saturday, but he will be kept out of the game if possible. Tight end  Arthur Cox (strained back) is doubtful. . . . Henning said Thomas Sanders and  Rod Bernstine will get the majority of the work at running back Saturday, with  Ronnie Harmon and Darrin Nelson coming in on third-down situations. . . .  Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard said there were no further negotiations  on the contract of first-round draft pick Junior Seau, the linebacker from USC.  </P></p>

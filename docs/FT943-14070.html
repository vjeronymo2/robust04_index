			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Beijing cool on HK overtures Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister and vice-premier, reacted coolly yesterday to a suggestion by Mr Alistair Goodlad, British Foreign Office minister, that the two countries put behind them past disputes over Hong Kong's political reform and co-operate on other issues concerning the territory, Our Foreign Staff reports. Mr Qian also gave the impression of turning down a proposal by Britain's foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, that they should have an exchange of visits. Mr Goodlad told reporters in Beijing yesterday that he had had a long discussion on Hong Kong issues with Mr Qian's deputy, Mr Jiang Enzhu. 'I emphasised the need to put our past disagreements on constitutional matters behind us and to work together on the important agenda of issues that have to be addressed in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty in the interests of building up the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong,' Mr Goodlad said. Two hours later as Mr Goodlad was meeting Mr Qian, the Chinese foreign minister broke custom by answering two questions from a Hong Kong reporter about Mr Goodlad's remark. Mr Qian was asked whether China had said that, in the absence of political co-operation, there could be co-operation on other Hong Kong issues. Mr Qian said: 'We did not say things to that effect. If there is to be co-operation there should be comprehensive co-operation in all areas.' Asked about prospects for his talks with Mr Goodlad, Mr Qian laughed and said he could not answer this when they had only just met. Later the official Xinhua news service reported Mr Goodlad gave Mr Qian a message from Mr Hurd proposing an exchange of visits or a meeting between the two. Mr Qian reportedly replied 'what could be agreed on at present' was that they should meet when they were both in New York for a UN General Assembly meeting this year. A possible reason for his coolness is that the Chinese took umbrage at receiving a public sermon on the need to co-operate over Hong Kong.</p>

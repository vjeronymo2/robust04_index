			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Banknote sales help De La Rue rise 24% De La Rue, the security printer and cash-handling machine group, yesterday reported a 24 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, buoyed by particularly strong banknote sales. The group, which abandoned merger talks with Portals, the security paper maker, last week, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 129.8m in the year to March 31, up from Pounds 104.7m. Turnover from continuing operations grew by 7 per cent to Pounds 586.6m. The latest profits include a Pounds 6.1m net gain on disposals. Leaving this aside, pre-tax profits rose by 20.2 per cent to Pounds 123.7m. The shares closed up 16p at 859p. De La Rue held net cash of Pounds 267.7m at the year-end, well ahead of the previous March's Pounds 170.9m. Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive, said the group was continuing to look at acquisitions, but any purchase would have to be in a related area. He said all three divisions had pushed up sales, operating profits and margins. Operating profits from continuing operations increased by 25 per cent to Pounds 96.1m, underpinned by strong banknote demand from emerging nations. Excluding the Brazilian operations, which were sold during the year, the security printing division lifted sales by 16.4 per cent to Pounds 208.2m, while operating profits increased by 36 per cent to Pounds 50.6m. The division's margins widened from 20.8 to 24.3 per cent as a result of enhanced production efficiency, an improved mix of banknote work - including more sophisticated notes to beat counterfeiters - and favourable exchange rate movements. The payment systems division increased its sales, particularly in the US and continental Europe, except for Germany, and improved margins through the rationalisation of some of its manufacturing operations in Sweden and the US. Profits increased by 10.3 per cent to Pounds 40.5m on sales marginally ahead at Pounds 317.1m. The new transaction systems division, seen as a longer term source of growth, lifted sales by 12.4 per cent to Pounds 64.4m and profits by 72.4 per cent to Pounds 5m. Net interest receipts were slightly higher at Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 11.6m). Associates' profits increased 31.1 per cent to Pounds 15.6m. Earnings per share rose to 49.9p, against 38.8p. A final dividend of 14p is proposed, making a total of 20p, up from 17p. Lex, Page 24</p>

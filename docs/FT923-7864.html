			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / City's foreign earnings rose to Pounds 16.9bn last year BRITAIN'S financial in-stitutions boosted overseas earnings by 12.8 per cent to Pounds 16.9bn last year, underlining the importance of 'invisibles' to the economy and of the City's international role as a financial centre. The improvement largely reflected increased investment income, which rose almost 20 per cent to Pounds 10.5bn, according to a report from British Invisibles, an industry trade group. Services income rose just 3 per cent to Pounds 6.4bn. Even the insurance sector - dogged by underwriting losses at Lloyd's of London - saw a 24 per cent jump in earnings to Pounds 3.3bn as insurance brokers raised income by 12 per cent to a record Pounds 919m. The banking sector also made a schizophrenic showing, with a 7.9 per cent fall to Pounds 3.14bn in income from banking services outweighed by a 21 per cent rise to Pounds 4.6bn in investment income, to show an overall 7.5 per cent improvement between 1990 and last year. British Invisibles noted 'positive pointers' for the first half of this year, with informal forecasts that earnings would grow by at least 7 per cent. The UK is second only to the US as an exporter of invisibles - which encompass not only financial services, but tourism, information transfer and transport services, and remitted interest, profits and dividends. Last year these earned Pounds 117bn - significantly more than visible exports of Pounds 104.8bn - with interest, profits and dividends accounting for Pounds 75bn. This accounted for about 16 per cent of the Pounds 750bn total world trade in invisibles. The UK has a greater dependency on invisibles trade than any industrial country, with tradeable services accounting for 20.5 per cent of gross national product last year. This compares with 4.8 per cent of GNP in the US, and 5.6 per cent in Japan. Even last year, a year of recession in banking, 31 new banks opened a London office and 15 banks departed. The Baltic Exchange, which was devastated by an IRA bomb in April, lifted earnings by 7 per cent to Pounds 804m. Mr Peter Tudball, the exchange's chairman, said this confirmed the exchange's importance at the heart of the world shipping freight market. Dealers in London's securities markets lifted earnings by 23 per cent to Pounds 2.0bn, with a steep fall in commissions and fees being offset by portfolio investment income.</p>

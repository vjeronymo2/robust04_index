In considering the framework of existing regulatory constraints, the Agency's evaluation of alternatives will assume compliance with their provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, it will not be possible to factor in regulatory requirements that are still under development (e.g., more stringent requirements to control volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants under title I and title III of the CAA). In these instances, a substitute may be deemed acceptable under SNAP, but is not thereby excused from compliance with any future regulations. The Agency does not believe that it was the intent of Congress to use the authority under section 612 to compromise other regulatory requirements. Should future regulations severely limit the availability of the only acceptable substitute for a specific end-use, EPA would reconsider the advisability of keeping any other alternatives which could be used in that application on the list of unacceptable substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. EPA-Generated Review of Substitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to SNAP notifications received under section 612 for substitute review, the Agency is authorized by section 612(c) to add or delete alternatives to the list of reviewed substitutes on its own initiative. EPA has many efforts under way to identify and communicate the availability of promising new alternatives. These include support for research efforts to study and focus attention on future substitutes, involvement in the United Nations Environment Programme's biannual assessment of technologies for key sectors currently using ozone-depleting chemicals, and technology transfer projects with industry, other federal agencies, and developing nations. Based on information available through these activities, EPA may initiate review of new substitutes under section 612. In each case, the next planned quarterly  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice updating the status of SNAP determinations will inform the public that EPA is initiating a review, subject to the provisions discussed in this final rule. Similarly, determinations ultimately reached as a result of these internally-generated reviews will be included in these quarterly updates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Joint Review of New Substitutes under SNAP and TSCA PMN  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any potential SNAP submitter who intends to introduce a new chemical (i.e., a chemical not currently included in the TSCA inventory) as an alternative for a class I or class II chemical must undergo review not only under section 612, but under section 5 of TSCA (the Premanufacture Notice program) as well. Because of the overlap in statutory authority, the Agency has established a joint review process between the SNAP and TSCA Premanufacture Notice (PMN) programs. This process has been structured to minimize reporting burden and to ensure consistency in decisions between the two programs. The following sections describe the joint review and decision-making process in more detail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Data Submission Requirements and Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> SNAP and PMN forms.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has reviewed the data submission needs for the SNAP and PMN programs and found significant overlap. In general, the Agency has identified only a few additional data elements beyond those already required by the PMN program that should be included for review under the SNAP program. These elements are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ozone depletion potential. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Global warming potential. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cost of using the substitute, including: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Chemical replacement data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Chemical cost data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Incremental equipment expenditures (either new or retrofit) needed to use substitute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Information on the cost implications of changes in energy consumption (e.g., from the use of a less or more energy-efficient refrigerant). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Documentation of testing results regarding the flammability of substitutes, especially when proposed for consumer applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given this overlap, a submitter requesting a review under both the SNAP and PMN programs should provide the above information by following these steps:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Complete the PMN form (EPA Form 7710&hyph;25) following the Instructions Manual currently available through the TSCA Assistance Information Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Indicate on page 11 of the PMN form, ``Optional Pollution Prevention Information,'' that the chemical to be reviewed is also to be considered under the SNAP program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Complete a SNAP addendum that requests information only on those items listed above. (The addendum can be obtained from the SNAP program, or EPA's Stratospheric Ozone Protection Hotline.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The completed PMN form (EPA Form 7710&hyph;25) will remain the basis for all information needed to complete review of the new chemical under section 5 of TSCA. The completed PMN form and the SNAP addendum together will comprise the data submission for section 612 review and listing decisions for new chemicals. This approach is intended to minimize the reporting burden on submitters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency will modify the PMN Instructions Manual to provide more explicit direction on how to complete the SNAP addendum. A SNAP submitter may also consult the SNAP Guidance Manual, which is available from the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Hotline. Any questions regarding the completion of these forms can be directed to either the PMN Pre-notice Coordinator or the SNAP program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

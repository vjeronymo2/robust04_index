			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Two pits fail to attract bids Hopes ended yesterday for reviving two closed collieries, Bentley in Yorkshire and Rufford in Nottinghamshire, when British Coal said it had received no tenders from private operators to run them, Michael Smith writes. However, tenders have been received for Wearmouth, in the north-east of England, and Calverton, Nottinghamshire. Deadlines for tenders closed yesterday. Tenders for a further batch of four pits, the last which will be offered on a lease and licence basis, must be in by the end of the month. Five collieries where closure was announced by British Coal last week are likely to be offered for sale when the industry is privatised this year and next.</p>

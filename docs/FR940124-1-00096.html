			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 667.23&blank;SPRE Reviews of Institutions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;667.23, the Secretary proposes procedures regarding SPRE reviews of referred institutions. In general, if the Secretary refers an institution to a SPRE for review under &sect;667.5, or the SPRE selects an institution for review under &sect;667.6 and the Secretary approves that selection, the SPRE reviews, or arranges for the review of, that institution to determine whether the institution is in compliance with the State review standards described in &sect;667.21.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To implement the part of section 494C(d) of the HEA that requires a SPRE to review referred institutions in accordance with published State standards, in &sect;667.23(b), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE provide written notice of the State's established review standards to each institution in the State before the SPRE conducts reviews of referred institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;667.23(c), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE issue a report of its findings and provide it to the institution no later than 45 days after the SPRE completes its review. For each finding contained in the report, the SPRE must cite the standard violated and cite the nature of the violation. The SPRE may prescribe, if necessary, a course of action the institution must follow to correct the violation, or the SPRE may determine that the institution should no longer participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. If the SPRE chooses to prescribe a corrective action, the Secretary proposes to give the SPRE sole discretion to determine an appropriate period for the institution to correct the violation and bring itself into compliance with the State's review standards. Alternatively, if the SPRE determines that the institution should no longer participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, as provided in section 494C(h) of the HEA, the SPRE may initiate the process described in &sect;667.25, under which the Secretary ultimately terminates the institution's participation in those programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;667.23(d), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE give the institution an opportunity to respond to its findings and required actions. If the institution chooses to respond within the time permitted by the SPRE, in &sect;667.23(e), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE evaluate the institution's response and issue a final report to the institution that includes its findings and required action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 494C(h)(1) provides that a SPRE must notify the Secretary of its findings and the actions the SPRE is taking, or has taken, in response to those findings within a time period prescribed by the Secretary in regulations. Therefore, in &sect;667.23(f), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE provide to the Secretary a copy of its final report to an institution within 30 days of its issuance to the institution. A final report includes the report that the SPRE produces after the institution responds to its initial findings. However, if the institution does not respond to the SPRE's initial report in the time permitted by the SPRE, the SPRE's initial report becomes its final report on the day after the deadline date provided to the institution for responding to that report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;667.23(g), the Secretary proposes that a SPRE may determine that an institution should no longer participate in the Title IV, HEA programs for reasons other than the institution's failure to meet the State's review standards. Specifically, a SPRE may initiate a proceeding to effect the termination of the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs under &sect;667.25, if that institution_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Does not respond to the SPRE's findings or required actions within the time permitted by the SPRE and the SPRE's findings show serious violations of the State's standards; (2) Does not allow SPRE personnel at the institution; or (3) Fails to provide SPRE officials with prompt access to its documents and records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary wishes to make clear that these proposed regulations do not require a SPRE to take specific actions against an institution that fails to meet a State's review standards. The Secretary believes strongly that SPREs be afforded the latitude to prescribe appropriate corrective actions, or, if the SPRE finds that an institution has continuously or egregiously violated the State's standards, make the determination that the institution should no longer participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. On the other hand, the Secretary would be concerned if a SPRE failed consistently to prescribe appropriate and adequate corrective actions for institutions that did not satisfy the State's standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

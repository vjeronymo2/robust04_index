During January-March of this year enterprises reduced output  of products by more than one-third in the cities of Babarinsk,  Iskitim, Kuybyshev, and Tatarsk, and in Vengerovskiy,  Dovolenskiy, Karasukskiy, Kupinskiy, Kolyvanskiy, Moshkovskiy,  Ordynskiy, Suzunskiy, Severnyy, Chanovskiy, Chulymskiy, and  Chistoozernyy Rayons.    The scale of the reduction of the physical volume of  production during January-March of this year differed  significantly in the various branches: In ferrous  metallurgy--about 65 percent; nonferrous metallurgy, the  chemical and petrochemical industry, machine-building,  milling-cereal and manufactured concentrated feed industry--from  41 to 48 percent; light industry, the timber, wood processing,  and the pulp and paper industry, and the construction materials  industry--from 31 to 39 percent; and the food industry--14  percent.    Production decreased as follows:    --in the fuel industry: coal (by 5.1 percent);    -in electric energy engineering: hydroelectric energy (by  11.9 percent);    --ferrous metallurgy: finished rolled metal (80.4 percent),  nonrusting sheet steel (57.2 percent), rolled sheet metal (83.8  percent), cold rolled steel belts (74.8 percent), steel (45.8  percent), ferrous metals (80.9 percent), seamless pipes (90.8  percent), and electric welded items (60.4 percent);    --in machine building: metal cutting machine tools (by 37  percent), wood processing (68.9 percent), looms (48.5 percent),  large electrical machinery (53.2 percent), electric furnaces (50  percent), tractor seeders (78.2 percent), and concrete mixers  (90.1 percent);    --in the chemical industry: flexible polyvinyl chloride  (15.7  percent), plasticizers (47.8 percent), synthetic resins and  plastics (82.5 percent), and polymer film (62.8 percent);    --in the timber and wood processing industry: shipments of  commercial timber (65.8 percent) and lumber (33.2 percent);    --in the construction materials industry: cement (57.6  percent), ceramic sanitation items (45.3 percent), panels for  large-panel housing construction (55.4 percent), prefabricated  reinforced concrete items (33.3 percent), asbestos cement sheets  (91.4 percent), and heating radiators and convectors (49.1  percent).    The actual volume of production during the first quarter of  this year increased in the fuel industry (by 9.4 percent) and  electric energy (by 7 percent). In the oblast as a whole 57  industrial enterprises provided for an increase in production  volumes (17.1 percent of the overall number).    Taking into account the average daily production in March of  this year as compared to February of this year there was an  increase in the production of coal, hydroelectric energy,  electric steel, finished rolled metal, steel pipes, cold rolled  steel strips, flexible polyvinyl chloride, prefabricated  reinforced concrete items, radiators and convectors for heating,  and ceramic items for sanitation.    During January-March of this year there was a considerable  reduction of the production of consumer goods--by 33.9 percent,  including nonfoodstuffs--by 39.2 percent, which included light  industry goods--34.4 percent, foodstuffs--24.5 percent, wine and  liquor items and beer--46 percent. The production of individual  kinds of foodstuffs is characterized by the following data:       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |            |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------      During January-March of this year the output of prepared  cotton fabrics and washing machines increased.    The output of leather, fulled, and felt footwear, electric  mixers, tape recorders, television sets, clocks, wallpaper,  speakers, and general-purpose notebooks increased by more than  one- third. Among the wine and liquor items there was a  considerable reduction of the production of vodka and  liquor-vodka items (by 57.7 percent) and grape wine (by 59.6  percent).    During the first quarter of this year the production of  products for defense purposes in comparable prices decreased by  32.8 percent.    The proportion of military products in the overall volume of  oblast production in comparable prices in March of this year  amounted to 9 percent.    The decline of the overall output of industrial products at  converted enterprises during the three months of this year  amounted to 44.4 percent, including defense products--29.5  percent.    During January-March of this year the number of industrial  production personnel in the oblast decreased by 12.4 percent,  including at converted enterprises--19.1 percent. There was a  growth of the number of personnel in electric energy engineering  (by 6.9 percent) and nonferrous metallurgy (by 1.2 percent).  The greatest reduction was in machine building and metal  processing (by 18.8 percent), the medical industry (11.7  percent), and the timber and wood processing industry (11.4  percent).    The reduction of labor productivity amounted to 24.5  percent,  including at converted enterprises--31.3 percent.    There was a growth of labor productivity in the fuel  industry  (by 15.6 percent), the timber and wood processing industry (by 2  percent), and the microbiological industry (by 48.5 percent).    Losses of working time are increasing because of the  prolonged shutdowns of enterprises. During March of this year  75 industrial enterprises had production shutdowns and losses of  working time amounted to 471,300 man-days or 16.5 percent of the  scheduled supply of working time of these enterprises (in March  of last year: 31 enterprises lost 70,900 man-days or 4.4 percent  of the scheduled working time of these enterprises). Four  enterprises fully halted their production for more than one  shift and losses amounted to 29,800 man-days (6.3 percent of the  overall losses of working time).    The main ones to stand idle were enterprises of machine  building and metal processing, the chemical industry, and the  construction materials industry.    Enterprises are halting their production because of  difficulties with the sale of products, shortage of material  resources, and other factors. Because of shutdowns or  transition to different work schedules in March of this year 595  workers were discharged from 75 enterprises and 24,742 people  were furloughed on the initiative of the administration.    During the first quarter of this year 42 percent of the  industrial enterprises were included in the nonstate form of  ownership. A large share of the enterprises of the nonstate  sector are joint-stock companies (87 percent).  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   Agricultural commodity producers are preparing the material  base for planting.    As of the beginning of April they had made ready 75 percent  of the tractors, 73 percent of the trucks, 69 percent of the  seeders, 79 percent of the tractor plows, and 73 percent of the  cultivators. The rates of repair of all kinds of agricultural  equipment are below last year's.    During the past quarter agricultural enterprises have  shipped  in 44,000 tonnes of diesel fuel and 15,800 tonnes of gasoline,  which is less than last year by 33 and 27 percent. The  provision of diesel fuel as of the beginning of the second  quarter is 38 percent below last year's and gasoline--19 percent.    The situation in animal husbandry on farms with the  collective- shared form of ownership continues to grow worse.  The number of cattle and hogs has decreased by 10.3 percent as  compared to the corresponding period of 1993, including cows--7  percent, sheep--31.6 percent, horses--7.5 percent, and  poultry--0.2 percent.    During the first quarter of this year the farms sold for  slaughter 29,800 tonnes of cattle and poultry, produced 130,300  tonnes of milk, and obtained 126.3 million eggs. As compared to  the corresponding period of 1993 there was a reduction of meat  production by 9,400 tonnes (23.8 percent), and milk--40,200  tonnes (23.6 percent); but more eggs were received than last  year by 6.3 million or 5.3 percent. The average milk yield per  cow as of the beginning of the year was 348 kilograms during  January-March as compared to 421 during January-March of last  year. In March the milk yield per cow dropped by 29 kilograms  and amounted to 144 kilograms. One laying hen produced 54 eggs  as compared to 56 during the first quarter of last year.    During the three months the farms obtained 146,600 calves,  109,900 piglets, and 117,900 lambs. The use of the reproduction  herd of cattle and sheep improved. Since the beginning of the  year 34,800 head of cattle, 29,900 hogs, and 17,700 sheep have  died. The maintenance of all kinds of cattle has deteriorated  as compared to the corresponding period of last year.    During the three months 22,500 head of livestock and  poultry,  80,600 tonnes of milk, and 105.2 million eggs were delivered to  state resources. As compared to the same period of last year  procurements of cattle and poultry decreased by 33 percent,  milk--by 32 percent, and eggs--by 1 percent. Additionally, the  farms sold in the markets, through their own stores, and through  public catering 4,800 tonnes of cattle, 4,200 tonnes of milk,  and 1.7 million eggs.  <H5>  Capital Construction </H5>   During the first quarter of 1994 R116.9 billion in capital  investments were assimilated (64 percent of the amount for  January- March 1993), of which R20.8 million came from the  republic budget (18 percent of the overall volume of capital  investments) and R11.4 billion from local budgets (10 percent).    The greatest proportion of assimilated capital investments  was at state and municipal enterprises (65 percent) and  joint-stock companies (34 percent).    For construction of facilities for production purposes from  all sources of financing R68.2 billion in capital investments  was assimilated, including at facilities for producing consumer  goods-- R1.2 billion or 1.7 percent.    In the oblast as a whole R27.3 billion in capital  investments  were assimilated in housing construction, the construction of  general educational schools--R0.8 billion, preschool  institutions-- R0.3 billion, hospitals and outpatient polyclinic  institutions--R1.0 billion, and clubs and houses of  culture--R0.03 billion.    During the first quarter of 1994 the  Zatsibselelektrosetstroy  Trust put electric power transmission lines with a distance of 8  kilometers into operation.    From all sources of financing R8.6 billion worth of fixed  capital was put into operation in the oblast, of which R6.5  billion was at facilities for production purposes.    During the first quarter of 1994, 274 apartments with an  overall area of 16,600 square meters were put into operation in  the oblast from all sources of financing, which amounted to 15  percent of the  level of the corresponding period of last year.    As before, most of the volume of housing construction was  carried out by state and municipal enterprises and organizations  (65 percent of the overall introduction of housing). Individual  builders introduced 1,800 square meters (11 percent) using their  own funds or with the help of state credit.    During January-March of this year the following were put  into  operation: a kindergarten to accommodate 140 by the Pobeda AOZT  [private joint-stock company] in the village of Kargapolova in  Suzunskiy Rayon, and a club to accommodate 100 by the Sibir AOZT  in the settlement of Krasnyy Khutor in Krasnozerskiy Rayon.    All construction organizations on the territory of the  oblast  during January-March of this year performed R112.1 billion worth  of contracting work through their own forces, and the volume  dropped by 41 percent as compared to the corresponding period of  last year.    The main volume of contracting work (R67.8 billion or 61  percent) was performed by enterprises with a mixed form of  ownership, R26.2 billion (23 percent)--by private enterprises,  and R18.2 billion (16 percent)--by state and municipal  enterprises.    In the structure of contracting work performed, construction  and installation work makes up 86 percent. Capital repair and  other contracting work accounts for 14 percent of the volume  performed.    Contracting organizations performed R6.2 billion worth of  work on the construction of the facilities of the  agro-industrial complex, which was 6 percent of the overall  volume of contracting work.  <H5>  Transportation and Communications </H5>   Under the conditions of the decline of production and the  continuing growth of prices the volume of freight shipments by  general purpose transportation is continually decreasing. Thus  during the first quarter of 1994 the volume of shipments of  freight by general purpose transportation decreased by 36.4  percent as compared to the first quarter of 1993, and cargo  turnover--by 33.2 percent.    On the Western Siberian Railroad the volume of freight  dispatched decreased by 26.3 percent, and the delivery of timber  cargo decreased by 59.1 percent, petroleum cargo--by 32.5  percent, and grain and milling products--by 51.9 percent. Cargo  turnover decreased by 31.7 percent or 12.6 tonne-kilometers.    A considerable increase in rates for freight shipment  because  of the sharp increase in fuel prices has led many consumers to  refrain from the services of general purpose automotive  transportation. As a result, during the first quarter of this  year this kind of transportation was used to ship 2.1 million  tonnes of freight, which is 47.6 percent less than during the  first quarter of last year, and cargo turnover decreased by 46.4  percent. In addition to general purpose automotive  transportation, freight was shipped by 64 automotive enterprises  of other ministries and departments and they shipped 29.2  million tonnes of freight.    The situation with automotive transportation service for  citizens continues to be strained. Passenger departures from  airports of civil aviation decreased by 40.2 percent during the  first quarter. Some of the passenger flow shifted to the  relatively less expensive rail transportation, where passenger  transportation increased by 2.9 percent, but passenger turnover  decreased by 13.4 percent. Transportation of passengers by  automotive transportation increased by 6.3 percent, including  general purpose transportation--by 6.9 percent, and passenger  turnover--by 1.2 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.    Revenues of communications enterprises during the first  quarter of this year amounted to R10.1 billion, including from  the sale of services to the population--R2.1 billion.  <H5>  Development of Foreign Trade Relations </H5>   During the first quarter 32 enterprises and organizations  entered the foreign market. They exported R15.4 billion worth  of machines, equipment, raw materials, processed materials, and  consumer goods and services. Ferrous metallurgy products and  items made from them amounted to R1.1 billion (7.1 percent of  the overall volume), inorganic chemistry products--4.1 billion  (26.6 percent), and tin and items made from it--R2.4 billion  (15.6 percent). The main exporters, which made up more than 75  percent of the overall number, are four enterprises: the  Khimkontsentratov Joint-Stock Company--2.6 percent (R4.1  billion), the tin combine--20.5 percent (R3.2 billion), the  Elsib AOOT [public joint-stock company]--8.8 percent (R1.4  billion), and the Institute of Nuclear Physics--19.5 percent (R3  billion).    Foreign trade turnover through direct production ties and  commodity exchange operations amounted to $32.4 million  (exports-- $19 million and imports--$13.4 million). More than  60 percent was commodity turnover with Germany, Great Britain,  China, France, and the United States.  <H5>  The Consumer Market </H5>   The volume of retail commodity turnover of officially  registered trade organizations of the oblast during  January-March reached R295 billion and increased 6.5-fold as  compared to the corresponding period of last year (in actual  prices). The physical mass of goods sold was 24.9 percent less.  During the report month there was a 0.8-percent increase in the  volume of commodity turnover as compared to March of last year.    The proportion of sales of foodstuffs in the overall volume  of commodity turnover amounted to 51 percent as against 54.2  percent  during the first quarter of 1993.    The commodity turnover of public catering enterprises  amounted to R17.6 billion and increased 5.2-fold as compared to  the corresponding period of last year (in actual prices). Its  proportion in the overall volume of commodity turnover decreased  from 7.4 percent to 6 percent.    Enterprises of the nonstate sector in trade and public  catering since the beginning of the year have provided for 48.8  percent of the overall volume of commodity turnover. The state  sector accounts for 39.5 percent, and consumers'  cooperation--11.7 percent.    As of the beginning of April commodity reserves in trade  organizations amounted to R117 billion. Their provision,  calculated in days of trading, amounted to 40 days (in the first  quarter of 1993--50 days).    During January-February of this year as compared to the  corresponding period of last year there was an increase in sales  of herring, margarine products, cheese, knitwear, hosiery items,  leather footwear, and television sets.    There were decreased sales of meat, sausage items, fish,  butter and vegetable oil, eggs, sugar, confectionery items,  fabrics, sewn items, soap and detergents, and radio receivers.    The volume of paid services during the first quarter of this  year amounted to R70.7 billion with an average of R25,200 per  resident. As compared to last year it increased 12.9-fold in  actual prices.    The volume of consumer services rendered to the population  was R6.1 billion. This is 8.6 percent of the overall volume of  paid services (during January-March 1993--16.4 percent).    In the sphere of rendering services to the population,  nonstate enterprises account for 20.7 percent of the overall  volume of services.  <H5>  Finances </H5>   According to figures from the administration of finance and  tax policy of the oblast administration, the consolidated oblast  budget during January-February 1994 was fulfilled for incomes  and expenditures in the amount of R99.7 billion.    The largest proportion of revenues is made up of value added  tax--25.2 percent, individual income tax--20.4 percent, and  profit tax--19.7 percent.    The basic directions for financing are still sociocultural  measures and the development of the economy. In budget  expenditures during January-February 1994 expenditures on  sociocultural measures make up 58 percent and on the development  of the economy--28 percent.    Enterprises and organizations of the oblast (not including  agricultural) during January-March 1994, according to  preliminary calculations, received profit in a volume of R250  billion. Industry accounts for 88 percent of the profit,  construction--8 percent, and transportation--2 percent. As  compared to the corresponding period of last year the volume of  profit increased 4.3-fold while the prices of industrial  products increased 8.6-fold.    The financial position of enterprises and organizations  continues to be complicated by the lack of regulation of mutual  settlements in the national economy.    The overall creditor indebtedness at enterprises of  industry,  construction, transportation, and agriculture as of 1 March of  this year amounted to R684.6 billion, including  defaulted--R266.7 billion or 38.9 percent.    In the overall total of defaulted creditor indebtedness of  these branches, defaulted indebtedness to suppliers accounts for  R174.1 billion or 65.3 percent, and the budget--R45.2 billion or  17 percent. More than 66 percent of the defaulted indebtedness  to suppliers (nonpayments) are to enterprises of industry.    As of 1 March this year all of the accounts receivable  amounted to R654.1 billion, of which the defaulted amount was  R331 billion or 50.6 percent. Almost 90 percent of the  defaulted accounts receivable is defaulted indebtedness for  products delivered, work performed, and services rendered  (R295.7 billion). Of the overall total of defaulted  indebtedness of consumers, R227.5 (76.9 percent) is to  industrial enterprises.    The shortage of their own financial resources forces  enterprises to use credit and loans. Indebtedness on loans and  credit received from banks as of 1 March of this year amounted  to R166.7 billion, of which R15.3 billion is defaulted.    The volume of defaulted indebtedness for issuing funds for  consumption for enterprises and organizations of industry,  construction, and agriculture amounted to R30.7 billion as of 1  April 1994.    Among industrial goods the most significant price increases  were for medications--1.8-fold, gasoline and printed  publications--1.7- fold, private means of  transportation--1.5-fold, and detergents and jewelry  items--1.4-fold.    The greatest rate of price increases was found for paid  services rendered to the population, which was brought about by  the sharp increase in the cost of housing and municipal  services. Since the beginning of the year housing services have  increased in cost 224- fold, communications--2.3-fold, rail  transportation--twofold, automotive transportation--1.6-fold,  and services for keeping children and children's preschool  institutions--1.6-fold.    The growth of consumer prices was influenced by the higher  wholesale prices in industry, which, in turn, was linked to the  increase in expenditures on the production of products (higher  costs  of raw materials, processed materials, energy resources, and  fuel).    During the first quarter of this year wholesale prices for  food industry products increased 33 percent, including  butter--59 percent, wine making products--38 percent, and  confectionery items- 27 percent. Light industry products  increased in cost by 32 percent during this same period,  including footwear--72 percent, cotton fabrics--37 percent, and  knitted items--23 percent.  <H5>  Incomes and Expenditures of the Population </H5>   During January-March of this year monetary incomes of the  population amounted to R502 billion and increased 6.5-fold as  compared to the same period of 1993.    During March of this year nominal monetary incomes totalled  R190 billion. As compared to February they increased 10  percent, and compared to March 1993--6.1-fold. At the same time  the real disposable monetary incomes (income minus mandatory  payments and contributions adjusted to the price index), which  reflect the dynamics of the buying power of the current monetary  incomes, decreased in March 1994 as compared to the preceding  month by 0.4 percent, and as compared to March 1993--by 24  percent.    With the increase in prices there is also an increase in the  amount of the subsistence level which, according to methods  approved by the Ministry of Labor of Russia, as of 1 April 1994  amounted to R55,220 on average per capita.    The average monthly wages of workers during January-March of  this year amounted to R130,000 and increased 9.4-fold as  compared to the corresponding period of last year.    Monetary expenditures of the population during January-March  1994 amounted to R528 billion (8.2 times more than during  January-March 1993), including for the purchase of goods and  paid services--R363 billion (6.8-fold).  <H5>  Public Health </H5>   During January-March of this year there was an increase in  the number of registered infectious and parasitic diseases as  compared to the corresponding period of 1993, the number of  reported cases of diphtheria increased 10-fold, German  measles--7.4-fold, salmonella infections--twofold, and  influenza--1.8-fold.    There was a certain decrease in the number of reported cases  of colitis, enteritis, gastroenteritis, and food poisoning with  established etiology (from 342 to 293), critical intestinal  infections caused by unestablished infectious agents (from 1,782  to 1,553), chicken pox (from 4,636 to 4,036), and viral  hepatitis A (from 694 to 542).  <H5>  The Crime Situation </H5>   According to data from the oblast internal affairs  administration, during January-March of this year 17,800 crimes  were reported, including 700 (4 percent)--against individuals,  2,000 (11.2 percent)--against state and public property, and  12,500 (70 percent)--against private and personal property.  Criminal charges were brought against 7,600 individuals.  <H5>  Privatization </H5>   Since the beginning of privatization 1,460 packages of  documents have been filled out for enterprises of all branches,  and 1,284 enterprises have been fully privatized, including 142  in 1994.    Most of the privatized enterprises (59.3 percent) are  municipally owned enterprises, 23.5 percent--federally owned,  and 17.2 percent-- oblast-owned enterprises. During 1994 these  figures were 27.5 percent, 42.9 percent, and 29.5 percent,  respectively.    On the territory of the oblast 419 joint-stock companies  have  been created, including 233 on the basis of federally owned  enterprises. At commercial competitions 524 enterprises have  been sold and 287 enterprises have purchased leased property.    A total of R14.8 billion has been obtained from  privatization, R2 billion of which in 1994.    Earnings from privatization of municipally owned facilities  amounted to R7.4 billion (50.7 percent of the total received),  and oblast-owned--R1.6 billion.    Name-bearing privatization checks were used to obtain R6.5  billion worth, including R1 billion in 1994.    Of the monies received from privatization, R7.9 billion was  transferred into budgets and funds, and R3.5 billion (43.9  percent)--into local budgets.    Since the beginning of privatization in buildings of the  state and municipal housing fund, 138,300 apartments have been  privatized, including 12,400 in 1994.    As of 1 April this year in the rayon committees for land  reform 5,999 peasant (farmer-run) farms have been registered,  and they were assigned 344,100 hectares of land. There are 57.4  hectares per one farm. Since 1 January 1992, 603 farms have  ceased their activity for various reasons.</p>

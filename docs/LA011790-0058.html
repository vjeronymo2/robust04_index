			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A San Diego police officer was justified in shooting a robbery suspect in  December, a district attorney's investigation has concluded.  </P> <P> Officer Gerald K. Griffin fired four shots at Curlee Markson Jr., purportedly  after he saw Markson attacking another man with a knife. The incident occurred  about 9:30 p.m. Dec. 3 in the 4300 block of University Avenue.  </P> <P> In a letter dated Jan. 10, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael R. Pent wrote that  Griffin told Markson to drop the knife. Instead of dropping the weapon, Markson  turned toward the officer, who was now within a few feet of him.  </P> <P> "Officer Griffin fired two shots at Markson, fearing that the apparent victim  (Jose Hernandez-Garcia) might be injured or killed by the knife-wielding  assailant. Markson was not hit by either shot," Pent wrote in the letter to  Police Chief Bob Burgreen.  </P> <P> Markson ran away, with Griffin in pursuit. After several blocks, Markson ran  into an alley. Griffin fired two more shots at Markson and hit him once in the  back.  </P> <P> "The facts in this case establish legal justification for the use of deadly  force by Officer Griffin," Pent wrote.  </P> <P> "Markson was armed with a deadly weapon, was in the process of threatening  Hernandez-Garcia with it in an attempt to rob him, failed to drop it when  confronted . . . and in fact took the knife with him as he tried to escape. The  use of deadly force to arrest is proper if the crime for which the arrest is  sought is a forcible and atrocious one which threatens death or serious bodily  harm."  </P> <P> Pent said Markson was charged with attempted robbery and assault with a deadly  weapon. Markson is scheduled to appear Jan. 30 in Superior Court. He is in  County Jail downtown, on $20,000 bail.  </P> <P> Homicide Lt. Gary Learn said there were 23 officer-involved shootings in 1989,  seven of them fatal. Two of the incidents are still under investigation. The  others, he said, were found to be justified.  </P></p>

The debtor may represent himself or herself or may be represented by an individual of the debtor's choice and at the debtor's expense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The hearing official shall issue a final written decision based on documentary evidence and, if applicable, information developed at an oral hearing. The written decision shall be issued as soon as practicable after the review but not later than 60 days after the date on which the request for review was received by the Corporation, unless the debtor requests a delay in the proceedings. A delay in the proceedings shall be granted if the hearing official determines, in his or her sole discretion, that there is good cause to grant the delay. If a delay is granted, the 60-day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by which the review was postponed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Upon issuance of the written opinion, the Corporation shall promptly notify the debtor of the hearing official's decision. Said notification shall include a copy of the written decision issued by the hearing official pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1408.11  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Special review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) An employee subject to salary offset, under subpart C of this part, or a voluntary repayment agreement, may, at any time, request a special review by the Corporation of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary repayment, based on materially changed circumstances such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) To determine whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the employee shall submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the employee, his or her spouse, and dependents indicating: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Income from all sources; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Assets; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Liabilities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Number of dependents; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Medical expenses; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Exceptional expenses, if any. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If the employee requests a special review under this section, the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents, showing why the current salary offset or payments result in an extreme financial hardship to the employee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The Corporation shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents, and determine whether the original offset or repayment schedule imposes an undue financial hardship on the employee. The Corporation shall notify the employee in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or payment schedule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1408.12  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Corporation shall: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Assess interest on unpaid claims; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Assess administrative costs incurred in processing and handling overdue claims; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Assess penalty charges not to exceed 6 percent a year on any part of a debt more than 90 days past due. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The imposition of charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties shall be made in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) Interest shall accrue from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the initial demand for payment or the Notice of Intent to Collect by either Administrative or Salary Offset if the amount of the claim is not paid within 30 days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the initial demand or notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The 30-day period may be extended on a case-by-case basis if the Corporation reasonably determines that such action is appropriate. Interest shall only accrue on the principal of the claim and the interest rate shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, in cases where a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, or if the Corporation reasonably determines that a higher rate is necessary to protect the interests of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, the Corporation may assess a new interest rate on the unpaid claim. In addition, charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties which accrued but were not collected under the original repayment agreement shall be added to the principal of the claim to be paid under the new repayment agreement. Interest shall accrue on the entire principal balance of the claim, as adjusted to reflect any increase resulting from the addition of these charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The Corporation may waive charges for interest, administrative costs, and/or penalties if it determines that: (1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the claim within a reasonable period of time; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Collection of charges for interest, administrative costs, and/or penalties would jeopardize collection of the principal of the claim; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Collection of charges for interest, administrative costs, or penalties would be against equity and good conscience; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

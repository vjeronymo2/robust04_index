			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Marchioness group wins inquest battle Families of the 51 people who died in the 1989 Marchioness riverboat disaster on the Thames yesterday won the right to seek to have the inquests into the deaths reopened before a new coroner. The Court of Appeal said that Dr Paul Knapman, the coroner who conducted the original inquests, had shown 'apparent bias' in describing Mrs Margaret Lockwood-Croft, the mother of one of the victims, to a newspaper as 'unhinged'. Lord Justice Simon Brown said it was possible that Dr Knapman thought the families were troublemakers and unfairly undervalued their argument for resumed inquests. Lawyers for Dr Knapman said they were considering asking the House of Lords for leave to appeal against the ruling.</p>

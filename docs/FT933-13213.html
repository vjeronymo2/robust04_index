			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Medeva shock A shock profits warning from Medeva sent shares in the group tumbling 100 to 116p, and did further damage to a drugs sector weak from recent adverse comment. Turnover was a very heavy 28m shares, accounting for nearly 10 per cent of the issued equity. The dramatic fall in the share price revealed deeper worries in the market over the quality of the stock. The company warned that problems at one of its US subsidiaries would mean profits some Pounds 10m below market forecasts for this year. One pharmaceuticals specialist commented: 'Medeva has always based its earnings growth on its acquisitions and now one of those has gone wrong. The market is worried that it could happen elsewhere.' There were also darker hints that warnings of trading worries at the group had been circulating in the market for some weeks, but had been firmly rejected by sources close to the company.</p>

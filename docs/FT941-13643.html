			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Paisley scorns declaration as 'pay-off' to IRA The Downing Street declaration is a down-payment to the IRA and a negotiated surrender of Northern Ireland's constitutional link with the UK, the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said last night. He told an audience of Conservative MPs that the document was designed to give the terrorists a say in shaping the province's political future. Arguing that the declaration would also strengthen the Irish government's role in Ulster's affairs, Mr Paisley said Dublin now had the right to decide 'the sort of institutions and structures to be set up in Northern Ireland. 'Cross-border bodies with a permanent unionist minority and, as proposed by Dublin, with executive functions, are the next stage on the surrender road,' he said. The DUP leader's words came as Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, called on Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, to lift the ban on his entry to the US. Insisting that Sinn Fein was not engaged in armed struggle, Mr Adams said US authorities could help the Northern Ireland peace process by allowing him in to the US. The Sinn Fein president has been invited, along with other leading Ulster politicians, to address the National Committee on American Foreign Policy in New York next week. Mr Adams recently failed in his appeal against an exclusion order keeping him out of mainland Britain. Meanwhile, the political talks process involving the province's constitutional parties continued in Belfast yesterday afternoon with a meeting between Mr Michael Ancram, a junior Northern Ireland minister, and the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party's four Westminster MPs. The Northern Ireland Office said the two sides agreed on the need for further early progress in the talks 'across all three strands'. They plan to meet again soon. An unexploded letter bomb was found last night at a girls' school run by nuns in the Irish Republic border town of Dundalk. Police believe it had been sent by an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group.</p>

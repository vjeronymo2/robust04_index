			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Lafarge rules out role in US deal Lafarge Coppee, the French building materials group, has ruled out a plan to co-operate with Golden Eagle Industries in its Dollars 940m bid for National Gypsum, the second-largest US plasterboard manufacturer. The French group, which holds 10 per cent of the shares in National Gypsum, said it had rejected the idea of a joint bid, and was studying what to do with its stake. The decision complicates the task of Golden Eagle, which holds 19 per cent of National Gypsum and is leading the bid by a group of North Carolina-based investors. Golden Eagle, headed by Mr C. D. Spangler, non-executive chairman of National Gypsum, may also face barriers to any hostile bid. These were agreed by shareholders of the plasterboard company last week. Industry observers discounted the idea that Lafarge Coppee would make a rival offer for control of National Gyspum. Although Lafarge is one of Europe's largest plasterboard manufacturers, and has a strong presence in the US building materials market, analysts say it probably cannot afford to be part of the National Gypsum acquisition.</p>

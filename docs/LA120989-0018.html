			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN JOSE;  </P> <P> DOG PHOTOS SHOWN AT MURDER TRIAL  </P> <P> Prosecutors Friday introduced more than a dozen photographs of frenzied  fighting dogs that were taken from the home of the first U.S. pit bull owner  charged with murder for his animal's actions. The photos, enlargements of  snapshots taken from Michael Berry, 39, were part of the prosecution's effort  to show that Berry was deeply involved in dog fighting and trained the animal  that killed a 2-year-old neighbor, James Soto, who wandered into Berry's yard  on Jan. 13, 1987. The pit bull, Willy, had been leashed on a six-foot chain and  guarded a corridor that led to a patch of 243 marijuana plants, according to  testimony. Berry was initially charged with involuntary manslaughter, but the  charge was upgraded to second-degree murder in November, 1987, alleging malice  because Berry had trained Willy to fight and had failed to take proper  precautions. Willy was ordered put to death, but is currently at the Santa  Clara County Animal Shelter while his death sentence is appealed.  </P></p>

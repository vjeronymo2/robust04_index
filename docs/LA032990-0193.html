			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BILL TO REQUIRE CSU TRUSTEES TO HAVE DEGREES CLEARS PANEL  </P> <P> A bill that would impose minimum educational requirements for appointees to the  California State University Board of Trustees cleared its first hurdle  Wednesday when the Senate Education Committee approved it by a vote of 6 to 2.  </P> <P> The measure, sponsored by Sen. Daniel E. Boatwright (D-Concord), was inspired  by revelations last year that Huntington Beach resident Marianthi Lansdale, now  chairwoman of the CSU board, had claimed educational credentials she had not  earned when first named to the board in 1985 by Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Lansdale had claimed an associate of arts degree from Long Beach City College  although she never was graduated from the two-year school.  </P> <P> Boatwright has said the Lansdale controversy surprised him because it showed  that there are no educational requirements for people appointed to the CSU  board. Two other CSU trustees have never received a bachelor's degree.  </P> <P> His bill would require such a degree of future gubernatorial appointees to the  prestigious post.  </P> <P> "You have people controlling students who are applying for degrees, and I think  . . . it certainly enhances that person if they have a baccalaureate degree. If  they are administering a system, they can better understand the problems of the  students," said Boatwright.  </P></p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Rivera landscape sells for Dollars 1.21m: Saleroom A LANDSCAPE painting by the Mexican artist Diego Rivera, 'Paisaje de Toledo', giving a Cubist impression of the countryside around Toledo in Spain, sold for Dollars 1.21m (Pounds 661,202) at Christie's in New York on Monday night. It was bought by a Mexican dealer and reflects the strong current demand for Mexican art. The auction totalled Dollars 7.75m and was 24 per cent unsold. 'The Temptation of St Anthony', a Surrealist work by Leonora Carrington, made Dollars 440,000, an auction record for the artist. Christie's sales of modern illustrated books and 20th-century decorative arts in Geneva on Monday were less successful, with both nearly 50 per cent unsold. The top price was the Pounds 37,218 paid for an autographed manuscript by Jean Cocteau, Cherchez Apollon, illustrated with three sketches. Sotheby's also had difficulties, this time with tribal art in New York. The most important lot, a rare Benin bronze head of a leopard, dating from the 17th century and estimated as worth as much as Dollars 500,000, was unsold. There was little demand for medium-quality works, but an object from New Guinea, a Middle Sepik River suspension hook, sold for Dollars 159,000, at the top of its target. The auction brought in Dollars 1m, with 52 per cent unsold. Silver remains a healthy market and in Geneva an auction of European silver totalled Pounds 2.5m and was more than 87 per cent sold. A French silver gilt toilet service made by Francois-Daniel Imlin in Strasbourg in 1825 for Stephanie, Grand Duchess of Baden, a protegee of Napoleon, sold for Pounds 228,461. A French silver soup tureen and cover, made by Jean-Baptiste de Lens in Paris in 1736, far exceeded its forecast at Pounds 191,744.</p>

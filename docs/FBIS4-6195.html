			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to  negotiate directly with North Korea if Pyongyang makes an issue  out of Seoul's decision to resettle fleeing North Korean loggers  in the South.    A senior government official said Sunday there was a strong  possibility that North Korea would officially broach Seoul's  decision last week to give North Korean loggers refuge in the  South.    "In that case, the government plans to push direct  negotiations with North Korea on this problem," he said.    An estimated 500 North Koreans are said to have escaped from  Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia, many of whom are hiding  in various parts of Russia to elude North Korean agents while  seeking refuge in South Korea.    The official, who declined to be identified, noted that when  many East Germans tried to escape to West Germany, the Bonn  government solved the problem by negotiating directly with East  Germany.    The government will cooperate with Russia and the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the process of  settling the North Korean loggers in the South, he said.    But there is a possibility that North Korea, insisting the  loggers are "criminals," will demand their repatriation. The  government has decided to prepare for this eventuality by  checking the background of all North Korean loggers applying for  refuge in the South, he said.    In addition, the government will introduce a procedure  allowing the UNHCR to confirm whether the loggers indeed want to  leave their country or settle in nations other than South Korea,  in order to prevent Pyongyang from leveling charges of  kidnapping against Seoul, the official said.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Management: Life and times of the ditkies - Book Review Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, and his television producer wife, Prudence Keely, are happy ditkies (double income, two kids). Other couples might be ground down by the demands of big jobs and tiny tots, but these two find them rewarding and rejuvenating. So much so that they have written a curiously positive foreword to The Workplace Revolution*, a book which chronicles the woes of dual-career couples. The opening anecdote tells of a chance meeting between Davies's small son and his much-loved former nanny in a supermarket. The child was unmoved, but the nanny burst into tears. This is meant to show that preconceptions about childcare can be wide of the mark. Instead it leaves the impression that Davies, Keely and family, unlike the other examples in the book, are having it all and loving it. The contention of the authors, Cary Cooper and Suzan Lewis, is that the way in which people work has changed forever. More women work full time in areas once dominated by men, and more return to work after having children. Men no longer have full-time wives providing domestic support, and so are under pressure to help at home. Yet this is not another book about the problems for working mothers. The wants and needs of both men and women are changing, yet most companies expect their workers to behave as before. The result is conflict for all sides. Cooper and Lewis have interviewed 400 dual-career couples to find out where the main areas of friction lie. These turn out to be many and various: the working day is too long, and the macho work ethic too entrenched. Couples find their schedules are inflexible. They find the cares of work are spilling over into home time, and domestic concerns are getting in the way of work. When children arrive the problems get worse. Women find themselves missing out on promotion and feeling constant guilt. Every time the child gets ill or something goes wrong, the load of guilt increases. The book bristles with examples of each of these well-known problems. Sally works in a big department store where staff need written permission from two managers in order to leave early. She lives in constant terror of being unable to respond quickly should her child fall ill. While the problems sound all too common, what is less familiar is the variety of ways in which couples cope. The book contains many examples of new men - rather more than one meets in real life - ensuring that the strains are shared equally. One London-based small business- woman persuaded her husband not to accept a job in Scotland on the understanding that next time it would be her turn to be flexible. Another couple, Lynda and John, share a job as social workers and take it in turns to look after the children. Despite these examples, the authors do not pretend that everyone should be like Lynda and John. Indeed they believe that there is no right way to handle the pressures. They argue that unless organisations change their ways, these problems will not go away, no matter how many new men there are. They have drawn up a shopping list of corporate policies which would help. Companies should conduct stress audits and discourage workaholic behaviour. More important, they should recognise the value of giving people increased control over the number of hours they work, which means they should place greater trust in their employees. Companies should offer more training in time management, assertiveness and stress management. They should accept that family decisions are a part of career planning. Above all, what is needed is a rethink of what constitutes the ideal employee and the ideal career pattern. All change in attitudes takes time, yet the authors are optimistic that change is possible, indeed inevitable. Cooper and Lewis put forward the standard argument that it is in an employer's economic interests to have an unstressed workforce. Yet they seem to assume that the list can be bought for nothing. A more persuasive argument for change may be needed, especially at a time in which companies are loading extra demands on their workers. *Kogan Page. pp184.

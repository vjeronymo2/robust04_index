			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Maroni Responds to Senate on Mafia, </F> Skinheads"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 18 -- Interior Minister Roberto  Maroni went before the Senate this evening, after the confidence  vote, to reply to queries put forward concerning recent attacks  by the mafia in Sicily and last weekend's march in Vicenza of  neo-Nazi skinheads.    Regarding the bombing by the mafia in Piana degli Albanesi,  which saw the destruction of a home of a Left Democrat party  official, Maroni replied how he immediately went in person to  Sicily where he met with seventeen mayors and numerous city  councilors and private citizens.    "The new and effective concept" the interior minister told  the Senate, "is the that fight against organized crime will now  take place through local governments which side against the  mafia phenomenon and are no longer, as once was the case, in  support of the mafia."    Turning his attention to Saturday's [14 May] march in  Vicenza, Maroni ruled out any fault for the part of National  Police Chief Vincenzo Parisi and argued that "the ministry  official, in Rome, who received the request from authorities in  Vicenza for 80 additional police officers probably did not  notify Parisi because he underestimated the request."    The interior minister then went on to say how the  participants in the demonstration had all been identified,  thanks to television tapes, and their names forwarded to  judicial authorities for violation of laws against fascism.  Maroni also told the senate how the number of skinheads in  Italy was 800, of which 300 were considered "activists."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In a pre-departure statement in Sanaa today, UN  envoy Lakhdar Brahimi expressed disappointment at the collapse  of yesterday's cease-fire agreement. He stressed that the  conflict can be solved through dialogue between the concerned  parties, but such a dialogue is still not possible as the south  wants a complete halt to battles and full northern commitment to  a cease-fire before anything else. As for the conditions of the  north, here is 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, chairman of the General  Committee of the General People's Congress, which is led by  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, speaking to our correspondent  Ahmad Birru in Sanaa.    [Begin al-Anisi recording] To agree to dialogue, the  following conditions should be met:    1. The Socialist Party should issue a decision abrogating  the secession decision.    2. It should clearly and frankly announce its acceptance  of the results of the parliamentary elections held on 27 April  [1993].    3. It should announce its commitment to the  constitutional legitimacy and to dealing with the institutions  accordingly.    4. The dialogue should take place in Sanaa.    5. The dialogue should not last more than five days.    6. The 16 Socialist Party members subpoenaed by the  public prosecutor should not take part in the dialogue. [end  recording]</p>

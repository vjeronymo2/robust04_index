			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Brussels softens lineon film, TV quotas A senior European Commission official yesterday signalled that Brussels intended to take a more lenient approach to regulating the European film and television industry, forecasting that quotas designed to protect the sector could become a thing of the past because of rapid technological change. Mr Reinhard Buscher, a member of the cabinet of Commissioner Martin Bangemann, told a Financial Times multi- media conference in London that the development of video-on-demand, pay-per-view services made quotas an old battle which would be less and less important. There have been furious rows between the US film and television industries over quotas which have been designed to protect the European production industries. 'Entertainment is becoming more and more an economic good that we should pay for individually without any harm to culture or languages,' said Mr Buscher, who said that his personal approach on quotas was shared by Mr Bangemann. At the moment, European Union legislation means that broadcasters have to have a majority of European programme content where practicable. Although Commission officials concede privately that quotas are difficult to enforce, the official line - at least until now - has been that they are necessary to protect European culture and to nurture the audiovisual industry. Mr Buscher's comments add to gradual indications that the Commission is willing to consider changes to the broadcasting directive. However, they are likely to anger countries such as France, which are strongly in favour of quotas. He added, though, that free movement for US programmes would have to be balanced by measures to support the European film and television industries. The Brussels approach to creating an 'information society' was to stimulate practical applications using existing funds rather than seeking a single solution, said Mr Buscher. The Commission is expected to announce an action plan next week which is designed to implement main the recommendations of the Bangemann report on the information society. These range from teleworking and distance learning to creation of networks for universities and research centres and health care to a trans-European public administration network. 'Research projects and experimental applications must now be taken out of the laboratories into real life so they become social and economic realities in order to create new markets and new job opportunities,' Mr Buscher said.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: US steel companies suffer from recession TWO leading US steel companies reported first-quarter losses as the US recession hit demand for their products, particularly in the automotive and consumer white goods markets. USX, the largest steel manufacturer in the US, reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 237m, or 94 cent a share, compared with net income of Dollars 176m, or 66 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. Sales were Dollars 4.5bn, against Dollars 4.7bn. The figures included Dollars 346m of one-time restructuring charges. Its steel business reported an operating loss of Dollars 502m, or Dollars 180m without restructuring charges, but its Marathon energy operations produced operating income of Dollars 229m, including a Dollars 24m restructuring charge, aided by a strong downstream performance. Mr Charles Corry, the chairman, said the downstream energy business should be helped by the coming summer driving season. National Steel, the fifth largest US manufacturer, reported a net loss of Dollars 64.4m in the first quarter on sales of Dollars 524m, compared with a net loss of Dollars 4.2m on sales of Dollars 612m in 1990.</p>

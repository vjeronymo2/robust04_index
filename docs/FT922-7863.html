			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Observer: Hiccup Is the Old Testament right that man dates from God's creation 5,752 years back, or did he evolve more lengthily as Darwin said? The question has somewhat stumped Pepsi-Cola's first launch in Israel, where Coca-Cola has long had the market to itself. Planned advertisements suggesting Darwin was correct, and that today's homo sapiens drinks Pepsi, turned the stomach of the ultra-orthodox Jewish community's court, Badatz. Unless the blasphemous ad was cancelled, it ruled, Pepsi's kosher certification would be. The company and its local licensee, Israel's biggest drinks-maker Tempo, are still sweating over how to respond to the threat - a powerful one given that the religious community accounts for a good portion of the country's Pounds 170m soft-drinks market. Meanwhile the local producers of Coke looked on smugly. Their impeccably kosher plant is sited in Tel Aviv's main ultra-orthodox neighbourhood, Bnei Brak.</p>

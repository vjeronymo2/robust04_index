			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Prisons Get Drug-Free Areas"] </F>   [Text] The Ringe national prison in Fyn opened a section  yesterday, the first in Denmark, in which young imprisoned drug  addicts are offered a guaranteed drug-free environment. In a  month, the Nyborg national prison will open a similar section.  Both sections will have room for 12 addicts.    "The idea is to help the drug addicts who want to break the  habit. When they are separated from the other prisoners, they  avoid stress and offers of drugs or demands and threats to pay  old drug debts. And they receive help in remaining drug-free,"  Prison Inspector Bodil Phillip of Ringe said.    The drug-free sections are so-called contract sections. The  prisoners sign a contract that they will neither take nor deal  in drugs. The contract has no legal value, only a moral one.  Nevertheless, Prison Inspector K. Taagegaard of Nyborg thinks  that the contract will reduce the abuse of drugs. "This is shown  by experience from Norway and Sweden, which already have  drug-free sections," he said.    About 90 percent of the prisoners in Ringe were drug abusers  before they were imprisoned.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EMBRYONIC BIOTECHNOLOGY PROMISES HUGE EARNINGS DESPITE REGULATION  </P> <P> Miracle cures and cheaper, healthier food are on the horizons of biotechnology,  but for companies able to cope with the regulatory patchwork of the embryonic  industry the future holds huge earnings.  </P> <P> The Industrial Biotechnology Assn. predicts that sales, now estimated at $600  million, will rise to between $25 billion and $30 billion in the year 2000 and  between $75 billion and $100 billion in 2025.  </P> <P> "The first impact is going to clearly be on the medical side," said James  McCamant, editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley, Calif.  </P> <P> Genetically engineered products to cure AIDS and some cancers, to make pork and  beef leaner and healthier and to protect crops from insects, weeds and weather  are just a few of the promises held out by the industry.  </P> <P> "You will see biotechnology products all over the shelves in the next few  years. It will creep into your life and continue to accelerate. Fifteen years  from now we can't even speculate," McCamant said.  </P> <P> The United States remains the leader in all aspects of biotechnology --  diagnostics, medicine, forensics and agriculture, analysts say. But Japan and  Western European nations are making inroads, partly due to a strong government  role in financing and, in some cases, looser regulations.  </P> <P> "Funding for the basic sciences has gone down in the last 10 years. We're being  hit pretty hard by the Germans, the English and the Japanese," said Jim  Gramlich, director of American Cyanamid Co.'s agriculture research center in  Princeton.  </P> <P> </P> <P> California Among Leaders  </P> <P> California, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, North Carolina and New Jersey are the  states having the most companies with biotech connections, IBA spokeswoman  Sherrod Shim said. States benefit in taxes and jobs by supporting biotechnology  and can be good sources of start-up funds, state biotech center officials  state.  </P> <P> However, in the long run, the New Jersey Center for Advanced Biotechnology and  Medicine hopes to attract federal support and backing from pharmaceutical  companies, said Robert Namovicz, the center's executive director.  </P> <P> Agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science  Foundation have responded to challenges from abroad in recent years with more  grants to universities and industry, but not everyone sees that as an answer.  </P> <P> "They are good to a certain point. They're more directed toward the research,  and what we're really about is developing a commercial product," said Don Reed,  chief financial officer of Massachusetts' Cambridge BioScience Corp.  </P> <P> U.S. companies have not yet taken their business to countries with looser  regulations, such as France or Italy, said Jeff Gibbs, one of three authors of  "Biotechnology and the Environment: International Regulation."  </P> <P> But it could happen, Gibbs said, even though the European Community is studying  whether to establish uniform rules that would probably lean toward those in  countries like Denmark and West Germany, where the stronger influence of  environmental groups has led to tougher regulation.  </P> <P> What companies are doing is taking advantage of the newness of the U.S.  regulatory environment. The Patent and Trademark Office, facing a backlog of  more than 6,000 biotech applications, asked the industry association in early  November to train more patent examiners to handle the caseload.  </P> <P> All over the country, companies are racing to develop new products.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AIDS Diagnosis Technique  </P> <P> Cetus Corp., of Emeryville, Calif., has worked to develop polymerase chain  reaction which lets scientists magnify a single piece of DNA, the molecule that  carries genetic information. Cetus president Robert Fildes said PCR simplifies  diagnosticians' task of finding viruses from infected cells. It can determine  in hours if a cell has been infected with AIDS, for example, something that  would take six weeks using tests in a culture medium, Fildes said.  </P> <P> Lifecodes Corp., of Tarrytown, N.Y., is offering DNA tests to determine the  guilt or innocence of criminal suspects from body fluids. Company spokeswoman  Karen Wexler said Lifecodes will soon offer a kit that tests DNA samples of  suspects' blood or semen to match them to samples taken from the crime.  </P> <P> Turf battles between federal agencies trying to decide jurisdiction for each  new biotechnology product and the constantly changing science complicate the  task of companies seeking a piece of the market, said Jan Kurtz, with the  science advisory board for the federal Environmental Protection Agency.  </P> <P> "We're trying to make a patchwork quilt," Kurtz said. "It's not easy to  promulgate new legislation. The questions are all new."  </P> <P> Faye Peterson, a Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman, said the regulatory  process does not differ greatly from that for other products submitted to the  agency. Regulation levels are appropriate and do not require further expansion,  an assessment shared by most company officials, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warnings of Dangers  </P> <P> However, Mike Cannell of the Wisconsin Family Farm Defense Fund Inc., a group  opposed to biotechnology in agriculture for economic and safety reasons, said,  "It doesn't take a black heart to imagine the worst when the chemical companies  are supplying most of the regulatory data."  </P> <P> Groups like Cannell's and the Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends  contend that the dangers of biotechnology have not been sufficiently examined.  Critics point to herbicides and pesticides that were once considered harmless  and have been proven to pollute ground water as reason to doubt the motives of  any industry that is being regulated.  </P> <P> The industry says fears of genetically engineered bacteria running wild mislead  the public and legislators into seeking to toughen the regulatory road.  </P> <P> "The risks are sometimes greatly exaggerated of nature gone wild. We all grew  up on the same movies of giant spiders that escaped laboratories and ate  Chicago," said Hugh A. D'Andrade, executive vice president of Schering-Plough  Corp. in Madison and vice chairman of the industry association.  </P> <P> More plausible dangers involve weed-control experiments that could backfire  with the wrong gene implanted, letting the weed reproduce, and even that would  be highly improbable because researchers start experiments with some idea of  which genes accomplish what ends, D'Andrade said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Smaller Firms' Troubles  </P> <P> The specialized knowledge and costly equipment required will keep the  technology out of the wrong hands, and regulation coupled with companies' wish  not to damage their credibility will keep products from being rushed onto the  market without proper safeguards, he said.  </P> <P> Lisa Drake, a spokeswoman for Monsanto Co. in St. Louis, said that the company  is used to regulatory mazes but that it is harder for smaller firms. "We're  used to working within those kinds of boundaries. But a lot of smaller  companies are bothered by regulations because it's so expensive and takes so  much time."  </P> <P> Smaller companies living off initial investment capital all feel pressure in an  uncertain market to put products on the shelves, American Cyanamid's Gramlich  said. "They can only survive so long in savings and research contracts. I don't  think any company can put 50 to 60% into research as some of these have and  survive long."  </P> <P> Smaller companies like Epitope Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., can no longer ask  investors to wait, as in the early days of biotechnology, said Michael Hubbard,  president. "They're not satisfied with companies any more that say, 'We're  going to lose money for six or seven years.'  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Applicable Things'  </P> <P> "We've geared our work to very applicable things rather than heading into  long-term things like cancer treatment."  </P> <P> The competition could also reduce the number of companies. Executives predict  that one-third of the industry will be acquired within five years and nearly  half within 10 years, according to "Biotech 89: Commercialization," a report by  Arthur Young Co.  </P></p>

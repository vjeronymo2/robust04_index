			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Governments reach accord on N Ireland talks THE BRITISH and Irish governments have agreed to try to restart political talks in Northern Ireland in the new year. The talks, involving both governments and the four main political parties in the province, broke up last week without agreement and no clear commitment to renew dialogue. The discussions had sought an agreement on a new devolved administration in Northern Ireland, and a replacement of the 1985 agreement. Both governments agreed in Dublin yesterday 'that the objectives of the talks process are both valid and achievable'. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, agreed that the most fruitful stage of the talks had occurred in the past four weeks, when the round-table plenary and committee stages were abandoned in favour of bilateral meet-ings. Sir Patrick said: 'People got on better on a party-to-party and a one-to-one basis.' Mr Andrews admitted that there had been no bilateral meeting between the Irish government and the Democratic Unionist party led by the Rev Ian Paisley. 'We would like to meet the DUP in bilateral talks,' he said. The value of any future talks would be greatly diminished without such a meeting.' He criticised the a la carte approach of the DUP to the past series of meetings, but praised the 'moderate and very conciliatory' approach of Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party. Yesterday's meeting dealt at length with the upsurge in paramilitary violence in the North. Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish justice minister, said there now existed a threat of the violence extending into the Irish Republic. The meeting, on the seventh anniversary of the signing of the 1985 Hillsborough agreement, was the first bilateral discussion under the agreement since April, when regular meetings were adjourned to allow the inter-party talks to take place. The unionist parties oppose the 1985 agreement because of the role it gives to the Republic in Northern Ireland's affairs, and refuse to participate in talks while the intergovernmental meetings continue. The governments have agreed to meet 'as soon as is practicable' before Christmas with a further intergovernmental conference in the new year. That would establish a new pause in the process so that the multilateral talks could begin again.</p>

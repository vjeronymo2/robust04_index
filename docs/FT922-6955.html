			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Compass RESILIENT demand helped Compass Group, the catering and hospitals concern, to increase pre-tax profit by nearly 10 per cent, from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 17m, in the six months to March 29. Turnover advanced at a similar rate to Pounds 177m (Pounds 161m). Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, said both divisions had achieved record sales and profits. In contract catering, operating profit rose to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 12.7m) on sales of Pounds 146m (Pounds 132m). The margin was reduced by a large contract with British Telecom, announced at this time last year. It contributed about Pounds 20m to turnover but the margin was much lower than with established contracts. Fewer new contracts were signed and more were lost as sites closed, leaving a net gain of only seven. Redundancies also reduced traffic through some canteens. Opportunities were opening up in public sector hospitals and schools. The catering market in health and education was worth about Pounds 3.3bn, more than twice the corporate market. However, only 5 per cent was contracted out compared with 50 per cent in the business sector. The purchase of four hospitals early in 1991, taking the total to 15, helped the healthcare division to increase operating profit to Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 5.6m) on sales of Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 26.1m). Although average occupancy fell from 57.5 to 50 per cent because of the acquisitions, improved efficiency enabled overall margins to rise slight-ly. Net debt fell to Pounds 36.5m, against Pounds 41.1m at the year-end. However, last year's acquisition-led spending bulge was in the first half, whereas most of this year's investment in hospital expansion will come in the second half. Earnings per share rose to 16.8p (15.4p) and the interim dividend goes up to 4.19p (3.85p). COMMENT While scope remains for improving margins at BT and the acquired hospitals, short-term growth in catering will be limited by the lagging recovery in employment and by the time taken to win public-sector contracts. A move on to the continent also looks medium-term, unless some acquisition is in its sights. Market rumours have resurfaced that it may be interested in its rival Gardner Merchant. While Forte would consider a rich offer, Compass is unlikely to pay over the odds and there would be a monopoly issue in the UK, where the two have 50 per cent of the corporate market. A full-year pre-tax profit of Pounds 35m gives a prospective multiple of about 15 on yesterday's close of 519p, down 8p as expectations were a little dampened. While Compass has no trough to bounce back from, it deserves a premium for its sustained growth record and for the bright prospects in both its markets. After a good run, the shares still look a strong hold.</p>

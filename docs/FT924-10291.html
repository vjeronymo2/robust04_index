			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Letter: Privatisation of Post Office ludicrous Sir, The notion that privatisation of the Post Office is a desirable and 'feasible' proposition ('Post Office privatisation 'feasible'', October 26) is ludicrous if one couples with it the idea that both the standard of service and employment levels are to be maintained. Britain's Post Office evolved over 150 years to become the best in the world. Accountants with calculators cannot measure the negative welfare effect of dismembering the services it offers. Sir Ronald Deering, the former chairman, knew this and said so - perhaps that is why the blinkered Thatcherite marketeers welcomed his departure. The less profitable counters business provides both a service and a kind of life line for the least affluent sections of the community as both staff and customers will testify. Furthermore, sub-postmasters, who account for more than 70 per cent of the total business, have collectively invested Pounds 6bn in their businesses. The best way forward is to permit Post Office Counters to extend its services to include other money collection and financial services. The national network is ideally suited to do this. Royal Mail Letters has consistently improved its performance and profitability while at the same time passing the benefits on to the public. In January 1977 a first-class letter cost 8 1/2 p compared with 24p at present - an increase of 282.35 per cent against a rise of 415.94 per cent in the retail prices index. Furthermore, postage rates have now been frozen until March 1993. Compare that with gas, electricity, water and telephone charges over a similar period. Only supporters of madcap economics would propose the destruction of a proven and generally well-run public service. It should remain intact and be encouraged to utilise and develop new technology to provide an even better service.

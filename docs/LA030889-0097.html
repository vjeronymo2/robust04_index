			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: FESTIVAL OFFERS 'NOTTURNO,' RESTORED 'SODOM, GOMORRHA'  </P> <P> The American premiere of Fritz Lehner's "Notturno" (1988) and the screening of  the recently restored 1922 spectacle "Sodom und Gomorrha" are among the  highlights of "The Contemporary Art Scene in Austria" festival, which the Max  Kade Institute and the Austrian Consulate General is presenting with USC's  schools of cinema and drama.  </P> <P> "Notturno" screens Saturday at USC's Norris Theater at 8 p.m., and "Sodom und  Gomorrha" will be shown by the Silent Society at the Hollywood Studio Museum  tonight at 7:30 with piano accompaniment by Robert Israel.  </P> <P> "Sodom und Gomorrha" is hardly contemporary but it's fun -- a must for silent  film buffs. Directed by Michael Curtiz when his last name was still spelled  Kertesz, this stupefying yet also stupendous picture makes De Mille epics of  the period seem like models of taste and restraint. We think of Vienna as a  citadel of European sophistication, but this production is pure kitsch with a  capital K. The sets seem far bigger and more elaborate than those for  "Intolerance" and even De Mille's silent "Ten Commandments," but they're all so  gaudy they're awful and the acting isn't acting, for the most part, but  extravagant posturing.  </P> <P> Like many a De Mille production, a modern story and a biblical inspirational  tale are intercut. The modern story involves a young woman, Mary Conway (Lucy  Doraine), who becomes completely cynical when her mother marries her off to a  banker, a vastly rich older man (Georg Reimers) whose mansion seems bigger than  the Schoenbrunn Palace.  </P> <P> After driving one man (Kurt Ehrle) nearly to suicide and drifting into an  affair with her stepson (Walter Slezak, then a slim youth), Mary has two  severely cautionary dreams-within-a dream. (This is none too clear on the  screen.) First, there's her nightmare imagining the dire consequences of her  behavior, which in turn gives way to her dream that she is the wife of Lot and  the Queen of Syria.  </P> <P> Yet "Sodom und Gomorrha" is worth seeing for more than camp or history.  Cinematographer Gustav Ucicky's images are remarkable, and they grow more so as  the barbaric nonsense and tepid orgies of the biblical sequences build toward a  climax of epic destruction, a vision of chaos that takes you by surprise with  its sheer power and duration. In retrospect it's amazing to realize that 20  years later Curtiz directed two of Hollywood's most beloved movies, "Yankee  Doodle Dandy" and "Casablanca." (For reservations for "Sodom und Gomorrha":  (213) 937-0776.)  </P> <P> Fritz Lehner's "Notturno" is an impassioned, very beautiful -- and sometimes  quite free -- rendering of the life of Schubert, which turns on the generally  accepted belief that the Viennese composer was a syphillitic. In its heady,  gorgeous way, "Notturno" is an intense and engaging film in which the likable,  unhandsome young Schubert (Udo Samuel) transforms his sexual longing into great  music (which of course floods the sound track). For more festival information:  (213) 743-8066, 444-9310.  </P> <P> Aki Kaurismaki's "Hamlet Goes Into Business" (1987), which screens Saturday at  7:30 p.m. in Melnitz Theater as part of the final program in the UCLA Film  Archives' "The Brothers Kaurismaki" retrospective, is as successful and bold a  contemporary reworking of Shakespeare as Aki's "Crime and Punishment."  </P> <P> Aki's unprepossessing Hamlet (Pirkka-Pekka Petelius) is the bulky, middle-aged  son of a Helsinki industrial paper and shipping tycoon who is poisoned by his  brother Klaus (Esko Salminen), who would reduce a once-mighty family concern to  turning out rubber ducks.  </P> <P> There's nothing noble about this lethal family and its deadly machinations, but  its plight and its fate have considerable political implications both for life  in Finland and that country's minor position in world trade. Shot in striking  high contrast black-and-white like a classic film noir, "Hamlet Goes Into  Business" is set largely in the family's vast, castle-like mansion, as isolated  as Elsinore, and it has a darkly humorous, dryly outrageous tone.  </P> <P> Second feature is Mika's "The Worthless" (1982). Information: (213) 206-8013,  206-FILM.  </P></p>

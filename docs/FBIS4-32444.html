			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, June 23 (AFP) -- The Bosnian Parliament  Thursday unanimously re-elected Haris Silajdzic as prime  minister of the new, deeply re-shuffled Bosnian Government which  now includes six Croat ministers. Silajdzic will head a  government acting not only as government of Bosnia but also of  the Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia which will officially come  into being as soon as legislative elections scheduled for  September are held.    There are 11 Moslem ministers including the prime minister  and Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic, who kept his portfolio,  as well as the ministers of the interior, transport, industry  and energy, refugees and social affairs, education, environment  and three with no portfolios. The six Croat ministers include  Jadranko Prlic who was appointed defence minister and deputy  prime minister. The Croats hold the finance, justice, health  and trade portfolios and one minister has no fixed portfolio.  Each minister's deputy will be from the opposing ethnic group.    Political analysts say that as the men in both governments  are the same, with Bosnian Serbs occupying 70 percent of Bosnia  and the ethnic divisions of the country having been radically  modified in two years of warfare, the day-to-day management of  affairs is likely to remain unchanged. However, what is new is  that the zones currently controlled by the Croat forces of  Bosnia, that is the central area and practically the whole of  Herzegovina, will be managed by Croats within the new government.    The existing structures are likely to change name, and the  Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, declared before the Federation,  is likely to be diffused into the eight federal cantons: four  Moslem majority, two Croat majority and two mixed.    The president of the Federation, moderate Croat Kresimir  Zubak, and his vice-president, Moslem Ejup Ganic, were appointed  in May.</p>

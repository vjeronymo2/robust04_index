			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> SCHOOL GETS AID FOR REPAIRS  </P> <P> Monrovia High School will no longer have to cram students into the gymnasium  for assemblies, thanks to state aid that will be used to repair an auditorium  damaged in an earthquake.  </P> <P> The 1,500-seat auditorium has been closed since the 1987 Whittier earthquake  dislodged segments of the ceiling. Building inspectors initially said the  damage was not caused by the earthquake, but a re-evaluation ordered by the  district has qualified the school for the $417,000 in financial aid, the state  Department of Finance announced last month.  </P> <P> "It's a real godsend," said Principal Jack Clement, adding that pep rallies the  school has been holding in the football stadium "are just not as exciting."  Drama students have had to travel to Clifton Middle School to use its  auditorium for rehearsals, he said.  </P> <P> The funds, to be received in March, will cover 80% of the repair costs for the  ceiling, including removal of asbestos.  </P> <P> The Monrovia Unified School District has applied for $100,000 in federal  earthquake aid for the rest of the expenses, school board President Christine  Goudy said.  </P></p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Fall in jobless shows sluggish US recovery FIGURES showing the first fall in US unemployment for nine months were yesterday seen as further evidence that a sluggish recovery is underway. The Labour Department said the unemployment rate fell to 7.2 per cent last month compared with 7.3 per cent in March. Non-agricultural employment rose 126,000 to just over 109m, about twice the increase expected in financial markets. This was the third consecutive monthly increase in non-farm employment after a setback during the winter. 'It's a crawl, but a crawl up', said Mr Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Group, an economic consultancy. He said employment was rising at about half the rate normal at the start of an economic recovery. Mr William Brown, chief economist at J P Morgan, said the figures indicated positive economic growth but 'not a fully-fledged recovery'. Many analysts expect the economy to continue expanding at about the 2 per cent annual rate registered in the first quarter. Few economists rule out the possibility of another small cut in interest rates if the economy fails to gather momentum. The Federal Reserve, the central bank, has failed to prevent the money supply once again falling below its 2.5 to 6.5 per cent growth target band. The composition of last month's employment increase did little to generate confidence. Job creation was centred in business services, health care and the retail trade. Payrolls were flat in manufacturing and construction - the sectors which usually lead the economy out of recession. The jobs report follows a Fed survey this week indicating a slight improvement in retail sales and manufacturing production. However, the pace of recovery of both consumer demand and residential housing appears to have tailed off recently.</p>

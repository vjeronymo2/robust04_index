The French foreign minister would  like the Israeli Government and the PLO to keep to the schedule  of the agreement signed in Washington on 13 September of last  year.

Everything must be done in order to  have every chance of succeeding. I have already said that time  does not work for those who want peace; it works for those  against it. We believe that the announced schedule must be kept  to as much as possible. I hope that a global agreement on  Palestinian autonomy and its implementation will be reached in  the near future.    I believe that the global atmosphere must be changed, that  measures of detente and trust must be developed. This is why,  when I went to Gaza, I advocated the freezing of settlements in  the occupied territories, as well as the imminent release and  rehabilitation of prisoners. I would like to add, however, that  I also understand Israel's concern after the historic leap that  was made last September. I understand the concern of the people  for their security. [end recording]    That was Alain Juppe speaking in Jerusalem last night during  his news conference recorded by Pierre Weill.</p>

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Top Yugoslav air force officer to face charges THE Yugoslav Defence Ministry said yesterday an officer in the air force high command would face criminal proceedings, and four other officers military disciplinary action over the downing of an EC helicopter. It said the incident, in which four Italian and a French observer were killed, had occurred because of 'mistakes by higher organs (in the air force) and a number of adverse circumstances caused by the exceptionally complex situation in Yugoslav air space'. Meanwhile the European Community yesterday decided to reactivate its ceasefire monitoring mission in Yugoslavia on a 'day-to-day basis', and indicated that the Twelve would recognise Slovenia and Croatia next week. The 170 monitors in Yugoslavia are to work with the 50 UN liaison personnel being sent in advance of 10,000 peace-keeping troops. The UN observers are to arrive in Croatia on Tuesday. Half the observers will monitor the ceasefire, which yesterday held for an eighth day. The rest will be dispatched to the Croatian-Serbian border. If the ceasefire holds, the UN troops will go to Krajina, the Serb-inhabited region of south-west Croatia which has declared itself a republic. Mr Milan Babic, the leader of Krajina, has said he wants UN troops deployed elsewhere in the republic, and that his troops will not disarm unless there was a simultaneous disarming of Croat forces. In Brussels, EC foreign ministers lifted sanctions against Montenegro, the main ally of Serbia, which remains the only Yugoslav republic cut off from EC aid and credit. The ministers looked set to recognise Croatia next week, although some member states argued yesterday that recognition pre-empted EC peace negotiations aimed at pinning down guarantees and self-government for the Serbian minority in Croatia - the central dispute of the war. Bosnia-Hercegovina's claim to recognition looked certain to be rejected, on the grounds that its three-way population split between Serbs, Croats and Moslems offered no foundation for consensual independence, and risked sparking another Croatia. Macedonia's claim was being blocked by Greek insistence that recognising it could lead to claims on Greece's province of Macedonia.</p>

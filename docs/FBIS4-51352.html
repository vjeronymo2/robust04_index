			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- To Mr. Tang Liuzhao,  manager of Changzhou Natural Pigment Company, Ltd. in Jiangsu  Province, his cooperation with foreign investors means that he  and his fellow countrymen can step onto the world economic stage.    The Chinese agricultural sector used to export its products  through the National Foreign Trade Corporation, but now the  newly founded joint ventures have their own right and ability to  trade on the international market.    Mr. Tang has traveled overseas several times and has had  direct talks with foreign traders. For him, the price and  demand for natural pigments around the world is well in his mind.    With China's opening policy, foreign-funded enterprises in  agriculture are booming, which helps China's agriculture to  catch up with international standards.    The development of China's socialist market economy has  brought China's agricultural products face to face with severe  competition both on the domestic and foreign markets.    The Chang Jiang River delta is a great grain producing area  in China. Jiangsu Province is just located in this area.    The province has made great efforts to introduce foreign  funds to develop joint venture agricultural enterprises.  Statistics up to the end of last year showed there were 600  such enterprises in the province, and the number was rising in  the first quarter of this year.    The characteristics distinguishing the development of  Jiangsu's foreign-funded agricultural enterprises are: first,  joint ventures' production has changed from agricultural product  processing to both planting and raising, and service; second,  cooperation has broadened from investors in Hong Kong and Taiwan  to include those from Japan, the U.S., Australia and Europe; and  third, the introduction of high-tech programs has increased, and  the amount of investment become larger.    The development of Jiangsu's joint venture agricultural  enterprises shows the prospects of China's agricultural  modernization.    The new type of enterprises engage not only in producing and  processing, but also in domestic and foreign trade, which means  a break from the past in which producing and selling were  separate.    A convincing example is the development of a joint eel  industry company in Dantu County of the province. The company  used to be an eel raising pool. In 1988, it used 5 million  dollars to build a 280,000-sq-m indoor and 3,000-mu  (200,000-sq-m) outdoor eel raising pool. In the meantime, it  set up an eel feed company, an eel roasting factory and a trade  company jointly with Japanese, Shanghai and Guangdong companies.  In such steps, it formed an enterprise system from raw  materials to processing to sales. Now the company has fixed  assets of 125 million yuan.    The joint venture agricultural enterprises are closely  connected with thousands of rural households.    A food company in the port city of Lianyungang is such an  example. It is a vegetable processing plant which has  introduced 400 kinds of improved varieties of vegetable seeds.  After testing, it organized farmers to plant these vegetables  and offered seeds and technical services, with the farmers later  selling the vegetables to the company according to contract.  Now, the company exports about 80 million tons of vegetables  annually.    The introduction of improved crop seeds and advanced  agricultural techniques from overseas has helped local farmers  greatly in improving agriculture production and processing in  order to compete on international market.</p>

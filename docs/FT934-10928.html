			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Arts: The Madam of the Balconies - Theatre What price beauty in times of poverty? Why work to revive the art of the past when deprivation is all around? With lyricism and with poignancy, this play by Mario Vargas Llosa addresses these questions. It has no answers; this is not (thank heavens) a didactic play. At times, indeed, it is hardly a play - more a great swelling funeral ode for the culture of the past. But one watches it with a very full heart. A work of art is a testament to the glory of the human spirit. How then can men so readily let art be destroyed? Alas, they do so all the time. Professor Brunelli, 'the madman of the balconies', is an old Italian who lives in a scruffy old district of Peru and who, as old houses are destroyed to make way for modern high-rise tenements, dedicates his life to saving their balconies. Each old balcony is an example of artistic traditions that speak of generations of Spanish and Arab craftsmanship - that speak of the cross-cultural paths of culture itself. The professor leads a crusade of enthusiastic young boys and old women - a crusade that fails. Modern town planners reject the balconies as antiquated, native South Americans revile them as examples of cultural imperialism, the old ladies are scared away by the dangers of the slum districts, and the Professor's own daughter blames him for sacrificing her life to his cause. This Gate staging has designs by Marjoke Henrichs of aching beauty - with shards of old-gold balconies in layer upon layer, foreground, midground, background, against dazzling azure. Hettie Macdonald, directing, has caught a sense of South American culture by qualities of intonation and gesture throughout her cast of 15. She fills the stage with such depth and breadth of character and colour that we are often contentedly suspended in a situation that is nearly plotless. The performance is dominated by Peter Eyre, who makes the Professor as cultivated, as quaint, as significant, as one of his balconies. He rises to, and reveals, the lyric threnody of Llosa's text with the greatest vocal distinction. He employs an old tenor voice - now reedy, now mellifluous, now suddenly descending into a deep, mellow baritone - and effortlessly strings three or more sentences together on a single breath: all of which conveys not virtuosity but feeling. Much of the play consists of his soliloquies - which often are his tender address to the city of Lima itself, 'my little whore'. I wish the Gate supplied its audience with more information about this play  -its date of composition, its previous performances, and so on; but I can object to little else. The Gate's reputation is largely built upon its stagings of foreign plays by dead authors, and it is good that (since Llosa is alive and kicking) this production reminds us that the Gate also honours world drama of the present day. Llosa never tells us that his balconies symbolise anything. It is enough for him to make the Professor's world real to us: admirable. Still, we may certainly take those balconies as symbols. And among other things they symbolise the art of the Gate itself - the little theatre that in impoverished conditions struggles to revive the past, to enlarge our knowledge of cultures outside our nation, and to make us feel that other cultures are in fact ours too. At the Gate, W11, 071-229-0706, until November 27</p>

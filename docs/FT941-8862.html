			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Unitas still in deficit at FM2.6bn Unitas, Finland's second-largest banking group, stayed in the red with a FM2.57bn (Dollars 467m) deficit last year and warned it may not show a clear profit until 1996. It is the bank's third consecutive annual loss and reflects the weak state of the Finnish economy and high credit losses. Mr Vesa Vainio, Unitas's chairman, said the group's result would improve this year, but it would still be negative. 'In 1995 we expect to have left losses behind us and 1996 should be a clearly profitable year,' he added. The 1993 deficit was only slightly lower than 1992's FM2.70bn loss. Group net income from financing operations rose by 27 per cent to FM2.17bn due to the fall in Finnish interest rates and improved efficiency. However, the benefit was wiped out by a FM500m jump in credit losses to FM3.77bn. The latest figure was aggravated by a FM750m provision against likely future write-offs. Unitas, which is the holding company for the Union Bank of Finland, said corporate credits accounted for FM2.46bn of credit losses and households FM251m. The most problematic sector was trade, hotel and restaurant, accounting for 22 per cent of write-offs, followed by real estate with 14 per cent and construction at 12 per cent. 'Credit losses are expected to decrease this year as the economic recovery gets under way and interest rates stay low,' said Mr Vainio. Non-performing loans peaked during 1993 and at the year-end totalled FM6.84bn, down FM1.46bn from a year earlier.</p>

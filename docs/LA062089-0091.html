			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY POLICY IN LAND SWAPS QUESTIONED BY GRAND JURY  </P> <P> The Orange County Grand Jury Monday questioned a real estate policy in which a  landowner seeking to swap property with the county is sometimes allowed to  choose the appraiser who establishes the value of both parcels.  </P> <P> Under the policy, the landowner must choose the appraiser from a list provided  by the county and must pay the appraiser's fee.  </P> <P> Robert Love, deputy director of the county General Services Agency, said the  policy only applies to cases in which a single landowner is interested in the  county property which cannot be sold on the open market. Love said those cases  represent fewer than 5% of the county's property transactions.  </P> <P> The grand jury report said, however, that "this selection and payment process  can lead to a loss of impartiality on the part of the appraiser." The report  also said that property officials in San Diego and Riverside counties do not  allow an outside party to choose the appraiser.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ensure Objectivity'  </P> <P> The grand jury's administration committee recommended that the county look into  the practices of other counties "and develop a real estate appraisal procedure  that ensures adequate appraiser independence and objectivity."  </P> <P> Bill B. Wills, chairman of the committee, also mitigated the findings, however,  by saying he did not believe that the practice was as serious as he first  believed.  </P> <P> "It seems to me the county has been well served by the process," Wills said.  "We're recommending that they check other counties to see how they handle it,  but I personally think they will find this is a good policy that they have."  </P> <P> Wills said there is an advantage because it deters people who aren't serious  about a transaction by requiring them to pay the appraisal fee. And, he said,  it can prevent disagreements over the appraisal.  </P> <P> Still, Wills said, there is "an appearance of a conflict of interest."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Procedure Defended  </P> <P> Love said he will respond to the grand jury's recommendation, which is only  advisory, and check with other counties about their policies. He also defended  the county's current procedures.  </P> <P> "We're only giving them a list of appraisers that we have confidence in," he  said. "The list is developed based on our staff experiences."  </P> <P> "The advantage is also that the developer is paying the fee rather than the  taxpayer," Love said. And, he said, it avoids disagreements that require the  parties to seek a second appraisal.  </P> <P> "I'm not quite sure what the conflict is," he said.  </P></p>

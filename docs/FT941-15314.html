			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A squeeze as UK institutions turned aggressive buyers of the London market sent futures contracts sharply forward and brought heavy dealing in the traded options, writes Joel Kibazo. After an erratic week of exaggerated swings, buyers were seen for the March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 from the outset as it opened at 3,382. Dealers said US houses that had been prominent sellers in the last two sessions had remained on the sidelines as UK institutions moved in. March lost some momentum mid-session, as traders used the earlier advance to arbitrage between the cash and the futures markets. However, a good premium to cash was maintained throughout the day. It closed at 3,425, just ahead of its fair value premium to cash of 13 points, on volume of 16,688 lots. Turnover in the traded options jumped to a hefty 56,696 lots with heavy trading in the FT-SE 100 option bring closing volume of 22,493.</p>

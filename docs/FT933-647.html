			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Buckingham Intl sells Portuguese subsidiary BUCKINGHAM International, the property, hotels and nursing group which tumbled to pre-tax losses of Pounds 62.5m in the six months to May 2 after a Pounds 60m write-down in the value of its property, is to sell one of its Portuguese subsidiaries for Pounds 9.9m. This comes after Mr John Clark, chief executive, was granted on September 22 an option over 5m 10p shares, or 4.15 per cent of the issued capital, for nil considera-tion. The option is exercisable between March 14 1994 and September 13 2000. The shares closed at 8 1/2 p last night. Morlaix de Portugal Investimentos Hoteleiros e Turisticos, the Portuguese offshoot which owns the Holiday Inn in Lisbon, is to be sold to Mr Marcal, a Lisbon hotelier. Of the total consideration Pounds 1.2m is deferred until December 31 1994. Morlaix's book value is the same as the full consideration. The sale is conditional, principally on the approval of the holders of Buckingham's Pounds 33m convertible redeemable loan stock 1995, part of the security for which is Morlaix. Buckingham is controlled by Purlieus Investments, which in March made a mandatory cash offer for the issued share capital not already owned by it or parties acting in concert with it.</p>

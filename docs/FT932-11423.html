			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / A field-day for the bears: America Another wave of pessimism about the US economy now seems unavoidable. Even bearish forecasters were surprised by first quarter growth figures which showed the economy expanding at a sluggish annual rate of 1.8 per cent, sharply down from the 4.7 per cent rate of the fourth quarter. Final sales actually fell and, but for a jump in corporate inventories (stocks of unsold goods), real gross domestic product would also have contracted. Yesterday brought more gloom: the Purchasing Managers' Index - a widely followed guide to the health of manufacturing industry - was reported sharply down in April, mainly because of a plunge in orders. 'Poor lemmings are still crowding into the US stock market even though it is more overvalued than it has ever been,' says Mr Jim Davidson in a tone of resigned disbelief. Mr Davidson, an investment adviser based in Alexandria, Virginia, is predicting a crash in US share prices, a decline in GDP in spite of further easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and a rise in the US budget deficit to Dollars 600bn-Dollars 700bn as the economy sags. With co-author Lord Rees-Mogg (the former editor of the London Times), he has just published a new edition of The Great Reckoning (Simon &amp; Schuster), a survival guide for the 'final depression of the 20th century'. I mention Mr Davidson's forecast, not because I agree with it, but to illustrate the diversity of informed opinion on the US economy. While not implying another recession, the GDP figures are ominous in some respects. The weakness of some of the US's largest trading partners does appear, finally, to be sapping the vitality of the recovery. Last year US exports defied recessionary forces, growing at a real rate of about 6 per cent. In the first quarter they contracted at an annual rate of 7 per cent relative to the fourth quarter. These preliminary figures, which are often heavily revised, may well be overstating US export weakness; on the other hand, few analysts believe the US has yet felt the full impact of the slow-down in Japan and continental Europe. But whatever the fate of exports, pessimists should remember that they account for less than 15 per cent of national income; the US is thus far better placed than small, open European economies to withstand even severe shocks to its external trade. Other sources of first quarter weakness are less troubling. Business equipment investment expanded less rapidly than at the end of last year, but it still managed a creditable annual rate of increase of nearly 9 per cent relative the fourth quarter - hardly a recessionary reading. Residential investment stalled completely, but home building was hit by bad weather and had anyway soared late last year. Government purchases contracted sharply too, but this reflected a precipitous decline in defence spending at an annual rate of 25 per cent relative to the fourth quarter. Defence will remain weak, but not this weak: almost certainly the collapse reflected the Bush administration's frantic efforts to pump up the economy ahead of November's presidential election by bringing forward spending. This brings us to consumer spending, easily the most important component of demand. Real consumption grew at an annual rate of just over 1 per cent against more than 5 per cent in the fourth quarter. The slow-down was inevitable, given the low rate of US saving and the fact that consumer spending raced ahead of personal incomes at the end of last year. But with employment so far growing faster than last year, and with debt burdens and interest rates well down, real consumer spending should grow faster this year than the 2.3 per cent registered for the whole of 1992. While consumption growth at an annualised rate of 5 per cent was never realistic, an underlying rate of, say, 3 per cent is not far-fetched. Recoveries never proceed in a straight line: a couple of strong quarters followed by a weak quarter is a perfectly normal pattern. But the eight successive quarters of growth registered since the mild contraction in the winter of 1990-91 are a reassuring sign of the economy's underlying momentum. If you average the fourth and first quarters, you get real growth at an annual rate of 3.3 per cent, in keeping with the rate of expansion in the third quarter of last year and close to what most economists still believe is feasible for this year as a whole. A glance at spending in cash rather than inflation-adjusted terms confirms the economy's continuing buoyancy: nominal GDP grew at an annual rate of about 5 per cent in the first quarter, down from 7 per cent in the fourth quarter, but hardly a signal of impending doom. Early figures for April provide tentative signs of a pick-up in spending. But the decline in the Purchasing Managers' Index suggests production and employment could be subdued for several months in reaction to weak demand in the first quarter. Consumer and business confidence is fragile partly because of growing uncertainty about the Clinton economic programme. Nobody is any longer sure which taxes will go up or whether the promised deficit reduction will materialise. At this stage the best guess remains that US growth will erratically climb back towards 3 per cent later this year.</p>

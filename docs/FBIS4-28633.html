			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 9 (YONHAP) -- An exchange of public  servants between South Korea and China will be realized from  June 28 for the first time in history, the Government  Administration Ministry said Thursday.    The government plans to send 16 grade-five, working-level  officials to a three-week group training course for public  servants offered by the Chinese personnel ministry from June 28  to July 19.    The exchange is based on an agreement to expand personnel  cooperation signed by Seoul and Beijing last March.    China will also send about 15 public servants to South Korea  in early September to attend the central officials training  institute here, a Ministry official said.    The exchange of public officials is designed to promote  friendly and cooperative relations between the two nations'  civil servants by widening their knowledge of the other  country's reform policy.</p>

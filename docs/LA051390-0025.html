			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ** 1/2 JEFFREY DANIEL, "SKINNY BOY," SOLAR/EPIC. ALBUMS ARE RATED FROM ONE TO  FIVE STARS.  </P> <P> There is something disarmingly refreshing about ex-Shalamar member Daniel's  musical style. But Daniel lacks a great instinctual producer like Andre Cymone  (who works with another Shalamar alum, Jody Watley) in his corner. The  liveliest cuts seem to cry out for remix treatment and Daniel, who's best known  for his choreography, needs at least one killer dance track. CONNIE JOHNSON  </P></p>

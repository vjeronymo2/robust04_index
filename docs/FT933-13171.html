			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Cagliari's death casts shadow over inquiry: Concern about the abuse of power in probe of corruption THE DEATH in prison yesterday of Mr Gabriele Cagliari, former chairman of ENI, the Italian state oil concern, has brought to a head the long-simmering debate over the methods of magistrates investigating the natiowide corruption scandals. Immediately at issue is the abusive use of the magistrates' powers of preventive detention that conflicts with the basic right of habeas corpus. The matter was raised by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro in a controversial speech on July 8 when he expressed his doubts about the behaviour of magistrates: 'There is no doubt that the use of prison to make talk someone under investigation is against the inviolable rights of man.' The bulk of the politicians and a few jurists immediately sided with the president. The press was largely neutral, and may well remain so now, aware the latest opinion poll shows the public is 57 per cent behind the judges on preventive detention, with 34 per cent against. But Mr Cagliari's apparent suicide, the ninth since the corruption investigations began in February 1992, inevitably raises two broader questions: has the judiciary accumulated too much power?; and has it become too politicised in seeking to extirpate a corrupt political system? The handling of this controversy will determine the future course of the corruption investigations and could well produce a constitutional tussle between the respective powers of the legislature and judiciary. Parliament, where one in six members are under investigation, will do its best to exploit the occasion by trying to the shackle the magistrates' behaviour with more restrictive legislation. New legislation limiting the terms of preventive detention is already in the pipeline. The Milan magistrates, confident of public support, are unlikely to take lying down any challenge to their authority, or any suggestion that their investigations be tempered. However, the Italian magistrature as a whole is not as combative as that of Milan, which has spearheaded the corruption investigations and has been using the most questionable methods. The case of Mr Cagliari is an apparent suicide after being held in Milan's San Vittore jail for 133 days. Latterly the 67-year-old former ENI chairman shared a cell with three others, including a drug offender. Magistrates can hold a person for up to three months. Thereafter the person has to be released unless due cause is shown by the magistrates. On five occasions, the last being only three days ago, Mr Cagliari was refused bail while magistrates investigated a string of charges relating to illicit financing of political parties when he ran ENI from 1989 onwards. On each occasion, Milan magistrates justified the refusal on the grounds that their enquiries concerned large sums of money lodged abroad. If allowed to leave prison for house arrest, Mr Cagliari could prejudice matters, they said. The Milan magistrates argued convincingly that ENI had emerged as the centre of the biggest single source of illicit financing of the political parties and their friends. Mr Cagliari said he had inherited a kick-backs system at ENI and admitted to at least L27bn (Pounds 11.3m) being passed with his knowledge to the Christian Democrats and Socialists. Mr Cagliari was also being questioned about alleged corruption in the reorganisation of the chemicals industry through the disposal of Enimont. Magistrates claimed yesterday that Mr Cagliari had recently admitted to knowing of L10bn going to the political parties. Yet despite Mr Cagliari being such a key figure, he appeared to be held in prison essentially as a means of pressure to make him talk. Mr Vittorio D'Aiello, his lawyer, insisted this was the case and released the transcript of his last interrogation on July 15 in which he said: 'I have been nearly 140 days in San Vittore prison and still have sought to maintain a certain reserve on some issues. At the same time I find it ethically and psychologically difficult to adopt a course of action which although it might help me would end up involving other people, perhaps colleagues and friends I have known for years.' Milan magistrates have adopted a clear carrot and stick approach with all those under investigation. The pressures are considerable - two people have died of heart attacks under investigation, including Mr Vincenzo Balzamo, the Socialist party treasurer. The second main criticism of the magistrates is that they have used the aviso di garanzia - the judicial warning that a person is under investigation - as a means of discrediting people. The aviso has come to be seen as an automatic indication of guilt, even though charges have not been pressed.</p>

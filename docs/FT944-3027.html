			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (3): 'Distorted' returns criticised - The changes to the Trustee Investments Act The Trustee Investments Act of 1961 was, by all accounts, drafted with the best of intentions. Trustees of charities were to ensure that donations were invested prudently, and that scarce assets were not wasted on high-risk ventures, or used to line the pockets of those who managed the money. But now, charitable organisations say, recent modifications to the act simply do not go far enough. The act is having the unfortunate effect of pushing charitable investment into relatively lower yielding securities, depriving them of badly needed investment returns at a time of shrinking donations. Moreover, it encourages certain distortions in investment which a 'prudent man' would never choose of his own accord. As a result, there is growing pressure from charities and those who invest on their behalf to alter the Trustee Investments Act so that funds may be managed in a more sensible fashion. In 1961, the terms of the act called for those who managed charity assets to place 50 per cent of funds into 'narrow' investments and the remainder into 'wider assets'. Narrow assets meant government stocks and cash, while wider assets meant certain UK equities. One criterion for equity investment specified that charities could only buy shares which had paid dividends for at least the five previous years. Mr Martyn Bensley, head of Fleming Investment Management's charity division, notes that the criteria have served charities badly. A Pounds 2m sum invested in 1961 would have earned Pounds 14m on the equities portion and just Pounds 700,000 on the 50 per cent of assets invested narrowly, by the end of last year. In 1992, amendments to the Charities Act brought some improvements. The category of narrower investments was broadened to include government bonds of European Union member states and unit trusts which invest in gilts. Meanwhile, the category of wider investments was broadened to include the shares of companies based in the EU. Investment in companies outside the EU can only be made through recognised unit trusts. Mr Bensley points out that even this broadening of definitions distorts investment. 'As a charity, you still cannot invest directly in shares of the US or of Japan, although you can invest directly into Greece or Iceland.' He describes the effect of the rules as 'crackers, just crackers.' However, changes to the act's section 24 authorised the creation of common investment funds (Cifs) and common deposit funds (CDFs), and these allowed professional investment managers to skirt some of the Act's more restrictive aspects. Apart from the rules creating these categories of pooled fund, other amendments to the act place greater emphasis on the fiduciary duties of trustees and make them personally liable for carrying out those duties. The effect of these legislative changes has been to create a surge in pooled funds offered to charities by leading UK fund management companies. For example, concern about trustees' duties under the act prompted Buzzacott Investment Management, a firm of chartered accountants which also manages funds for charities, to turn over Pounds 60m of client funds to Mercury Asset Management for investment through its pooled funds. The 1992 amendments also bar those who audit charity funds from managing them as well. However, the act is anomalous in that regulation of these pools falls to the Charities Commission, a body which may be well aware of the needs of charities but knows relatively little of the complexities of investment. For example, it recently dithered for seven months over whether it would be proper for the UK's largest charity, the Wellcome Trust, to invest in venture capital through limited partnerships. Investment in partnerships could have been deemed to constitute trading, an activity from which charities are banned, the commission feared. Investment professionals note that self-regulatory bodies in the financial services industry are probably better placed than the Charities Commission to consider issues of this sort. Thus, alterations in the regulation of pooled funds is one of the goals of a charities and voluntary organisations task force. 'The burden of regulation as it currently stands can, for smaller organisations, be so onerous and costly that it threatens to stifle the enthusiasm of volunteers and sometimes even the existence of the organisations themselves,' according to a Flemings' update on the charity investment regulations. Instead of the Charities Commission, one of the self-regulatory bodies for the financial services industry should be charged with overseeing the regulation of pooled funds, it is being argued. The task force, whose members include representatives of the Home Office and the Treasury, as well as charitable organisations and fund managers, produced a report earlier this year setting out 189 proposed changes to the regulation of charities. It is understood that the Treasury is considering the case for reform, although no legislation is considered likely for at least two years. In particular, the group is seeking deregulation of investment powers. Currently, charity trustees cannot lawfully designate the management of their investments to a professional manager or appoint a nominee company unless their own trust deed specifically permits them to do so. Also, as far as the scope for investment discretion is concerned, the task force had recommended that the concept of 'wider' and 'narrower' investments be scrapped altogether. Privately, this suggestion has been rejected by government ministers, but the group is still urging that the category for wider investments be broadened to cover 90 per cent of the funds under management. The task force is also urging that the choice of permitted investments should be considerably broadened.</p>

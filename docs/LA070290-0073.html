			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JAIL CROWDING CASE IN COURT AGAIN;  </P> <P> DEADLINE: A COURT-IMPOSED DEADLINE HAS PASSED AND THE COUNTY MUST EXPLAIN TO A  JUDGE WHAT, IF ANYTHING, IT HAS DONE TO SOLVE THE CHRONIC PROBLEM.  </P> <P> In row upon row of triple-deck bunks barely a few feet apart, inmates packed  into the downtown San Diego County Jail woke up to another day last week of  stifling heat.  </P> <P> The one working shower in each dormitory-like block, which houses dozens of  men, offered some measure of relief. The blaring televisions, tuned to an old  movie, offered authorized escape.  </P> <P> Newspapers served triple duty. They were there to be read. They served as fans.  Some inmates had taken individual pages and affixed them to the sides of their  bunks as makeshift shields from the searing sun pouring through the windows.  </P> <P> That day, as they had for years, according to a county judge, conditions at the  downtown jail violated the federal Constitution. They were cruel and unusual.  </P> <P> The heat only made things worse. The unresolved problem is simply that too many  men were, and consistently have been, jammed into the aging facility.  </P> <P> At a court hearing today, another judge, the most recent in a line of judges  presiding over two major court cases protesting overcrowding at the downtown  jail and at various other county jails, will decide whether the county has to  do anything about it.  </P> <P> "I think we are really getting to the moment of truth," said Betty Wheeler, an  attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought both suits.  </P> <P> It already has been 10 years since the first judge, ruling in the first suit,  declared that conditions at the downtown jail were cruel and unusual.  </P> <P> Now the county has seven jails at various sites, all chronically under-funded  and overcrowded. To avoid a lengthy and costly trial on a second ACLU suit  challenging conditions at the newer facilities, the county agreed to a 1988  settlement imposing caps on inmate populations.  </P> <P> The date for complying with those caps was Sunday. The two suits have been  joined together for a hearing today before the latest judge to consider  conditions at the jails, El Cajon Superior Court Judge James Malkus.  </P> <P> If the inmate population is not below the caps, Malkus said at a hearing  earlier this year, he could issue contempt-of-court citations or impose fines  on county supervisors or on jail officials. Though that is possible, it is  unlikely, according to lawyers in the case.  </P> <P> At a hearing last month, Malkus told the county to be prepared either to put up  tents to serve as temporary housing or to bus male inmates to jails in  neighboring counties.  </P> <P> In legal papers filed late Friday, the county said it expected to meet the  caps. But it admitted that it would do so only through a complex series of  maneuvers.  </P> <P> In part, they include the deportation of certain undocumented immigrants  convicted of crimes and the addition of bunks at outlying jails for transfers  from the downtown jail. The county also has made use of a system to exclude  from the daily count -- on various grounds -- dozens of inmates who assuredly  are in the jails.  </P> <P> ACLU lawyer Wheeler, meanwhile, claims that all the county has done is engage  in a number-juggling "shell game" and remains nowhere near true compliance. The  inmate census fails to comply with a cap imposed on the downtown jail in the  first suit, meeting instead only a more generous, "temporary" figure allowed by  Malkus, she contends.  </P> <P> Because it is so desperate for jail space, meanwhile, the county has adopted a  policy of jailing only felons, while for the most part citing and then allowing  thousands of alleged misdemeanor offenders to walk free.  </P> <P> At last month's hearing, Malkus ordered that women arrested for misdemeanors be  cited and released, just as men have been for years. That action raised  community fears of an increase in prostitution, which Malkus said was  groundless.  </P> <P> "Even if we comply with the court order, I think conditions . . . (are)  horrible," said Cmdr. Mel Nichols, who directs the daily operation of the  jails.  </P> <P> He added in a separate interview, "I would think that after the period of time  that's been involved that somebody would get serious about resolving this  problem."  </P> <P> In September, 1977, an inmate named Henry Hudler at the downtown jail set into  motion the legal challenges that have led to today's hearing before Malkus. The  population in what was then the county's only detention facility, built in  1960, had reached 1,500.  </P> <P> The state Department of Corrections, charged by law with determining how many  inmates a jail should house, puts the number for the downtown jail at 730.  </P> <P> The ACLU filed suit against the county on Hudler's behalf, alleging a variety  of ills attributable to overcrowding, including understaffing by deputies and  lack of inmate access to recreation, visitation and their attorneys, according  to Alex Landon, the lawyer who brought the suit.  </P> <P> After a seven-month trial, San Diego Superior Court Judge James Focht ruled  that conditions at the downtown jail violated the federal Constitution's  prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. He ordered the Sheriff's  Department to house no more than 750 inmates there.  </P> <P> The ACLU filed the second suit in 1987, again alleging overcrowding, this time  at the five jails the county had since built. In December, 1988, San Diego  Superior Court Judge Barbara T. Gamer approved a settlement in that suit under  which the county agreed to meet certain inmate caps by July 1, 1990 --  yesterday.  </P> <P> The ACLU agreed in May, 1988, to a temporary cap of 1,250 at the downtown jail  while the Vista jail was being emptied for renovation. At last month's hearing,  with Vista fully operational, Malkus ordered the downtown cap lowered to 1,000.  </P> <P> The pact called for the cap at the Vista jail to be set at 937. Other caps were  440 at Descanso, 251 at El Cajon, 373 at Chula Vista and 478 at the Las Colinas  women's jail in Santee, according to Landon.  </P> <P> The men's jail at Las Colinas is not included in the pact because it was built  after the 1987 suit was filed. According to jail officials, it currently holds  nearly 600 inmates, hundreds more than the state board says it should.  </P> <P> Each of the figures set forth in the agreement is also well above the  recommendation set by the state board. For instance, the board rated the El  Cajon facility not at 251 inmates but at 120.  </P> <P> The higher figures were designed solely to satisfy the lawsuit's goal of  meeting bare constitutional minimums -- to avoid cruel and unusual punishment  for inmates already convicted of crimes and to assure due process to inmates  awaiting trial, according to Landon, now in private practice but still involved  with the jail suits.  </P> <P> For months after the December, 1988, settlement agreement, the total  populations and resultant overcrowding did not significantly improve, according  to a court document Landon filed earlier this year.  </P> <P> As a result, he contended in the legal papers, the county has "essentially lost  control of the jails."  </P> <P> From July, 1988, through January, 1990, the San Diego County Sheriff's  Department documented 35 "major inmate disturbances," or nearly one every two  weeks, Landon said in the filing.  </P> <P> Three major fights, each producing injuries to dozens of inmates, have erupted  so far this year, each at a different jail. Though the brawls have all been  racially motivated fights between black and Latino inmates, the crowded  conditions played a part in escalating tensions, sheriff's deputies have said  after each disturbance.  </P> <P> "When you have massive overcrowding, you have a set of circumstances that  jeopardizes the safety of the inmates and the safety of (the) staff," Wheeler  said. "We're not talking at all about providing country club conditions. We're  talking about providing conditions that result in an acceptable level of safety  and health."  </P> <P> At last month's hearing before Malkus, on June 11, the jail populations  exceeded the caps by a total of about 230 inmates. County officials asked  Malkus to extend the July 1 deadline by three months.  </P> <P> He refused. Instead, calling it an "emergency situation," the judge ordered the  county to return to court today with a report on the feasibility of either  busing inmates to other jails in nearby counties or putting up tents for  temporary housing.  </P> <P> While they worked on the plan, county officials stressed that any long-term  solution depends on money -- lots more of it.  </P> <P> With more cash, the county would be able to build more jails and have the funds  to staff them, said Rich Robinson, director of the county's Office of Special  Projects, which since 1986 has been charged with addressing jail-related  issues.  </P> <P> A 1,000-bed facility is under construction on East Mesa, near the U.S.-Mexico  border and seven miles east of I-805. But because the county doesn't have the  money to operate it, the jail may sit vacant once it is completed in spring of  1991.  </P> <P> County officials contend the state is to blame for a lack of cash, saying the  state has grossly underpaid the county in the return of tax revenues, money  that would go into the county's general fund, which pays for most of the  criminal justice system.  </P> <P> San Diego County ranked 57th among California's 58 counties in fiscal year 1988  in the return of per capita general revenues, Robinson said, citing figures  supplied by the state controller's office. It would take $140 million more a  year just to bring San Diego County up to the average of what the state's other  counties get, he said.  </P> <P> Funds from Proposition A, the half-cent sales tax county voters approved in  1988 for new courts and jails, "would go a long way to getting things started,"  Robinson said.  </P> <P> Proposition A money is being collected, and is sitting in a bank -- as of June  19, all $133,382,963.17 of it, Robinson said. But the validity of the measure  is being weighed by state appellate courts, and a final decision is months or  years away, he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in a court document filed late Friday, Deputy County Counsel Nathan  C. Northup indicated that the county was below the population caps and expected  by today to still be below the caps. The precise figures were not expected to  be available until early today.  </P> <P> As for a tent camp, Northup said that course of action is "unavailable" because  it would cost $4 million annually to staff and run it. And none of the counties  surrounding San Diego have beds available, Northup reported.  </P> <P> But, Northup said, officials expected to meet the cap -- through a variety of  methods:  </P> <P> * The downtown jail has fewer than 1,000 inmates, the number Malkus suggested  last month, but got there by adding bunks to Vista and to Descanso. Northup did  not refer to the 750 cap originally set in 1980.  </P> <P> * Malkus agreed last month to allow jail officials to exclude from the count  inmates in medical beds and those awaiting release. Last week, those categories  included 111 inmates, according to Sheriff's Department figures.  </P> <P> * The county plans to send 30 inmates to county probation camps, Northup said  in the legal papers.  </P> <P> * It was taking a renewed look at aggressive use of early-release programs, he  said.  </P> <P> * Last Monday, it began using a procedure allowed under state law under which  certain undocumented aliens can be released to Immigration and Naturalization  Service authorities if the immigrants agree to voluntarily leave the United  States, Sheriff's Cmdr. Nichols said. By week's end, 63 immigrants had been  transferred, Nichols said.  </P> <P> * Malkus' order to cite and release women accused of misdemeanors was having  "an impact" at Las Colinas, Nichols said.  </P> <P> Before the order, when those women were being booked into the facility, it  typically housed 520 women, he said. Last Friday, however, officials counted  451 toward the cap, or 27 under the limit, he said.  </P> <P> ACLU lawyer Wheeler said the various maneuvers might enable the county "to  temporarily achieve compliance." But she added, "That is an extremely cynical  definition of compliance."  </P> <P> "The circumstances don't improve for inmates if you gain compliance with the  population cap simply by not counting some of the inmates who are physically in  the facility," she said.  </P> <P> Besides, a count under 1,000 but over 750 at the downtown jail "tramples on the  original court's findings," Wheeler said, referring to Focht's 1980 decision.  She said she and Landon will "strongly oppose" at today's hearing any move by  either the county or by Malkus allowing a figure above 750.  </P> <P> The county contends that the only way it could have agreed to reduce the  downtown population to 750 by July, 1990, was on the assumption the new East  Mesa jail would be open by Jan. 1, 1990.  </P> <P> But Wheeler said it makes no sense to rely on the East Mesa facility to take up  slack if there is no money in the budget to run the new jail once it's built.  </P> <P> "I don't think (county officials) have given very thorough consideration to  alternatives to compliance other than the East Mesa facility and their  continued request to be excused from population caps -- or to be excused from  the deadline based on a lack of money," she said.  </P> <P> "It's our fervent hope the judge will require them to look beyond those two  options and to come into compliance."  </P> <P> But she added, "My prediction is that the county is not going to come into  compliance without a lot of kicking and screaming."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, S. Kolosova, and others]    [Text] Tajik opposition does not have a hand in terrorist  activities against Russian servicemen, Akbar Turajonzoda, a  co-chairman of the Islamic Renaissance Movement, told Interfax .  He emphasized that Russia was the main guarantor of  Tajikistan's security and the country's ally.    He thought that the acts of terror against Russian  servicemen  in Tajikistan had been engineered by those who wanted to drag  Russia into the mire of civil war in Tajikistan and opposed a  political settlement there. He said that Russian servicemen  were being dragged deep into fighting the opposition and  defending the Dushanbe regime.    Asked about the government-opposition talks that are  scheduled to end in Tehran Monday, 27 June, he said that the two  sides had failed to produce a single joint document thus far.  Talks on a ceasefire are still underway while the agenda has  not been discussed, he emphasized.    Turajonzoda made it clear, however, that if an agreement  were  signed, the opposition would observe a ceasefire inside the  republic as well as on the border. He thought that the official  Dushanbe had also to abide by the agreement and compliance with  it had to be supervised by observers from the UN and other  international organizations.    Meanwhile, Moscow has a different view of what is going on  in  Tajikistan. First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin  told INTERFAX recently that he did not rule out complicity of  the Tajik opposition in terrorist activities against the Russian  servicemen and ethnic Russians in Tajikistan.    He admitted, however, that there was no direct evidence that  the acts of terror were the work of the opposition.    For his part Lieutenant General Aleksandr Bespalov, deputy  commander of Russian border guards, told Interfax that the acts  of terror against his men had been committed on direct orders  from the Tajik government-in-exile.    He believed that the Tajik opposition leaders intended to  start a new round of hostilities and that opposition fighters  were concentrating on the Afghan side of the Tajik-Afghan border  for that purpose.</p>

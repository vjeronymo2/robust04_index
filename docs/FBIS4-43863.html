			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hayri Birler] </F>   [Text] Ankara -- Force commanders as well as Chief of Staff  General Dogan Gures will tour military units to feel the pulse  of the rank and file of the Armed Forces before the Supreme  Military Council meeting in early August where appointments,  promotions and retirements of leading military personnel will be  decided. Sources close to the military said similar tours were  carried out as "inspections" by the inspection and assessment  departments at various force commands every year before the  Supreme Military Council meeting but added: "Commanders of the  forces also participate in some of these inspection tours. But  things are different this year. The force commanders will make  nationwide tours. They will visit each and every army corps.  Such visits in the military mean feeling the pulse. They are  aimed at feeling the pulse and determining the attitudes of the  lower echelons of the Armed Forces and if there is any disquiet,  and it is obvious that people in the rank and file are rather  unhappy, then to find remedies."    The sources said as in all sectors of the society the  economic and political problems in the country are also being  discussed in the military units and that particular attention is  being given to the debate between President Suleyman Demirel,  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Chief of Staff General Dogan  Gures on the proposed extension of the term of office of the  chief of staff for another year.    The sources said it was interesting that while the debate  was  going on Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said that she wanted the  current people who are in command of the Armed Forces to remain  and that it may be desirable from the point of view of national  interests that these commanders stay on in their posts. They  said that means the prime minister wants the extension of the  terms of office of the commanders of the Air Force and Navy who  are scheduled to be retired in August and that her emphasis is  not only on the term of office of General Dogan Gures.    The sources said if this is the case, then the Air Force and  Navy chiefs will not retire and thus there will be no vacancy to  fill among the full generals and admirals in the Air Force and  the Navy respectively. Thus no rear-admiral or major general  will be promoted this year as full admiral or general. That in  return will mean some people will have to be retired as they  cannot be promoted.    The sources said: "The promotions in the military resemble a  pyramid. If there is a vacancy at the top of the pyramid, then  you can fill in the stones below with promotions and thus push  up the peak. If in the Air Force or the Navy the top of the  pyramid remains blocked then people cannot be promoted and thus  stones start falling out of the pyramid. Thus people will be  retired. Once the term of office of a general or admiral is  extended then they will block the promotion of others below.  The extension of the term of office of two commanders will  undoubtedly block the promotion of many others and thus will  create unease among the rank and file."    The sources said the force commanders will conduct their  "pulse finding tours" of the units all together and display  unity among themselves. Only Gendarmerie Commander General  Aydin Ilter will not participate in these tours and will only  visit his own units.    Sources said: "General Ilter's position is clear and will  not  be discussed at the Supreme Military Council in August. Only  the tenures of the chief of staff as well as the Air Force and  Navy commanders will be completed in August. The Land Forces  commander will be affected by the appointments because he will  become the chief of staff if and when General Gures is retired  so the military council meeting interests him. So the four  commanders want to act together. The controversial letter  written by General Gures as well as the land, navy and air force  commanders to former Land Forces chief Ret. Gen. Muhittin  Fisunoglu asking him not to stir up trouble after his retirement  and refrain from actions that will undermine the Armed Forces  was not signed by Gendarmerie chief Gen. Ilter. The reply  written by Gen. Fisunoglu to the four commanders is rather  meaningful. He signs his letter telling the four commanders, `I  hope in your joint letter you do not reflect mutual interests  and mutual expectations.'"    Sources also said President Suleyman Demirel is monitoring  the developments closely and added, "The head of state is  showing the necessary sensitivity over the issue." They said  President Suleyman Demirel points to the previous decision of  the Supreme Military Council which rejected the extension of the  terms of office of generals and admirals at the Gulhane Military  Medical Academy (GATA) and that he may object to the extension  of the terms of office of the Navy and Air Force commanders.</p>

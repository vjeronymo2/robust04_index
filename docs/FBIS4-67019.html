			<p>After   `Longest' Trial   <F P=102> 94WD0331A Dublin IRISH INDEPENDENT in English 25 Mar 94 p 7 </F> <F P=103> 94WD0331A </F> <F P=104>  Dublin IRISH INDEPENDENT </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Noel Smith: "&pound;20m Cannabis Smuggling Duo </F> Jailed for 10 Years"]    [Text] A Dutchman and Belgian national who tried to smuggle  cannabis worth &pound;20m into Ireland were yesterday jailed for  10  years.    Judge Kevin O'Higgins at Tralee also sentenced them to seven  years for being in possession of the drug on the same date. The  sentences are to run concurrently and date from the time of  arrest last July.    The judge refused an application for a certificate of leave  to appeal but granted free legal aid in the event of appeal.    He ordered the forfeiture to the State of the luxury yacht,  the Brime and said that the yacht could be used by the Navy as  they saw fit.    A jury had found Egbertus Marius van Onzen (36) of  Amsterdam,  Holland, and Frank Loopmans (31) of Antwerp, Belgium, guilty on  Wednesday night of possessing the drug and of intent to supply  it.    The trial, the longest in living memory in Kerry, was in its  fourth week and the jury of eight men and four women had  deliberated for more than 3-1/2 hours.    Judge O'Higgins described the charges as extremely serious.  He paid tribute to the Irish naval service which, he said, had  distinguished itself and showed great competence, skill and  courage. The judge had heard during the trial of the key part  played by the LE Orla under the command of Lieutenant Commander  Mark Mellett.    He also singled out for special mention Garda Sergeant  Christopher McCarthy, stationed at Finglas, Dublin, for his  courage and bravery during the arrest of the Brime.    The crime, said Judge O'Higgins, appeared to have been  committed on purely commercial motives and it seemed to him that  the accused were very seriously involved. However, there were  obviously bigger fish elsewhere in relation to the crime.    Garda Inspector Jim Fitzgerald told the court that van Onzen  was born in 1957, one of a family of 11. He was living on board  a vessel in Amsterdam and with three other people had joined the  crew of the Brime. They were offered Stg &pound;50,000 to do the  job.    There was no record of a previous conviction. He had been in  custody since July 13.    Loopmans was born in 1963. He had three brothers and one  sister and his mother said he had only become involved after a  number of business ventures floundered.</p>

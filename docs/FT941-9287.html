			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (9): Speed-skating Long-track speed-skating has been part of the Winter Olympics since its inception in 1924. Women were included in 1960. Short-track speed-skating was a demonstration sport at Calgary in 1988. Short-track was raised to full Olympic status for 1992 but in a limited form with only one distance for men (1,000m) and one for women (500m), plus a relay race for each sex. Part of short-track's appeal is that four or more skaters race against one another - rather than against the clock. Tactics are vitally important and there are many thrills and spills. In long-track skating, competitors race in two against the clock. Enthusiasts need the skills of an accountant to figure out whether a competitor is in contention for a medal.</p>

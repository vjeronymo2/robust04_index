			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Competitor for Stock Exchange A COMPETITOR electronic share-dealing system for the London Stock Exchange is scheduled to be launched next summer if it obtains sufficient funding. Tradepoint Financial Networks will issue a 'pathfinder' prospectus later this month to raise Pounds 5m from investors on the Vancouver stock exchange. The system - to be called Tradepoint - will target at institutional investors and should be operational by June or July next year. It will be 'order-driven', or operate by automatically matching volumes and prices of share orders from buyers and sellers. That contrasts with the quote-driven system that dominates the Stock Exchange, based on intermediaries' quotes. Tradepoint obtained authorisation as a 'service company regime' last week from the Securities and Investments Board, which allows it to 'facilitate' trading but forbids it to deal directly with private clients. The chairman is Mr Stephen Raven, a director of Madoff Securities International, a past director of SG Warburg Securities and County NatWest Securities and a Stock Exchange council member for 16 years. He said that Tradepoint would offer software and hardware to customers free and charge solely on a percentage of the value of trades conducted on the system. He hopes to achieve 10 per cent of the value of total transactions on which commissions are earned within five years, but he said he would break even above 1.5 per cent. That is based on an estimate of Dollars 500bn (Pounds 260bn) a year of transactions on the Stock Exchange that give rise to commissions. He said existing commissions were normally about 0.2 per cent of the value of Stock Exchange transactions that give rise to charges. Tradepoint's rates would be 'significantly' below that level. Mr Raven said he wanted to attract six institutions to subscribe to the service before the end of the year and about 30 before the launch date. There are existing order-driven systems including one called Nordex, as well as the Stock Exchange's own Bulletin Board, designed for shares in which there is little trading. Mr Raven said that Tradepoint had the advantage of offering buyers and sellers anonymity and of improving existing trading, which he said was imperfect because it was dominated by just five or six market-making firms. Previous discussions about introducing an order-driven system for more liquid stocks on the Stock Exchange have been resisted by the market makers, who would lose business as a result. The Stock Exchange said yesterday that a quote-driven system was the best way of trading in liquid stocks. It did not think Tradepoint would be a significant competitior.</p>

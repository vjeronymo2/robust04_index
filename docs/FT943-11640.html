			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Clarke and George hold meeting Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, held his monthly meeting with Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, following market speculation that they would agree to increase interest rates. Most analysts feel, however, that the authorities will leave rates unchanged. Ms Katy Peters, UK economist at Daiwa Europe, said: 'I don't think we've seen sufficient evidence to have a change in opinion on interest rates.' The minutes of yesterday's meeting will be published in six weeks.</p>

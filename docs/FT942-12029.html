			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Blue blood and the entrepreneur - Richard Gourlay tells the unlikely tale of how a pair of business partners found each other Sir John Aird raised the cash to buy his first stake in a company by investing his tuition fees for Harvard Business School in the Kansas City wheat market. Ten years later his next investment had an equally improbable beginning. Sir John, who was born to the son of the then Prince of Wales's equerry in the grounds of Windsor Castle, backed Ivan Semenenko, a Ukrainian who spent his first seven years behind barbed wire in a displaced persons camp in Kiel. The two met through the pages of the Henley-on-Thames-based Venture Capital Report, an agency that brings together business angels like Sir John and entrepreneurs like Semenenko. A taciturn and true blue-blooded aristocrat, Sir John's background is unlikely to be typical of the 600 angels on VCR's books. But then VCR says there are few common characteristics other than a taste for risk and building businesses. In the case of Sir John, he had always wanted to work for himself and inherited an interest in engineering from his great grandfather, a famous 19th-century contractor who built the Aswan Dam in Egypt. He applied to Harvard while designing dams in the Sudan when he decided to move into management from pure engineering. After Harvard he returned to the UK flush with his gains from the commodity markets and briefly worked for John Laing, the building company. This was the springboard for his first investment in a small south London builder - probably the only London repair and maintenance company run by a Harvard MBA. 'I saw it as a safe but unspectacular business that would provide steady cash flow,' Sir John says. 'I have always believed in trying to finance growth out of cash profits.' Sixteen years later in 1986, when Sir John sold the business, sales of Pounds 100,000 had grown to Pounds 2.5m. By that time Sir John had spread his wings, investing in Matcon, the company Semenenko had started and was running out of a borrowed room in the Cotswolds town of Chipping Norton. Semenenko had founded the company in 1980 to develop a novel vibrating cone valve that activated and controlled the discharge of powders and granules from storage silos. The product was on the market but commercially unproven with sales of about Pounds 30,000 when Sir John came on the scene in 1981. He invested Pounds 30,000 - a third in equity, the rest as a loan - in return for half the equity. 'I didn't realise I needed the cash, though in hindsight I did,' says Semenenko. 'I did realise I needed some help with business and financial skills.' 'He had recognised there needed to be a change of direction,' says Sir John. 'I enabled the original idea to become a reality.' The investment also allowed Matcon to extend the application to process industries that needed to handle powdered material in batch production. Sir John says he was a very active investor in the early days, spending a great deal of time installing management systems, setting up the production facilities, establishing the marketing infrastructure, and advising on financial and cash flow planning. Many observers of informal venture capital investing say this kind of management participation is as valuable to entrepreneurs as the cash, although it irks some founders to have to accept outside advice. As Matcon grew - it now has annual sales of more than Pounds 14m - Sir John has cut the time he devotes to the business as part-time chairman to a few days a week and is again seeking new investment opportunities. Sir John has a number of self-imposed investment guidelines. He must be impressed by the people he is backing, interested in their product and they must be based close to his home. He tends to avoid pure start-ups. In addition, he says he likes to leave the managing partner with as much of the equity as he or she can afford to take. 'It makes the whole process more worthwhile.' What is most surprising, given the many stories told by indignant entrepreneurs, is that he is not hung up on having a controlling stake. At Matcon, Sir John has 50 per cent. 'He was the only one who did not want 51 per cent,' says Semenenko. 'I feel having control is irrelevant,' Sir John says. 'The entrepreneur always effectively has control whatever percentage of the stock is his. An investor can only really exert negative control - you can forbid or prevent but it is difficult to be pro-active without the co-operation of the entrepreneur'. And irrespective of the percentage of shares held, the investor can exert control by specifying that his consent must be sought before any changes in company strategy, capital expenditure, gearing or executive compensation. Having established his guidelines, Sir John promptly went against two of them. His next investment after Matcon was in a nursing home company called Dalecare. It was a start-up and he did not have an intrinsic interest in running a business looking after elderly people. But he liked the founder and invested Pounds 100,000 anyway, taking the deal to 3i, the UK's biggest venture capital supplier. Three years later and after three homes had been successfully developed, Sir John sold to Associated Nursing Services, the then quoted group. Since then he has invested, also via VCR, in a London and Shanghai-based company called Chance China that represents western companies in China and Chinese companies in the west. Some two thirds of the Pounds 200,000 he paid for 50 per cent of the equity is in interest-bearing loan notes which have first call on any profits. And then there is the one that went wrong. 'The one bad one should have been the best - it had everything going for it,' he says. The company, Mogul Leisure Products, made ski-training machines which had been pre-sold to Thomas Cook, the tour operator, which was offering its clients lessons if they bought a holiday. 'I was interested in the product, the company was on my door-step, the sales were assured,' says Sir John. He could even make them using spare capacity at the Matcon factory. What neither he nor the entrepreneur had spotted was that the business plan made no allowance for servicing and teaching Thomas Cook staff how to use the product. All the profits were consumed by the cost of supporting the customer and Sir John closed the company. Whether typical of other angels - a term he dislikes because he is motivated almost entirely by profit - Sir John sets clear investment targets. 'I need a better return on capital than in the City,' he says. 'I am very depressed by the performance of so-called professional investment managers and am shocked by the way they regard matching the index as a standard of acceptable investment performance,' he says. While he has sold companies in which he successfully invested, Sir John does not actively seek investments and at Matcon is happy to let the managing partner develop the business. 'I certainly see a substantial regular dividend as just as valid a return as a sale,' he says. Too many good deals are not backed because the exit route is not clear. For those deals that go right, the dividends can be substantial. If he invests Pounds 150,000, one third as equity, he would expect to receive an annual dividend equal to 100 per cent of that equity after three or four years. There again, investing in a bad business plan or the wrong person and the loans quickly become equity and can evaporate at an alarming rate. Just as fast as his Harvard fees could have disappeared in the Kansas City wheat market.</p>

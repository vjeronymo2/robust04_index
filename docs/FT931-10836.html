			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lasmo sells Pounds 126.5m of assets - Sale proceeds should reduce net debt to Pounds 900m by middle of year LASMO, the North Sea oil exploration and production company, has sold two packages of assets for Pounds 126.5m, bringing the total for upstream disposals over the past year to Pounds 375m. The company said it was continuing to sell peripheral assets in a bid to reduce its debt and cut gearing. The disposals reduce its debt to equity ratio to about 80 per cent. Net debt, which was Pounds 1.1bn at the year-end, should come down to Pounds 900m by the middle of this year, after the sale proceeds have come through. The first asset package, which includes shares in 17 North Sea blocks, has been sold to Deminex, the German oil exploration company, for Pounds 105.8m. In addition, Lasmo has sold its interests in the producing Balmoral and Maureen fields to Pentex Oil for Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.7m). Lasmo has been under extreme pressure following the slump in its share price over the past year, the drop in earnings and its high level of debt following the acquisition of Ultramar in late 1991. Mr Chris Greentree recently stepped down as chief executive to be succeeded by Mr Joe Darby who is likely to adopt a more conservative approach to the business and could cut the dividend when the annual results are announced at the end of March. Mr Darby said yesterday that the company had achieved favourable prices for the assets in spite of difficult market conditions. 'We are encouraged by our progress and shareholders can expect to see this process continue,' he said. Part of the sale involves half of Lasmo's share in the Pine and Birch and South Birch fields where it remains the operator. The sale should save Lasmo about Pounds 250m in capital expenditure on these fields over the next five years. 'It gives us cash in hand and saves on expenditure, but we've got to make sure we don't give up the growth profile of the company,' said Mr Norman Davidson-Kelly, corporate development director. NatWest Securities estimates that the sale will boost Lasmo's pre-tax profits in 1993 by Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m to some Pounds 49m, giving earnings of 5.4p a share. NatWest said yesterday that the asset sale did not resolve the issue of whether Lasmo would be able to maintain the dividend, but it did give Mr Darby some flexibility. See Lex</p>

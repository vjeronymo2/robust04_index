			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Big programme of the night is Clive James - Fame in the Twentieth Century on BBC 1 at 9.30. In antiquity, rulers knew about exploiting their images in metal, stone, or wood. However, James's theory is that with the advent of the moving camera the nature of fame was profoundly altered. Tonight's line-up of most famous faces ever includes Charlie Chaplin and Rudolf Valentino. Time is running out for Inspector Morse, the man who more than any other fictional character has put 20th century Oxford on the map. Tonight sees the first of the final series (ITV, 8.00). The remarkable thing about Morse (played, I need hardly say, by John Thaw) is that the screen character is so satisfying, and the chap in Colin Dexter's novels so utterly pedestrian. In an ironic contrast between youth of today and ..youth of today, you can start with Def II's Reportage: Screen Generation on BBC 2 at 6.50, and grieve for the children who become murderous zombies (sorry, I mean 'socially dysfunctional') from too many video games. Then contemplate serried ranks of well-scrubbed youth in Choir of the Year (BBC 2 at 7.30.)</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 4 May (EFE) -- Six retired Peruvian Army  generals have been brought before the Military Court for  statements or publications considered "offensive" to the Armed  Forces or an "insult to their superiors." Today, the Military  Court Supreme Council will hear the charges against Generals  Jaime Salinas and German Parra, who criticized the performance  of General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, Army commander and commander  of the Armed Forces Joint Command.    For Gen. Parra alone, the military prosecutor has requested  a  sentence of eight months' imprisonment. Salinas and Parra  maintain that their comments were personal and were made in  their capacity as civilians now they are retired.    The Military Court has sentenced Gen. Luis Cisneros  Vizquerra  to 90 days' imprisonment "for insulting his superiors."  Cisneros was interior minister under the military government  that ruled between 1968 and 1980.    Gen. Alberto Arciniega, who presided over the court that  sentenced Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman to life  imprisonment, in January 1993 was charged with offense and  insult. He sought refuge in the Argentine Embassy because of  these charges and then travelled to that country.    Gen. Jose Pastor Vives has been charged with insulting his  superiors, and was sentenced to a provisional sentence of 60  days' imprisonment. Vives was involved in the thwarted coup of  13 November 1992, but was pardoned later on.    The trial of Gen. Sinesio Jarama began on 2 May. He is  charged with allegedly insulting the Army as an institution.    Gen. Salinas, who was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment  for having headed the aborted 13 November coup, is also being  tried for offending the Armed Forces and insulting his  superiors. Gen. Parra, former transportation minister during  former President Alan Garcia's government (1985-90), is charged  with offenses and insults.    Several constitutional experts have stated that although the  Constitution establishes some political restrictions for  military officers on duty, it is not the same for those who are  retired and are regarded as civilians.    Raul Ferrera, former dean of the Lima Law School, stated the  application of the military code contradicts the Constitution,  which guarantees the right to an opinion of every citizen,  without distinction.</p>

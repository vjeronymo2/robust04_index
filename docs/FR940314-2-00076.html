			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> As established in the FY 1991 social services notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 29, 1991, section I, ``Allocation Amounts'' (56 FR 42745), a variable floor amount for States which have small refugee populations will be calculated as follows: If the application of the regular allocation formula yields less than $100,000, then_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A base amount of $75,000 is provided for a State with a population of 50 or fewer refugees who have been in the U.S. 3 years or less; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For a State with more than 50 refugees who have been in the U.S. 3 years or less: (a) A floor has been calculated consisting of $50,000 plus the regular per capita allocation for refugees above 50 up to a total of $100,000 (in other words, the maximum under the floor formula is $100,000); (b) if this calculation has yielded less than $75,000, a base amount of $75,000 is provided for the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ORR has consistently supported floors for small States in order to provide sufficient funds to carry out a minimum service program. Given the range in numbers of refugees in the small States, we have concluded that a variable floor, as established in the FY 1991 notice, will be more reflective of needs than previous across-the-board floors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The $12,120,300 in remaining social service funds (15% of the total funds available) is expected to be used by ORR on a discretionary basis to provide funds for individual projects intended to contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of the refugee resettlement program. Grant announcements on discretionary initiatives will be issued separately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Population To Be Served <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the allocation formula is based on the 3-year refugee population, in accordance with the requirements of 45 CFR part 400 Subpart I_Refugee Social Services, States are not required to limit social service programs to refugees who have been in the U.S. only 3 years. In keeping with 45 CFR 400.147(a), a State must allocate an appropriate portion of its social service funds, based on population and service needs, as determined by the State, for services to newly arriving refugees who have been in the U.S. less than one year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While 45 CFR 400.147(b) requires that in providing employability services, a State must give priority to a refugee who is receiving cash assistance, social service programs should not be limited exclusively to refugees who are cash assistance recipients. If a State intends to provide services to refugees who have been in the U.S. more than 3 years, 45 CFR 400.147(c) requires the State to specify and justify as part of its Annual Services Plan those funds that it proposes to use to provide services to those refugees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ORR expects States to ensure that refugee social services are provided to special populations such as Amerasians and former political prisoners from Vietnam, in addition to special funding that ORR may designate to address the special needs of these populations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ORR funds may not be used to provide services to United States citizens, since they are not covered under the authorizing legislation, with the following exceptions: (1) Under current regulations at 45 CFR 400.208, services may be provided to a U.S.-born minor child in a family in which both parents are refugees or, if only one parent is present, in which that parent is a refugee; and (2) under the FY 1989 Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act (Pub. L. No. 100&hyph;461), services may be provided to an Amerasian from Vietnam who is a U.S. citizen and who enters the U.S. after October 1, 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Service Priorities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Refugee social service funding should be used to assist refugee families to achieve economic independence. To this end, ORR expects States to ensure that a coherent plan of services is developed for each eligible family that addresses the family's needs from time of arrival until attainment of economic independence. Each service plan should address a family's needs for both employment-related services and other needed social services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reflecting section 412(a)(1)(A)(iv) of the INA, the Director expects States to ``insure that women have the same opportunities as men to participate in training and instruction.'' In addition, States are expected to make sure that services are provided in a manner that encourages the use of bilingual women on service agency staffs to ensure adequate service access by refugee women. In order to facilitate refugee self-support, the Director also expects States to implement strategies which address simultaneously the employment potential of both male and female wage earners in a family unit, particularly in the case of large families. States are expected to make every effort to assure the availability of day care services in order to allow women with children the opportunity to participate in employment services or to accept or retain employment. To accomplish this, day care may be treated as a priority employment-related service under the refugee social services program. Refugees who are participating in employment services or have accepted employment are eligible for day care services. For an employed refugee, day care funded by refugee social service dollars must be limited to one year after the refugee becomes employed. States are expected to use day care funding from other publicly funded mainstream programs as a prior resource and are expected to work with service providers to assure maximum access to other publicly funded resources for day care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

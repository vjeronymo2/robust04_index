			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible military source at the Command of the  Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has said that  the ruling Sanaa gang, at the same time that it claims it wishes  to reach a cease-fire, is continuing its practice of misleading  Arab and international public opinion.    Yesterday evening it fired another ground-to-ground missile  toward the capital, Aden. The source confirmed to the Yemeni  news agency, SABA', that our vigilant ground defenses destroyed  it in the air. Its parts fell in one of the farms in the Lahij  Governorate, causing no deaths or material damage.</p>

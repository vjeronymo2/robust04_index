			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Row over state role in Israel Chemicals Israel Chemicals, the country's biggest chemical and fertiliser group and one of the nation's leading exporters, is at the centre of a row between ministers and government officials over the next phase of its privatisation. Mr Micha Harish, the minister of industry and trade, has publicly criticised the Government Companies Authority, charged with selling state-owned companies, and called for the resignation of Mr Yossi Nitzani, its director. Mr Harish's wants to make the company, of which the government holds 75 per cent, to move its headquarters from Tel Aviv to Beersheva, in the Negev desert. He said it was vital that large state-owned companies such as IC move there to encourage foreign investment in the development of the Negev. However, when Mr Nitzani last week met New York-based investment banks to discuss the next phase of IC'sprivatisation the bankers were reported to have voiced concern about government interference in the management of the company. They also expressed reluctance to become involved in selling shares in the US so long as the government continued to hold a majority stake. Investment analysts said the government had to make a clear statement of its timetable for selling shares in the company. The government has decided to reduce its stake in IC to 28 per cent by the end of this year and plans to sell 15 per cent of the company to a private investor and 32 per cent by international public offering.</p>

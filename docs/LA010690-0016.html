			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOUTING TOUT SHEETS: NOT A LOT TO TOOT ABOUT  </P> <P> I was pleasantly surprised to see Kelly Burgess' article (and statistics)  "Rating the Sheets." It's something that's long overdue, and I'd like to see it  become a regular thing.  </P> <P> Of added interest was that The Times' own Bob Mieszerski (83 winners) as well  as your consensus (76 wins) outperformed all the sheets (and the Racing Form's  consensus). Also noteworthy is that every "card" showed a flat bet loss on $2  win bets. (The best of them recovering only $478 of the $540 bet.)  </P> <P> Sort of wish I knew how they all did on plain "top choice" bets on doubles,  triples, exactas, pick six, etc. If I were to take a chance betting on someone  else's selections, it'd sure be no more than one or two combinations -- surely  not $54 just on a single triple, as they might "suggest."  </P> <P> WILLIAM M.

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> SCOFIELD MIXES IT UP WITH MASTERY  </P> <P> John Scofield, the guitarist who played with Charles Mingus, Billy Cobham and  Jay McShann, among others, before coming of age with Miles Davis in the early  1980s, brought his trio to the Catalina Bar and Grill.  </P> <P> An infrequent visitor to the Southland, Scofield was greeted on the first night  of his weekend gig with enthusiasm by a sparse crowd at the Hollywood night  club. Considering the man's talents, the place should have been packed to the  rafters. Working with bassist Anthony Cox and drummer John Riley, Scofield  presented a set that mixed his own compositions with those of the standard jazz  repertoire. In each instance, Scofield's technical mastery was matched by his  musicianly approach.  </P> <P> Though a trio setting for any soloist can pose problems, this one didn't for  Scofield. Bassist Cox, whose solos were quite imaginative, played a larger part  in quelling any sense of emptiness in the group's sound with his full sound and  powerful harmonic structuring. So, too, did drummer Riley help fill any gaps  with his "brush fire" of rhythmic activity.  </P> <P> Scofield plays with a purposely distorted but attractively full sound, while  never disguising his melodic or harmonic intent. His illustrious musical  background provided him with an eclectic approach that, on "All the Things You  Are," for instance, had him starting in a be-bop mode before finding a raucous  and bluesy midsection that would have delighted Jimi Hendrix fans. He returned  to be-bop with liberal "From Thelonious Monk."  </P> <P> Though his music is enough to recommend Scofield to anyone interested in jazz,  his presentation will disappoint those looking to be entertained. Hunched over  his guitar, his level of seriousness is that of an artist -- not of a nightclub  performer.A. JAMES LISKA  </P></p>

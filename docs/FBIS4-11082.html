			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 18 Apr (EFE) --  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria described today as "lacking in  objectivity" a report issued by Amnesty International (AI)  requesting the United States suspension of military aid to the  Colombian Armed Forces, which AI accused of violating human  rights.    "I have never denied there are human rights problems, but  international organizations are not properly assessing things  taking place in Colombia to protect fundamental principles,"  Gaviria stated to reporters in the Caribbean city of Cartagena  de Indias.    AI, a human rights organization headquartered in London,  asked the United States to suspend economic aid to the Colombian  military because "the Colombian Armed Forces are a bridge for  the violation of the rights of individuals."    According to the Colombian president, AI "lacks objectivity"  in reporting how Colombia has managed the situation and how  Colombia has protected human rights in past years, especially  after the new National Constitution was promulgated in 1991.    The Colombian president underscored that the Armed Forces,  when they combat insurgents, "cannot ever fall into the trap of  imitating the guerrillas' behavior of intimidation, extortion,  torture, kidnapping, and slaying and injuring soldiers and  policemen, or putting them out of action."    Gaviria added: "Colombia has confronted persistent attacks  against its democratic institutions for many years. The attacks  come from organizations that receive economic resources from  kidnapping and extortion activities."    He added, "To confront these groups, there is an  overwhelming  majority of members of the military and police forces who  respect the law."</p>

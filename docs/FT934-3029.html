			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: British Land advances 28% British Land, the commercial property company, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 28 per cent to Pounds 13.1m in the six months to September 30, against Pounds 10.2m. The company also said it had so far spent more than Pounds 135m in property purchases for the British Land Quantum Property Investment Partnership announced in June. Gross rental income was Pounds 72.7m (Pounds 69.4m). Earnings per share came out at 2.9p (3.9p) and the interim dividend is increased to 2.45p, compared with 2.28p. Mr John Ritblat, chairman, said: 'We are very happy with these results' and expressed strong confidence in the recovery of the property market. He reiterated his comments from June last year that the property market had turned for the better and continued to recover to a semblance of normality. He said that the company traditionally had a 'quiet first half' with the timing of its quarterly rent collection dates pushing more revenue into the second half of the year. Mr Ritblat attacked FRS 3 as 'so inappropriate for our accounts' because of its requirement that capital items be included. He preferred to emphasise revenue profits which showed a 60 per cent advance to Pounds 18.2m (Pounds 11.4m) during the half year. Current funds and facilities exceed Pounds 775m. The company said its weighted average debt maturity was now greater than 22 years. The Quantum partnership, under which British Land will spend Pounds 500m in property, was set up with a Pounds 250m equity subscription from Mr George Soros' Quantum Fund. British Land said it now had first refusal over the Quantum interest. COMMENT The market seemed slightly disappointed in British Land's results, with the shares closing down 11p at 433p while the sector was stable. The reason was the false expectation, based on previous experience, that there would be other news at the same time: perhaps an acquisition, or a revaluation or balance sheet at the half year. Some analysts also felt the company was falling behind in its spending plans for its property-buying partnership with the Quantum Fund at a time when they consider the market is becoming more competitive. The company denies it has set any targets and seems willing to bide its time. Overall the shares seem fairly priced, with the company well geared for recovery and rich in cash for potential acquisitions.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: RJB Mining achieves 23% growth to Pounds 6.8m RJB Mining, the coal group, yesterday pressed its case for taking over all five British Coal mining regions as it reported a 23 per cent improvement in interim profits. Mr Richard Budge, chief executive, said there was a lot of support for a unitary coal company in the UK because it could provide a higher level of investment, and industrial relations would be better. Mr Budge said the board had not yet decided finally on what it would bid for. However, the expectation in the market was that it would put in a tender for all five regions. RJB is considered one of the few potential bidders capable of raising the finance to take over all of British Coal's working mines. However, there would be considerable poli-tical obstacles to overcome because the government is thought to favour competition in coal. Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 6.82m, against Pounds 5.55m last time, achieved on turnover up from Pounds 37.7m to Pounds 49m. Earnings per share were 10.9p, against a pro-forma 11p in 1993, and an interim dividend of 5.2p (5p) is declared. Coal production was 1.34m tonnes, up from 980,000, with underground mines contributing 296,000 tonnes. Mr Budge said the three deep mines recently leased from British Coal were on target to produce 2m tonnes when in full production next year. RJB had identified markets for the foreseeable future for all the coal it produces, he said. Monckton Coke &amp; Chemical, bought in March, contributed Pounds 600,000 to group profits. COMMENT These are sound results for a company readying itself for life after British Coal. By opening three deep mines and increasing its licensed opencast operations, the company should within 18 months be able to generate at least 80 per cent of profit from sources that are not directly depen-dent on British Coal or its successors. Some 18 months ago that figure was just 20 per cent. If all continues to go to plan, the transformation will mean that RJB can grow profits comfortably even if it does not succeed in winning the ownership of any of British Coal's five regions. That, together with results at the top end of expectations, helps explain why the shares continued to rise yesterday on top of recent advances. Assuming profits next year of Pounds 18.2m, the shares are trading on a prospective multiple of 16. Progress in the immediate future may be restrained by the British Coal bids and the near certainty that, with gearing already at 65 per cent, an issue of shares would be needed if the company's bids are successful.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> BAT Begins Reshaping: London-based BAT Industries PLC, which has been the  takeover target of a group led by Sir James Goldsmith, agreed to terms for sale  of its 69% stake in VGI, which makes analytical instruments. The sale will be  the first step in a shareholder-approved restructuring aimed at focusing BAT's  businesses on tobacco and financial services, including its Los Angeles-based  Farmers Group insurance holding company. Goldsmith supports the divestment but  would strip BAT of financial services as well, including a sale of Farmers to  Axa-Midi Assurances SA of France.  </P></p>

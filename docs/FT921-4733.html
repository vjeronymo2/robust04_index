			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Wine: Angela checks the cheap but cheerful - A unique exporter from Britain A BRITISH wine merchant arrived to buy wine at a large French winery. The staff lolled around smoking. The welcome was offhand. The merchant was underwhelmed. Until he mentioned who had sent him. Gitanes were hurriedly stubbed out, the workers set to like the busiest of bees and a superior echelon of eager management appeared as if by magic. The name capable of galvanising entire workforces in the very unBritish world of wine production is Angela Muir. Muir is a 43-year-old Master of Wine with a very unusual interest, cheap wine. 'What really fascinates me,' she says, dark eyebrows knit passionately under her Valkyrie mane, 'is large volumes of low cost wine that people get physical pleasure from - and that doesn't happen often enough.' Uniquely, she has built up a reputation for telling wine producers in the hugely important bottom third of the wine price pyramid, in no uncertain terms, how to make wines that (British) people will actually want to drink. 'I start at the critic's end rather than the creator's,' is how she explains her particular expertise. 'If you happen to have great land, then employing a genius to make great wine is just a question of money. What I'm interested in is working back towards what the consumer wants rather than what the soil will give and how best to express it.' Happily for her the British market is so important, and indicative, to the world's potential wine exporters that, in the first three weeks of last month, she had been to Argentina to help one of the biggest companies there fashion wines for foreign palates with less than ideal equipment (answer: bottle in France); to Chile to find a new source for a British company which may then ask her to source its entire New World range 'very exciting, in an area of the market I really like'; to Czechoslovakia to oversee one of her most innovative schemes to date; to France on a confidential assignment (it is a very competitive market); and finally, and apparently most thrillingly, to an Italian manufacturer of bottling equipment. Angela's eyes light up when describing this visit. 'They're very, very good, particularly on computer coordination of bottling lines. We went and had a very interesting look round their machine shops near Verona on the way back from Czechoslovakia.' The Czech project is the first one in which Cellarworld, the company she formed in 1988 with her ex-management accountant husband Peter, has taken a direct stake. It all started during her previous 10-year stint buying wine - 'proactively, like the Oddbins boys'  - for Allied-Lyons where she was most famous for dragging a huge Spanish bodega into the late 20th century by promising to buy the resulting crisp 1982 white revamp for the Don Cortez label. Her unrivalled buying power at Grants of St James's was, of course, why producers listened to her didactic comments on their wines.) The road to Czechoslovakia went via Ethiopia. Someone, 'it's always silly - a friend of a friend, or someone wanting a reciprocal deal,' asked Angela to evaluate some Ethiopian wines. The wines stayed in Ethiopia but 18 months ago she was asked by a related contact to look at a range of wines from a Czechoslovakia desperate for trade with the west. 'Despite the ghastly labels, and some unpleasant winemaking aromas of sorbates etcetera, I realised there was some very good intense fruit there. I said I'd write them a report if they'd pay for me to go and spend four days there. You can learn a lot in four days if you really decide to get to grips with it.' Yes, ma'am. Or rather, yes, Major General, to which rank Angela has been elevated by colleagues at the Slovakian wineries from which she has coaxed four remarkably clean, fresh westernised varietals that are just hitting the shelves of better Victoria Wine shops at under Pounds 3 a bottle. The lively red Frankovka at Pounds 2.79 is in limited distribution but is particularly good value. If the first three days' sales are indicative, she may turn out to be the saviour of the Czech wine industry, which is about half the size of the long-westernised Bulgarian one. The Muir Czech revolution encompassed such refinements as an awesome respect for hygiene, a proper understanding of filtration, sterile bottling, more use of under-utilised equipment and whirlwind labelling applications to Brussels. Bottling lines have already been upgraded to supermarket standard. She also had to make changes in the tasting and dining rooms. 'I told them we needed proper big tasting glasses, not thimbles. Also that we needed something to spit into - and that we certainly didn't need cat stew.' The Muirs live, with their cats, in deepest Surrey. Peter Muir is clearly vital to the business and, like many palates exposed to wine through a partner, is an impressive blind taster. His wife views the fine wine market as a 'minor interest' and the wine she chooses to drink is, typically, fizzy and copious. If she is right about the future of the wine market there will be a need for more consumer-driven consultants of her ilk. 'Wine will be used more and more as a luxury and it's going to be one hell of a struggle for survival by vineyard owners. The market will increasingly demand reasonable prices and that wine tastes nice. There is lots of trauma ahead for producers who can't make that adjustment.' Cellarworld operates from the same address as the Fulham Road Wine Centre, 899/900 Fulham Road, London, SW6. Tel: 071-384 2588.</p>

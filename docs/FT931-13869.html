			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Europe's agenda YESTERDAY'S PUBLIC row in the European Parliament, between the Danish foreign minister and Greek deputies, over Greek resistance to the diplomatic recognition of Macedonia was a lamentable distraction. Greek fears that an independent Macedonia might harbour territorial ambitions are too obsessive. But Mr Ellemann-Jensen did not enhance his role as the new president of the Community by engaging in a public slanging match. Moreover, the row distracted attention from the rest of the Community's agenda during the next six months. The overriding priority is to secure the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, by Denmark and by Britain. In the meantime, the most important innovation will be the opening of membership negotiations with four applicant countries from Efta. Externally, the Community must work on strengthening co-operation with the US, starting with a serious effort to secure an agreement on the long-delayed Uruguay trade negotiation. The problem with Mr Ellemann-Jensen's straightforward presentation was that it skirted round the profound policy conundrums which surround the Maastricht treaty, the programme for economic and monetary union, and the prospective enlargement of the Community. These conundrums are fundamental and urgently need to be addressed. First, what is really left of the policy objectives contained in the Maastricht treaty after the Danish opt-outs? Ostensibly, these concessions are unique to Denmark; but the Danish precedent implicitly renders all Maastricht commitments more voluntary. This problem could be critical for the enlargement negotiations: it will certainly be difficult for Denmark as president to insist that Sweden must shoulder obligations which Denmark itself has chosen to evade. Second, what can be done to restore credibility to the programme for economic and monetary union, after the storm of Black Wednesday? Though the turmoil seems to have subsided somewhat, the system is manifestly under systemic strain and speculative pressures are likely to recur right up to the French elections in March, and beyond. Whether or not monetary union is still a credible objective, the source of these tensions needs to be identified and addressed. Third, the enlargement negotiations will require an overhaul of the EC institutions: with 16 members the Community will need more streamlined decision-making rules, and a reduction in the voting premium enjoyed by small countries. This is a deeply contentious issue, but it risks becoming insoluble if it is not tackled now.</p>

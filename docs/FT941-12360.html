			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Stores curb the urge to expand: Neil Buckley and Vanessa Houlder examine the end of a building spree by the supermarket groups Decisions by the UK's three largest supermarket groups to write down land and building costs and trim their opening programmes signal an end to the store-building free-for-all of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The pace in future will be less frenetic and the prices paid for land less astronomic. The retail scene has changed markedly from 1991 when the big three were spending up to Pounds 2.5bn a year between them on expansion, and were prepared to pay huge premiums to secure prime sites. Since then, increasing price competition and market saturation has sparked fears in the City that superstore groups would be unable to sustain their margins and returns on capital. Those fears - coupled with the slump in the property market - led to increasing pressure on store chains to rein back expansion and depreciate buildings and land. Asda, the UK's fourth-largest grocer, halted its expansion programme 18 months ago and wrote down its property and fixed assets by Pounds 319m. Yet it took until last month before Argyll, the UK's number three, announced it would depreciate buildings at 2.5 per cent a year, and cut capital spending from Pounds 650m to Pounds 550m this year. Two weeks ago Tesco followed suit with a similar depreciation policy for buildings, as well as a decision to write down the 'premiums' it had paid for its land - the difference between the price paid and the alternative use value - over 25 years. With the latter charge put at Pounds 32m this year, there was an implicit admission that the group had overpaid, by a massive Pounds 800m, on its land. Tesco also made an Pounds 85m write-down on land it had decided to sell rather than use for new stores. It said it would cut capital spending from Pounds 750m this year to Pounds 450m-Pounds 500m in 1996-97, and its store-expansion programme from 31 to 20 over the same period, with the emphasis shifting to smaller superstores and its new Metro city-centre format. Finally last Friday, J. Sainsbury said it would depreciate stores at the slower rate of 2 per cent a year, and make a one-off write-down of the Pounds 365m it had overpaid for land. Some Pounds 60m of that charge referred to surplus land which it, too, had decided to sell. It said it would continue to open 20 grocery superstores a year for four years, but beyond that the pace might slow. Mr Jeremy Alun-Jones, retail analyst at Lehman Brothers, said: 'The biggest thing about all these announcements is that they recognise the fact that superstores don't last for ever.' They also reflect a decline in the top end of the property market from more than Pounds 2m an acre in 1991 to between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m an acre now, according to Erdman Lewis, chartered surveyors. Some agents believe, however, that the decline in prices has come to a halt as a result of strong demand from other types of out-of-town retailer. After years when bidding battles between supermarket chains pushed site prices above the reach of other purchasers, there is now strong competition for the best sites from operators of retail warehouses. Tenant demand for warehouses has been buoyant as these large out-of-town stores have appealed to a growing number of retailers. The warehouses sell goods ranging from furniture to office supplies. Another factor that could sustain prices would be a tightening of planning controls, which would reduce the supply of potential sites. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, recently indicated that he wished to discourage development on greenfield sites on the edge of cities, so as to help revitalise town centres. The sites that are best expected to retain their values are those surrounding prosperous towns where development was constrained by restrictive planning policies in the 1980s.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Microchip maker launches fresh search for partner: SGS-Thomson emboldened by Dollars 2bn cash injection over five years SGS-THOMSON (ST), Europe's only independent maker of microchips, is to relaunch its search for a big electronics industry partner, emboldened by a promise of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) over the next five years from its French and Italian state owners. The French government is urging the group to seek a share exchange alliance with a leading customer or semiconductor producer, following last week's agreement on the package. The pact brought to a climax a year's intense debate between an eager France and a cautious Italy. 'Now that the public shareholders have shown their confidence in SGS-Thomson, the group can relaunch discussions with other groups. It could be a European client or components supplier or even a Japanese or US company,' said a senior French industry official. ST tried to entice Philips and Siemens, the Dutch and German electronics group, to join forces last year, but they were not interested. They had industrial reasons for making other plans, but officials admit that doubts over Italy's ability to support ST through Rome's public spending crisis made the company a poor prospective partner. This is by far the largest investment in ST to date and involves Dollars 1bn of fresh capital plus Dollars 1bn of state research and development grant. It will more than wipe out ST's Dollars 900m debts and pay for two-thirds of the group's investment needs for the period. France has been an unfailing supporter of ST, the world's 12th largest microchip group and the third largest in Eproms, an increasingly important kind of memory chip. Paris sees ST as the flagship of European attempts to resist Japanese domination of a strategically vital industry, a theme which commands sacred importance in French government circles. Italy, worried by its public spending crisis, was unsure until last week. The cash will come equally from France and Italy, which each hold 45 per cent of ST through groups of state agencies led by their respective atomic energy bodies. The other player is Thorn-EMI, the British electronics group, which owns 10 per cent of ST and sees itself as a passive investor. Thorn-EMI says it will not buy new shares and thus is content to let itself be diluted to 6 per cent. ST reckons the deal will enable it to fulfil its plans to more than double its overall market share from the 2.3 per cent around which it has stagnated for more than a year, to 5 per cent. At this level, it would expect to be profitable enough to fund its own R&amp;D and fight the industry leaders on equal terms. ST spends roughly a fifth of turnover on R&amp;D - Dollars 320m out of sales of Dollars 1.6bn this year - well above the industry average. It is a spectacular bet, even by the standards of the French and Italian public sectors. It dwarfs the Dollars 300m which ST's shareholders invested in the business at its birth five years ago, from the merger of two French and Italian state-owned semiconductor producers. Since then, ST has received no fresh equity capital, although it has benefited from European Community research programmes, a declining source of cash. In the process, ST has built up nearly Dollars 467m of accumulated net losses since 1987, having lost money in all but one of the past five years. It now faces debt charges which wiped out operating profits several times over in 1991 and will allow it to make only a small net profit - if ST officials' hopes come true - this year. Will the rescue work? There should at least be no problem in putting the plan into effect, says the French industry ministry. It does not expect the European Commission to object to the rescue under state aid rules because government shareholders are as entitled as private ones to put cash into a commercially viable business and R&amp;D grants are legitimate, the argument goes. Officials deny suggestions that part of the R&amp;D grant is covert aid to pay for ST losses. In any case, Brussels might hesitate to upset two important member states at a time when European unity is already shaky and when the European Commission it is about to undergo its four-yearly organisational upheaval as commissioners' mandates come up for renewal. The first Dollars 500m will be paid before Christmas, so ST's debt charges will fall from early next year. ST's operating costs are down too, thanks to a cut in staff numbers by 4,200 to 17,300 over the past two years. All other things being equal, ST should therefore be able to produce a sizeable profits rise next year. ST's current five-year plan, as agreed at a recent meeting with its state shareholders, calls for a total investment of Dollars 3bn, so it will have to find another Dollars 1bn from its own funds. French officials believe ST can generate enough cash to make this possible, now that its debts are to be paid. However, a new equity partner would clearly help.</p>

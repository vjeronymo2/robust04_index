			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Letter: Taking issue with generalisations and costs of options Sir, With reference to the article 'Exotic options fit the bill' (July 19), we oppose two views expressed in that article. 1. Knock-out options: 'They are generally about 35 per cent cheaper than other options'. To say that they are generally 35 per cent cheaper is a very misleading generalisation. The reduction in the premium of a knock-out option compared to a plain vanilla option depends primarily on the level of the out-strike (knock-out level). As the 'out-strike' is determined by the client the premium reduction could be anywhere from 0 to 99 per cent. Also it is important to understand that the reduction in premium is obtained by accepting a risk that the hedge might vanish if the out-strike level is reached. 2. Instead of buying options, companies can replicate options by dynamic hedging. 'This method creates substantial savings', according to Mike Shilling. That means options are overpriced. Based on trading experience and empirical research, we do not find that FX option prices in general are overpriced. Taking into account the transaction costs and gamma risk associated with such a strategy we do not believe that 'dynamic hedging' is appropriate for hedging purposes. Actually such a strategy would probably be more expensive and dangerous for companies in the longer term.

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Russia may ban internal use of dollar THE RUSSIAN government plans to introduce a package of economic reforms, including banning the use of the dollar within the country, as part of a drive to pull the country back from the brink of hyperinflation and again make it eligible for sustained western assistance. The measures are being finalised as Mr Yegor Gaidar, the radical economist who was acting prime minister until last December, rejoins the government in the role of first deputy prime minister in charge of the economy. His acceptance of the job was conditional on the removal of Mr Oleg Lobov from the post of first deputy prime minister. Mr Lobov may be 'promoted' to the influential secretaryship of the Security Council. The banning of the use of foreign currency, widely used, has been proposed several times in the past year but always delayed because of Russians' preference for hard currency as a stable unit of value. A steep slide in the rouble abated two months ago, and its current worth is Rbs1,025 to the dollar. But because of inflation, the purchasing power of the rouble falls by 20-30 per cent a month. The government could stop the right of Russians as well as foreigners to hold dollar bank accounts, as well as forbid its use in retail outlets. However, such a move would be extremely difficult to police and would be evaded. The measures, probably to be introduced in a series of decrees, will also include: Raising value added tax on a range of goods by 7 percentage points from a current average of 15 per cent. Proceeds would go into a fund to support the energy industries. Increasing marginal rates of income tax on all salaries over Rbs12m (Dollars 12,000) to 50 per cent from a flat rate of around 30 per cent. Raising import duties on cars and other goods. Further restriction of credits to industries, except for special cases. A tough review of capital investment programmes. Postponing interest payments on government debt to the central bank until 1997. Cutting imports of raw materials by 30 per cent. The package, constructed by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy premier in charge of finance, would, if carried through, pit the government directly against the powerful agricultural and industrial lobbies whose interests are in continuing subsidies and soft credits. The government, harried by foreign countries to which it is vastly indebted, has decided to try again for macroeconomic discipline, with the lustre of Mr Gaidar's name giving the project credibility. Mr Gaidar will face an all but impossible task - with a budget deficit plunging beyond 10 per cent of the gross domestic product, a hostile parliament and a potentially difficult relationship with Mr Fyodorov, who has been in charge of economic reform.</p>

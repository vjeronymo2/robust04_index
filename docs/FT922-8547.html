			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / US court rejects challenge over unitary taxation CALIFORNIA'S supreme court has rejected a challenge to the state's 'unitary taxation' system, in a decision that could cost multinational companies with operations in the state about Dollars 792m (Pounds 447m) in disputed tax payments. British, Japanese and other foreign companies have been fighting California's unitary tax for a decade. The case decided by the supreme court was brought by Barclays Bank of the UK in 1984, and challenged the constitutionality of the tax assessment method. Unitary tax is calculated according to a formula that takes into account a company's worldwide earnings and taxes a portion of them according to the percentage of activity in the state. A company that has 10 per cent of its world sales, property and payroll in California, for example, would be taxed on 10 per cent of its global profits, even if the California operation made no profit. The court rejected the claims of multinationals - which have been backed by the Bush administration as well as by foreign governments, including the UK  -that the tax method interferes with the US federal government's ability to conduct foreign policy. While acknowledging that four US presidents have opposed state unitary taxes, the California court held that Congress, which holds power over foreign commerce, has not opposed the tax. The law 'does not give executive (branch) officials carte blanche to declare state tax methods null when they irritate our trading partners,' Justice Armand Arabian wrote in a unanimous decision. The state court referred back to the state appeals court the relatively minor issue of whether calculating unitary tax places an unfair burden on foreign multinationals. David Barchard adds: Barclays said in London last night it was disappointed but not surprised by the Californian judgment. The bank, which had hoped to secure a tax refund of about Dollars 30m, plans to appeal to the US Supreme Court in a last-ditch effort to overturn the judgment.</p>

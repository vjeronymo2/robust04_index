			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Complex, Confusing Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many applicants enter the SSA disability process uninformed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the process itself and the definition of disability. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are unaware of the criteria for establishing disability and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence they will be required to submit. Even third parties and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advocate organizations, often more knowledgeable than the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public about SSA procedures, experience difficulty obtaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaningful information about the status of their clients <!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->  claims,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding that they often are transferred from one employee to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disability claimants face a ``one size fits all'' approach to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the intake and processing of their claim, finding themselves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> answering questions they believe are intrusive and irrelevant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their claim. Front-line employees currently devote hours to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completing forms and obtaining information which may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for a finding of disability. Claimants often do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understand what happens to the claim after initial contact with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA and view multiple requests for medical information with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annoyance. Often claimants do not understand how the decision was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made and, therefore, believe that it was reached arbitrarily. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claim is approved, whether at the initial or appellate level,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimants and their representatives, as well as front-line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees, are concerned about the complicated procedures and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> length of time it takes to effectuate payment and entitle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible dependents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA employees, claimants, and other interested parties all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agree that the current process takes too long to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants a decision, and leaves them confused about who has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for their claim, and puzzled about the status of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their claim during various points in the process. Additionally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nearly all believe that many claimants can and should assume more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for submitting evidence and pursuing their claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most view the reconsideration step as little more than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rubber stamp of the initial determination, creating additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work for employees and yet another bureaucratic obstacle for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimants and their representatives. Some believe a face-to-face  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interview with the decisionmaker is vital to reaching a fair,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurate determination; others believe just as strongly that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision should be reached on the basis of a paper review, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a face-to-face interview can lead to subjective decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are not based on objective criteria. Quality reviews and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appeals Council reviews are often mentioned as areas where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities exist for streamlining and improving the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Claimants and their representatives have learned their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chances for a favorable decision improve if they appeal their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim to an ALJ. The public, in particular, believes that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to hire an attorney to maneuver through the appeals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, and voices resentment at having to do so. Higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance rates at the ALJ level lead to the perception that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different adjudicative standards apply at the initial and appeals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels. A variety of factors may be contributing to this. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facts of many cases change over time as a claimant <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s condition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes. ALJs often have access to information not considered at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower levels in the process because earlier decisionmakers are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not as likely to have face-to-face interaction with the claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Contributors to Complexity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The collection of medical evidence presents problems as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case is developed, accounting for a considerable portion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total time involved in disability claim processing. Health care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers who are a claimant <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s treating source often do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understand the requirements for establishing disability, and find  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical evidence request forms confusing and repetitive. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that evidence requests burden them with far too much  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paperwork and offer far too little in the way of compensation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time invested. Adjudicators often find that evidence is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily treatment-oriented and fails to provide either the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highly specialized clinical findings or the functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information that is required by the regulations. To compensate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for poor or missing medical evidence, DDSs purchase consultative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examinations, devoting substantial resources to scheduling,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchasing, and processing these examinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once the medical evidence has been collected, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology used by disability decisionmakers is complex and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controversial. The current sequential evaluation process, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was originally designed to identify and evaluate cases in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simple, rapid and consistent fashion has grown increasingly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complex as the result of court decisions and changes in medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology. This complexity has, in turn, contributed to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing difficulty and fragmentation in other portions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability process, including intake, evidence collection, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, the Listings of Impairments was originally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to highlight readily identifiable disabling impairments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the Listings have since evolved into complex and highly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detailed diagnostic requirements, demanding specialized medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence that may not be readily available from treating sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some, but not all, of the Listings consider the functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of an impairment; however functional considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vary significantly among the Listings. Additionally, in assessing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an individual <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s functional abilities at the later steps in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sequential evaluation, adjudicators collect and analyze evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a multitude of different, and often conflicting, sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including: objective clinical and laboratory findings; treating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source opinions and other third-party statements considered to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the objective evidence; and the individual <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> description of his or her limitations. The development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extensive medical evidence in every case impedes timely and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient decisionmaking. The varying approaches to assessing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s functional ability that are required at different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steps in the sequential evaluation, along with the nature and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of evidence that adjudicators may rely on to assess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function often lead to different interpretations of the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence by different adjudicators. Vocational rules originally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to provide a structured approach to decisionmaking have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grown increasingly complex, leading to varying interpretations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and inconsistent decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Fragmented Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fragmented nature of the disability process is driven by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and exacerbated by the fragmentation in SSA's policy making and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy issuance mechanisms. Policy making authority rests in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several organizations with few effective tools for ensuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent guidance to all disability decisionmakers. Different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles exist for conveying policy and procedural guidance to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisionmakers at different levels in the process. While the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for disability decisionmaking are uniform, they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed in different wording in the various policy vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Training on disability is not delivered in a consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner, nor is it provided simultaneously to disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisionmakers across or among levels in the process. Mechanisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for reviewing application of policy among levels of the process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are fragmented and inconsistent. Review of DDS decisions is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavily weighted toward allowances; no systematic quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance program is in place for hearing decisions although the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for feedback from the Appeals Council or from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> courts is heavily weighted toward denials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The organizational fragmentation of the disability process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> creates the perception that no one is in charge of it. SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures the process from the perspective of the component  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations involved, rather than the perspective of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant. Multiple organizations (field offices, DDSs, hearings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices, Appeals Council operations, and processing centers) have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdiction over the claim at various points in time, with each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> line of authority managing toward its own goals without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility to the overall outcome of the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the impact of one component <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s work product on other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components is not measured, further contributing to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fragmentation of the process. Each component's narrow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities reinforce a lack of understanding among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component employees of the roles and responsibilities of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees in different components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for a Redesigned Disability Claim Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Sharing out the spoils: John Authers says councillors will learn to co-operate English county councils are entering a new age of uncertainty. The signs are, however, that it could pave the way for an era of co-operation, guided by opposition to Conservative central government. A record number of counties - 26 - have no overall party control. In most cases, the largest parties will seek to form the local administration, and then look for support from other councillors. Parties are unlikely to make formal pacts. The Liberal Democrats now comprise the largest group in nine councils where there is no overall majority. They will expect to be recognised as the policymakers in all of them - as will Labour in the eight hung counties where they have the largest representation. The Liberal Democrats hope that the results will usher in a coalition style of local government along European lines, while Labour describes speculation about 'Lab-Lib agreements' as 'basically legitimate'. Mr Andrew Stunell, political officer for the Liberal Democrat Councillors, said: 'There will be a number of Labour politicians who are having to come to terms with what it will be like if we have a reformed constitution based on proportional representation. It's the norm in the rest of Europe.' Party leaders will look for support generally on an issue-by-issue basis. This is the approach of Mr David Rogers, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the hung council of East Sussex, formerly Conservative. He does not expect any formal arrangements. He made clear that the chances of an informal link with Labour were high: 'The Conservatives' credibility as a member of the administration has been damaged.' Mr Ken Bodfish, the Labour leader in East Sussex, seems to have similar priorities. He says his responsibility is 'to ensure that there is a non-Tory county council', where the Tories still form the second-biggest party. This sentiment is echoed in other hung counties where the Liberal Democrats have replaced the Conservatives as the largest group. In West Sussex, Labour leader Mr Arthur Pegler foresees a return to the non-partisan days when the council was run by independents. He has no intention of entering into a formal pact with the Liberal Democrats, and does not dispute their right to govern. Labour will make up its mind on individual issues, but Mr Pegler said: 'There is no difference between us and the Liberal Democrats on the most important things, such as the provision of social services, schools, the environment and the maintenance of roads.' Lib-Lab arrangements of different kinds might also arise in counties where the Conservatives remain the largest party, such as Norfolk, where they lost overall control for the first time since 1888. Labour is talking to the Liberal Democrats about opposition to the closure of village schools, rural policies, and applications for EC aid. Their hopes of engineering a change in county policies are high.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Land developer calls for receiver EUROPEAN LAND, a de-velopment company specialising in large business parks, has asked its bank, National Westminster, to appoint an administrative receiver. The company, which is run by Mr Jim Cookson, specialised in assembling land banks, with a view to seeking planning permission and selling land parcels to developers. Development land values have been particularly badly depressed in the property recession. Its most prominent project is in Ashford, Kent, where it is seeking planning permission for a large business park in partnership with the Church Commissioners and Imry, a development company. Two joint venture companies owned by Mr Cookson and CIN Properties, the property investment arm of the British Coal Pension Fund, which are promoting business parks in the north-east, are not part of European Land. Mr Cookson is confident of their future.</p>

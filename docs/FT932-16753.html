			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Appetisers LE MANOIR aux Quat' Saisons, one of England's most sumptuous country house hotels, is inviting chocaholics to spend the Easter weekend in Great Milton, just outside Oxford. There, you will be able to eat more chocolate than you could ever imagine: eclairs with your tea, puddings with your dinner, hot chocolate in your room, and a light breakfast of pain au chocolat. There will be an Easter egg hunt, too, with more than 1,000 to find and eat; the winner gets an over-sized egg. In the kitchens, there will be a cookery demonstration where you can learn how to make chef Raymond Blanc's cafe creme. This is a cup and saucer moulded from chocolate; the cup is filled with coffee ice cream topped with caramel-flavoured sabayon, rather like a cappuccino. It is served with two sugar lumps, which are shaped chocolate truffles coated with white praline powder. The hotel is as pretty as a picture: a 15th century Cotswold manor house with 27 acres of grounds full of herbaceous borders and rose beds, water gardens and woodlands. There are 19 bedrooms, all with views over the gardens, plus a tennis court and swimming pool. The weekend is being organised by Blanc and the Chocolate Society. The three-night stay (from April 9-12) will cost Pounds 445 each for everything. The Lanesborough hotel in London also is organising an Easter egg hunt for children on Easter Sunday. It starts at about 1pm and a traditional Sunday lunch is being served in the dining room. Or you can opt for brunch in the conservatory, where you are promised eggs with your bagels and dessert chocolate eggs afterwards. The lunch costs from Pounds 34 (or Pounds 22 for children). If you want to clock up your air miles, you could go to Paris for the weekend, stay at the Hotel de Crillon and combine it with a trip to the Henri Matisse exhibition, heralded as the art event of the year. The hotel's package includes a double room, dinner, champagne, gifts and the like - plus reserved entrance tickets to the exhibition so you can avoid the queues. The Crillon is the sole grand hotel in Paris to remain in private hands. It is a wonderful building, a masterpiece of 18th century architecture. Ask for room 158, 101 or 105 - all are magnificent. The hotel is on the Place de la Concorde, near enough to go shopping in the famous boutiques and to have tea at Maxime's. Prices from FFr2,000 (Pounds 250) a person. Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons, 0844-278-881; the Lanesborough, 071-259 5599; Hotel de Crillon, 010 331-4471 15 00.</p>

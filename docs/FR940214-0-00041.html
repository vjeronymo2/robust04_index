During the period of preapplication review and processing, applicants will not take any actions with respect to their applications which would have an adverse impact on the environment or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. This requirement does not preclude the applicant from developing preliminary plans or designs or performing other work necessary to support an application for Federal, State, or local permits or assistance. If the applicant incurs debts for work, materials, land purchase, or other authorized fees and charges before the loan is closed, the State Director may authorize the use of loan funds to pay the debts when all of the following conditions exist and debts were authorized in writing by FmHA prior to their being incurred (market studies will be exempt from this requirement):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Prior to the date of preapplication as part of a predevelopment loan specifically intended as temporary financing from a public agency or nonprofit organization and the State Director secures prior concurrence from the National Office; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) No increase in per unit development cost will be approved, whether the circumstance causing the cost increase occurs before, during, or after the construction period, unless these conditions were unforeseen factors beyond the owner's control and the increase in cost was approved by FmHA in writing before the expense was incurred. (In case of an emergency, the requirement that the cost be approved by FmHA in writing before the expense is incurred is waived as long as the servicing official is notified by the next working day.) Such costs are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 15. Section 1944.215 is amended in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) by adding the words ``(available in any FmHA office)'' at the end of the paragraph; by revising in paragraph (h)(1) the words ``What is Cooperative Housing?'' to read ``A Guide to Cooperative Housing''; and by revising paragraph (a), the introductory text of paragraphs (b) and (b)(1), paragraph (b)(1)(i), and the introductory text of paragraph (e) and by adding paragraph (w)(3) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1944.215  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Special conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cost containment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To achieve affordable rents and occupancy rates (not considering rental assistance or similar subsidies), all development costs will be economical in nature and not include costs for unnecessary or elaborate design features. Cost containment is not to be interpreted as accepting poor design or cheap construction. Projects must provide the features and amenities necessary for the lifestyles of the tenants and members. Consideration must be given to the cost/benefit ratio when evaluating, recommending, or requiring specific design features or construction techniques. Life cycle cost analysis will be employed to determine the types of materials which will reduce operation/maintenance costs even though their initial costs are higher. Operation and maintenance costs factored into proposed operating budgets will be adjusted accordingly. The following guidelines are to be followed when developing projects:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

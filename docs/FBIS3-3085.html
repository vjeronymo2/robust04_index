Confidence in  the territory would be seriously affected, with international  investors thinking twice because of the judicial uncertainty, he  said.    Mr Hoare said the Government planned to secure passage of  the  bill authorising the establishment of the court by July 1995.  He said one of the factors that concerned international  investors was certainty and Hong Kong was renowned for its  stable system of law. "Once you start to introduce uncertainty  into the system you will start to unravel everything," he said.  Mr Hoare said the situation would get worse as 1997 approached.    Legislators and the administration have been locked in a  dispute over the setting up of the Court of Final Appeal since  the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group reached an agreement on the  body in autumn 1991. While the diplomatic body agreed that the  number of overseas judges sitting on the five-member court  should be confined to one, both liberal and conservative  legislators maintain that the arrangement went against the Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law. Legislative Councillors have  vowed to vote down any government bill drafted along the line of  the Sino-British accord and none has indicated they have had  second thoughts on their original position.    Although the Government had earlier indicated that the draft  on the complex legislation would be available for consultation  with the legal profession some time this year, Mr Hoare  yesterday for the first time offered a clear legislative  timetable. Noting possible pressure from the Legislative  Council [Legco], Mr Hoare urged the lawmakers to have a second  look before proposing any amendments.    Mr Hoare said the draft bill would be submitted to the  Executive Council next month, before consultation with China and  the legal profession. It was planned the bill would be tabled  in Legco towards the end of the year.    Mr Hoare stressed that the Court of Final Appeal must be set  up in 1996 as it usually took a year for cases to reach the  Privy Council, so that process had to be terminated before  mid-1996. The Government therefore wanted to secure the passage  of the bill by July 1995 or the consequences would be serious,  he said. Without the bill, he envisaged a legal vacuum of  two-to-three years on the basis that some time would be expected  to be taken by the future Special Administrative Region  legislature to establish such a court.    United Democrat legislators have already indicated that they  would introduce an amendment to the bill if the Government  insisted on the Sino-British version of restricting the number  of overseas judges to one. But Mr Hoare warned that if the  amendment succeeded, the Government might set up the court  according to Legco's decision, bearing in mind that it would be  disbanded after the change-over. Or the Government would simply  withdraw the legislation and notet up the court, he said. "It  would not in anyway help to resolve the problem," said Mr Hoare.  He said it was essential for the top level court to be set up  by the handover to ensure a smooth running and operation before  then.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Money Markets: French rates tumble THERE were strong expect-ations yesterday that official French franc interest rates would be cut this week, following the appointment of a new French prime minister by President Francois Mitterrand, writes James Blitz. The French government being formed by Mr Edouard Balladur is under strong pressure to reduce interest rates because of the slowdown in the country's economy. Until now, the franc's weakness in the exchange rate mechanism has been a strong constraint on policy easing. But yesterday, the currency continued to profit from the decisive result for the centre-right alliance in the National Assembly elections. This raised speculation that the Bank of France might take the opportunity to cut its five to 10-day interest rate from the painfully high level of 12 per cent. One-month French franc interest rates fell nearly 100 basis points yesterday from 11.20 per cent to 10.18 per cent. Three-month interest rates fell from 11.00 per cent to below 10 per cent. There was a similarly upbeat tone in the French franc futures market. The June contract rose some 12 basis points from its previous close to a high of 91.64, before finishing at 91.60. The September contract was finally 19 basis points higher at 92.83. One factor adding to the upbeat sentiment in France was the Bundesbank's announcement that it would be offering a variable rate repo in its weekly securities repurchase tender today. There are strong expect-ations that the lowest accepted bid for the repo will fall some 10 or 15 basis points from the current level of 8.25 per cent. Underlining this view was the sharp fall in German call money yesterday from 8.15 per cent on Monday night to 7.80 per cent by last night. Conditions in the German money market are highly liquid because many banks have reached their reserve requirements. Sterling markets remained bullish as expectations grew that the UK authorities might lower base rates to deal with a threatened rise in mortgage lending rates by the nation's building societies. Three-month money closed at 5 7/8 per cent from a previous close of 6 1/32 per cent. The overnight rate was as low as 2 per cent following another small shortage in the Bank of England's operations.</p>

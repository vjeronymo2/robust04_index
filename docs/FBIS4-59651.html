			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, 16 May (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa has urged the promotion of relations between the European  Union [EU] and Egypt and launching of a new partnership covering  political, economic, cultural, technological, and other fields  "so that we can face the challenges of the future and benefit  from the opportunities available to us all."    In an address to the EU Council this evening, the foreign  minister said that Egypt is currently studying and analyzing  this matter from all aspects. "We are ready to begin  discussions with the EU on a new partnership agreement in the  near future," he said.    The minister began his speech to the Council meeting, which  is devoted for Egypt, by emphasizing that many developments and  changes have taken place in Europe and in the Middle East since  the last meeting between the Council and Egypt in July 1992.    In Europe, he noted, the EU itself has been launched,  reflecting positively on the temporary and future role to be  played on the level of European relations. In the Middle East,  important changes have taken place, notably the 4 May Cairo  Agreement between Israel and the PLO. The agreement, he said,  opens up important possibilities for achieving peace, stability,  and security in this region and also reflects positively on  regional and multilateral cooperation.    Among the other changes in the Middle East, Musa pointed  out,  is the progress in the peace talks between Israel and other  sides, and the progress in the multilateral talks, where a  protocol for economic cooperation between Israel and the PLO was  signed.    All this, Musa said, creates a positive climate to advance  cooperation and economic, political, and security relations  between the states of the EU and our region. He added: We hope  the EU will play its role in entrenching this cooperation.  This, he went on, should not be at the expense of bilateral  cooperation between the EU and the region, but should serve as  an additional avenue to help regional developmental projects and  projects in the occupied territories.    The foreign minister reviewed Egypt's efforts to implement  the comprehensive economic reform plan in Egypt, the positive  results of the first phase of the plan, and the start of the  second phase in a way that will open the door to all-out  development in Egypt where the private sector plays an important  role.    'Amr Musa reviewed the efforts Egypt has already made on  its economic reform and privatization programs. He noted these  efforts and the successes in this field. He stressed the role  of the EU in supporting Egypt's efforts and backing this program  "which we are following up with serious steps."    He noted his country's efforts in confronting its other  social and economic problems, beginning with finding solutions  to unemployment and confronting the housing problems. He also  noted that Egypt's concern about the population problem is  apparent in the fact that Egypt will host the international  population conference in September.    In discussing cultural relations between Egypt and the EU,  the Egyptian foreign minister highlighted the need to make full  and ideal use of EU allocations of funds and other aid to Egypt  within the framework of the fourth protocol.    The Egyptian foreign minister stressed the importance of  continuing European investment's role in bolstering the economic  reform process and providing easy-term loans, especially since  the World Bank report on Egypt released on 18 April 1994 praised  the progress in economic reform, particularly the privatization  process.    'Amr Musa noted that Egypt still has to scientifically and  constructively confront the challenges of developing its human  resources, encouraging exports, decreasing social burdens,  protecting the environment, and encouraging investments. It  needs to do all this to implement the economic reform programs,  make some progress, and decrease the burden of the low-income  and working-class sectors. It also has to concentrate on  exploiting the available resources to absorb new and young work  potentials.    He also spoke about bilateral relations with the EU. He  asked that the necessary measures be taken to encourage Egyptian  exports to the EU members in order to realize the joint  interests of both sides.    'Amr Musa spoke about the challenges that emerge after  signing the GATT agreement. He also highlighted the need to  find greater opportunities for international trade in the  international community. He noted the fears of protectionist  policies. He said that all this makes it necessary to discuss  and consult with the EU and demand a larger scope for  cooperation with it. We also ask that it increase the easy-term  loans and grants it gives us, as well as the food aid to realize  the food security projects in Egypt and help the poorer classes.    The Egyptian foreign minister once again discussed  developments in Egypt and our region. In particular, he  addressed the economic changes in Egypt, the future role of the  EU as an effective factor in the European community, and the  great possibilities for regional cooperation, especially now  that the peace agreement has been signed.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Observer: Treble trouble Guess the profession of Ian Cartwright who, having been the sole partner in his Godalming practice since 1986, is appointing two more tomorrow and so trebling the number of partners. He calculates that if he trebles them up again on Sunday, and goes on expanding at that same rate every 24 hours thereafter, he'd have to stop on August 21. The reason is that he would then have in partnership the entire population of the globe. Wouldn't that be an interesting world to live in, he asks. But some readers, at least, may doubt it. As all of his partners must belong to his own profession, the whole damn lot of us would have to be actuaries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Alekseyev, corresponding member of the </F> Russian Academy of Sciences, chairman of the Research Council of  the Center for Private Rights under the president of the Russian  Federation: "Under the Spell of the New Utopia: About Old Errors  and New Ways To Develop Privatization"]    [Text] Utopias are tempting, insidious, and diverse  in their characteristics; but attempts at their practical  implementation are one and the same always and everywhere--the  imposition of impracticable schemes on people, coercion, and the  inevitable shattering of illusions.    That is what happened with the Marxist utopia of  communism.    That, alas, is what in many ways is also happening with  one of our new utopias--the privatization program that is being  implemented now.  <H5>  Privatization Socialist Style </H5>   It is difficult to understand the reasons that conditioned  the rather broadly and persistently propagandized opinion that  the privatization being conducted in Russia at the present time  is radical and "of the people"--the kind that will create an  extensive class of private property owners and that will include  almost all Russian citizens in this middle class. For if we  divert our attention from the forceful and bombastic declaratory  statements of the supporters of such a program (set, by the way,  by the RSFSR Supreme Soviet according to its own principles),  then it is not difficult to see that in a number of its  features--fortunately, not in all of them--it is utopian, and in  addition to this it has a leveling, orthodox-socialistic  character.    First, the program is being conducted in such a way that the  main part of the national wealth remains under state domination.  The volume of properties being received by vouchers is trifling  (for each, the "note" has a value on the order of about  one-fourth of an average monthly wage, or $15). All of the  natural resources, "public" enterprises, and controlling blocks  of shares of stock of a majority of the enterprises converted to  joint-stock companies remain with the government.    Second, the distribution itself of state property by  vouchers  takes place according to the socialist principle--the division  of property among all fellow citizens "as equals." And if such a  division under conditions of deeply rooted private property  attitudes (as, for example, in the Czech and Slovak republics)  is capable of reinforcing these attitudes and expanding their  subject makeup, then, under conditions of the domination of  state property and the until now the indestructible  parasitical-consumer psychology of a majority of the population,  a similar result is possible, but then this is not always, only  during the use of vouchers for the acquisition of property by  the "labor collective"--however, with all of the contradictions  inherent in the given method of privatization.    Third, that which in Russia is now called "privatization" is  built on an understanding of property that corresponds to  socialist concepts that equate property with wealth, benefits,  and the source of a mellow and carefree life (the idea of its  division "as equals" comes from this).    Meanwhile, property in the economy is not so much a consumer  blessing as much as a burden and responsibility--a material  basis for the application of intensive labor, enterprise, risk,  brains, and talent. Its main criterion and indicator are "one's  own" investments and the investment of profits in production. It  is this effect that private property gives under conditions of  competition and market rivalry. And, consequently, the general  task of real privatization does not consist in dividing objects  of property "as equals," but making property really private and,  consequently, an incentive for intensive labor, an increase in  labor productivity, a factor of responsibility for work, and a  force that motivates "personal" investments.  <H5>  The Insidious Voucher </H5>   It is necessary, of course, to see that the privatization  being conducted currently has positive aspects (as, by the way,  some facets of socialist concepts are not without sense). It  "turned" Russian citizens toward questions of property, and the  rudiments of business appeared.    The fundamental deficiency of the ongoing privatization  program is that it is aimed at the implementation of utopian  ideas--to make all citizens of Russia private property subjects  with the help of privatization voucher-checks.    Well, vouchers have a known moral significance: They are  evidence that the state is a debtor to its own citizens; in some  measure, vouchers can have the character of temporary material  assistance to citizens.    But it is impossible in principle to transform all of our  fellow citizens into private property owners--bearers of small  parts of the wealth of former state property--with the help of  vouchers. Not only because of the scantiness of the "portion"  received and the modest prospects of acquiring incomes on the  shares of stock acquired for vouchers. And not only because  state property and a parasitical consumer psychology continue to  reign in society. But principally because this is contradicted  by the very nature of a dynamic commodity market economy, on the  creation of which economic reforms are calculated, inasmuch as  property-owning citizens who do not participate in production  can only be property-owning rentiers who parasitize on  production and on the results of the activity of property-owning  producers (that is why in countries with a developed economy,  pensioners, servicemen, and workers in the budgetary  institutions are supported by the state and are not directly  supported by property-owning producers).    It seems that already now a number of aspects of a  privatization that is built on a system of vouchers has  engendered a lot of negative consequences.    First, many important elements of privatization relating to  production and having independent significance were "driven" by  concerns for the success of the voucher system, and so that  shares of stock of any enterprises being privatized could be  acquired by all voucher owners.    Second, the voucher system, contrary to the purpose of  property in production, is even a disincentive to work. In a  situation of all-out propaganda ("gold vouchers," "thousand  percent incomes," etcetera, etcetera), the impression is created  that it is possible to receive impressive incomes at the expense  of "the work of others" through shares of stock acquired for  vouchers.    Third, also with respect to enterprises whose shares of  stock  were acquired for vouchers--this is a disincentive, inasmuch as  such a procedure involves an increase in the number of people  who do not work in production, but who claim a share of the  profits, in a word, still another tax on profits that is not  justified by anything.    Well, and the very idea of a "return" with the help of  vouchers to pensioners, doctors, teachers, servicemen, and state  budget employees of state property (attractive and tempting,  just like all socialist ideas) is futile and without promise.  <H5>  They Got What They Were Fighting Against </H5>   In behalf of the success of the voucher system, the ongoing  privatization program essentially limited the rights of the  labor collectives. This, in addition to everything else,  alienated a substantial number of labor collectives from  democratic movements with which the privatization program is  associated.    At the same time, there are a lot of reasons for the guarded  and even negative attitude toward the privatization being  implemented by labor collectives. After all, the "labor  collectives" that were formed under conditions of the  socialistic command-planning system were in themselves not  adapted to economic management as property owners, and they  frequently were only a cover and a conduit for commands issued  by the party-administrative elite. Therefore, in the opinion of  the author of these lines, the "lease-purchase" variant of  privatization that operated in the past, which was optimal for  post-totalitarian conditions, did not have the labor collective  as the strong point as such, but the "organization of  leaseholders," which at first mastered the difficult school of  "its own" economic management step by step, and only afterwards  became a fully-fledged property owner.    The system of privatization in operation, which is geared to  voucher distribution, nevertheless could not bypass the labor  collectives, and a substantial number of the latter, having  overcome by hook or crook the obstacles and impediments created  for them, became "closed" joint-stock companies--property owners  of privatized property. But they became "as such" without  changing, and without adapting to difficult economic management  as private property owners.    Well, it happens. As one of the unexpected consequences of  "people's" privatization, Russian society received precisely  that against which it was fighting, and also in a worse variant.  In a number of oblasts and sectors of the national economy, and  in a number of localities, enclaves of the command-planning  system were firmly established under the flag of labor  collectives and the aegis of the old regime director corps. And  now there is no need to be surprised that a base of the past  party-administrative aktiv has been consolidated and that the  source of the increasing strength of communist and procommunist  circles has been broadened.  <H5>  But What Is To Be Done? </H5>   First of all, it is necessary to see the truth, the real  state of affairs. Unfortunately, until very recently the  reaction of the adherents of the current programs of "people's"  privatization to critical considerations and proposals was not  of a practical nature, and it sometimes ended up in irritated,  peremptory cries and the application of labels to the authors of  these kinds of considerations and proposals. Is it really  necessary to wait for a complete crash that will also cancel the  movement forward on the most complicated problems of  reorganizing property in order to agree on obvious facts, to  discuss debatable ideas, and to begin to make corrections in the  ongoing privatization process?    Then, it is clear, it is necessary to explain oneself to the  people immediately. It must be believed that the authors of the  programs in effect sincerely wanted to make all Russians  property owners of those riches that they earned a long time  ago, and to create equal conditions for everyone to enter the  market. But then, not everything that is planned works out. The  people will understand, if they are talked to sincerely and  honestly. And judging by everything, it is still not too late to  develop a system of compensatory measures.    The main thing is this, after preserving everything that is  positive that has already been achieved in the process of  privatization, to persistently spread the privatization  processes directly to production. In order that private property  would begin to work not only in the sphere of marketplace  resales and clever currency operations, but so that it would  become a powerful incentive to work.    Three measures are presented here as priorities.    First-- resolute legislative and governmental  support in the production of private business and all forms of  private property (not "forms of private property" in general,  but specifically private ownership), i.e., private  entrepreneurs, intact production cooperatives, and  private-collective enterprises--all of those that on the basis  of "their own" property, market competition, risk, and  responsibility work in the market to saturate it with quality  goods and services. It is precisely with respect to such private  commodity producers (but not "commodity producers" in general)  that it is necessary finally to decide substantially to reduce  taxes, to remove all restrictions that encroach on economic  freedom, to support them with credits, to establish for them, as  for all other "commodity producers" (bureaucratic subsidized  state enterprises also hide behind this cunning formula) single,  stable "rules of the game"--civil legislation worked out in  detail.    Second-- inclusion of the workers themselves in  the practical relations of the private property of enterprises  converted to joint-stock companies. Here, without in any way  wrecking the system of already established joint-stock  enterprises and their current forms, it would be quite justified  to strengthen and enrich this system, conditionally speaking,  with "producer societies" established for worker-joint-stock  enterprises that would have, for example, "doubled shares of  stock" [sdvoyennyye aktsii]: in order, however, that the  normatively established part of the incomes for these shares  goes to investment in production. It can be confidently  predicted that the effect of such an inclusion of the workers  themselves of converted joint-stock companies with respect to  private property in the sphere of production will be significant.    Third--the kind of reorganization of open  joint-stock companies (after a resolution of all questions  associated with voucher privatization) when their "openness"  would be oriented not on the possessors of papers, behind which  there is no real wealth, but on actual domestic and foreign  investors--the possessors of capital. Such a "directed openness"  would make it possible, as experience indicates, to implement a  structural, technical, and technological restructuring of  production and ensure a considerable increase in the  productivity of labor, market vitality, and the activeness of  enterprises.    These and other corrections in the ongoing privatization  program will give it, as can be expected, a real and effective  nature and will make it possible to put into effect the  potential of private property as a powerful work incentive and a  high degree of responsibility for work, which are factors in the  growing investments in production. It is necessary just to free  oneself of "voucher illusions" and the current utopian hopes  that are associated with them.</p>

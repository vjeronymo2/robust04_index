			<p>BFN     [Text] Presumably, there is a Government human rights  policy even if it has not been communicated to Michael Suen, the  Policy Secretary responsible for this matter. Suen has gone on  record to say that plans are indeed in place for combating  sexual harassment, protecting pregnant workers, and combating  discrimination on grounds of marital status. Over the weekend  he appeared to be saying the new Equal Opportunities Bill was  the last word on this matter and he was not aware of any other  anti-discrimination legislation in the pipeline.    If the Secretary for Home Affairs, who gives every  impression  of performing a distasteful task, is confused, it is little  wonder that the public also is wondering what on earth is going  on. A knee-jerk reaction would be to blame Michael Suen for not  being on top of the job. This may turn out to be the case but  the lack of clear signals on human rights matters comes from the  top.    The government's hesitation in implementing  anti-discriminatory legislation and access to information  proposals, currently the subject of private members bills, gives  rise to the suspicion that the commitment to a full-scale human  rights agenda is lacking.    In private, the government has indicated it is preparing to  move in the right direction but is taking care to avoid  littering the path with symbolic gestures which would only serve  to raise Chinese government objections.    The government's stance is naive on the one hand, and  dishonest on the other. First, it is naive to assume that China  will not object to so-called nonsymbolic human rights gestures,  such as an access to information bill. Surely, it has become  clear there are highly trained human rights sniffers in Beijing  who can detect the slightest hint of human rights reform,  however it is dressed up.    Whatever steps are being taken to enhance the human rights  regime, China will object and do so with vigour. It is  therefore essential that the government comes clean on its human  rights agenda and clearly explains measures to be taken and why.  If the government believes these measures are right and just,  it should say so. If it behaves in a furtive manner, suggesting  that there is something to be ashamed of in its actions, it will  only convey the impression that it is trying to sell shoddy  goods.    Some members of the administration are opposed to  legislation  that eliminates discrimination and are even more violently  opposed to laws that give the public the right to know what  officialdom is doing. They are fighting a rearguard campaign to  stop the spread of what they see as the human rights virus.    The time has come for leadership. Either Governor Chris  Patten bows to their wishes or he must tell them that government  policy is irrevocably set in the direction of enhancing the  rights of the people of Hong Kong. There is no halfway house in  sight.    Not only should the government come clean about its  intentions but it should also campaign vigorously for what it  believes. Some faint hearts in the administration fear a human  rights campaign would not win public support. We challenge them  to point to a single demonstration that has called for less  human rights. Sure, there will be and have been protests in  favour of retaining privilege, as witnessed by the New  Territories inheritance issue.    Yet, such is the strength of feeling in favour of securing  and extending the rights of the people that practically no one  would come out and openly argue the case for less human rights.  At most, the doubters will advance the view that human rights  cannot be extended because China might object. The Government  should capitalise on public sentiment, rather than cower in the  shadow of human rights opponents. It should also provide  concrete examples that show why human rights is not an abstract  concept.    In Hong Kong, it means the right to determine if officials  are gathering information about residents of the territory that  may be incorrect and damaging. It means that female workers do  not have to tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace. It  also means that the right to housing and other essential  services cannot be denied on grounds of race, religion, or other  considerations of a discriminatory nature.    These are real issues, affecting everyday life. The Patten  administration has led the public to believe it is concerned  about matters of this kind. It is hard to overstate the  disappointment and disillusion that will ensue in Hong Kong if  the administration starts to back track on these issues.    We are used to the cynicism of politicians who judge policy,  on whether it will enhance their popularity. We see no reason  to make Hong Kong an even more fertile ground for nurturing this  kind of cynicism.</p>

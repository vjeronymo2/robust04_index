			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Brussels truce for breach of EC single market rules THE European Commission has called a truce with Community governments which break or fail to implement the rules of the new barrier-free single market. Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC's new internal market commissioner, yesterday promised a softly-softly approach to infringements of the single market, which came into force three weeks ago. Mr Vanni d'Archirafi did not specify how long such an 'armistice' would last, but he said the Commission would monitor the progress of the market over the first two to three months of 1993. The announcement provoked a mixed reaction from European business, which is worried that lax enforcement of nearly 300 single market measures might undermine the benefits of the market. 'We know it's not easy, but (member states and the Commission) must implement the single market as soon as possible and not find excuses for not doing it,' said Mr Rodolphe de Looz Corswarem of Unice, the European employers' federation. Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, 61, a former Italian diplomat, said he did not want to provoke a fight with member states. 'I would prefer to have a positive response (to single market measures), even if it takes a little longer, rather than a split or a confrontation which would then be more difficult to solve,' he said. He added that the January 1 deadline for single market legislation was just the beginning of a 'first phase' of the single market, which is supposed to be open to free movement of goods, services, capital and people. A number of important measures to liberalise and harmonise the EC market will not take effect until later in the decade, and in some important and sensitive areas - notably the energy, telecommunications and postal services sectors - legislation has yet to be approved by member states. Mr Vanni d'Archirafi indicated he would adopt the same lenient approach to the central outstanding question of how to abolish all passport checks at internal EC frontiers. He reaffirmed the Commission's view that EC rules on free movement of people require the lifting of all internal controls on people and goods. That legal interpretation has put Brussels in conflict with three member states - Britain, Denmark and Ireland. They are likely to retain some form of passport checks even if other continental member states abolish controls. Mr Vanni d'Archirafi also indicated that the Commission might revive proposals to allow pets to be taken from continental Europe into Britain and Ireland without quarantine restrictions. The commissioner's promise of leniency will be appreciated by a number of countries - not least Italy itself - which are struggling with implementation of new legislation, in particular the complex new rules on the monitoring and collection of value added tax. The Commission urged national authorities before Christmas not to punish companies which accidentally broke the new VAT and excise rules.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Malgorzata Subotic: "Veto's Small Chance; So </F> Far, President Has Not Undertaken Any Measure Against Reforms"]    [Text] If the president decided to veto the budget  law, it is very likely that the Sejm would overrule the  presidential veto. Yesterday, Lech Walesa said that "for now"  he will not sign the budget, while Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy  recalled that the deadline for Walesa to veto the budget is 25  April. "There is conflicting information emerging from the  President's Office--sometimes it is that the president will sign  the budget, and, at other times, that he will veto it." So say  politicians with whom we talked, and they also add that similar  news was coming out of the Belweder regarding Rosati's  candidacy.  <H5>  Why President Would Invoke a Veto </H5>   "The nation has been cheated again; life was supposed to get  better," Walesa said yesterday, while explaining why he would  not sign the budget "for now." But he immediately made the  stipulation that, "from an economic viewpoint," he is desperate  because he knows that, apart from minor changes, the budget law  cannot be amended a great deal.    Even Walesa's critics admit that, so far, he has not  undertaken any specific measure that would be targeted against  market transformations. He has signed all economy-related laws  (with the exception of the one concerning retirement pensions  for uniformed officials), even those that limited senior  citizens' income levels.    Views on the budget adopted by the Sejm tend to be  unanimous:  Generally speaking, the budget maintains the direction of  reforms implemented thus far. International financial  institutions and our Western creditors express a similar view.  It is obvious that lack of a budget law would get a bad  perception in those circles.    So why is the president suggesting that he might not place  his signature on the document?    "To clearly demonstrate that he is keeping a distance from  the current governing coalition and to be favorably looked upon  by future voters whose views are populist and geared toward  making claims"--this is what some say. "He is hoping that he  will manage to dissolve the parliament at the same time"--this  is what other people assume.    The first hypothesis could be confirmed by friendly gestures  vis-a-vis Solidarity, which is demanding that the budget be  changed or else the trade union will wage a general strike.  "Except that, this way, Walesa would alienate those whom he  once addressed by saying: `Take things into your own hands.'"  This is what Wieslawa Ziolkowska, of the Union of Labor [UP],  thinks.    Would the president be empowered to dissolve the parliament  if the Sejm failed to overrule his veto on the budget?  Provisions of the Small Constitution confirm yet again that the  document is not specific enough. Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, of the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], fears that one could make the  interpretation that the president could indeed dissolve the  parliament. But the view prevails that the parliament enacted  the budget, and it did so within the three-month period required  by the Constitution. Andrzej Potocki, of the Democratic Union  [UD], even says that the Sejm could readopt the same version of  the budget within about a dozen days.  <H5>  Dangers It Can Cause </H5>   "The president will not accomplish anything by vetoing the  budget. It will practically have zero impact on the domestic  situation because the Constitution provides that, if there is no  adopted budget law, the government acts on the basis of what it  had itself submitted before, which in this case means the budget  that was adopted and later vetoed," Sejm Deputy Ziolkowska says.  But she also adds that lack of a budget law "will cause external  destabilization. Our foreign creditors have agreed to reduce  our debts mainly because of the solutions contained in the  budget."    Sejm Speaker Oleksy, among others, has a different view: "A  delay in the signing of the budget law prevents financial means  from flowing down from the central budget to those institutions  that are financed by that budget. If the president does not  sign the budget law, an unstable situation will be created  `completely unnecessarily.'"    We asked Elzbieta Suchocka, a director at the Finance  Ministry, to explain the issue. In her view, in a situation  where the law was adopted by the Sejm but was not published in  DZIENNIK USTAW [official publication with final versions of laws  adopted by parliament and signed by the president] (due to a  delay in the president's signing or lack of a signature), the  law's status is the same as that of a draft law, which means it  exists in effect but with one important proviso: There are  authorizations contained in the budget law for the Council of  Ministers to issue executory legal acts. The government is not  authorized to issue such acts without a law. So it would not be  possible, for instance, to issue bonds (which are one of the  sources of financing the budget deficit) or to devote reserves  from centrally financed projects to gminas [small administrative  units] endangered by unemployment. There would also be problems  with agricultural credits.  <H5>  What Will Happen </H5>   According to our estimates, it is almost certain that a  presidential veto, if it did occur, would be overruled. A  two-thirds majority vote is required for that. The SLD  coalition does not have such a majority; it is nine votes short  of the 307 required. As UP's Wieslawa Ziolkowska told us, she  will make efforts to have the UP Sejm Deputies Club vote in  favor of overruling the veto. Even though UP voted against the  budget during the Sejm vote, "these are two separate votings."  The government would operate under the "old budget" anyway, but  it would cause effects outside of Poland. UD still does not  know how it will vote, and its Sejm deputies "would have to  consider the issue."</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / A year of living patiently: Disappointment is the watchword for most international investors It has been so far a year of frustration and dashed hopes for the world's leading stock and bond markets. Anticipated declines in interest rates have by and large failed to happen and predicted profit recoveries have mostly proved illusory. Sharp movements have, however, been rare. True, the Tokyo stock market has taken a well-deserved further dive, and Hong Kong has soared. But elsewhere the ups and downs of equity markets have been within a fairly narrow range, and the same is true of bond markets. Now some more optimistic investors are wondering whether the delayed upturn will begin to come through in the second half of the year. But it is probably true to say that the predominant mood is one of mild apprehension, as significant elements of the global economy continue to puzzle the economic pundits and investors worry that Wall Street, after a lengthy tightrope walk, will eventually lose its balance and take a tumble. At the beginning of the year there were grounds for being bullish. After the economic slowdown of 1991, when growth of the 24 member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-ordination and Development averaged only 1 per cent, inflation and interest rates were expected to fall. Meanwhile economic growth was forecast to pick up, creating plenty of scope for company profits to rise. To some extent this has worked out, but Europe has been held back by high interest rates arising from Germany's overheating problems, and the recovery in the US has been disappointingly sluggish. The OECD has just trimmed back its 1992 global growth estimate. The securities markets have been restrained by two particular factors. First, they have been buried by new issues of both stocks and bonds. Equity issues in the US, for instance, hit an all-time peak of Dollars 41.3bn in the first six months, and international bond issues reached Dollars 143bn. Second, the two biggest stock markets in the world, in the US and Japan, which at the start of 1992 represented some 70 per cent of global stock market value, simply appear to have been too pricey. Japan has embarked upon the second stage of the puncturing of its 1980s bubble market which had reached its maximum stage of overinflation at the end of 1989. The Nikkei average had already fallen from 39,000 to 23,000 in the first two years of the shake-out. Now it has fallen even further, to less than 16,000 at one stage in June. On Wall Street the popular impression has been of further progress, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting several new highs, culminating in an all-time peak of just over 3,400 at the beginning of last month. In fact the broader market indicators have moved sideways at best: the FT-Actuaries US Index of 522 leading stocks is slightly lower on the year so far (and has moved within a remarkably narrow range). To foreigners, Wall Street's performance looks still worse than this because the dollar has been edging lower. The dollar's slide, which has intensified in recent weeks, reflects the fall in short-term interest rates which has been the notable feature of US economic policy in the year so far. But long bond rates have actually been edging higher, boosted by the high pace of government borrowing. The recent cut in short rates to 3 per cent, the lowest figure for 29 years, has been associated by many investors more with desperation than with inspiration. Returns in the Japanese bond market have also been unexciting. The yield on Japanese government bonds, at less than 5 1/2 per cent, is already the lowest in any big national market. In Germany, usually the international investor's favourite for hard-currency investments, yields have been kept up at about 8 per cent by the weight of official borrowing, together with concerns about inflationary trends in the wake of unification. The German factor has dominated the European region, with an unexpected twist in early June when the Maastricht treaty was rejected by Danish voters. That brought an abrupt end to the 'convergence' phase which had brought disparate European national bond market yields closer together in anticipation of eventual monetary union. Some of the more financially marginal countries like Spain and Italy were hit hardest. Their bond yields jumped and Italy was even forced to raise its short-term rates by a percentage point last weekend. The UK was affected too, but overall the main factor influencing British markets has been the unexpected Tory victory in the April election. The impact has propelled the gilt-edged market to the very top of the international bond market performance table for the first half of the year. UK equities looked good at one stage, but they have suffered a serious setback since mid-May because of concern about fading economic recovery hopes. Equity investors have become subdued elsewhere too. There are worries that business activity is being suppressed by financial problems in the US and Japan and by the dampening impact of high D-Mark interest rates in Europe. At the start of 1992 there were hopes that D-Mark rates might be coming down, but few now expect them to move much before the end of the year. International investors seeking excitement have been driven out to the fringes: to Hong Kong, where the colony is thriving on the back of the quiet capitalist revolution in southern China, and to South America, where until last month emerging markets specialists were feeding eagerly on fragile bull markets in Argentine, Brazil and Colombia. However, last year's shooting star, Mexico, has been going backwards fast since the spring. After enjoying a decade of generous stock market returns in the 1980s, professional investors are concerned that more cautious strategies may be appropriate for the 1990s. Although foreigners keep hoping that Tokyo is close to the bottom, many have already burned their fingers badly by prematurely moving money back into Japanese stocks last year. There is a widespread fear that the Nikkei average may lurch down to 12,000 or even 10,000 before it finally bounces off the bottom. As for Wall Street, the torrent of retail money flowing into the stock market continues to perplex professional fund managers and undermine their concepts of how to price stocks. So-called 'value' managers complain that they have to go back to the notorious 'nifty fifty' days of 20 years ago to find stock market data on which their computer models will choke so badly. The reason is that many American savers have been stunned by seeing returns on certificates of deposit collapse this year to a dismal 3 per cent, and have transferred the money into bonds, stocks and mutual funds in search of a more acceptable return. Net new investment in stock mutual funds has been running at something like Dollars 7bn a month. US stock prices have therefore been pushed up beyond generally accepted fair value. The backward-looking price/earnings ratio on the best-known broad market index, the Standard and Poor's 500, stands at an amazing 28. It is true that analysts are expecting a huge earnings bounce this year, possibly as high as 50 per cent, partly reflecting the prevalence of one-off provisions against company earnings during the recession last year. But there is inevitably nervousness as a sluggish economic recovery casts doubts on whether that assumed profits surge can be achieved. And even if it happens on the calculated scale, the market would still look rather expensive in historical terms. The unusually high stock market ratings have caused corporate treasurers and new-issue promoters to rub their hands and generate the blizzard of new offerings, to the extent that in recent weeks the appetite of investors has finally appeared to be sated. This can be seen as the reduction of the US corporate sector's debt after the financial excesses of the late 1980s. It may also be interpreted as the eager exploitation by corporate America of an overvalued stock market. We are now in the often seasonally unexciting summer period, leading up to September and October which have sometimes produced panics and crashes in the past. Many national stock markets perform significantly worse in the second six months of the year. On the other hand November and December often produce good returns, as investors look forward optimistically to the scope for growth in the new year. A late rally could still turn 1992 from a tedious into an acceptable year for global investors. The bulls are focusing on the prospect of more rapid economic growth and at the same time generally lower inflation in 1993. The OECD projects that average real GDP growth will recover to 3 per cent and inflation edge down to 3.2 per cent. This environment would be good for bonds and even better for equities, which tend to move on to a higher valuation basis at times of low inflation. However, this story is getting a little shop-soiled. Mainstream economists seem to have little clue about what is going on in several leading countries: they have got the UK completely wrong and are hazy about what is going on in the US and Japan. Debt problems have to be worked out and are holding back the asset markets: apart from the stagnation in stocks, a more or less worldwide property crash has been going on. Meanwhile Wall Streeters face political uncertainties: they cannot yet be entirely confident that President George Bush will be re-elected in November, and Mr Ross Perot threatens to create waves that the stock market could find disturbing. As for the US economy, if recovery does come through strongly there might be a quick flip up in short rates, and a withdrawal of the retail money which has pushed the equity market to this year's highs. Alternatively, if the recovery fizzles out the earnings projections will be left high and dry and share prices would be vulnerable to a sharp setback. Too many countries are running excessive fiscal deficits. Without strong economic growth these will get even bigger; budgeted deficits of OECD countries for 1992 have jumped to 3.2 per cent of GDP against 2.4 per cent last year. To an extent this is good for certain kinds of investors, because the torrent of issues (the British government, for instance, now issues gilt-edged bonds in lumps of about Pounds 2.5bn at a time) is holding real long-term interest rates high. On the other hand private-sector activity is being damped down by the high cost of capital; share prices cannot be expected to show much strength in these circumstances. Securities markets have been held in a kind of uneasy equilibrium so far in 1992, and investors hoping for some action may continue to need patience.  ------------------------------------------ MARKET CHANGES SINCE START OF 1992 (%)  ------------------------------------------ Local currencies France            7.08 Germany           9.20 Italy           -10.07 Netherlands       7.30 Switzerland      13.27 UK                0.89 Australia        -0.20 Hong Kong        44.26 Japan           -25.25 US               -1.25  ------------------------------------------ Based on July 3, 1992 Source: FT-Actuaries World Indices  ------------------------------------------</p>

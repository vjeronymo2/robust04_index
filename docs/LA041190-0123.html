			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARENT OF DAILY NEWS LOSES $42.5 MILLION DURING YEAR  </P> <P> Cooke Media Group Inc., parent of the Daily News newspaper, lost $42.5 million  last year because of the company's heavy debt load and a $6-million operating  loss by the newspaper, according to a government filing.  </P> <P> The Daily News' operating loss -- the difference between revenue and day-to-day  expenses of running the newspaper, excluding such items as interest and taxes  -- was wider than the $2-million operating loss in 1988. The newspaper's  revenue climbed 8% to $113.6 million from $105.1 million.  </P> <P> The Woodland Hills-based company, owned by financier Jack Kent Cooke, owns  several cable-television systems in addition to the newspaper. Most of the  cable properties were acquired in 1987 for $1 billion, with mostly borrowed  funds.  </P> <P> Cooke is currently selling the cable systems piecemeal, and the company now  treats them as discontinued operations. That means Cooke Media's operating  results include only the Daily News' operations. However, interest costs on the  cable systems' debt and proceeds from sales of the cable properties are  included in the results.  </P> <P> Although Cooke Media's stock is privately held, part of its borrowings included  bonds sold to the public, and the company therefore must disclose its financial  results in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> Cooke Media's filing for 1989 showed that last year's loss was substantially  less than the $104.3 million it lost in 1988. That's because last year Cooke  Media had a $71-million gain from selling some of its cable properties.  </P> <P> Cooke Media has reported net losses totaling $226 million over the past three  years, largely because of its debt burden. But its properties have generated  sufficient cash flow to service the debt, and with the help of the cable sales,  the company cut its total long-term debt last year to $809.2 million from  $902.6 million.  </P> <P> Moreover, Cooke Media expects to sell all of its cable systems for about $1.6  billion, meaning that it likely could pay off the debt and still earn a profit  of about $300 million on its investment in cable.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Summary] "Dear friends: The Ninth National Assembly's  fifth session entered its 10th day today. The National Assembly  held group discussions in the morning and a plenary meeting in  the afternoon under the direction of National Assembly Vice  Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan to discuss the draft law on encouraging  investment at home."    This is the draft law that has been formulated over a long  period of time on the basis of ideas solicited from various  discussions, sectors, and the people.    "National Assembly deputies focussed their discussion on  issues such as the name of the law, its relationship with other  laws, enforcement of the law, forms of investment, measures to  protect investment projects, and state management on encouraging  investment and so forth."    Most deputies contend that it is necessary to promulgate the  law as soon as possible. They agreed that it should be called  the Law on Encouraging Investment at Home.    "Many deputies suggested that overseas Vietnamese who want  to  invest in Vietnam should not be treated as Vietnamese investors  at home. Other deputies, however, argued that to promote and  attract investment by overseas Vietnamese we should create  favorable conditions for them to invest in the country."    Many deputies also suggested that the law should encourage  afforestation projects, reduce or exempt taxes for investment  projects in areas with numerous difficulties or in regions  inhabited by ethnic minorities. Other deputies suggested that  to avoid inconvenience caused by paper work and negativism, the  law should clearly stipulate that people's committees of  provinces and municipalities directly subordinate to the central  government, are units authorized with the power to receive  applications of investors for consideration and forwarding to  agencies concerned for approval.    Tomorrow, 7 June, the National Assembly will continue its  work at the conference hall in Hanoi.</p>

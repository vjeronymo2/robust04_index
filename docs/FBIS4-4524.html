			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chong Pyong-chin from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] ROK and Japanese Foreign Ministers Han Sung-chu and  Tsutomu Hata held talks at the latter's office on the afternoon  of 3 April to discuss specific ways to cooperate in resolving  the North Korean nuclear issue now that a statement of the UN  Security Council's [UNSC] president has been adopted.    The two countries' foreign ministers shared the view that  North Korea should respond positively to the UNSC president's  statement no later than mid-April since the statement urges it  to allow additional inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] before the end of this month, and they  decided to cooperate in urging China to persuade North Korea.    Reminding his counterpart of the remark made by Japanese  Prime Minister Morihito Hosokawa during the recent ROK-Japanese  summit, that "Japan will join UN sanctions against North Korea  within the scope allowable by law," Minister Han requested that,  while continuing to make efforts for dialogue with North Korea,  Japan consider controlling its trade with North Korea,  restricting the amount of money being sent to North Korea by  Chochongnyon, a pro-Pyongyang association of Koreans in Japan,  and prohibiting North Korean ships from calling on Japanese  ports in case North Korea does not observe the UN statement.    Regarding Minister Han's request, Minister Hata said that he  would try to persuade North Korea to the utmost in cooperation  with China to denuclearize the Korean peninsula in a peaceful  way and that he would carefully consider the sanctions against  North Korea suggested by Minister Han.    On 4 April, Minister Han will also call on Prime Minister  Hosokawa to explain the ROK Government's position on the UNSC  president's statement and to discuss international cooperative  measures in preparation for the case in which North Korea,  despite the UN decision, does not allow the IAEA to conduct  additional inspections.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> UNITED WAY REACHES $5.6-MILLION GOAL  </P> <P> Ventura County United Way matched its $5.6-million 1989-90 campaign goal and  will continue to fund 64 local health and human-care agencies, United Way  officials announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> "This will ensure help for one out of every three people in the county who will  need counseling, guidance and emergency services through the United Way  agencies for another year," Charlie Lyons, United Way board president, said.  </P> <P> About 3,000 volunteers helped in the fund-raising campaign that began Sept. 15  and ended June 30.  </P> <P> About 76% of the money raised was through payroll deduction plans that are set  up in 99% of Ventura County businesses. The remainder was committed by  individuals, corporations and foundations, Sylvia Schnopp, United Way  spokeswoman, said.  </P> <P> "The employees contribute most of the money through their paychecks because  it's simple and painless," she said.  </P> <P> Local chapters of the American Red Cross, the American Cancer Society,  Interface: Children, Family Services and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Ventura  will receive the most money from the budget, Schnopp said.  </P> <P> The largest contribution came from the largest employer in the county, the  federal government. Employees contributed $763,555 to the organization,  $438,000 of which will go to local agencies and the rest will be distributed to  social service organizations around the country.  </P> <P> GTE Corp. workers gave the second largest employee contribution, $330,000.

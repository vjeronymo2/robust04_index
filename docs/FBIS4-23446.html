			<p>BFN     [Text] The Government of Chad has reported the merger of  450 rebels belonging to Moise Kete's National Awakening  Committee for Peace and Democracy in Chad [CSNPD] and the  National Recovery Council [CNR], which is based in the east of  the country. President Deby, who announced this at a cabinet  meeting on 2 June, directed the government to deal with these  mergers properly. Moise Kete's CSNPD southern rebels this  morning denied the report which, according to them, is intended  to undermine morale in the ranks of the CSNPD fighters, the  movement's spokesman declared.</p>

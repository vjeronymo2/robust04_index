			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Aerospace industry celebrates a silver lining: Andrew Baxter and Roland Adburgham assess reaction over the decision to order 25 Hercules aircraft Managers and unions in the British aerospace industry reacted with delight yesterday to the news that the UK would return to full membership of the European Future Large Aircraft programme. The decision more than offset disappointment in some quarters that Lockheed was awarded a Pounds 1bn contract for 25 C-130J Hercules II aircraft - the first step in the replacement of the Royal Air Force's 60-strong fleet of ageing Hercules transport aircraft. Even here there was good news for equipment suppliers which have won business from Lockheed. Sir Barry Duxbury, director of the Society of British Aerospace Companies, said: 'Companies across the UK aerospace industry will benefit immediately as suppliers to the C-130J.' As the head of one aerospace supplier said: 'The government seems to have made the right decision for once. They've found a way to please everyone.' The deal with Lockheed is estimated to secure 3,500 jobs in the UK well into the next century. But the government's decision to return to full membership of the FLA programme has a long-term significance that could safeguard or create thousands more. Sir Barry said: 'It assures the industry of the full commitment of the government to the FLA programme, which is of strategic importance to the future of the UK and European aerospace industries.' The government also announced that between 40 and 50 FLAs would be needed to complete the replacement of the old Hercules fleet and cover other possible air transport requirements. That, together with the commitment to the FLA programme, enabled British Aerospace to shrug off the defeat in its hard-fought battle with Lockheed. The UK company had offered a refurbishment programme to tide the RAF over until the FLA becomes available, which will not be until at least 2002. But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, concluded that refurbishment would provide poor value for money. In recent weeks BAe - sensing perhaps that it was losing its case for refurbishment - had been arguing strongly for Lockheed's contract to be limited to as few as 10 or 15 aircraft. Any higher number was seen as potentially damaging to UK participation in the planned FLA. The award of 25, therefore, looks at first glance like a blow for BAe's hopes. But, as it argued yesterday, the government's decisions on the FLA - and its stated requirement for 40 to 50 new aircraft - mean that the UK company looks set to obtain the share it was looking for from the programme. The decision to rejoin the FLA project will, therefore, help safeguard the future of BAe's plant at Filton, Bristol. The plant, which employs 4,500 people, designs and makes wing structures for the European Airbus. Without the FLA its 1,500-strong design team faced a six-year gap before the next generation of Airbus needs wing development. BAe's FLA project team of about 20 people is based at Filton. The company hopes the plant will undertake the wing development work for the FLA. But the decision on the FLA has implications that go beyond the defence field. BAe had feared that staying out of the programme would have caused it to lose its design leadership on wing technology to German industry. The aircraft's wings would have been designed and manufactured elsewhere, which in turn would have weakened BAe's position in the Airbus consortium when the next set of wings needs designing. Overall, the UK's decision to buy 40 to 50 FLAs could guarantee that the UK aerospace industry has a 20 per cent share in work for the programme. Not surprisingly, therefore, both Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive, and Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the AEEU engineering union welcomed the decision yesterday. It was 'tremendous news' for aerospace workers, said Mr Gallagher. Mr Evans said it was extremely welcome for jobs in this 'vital high-technology industry'. UK aerospace equipment suppliers were delighted by the award of the Lockheed order. As an offset, the US company has agreed to place Pounds 1bn of contracts with British companies, and at least 10 per cent of this will be related to the C-130J itself. The Ministry of Defence says about 36 UK companies will participate in the production of the Lockheed aircraft. Even before yesterday's announcement, several UK suppliers had won contracts from Lockheed, and pointed out the importance of winning business on an important 'launch order' for a new aircraft. Dorset-based Meggitt, for example, will win Dollars 5m (Pounds 3m) of business supplying equipment for the aircraft's engine housings, to be built by Westland. Meggitt is hoping to win other work directly from Lockheed, said Mr Ken Coates, its chairman. 'It's very important to be in at the start of a programme such as this.' Dowty, part of the TI Group, will supply propellers for the C-130J, made with the latest composite material technology. The deal safeguards 270 jobs at Dowty's propeller factory at Gloucester. Given the long timescales involved in the FLA programme, some immediate new business was welcome, it said. Rolls-Royce, the big aero-engine maker, said the decision on the FLA programme would make it easier for it to participate. But it should also benefit from the Lockheed order, because the engines for the C-130J are supplied by Allison Engine of the US, which Rolls-Royce is in the process of acquiring.</p>

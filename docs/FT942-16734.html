			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sharp gain at Sentry Farming Shares in Sentry Farming Group jumped 9p to 90p after the Suffolk-based company reported pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 334,000 to Pounds 786,000 in 1993. Turnover grew 22 per cent to Pounds 6.22m. USM-quoted Sentry attributed the result to an improved level of farming efficiency and an increase in acres farmed, together with the benefit of currency movements. Earnings per share advanced from 6.9p to 11.1p, while the dividend is stepped up to 2.25p (1.5p).</p>

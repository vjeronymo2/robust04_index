			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Candidates for Delors job court French support The competition to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission took an unexpected direction yesterday, with two leading candidates courting France in an effort to halt a Paris-Bonn bandwagon in favour of Mr Jean Luc-Dehaene, the Belgian premier. Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister, and Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, paid separate visits to Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, in a rare turn of public lobbying for a job which, in the past, has been settled through discreet diplomacy. After the meetings, a spokesman for Mr Balladur said that 'France was open to examining the merits of all candidates' for the Brussels job. 'The fact that both Mr Lubbers and Sir Leon are of high quality is flattering for the Commission.' France and Germany have made little effort to hide their preference for Mr Dehaene as a successor to Mr Delors, but French officials insisted that the two allies cannot pre-empt a decision that is scheduled to be made unanimously at the EU summit in Corfu on June 24-25. Mr Lubbers, the longest serving Dutch prime minister, stressed this week that the choice of a successor to Mr Delors lay 'not only with Bonn and Paris'. He appealed to other countries to make up their own minds. Sir Leon's camp reacted with enthusiasm to Mr Lubbers' determination to ignore the apparent Franco-German snub and stay in the race. Supporters calculate that this increases the chance of a deadlock at Corfu, opening the way for Sir Leon or the other long-shot candidate, Mr Peter Sutherland, the outgoing head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Next week campaigning is expected to intensify, with Sir Leon planning to visit Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister. Another crucial meeting takes place on Monday between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Felipe Gonzalez of Spain. Although Mr Gonzalez has pledged to support Mr Lubbers, a senior Spanish official said yesterday that the promise was made when Sir Leon was the only declared candidate. Europeandisarray has spread to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which now looks unlikely to reach agreement on a new secretary general at its annual ministerial meeting in Paris next week. With the UK, France and Germany all fielding rival candidates, European members of the OECD want more time to select a single European candidate.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Observer: Soldiering on France's President Mitterrand may be thinking about finding his successor, but Andreas Papandreou, Greece's ailing socialist prime minister, is making another stab at immortality.

Papandreou, 75, has been in poor health since having a double bypass in London in 1988. But this time he is too weak to travel. The operation is expected to take place early next year in Athens' gleaming new Onassis Cardiac Centre ' founded under the will of the late shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. Conveniently ' from the point of view of medical bills ' the Onassis hospital was incorporated into the Greek national health system by Papandreou a few years ago.</p>

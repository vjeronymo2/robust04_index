			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, </F> speaker of the House of Representatives, chairman of the Higher  Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and chieftain of the  Hashid tribes, by Hasin al-Bunyan in Riyadh; date not given]    [Text] Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of  the Yemeni House of Representatives, chairman of the Higher  Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], and chieftain of  the Hashid tribes, has described 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice  president and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP], as "a mutineer like the secessionist John Garang in  southern Sudan."    He said: "We are not bloodthirsty people, to say that in  this current war our aim is to demand the head of 'Ali Salim  al-Bid. It is our heads that the others want because we insist  on preserving the unity of the country."    [Al-Bunyan] But you insist on occupying Aden. Do you find  the way to Aden easy?    [Al-Ahmar] Who is insisting, and who fabricated and ignited  the war? And do you think the way to Sanaa is easy?    [Al-Bunyan] But how far will you take the war?    [Al-Ahmar] Until we destroy the mutiny, prevent secession,  preserve unity, and frustrate those who are banking on secession.    [Al-Bunyan] 'Ali Salim al-Bid says that he was the one who  worked for and accomplished unity.    [Al-Ahmar] No, he evaded Ceausescu's fate and sought unity  to save himself. So we said to him: Welcome.... After  submitting his demands to us, which he thought would achieve  secession for him, he fabricated and triggered the war to  achieve his objective.    [Al-Bunyan] What is his objective?    [Al-Ahmar] His objective behind the war is secession because  he failed to fulfill the old YSP ambition of ruling all Yemen  their way. Now they want to go back to ruling the southern and  eastern governorates which 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih left under their  control throughout the transitional period.    'Ali Salim al-Bid tried to separate the southern  governorates  [from the north] in order to revive the secession, ignite the  current war, and impose his terms which we had accepted for the  sake of unity. He had insisted on certain demands. When the  Pledge and Accord Document was achieved, he again brought up his  secessionist terms. When he failed he fabricated the war and  resorted to war because he thought that the Arab states and the  Arab League would intervene to stop the war and then he would be  able to impose secession.    [Al-Bunyan] Would you accept Arab mediation?    [Al-Ahmar] We had disagreements before the unity. Why did  the Arab states not try to send forces then, when we were two  states? Now we are one state and no force has any right to  intefere in the affairs of one state. This is an internal  Yemeni affair.    [Al-Bunyan] What are your conditions for stopping the war or  for the revival of the dialogue with the YSP?    [Al-Ahmar] Our condition is that there should be no  bargaining as far as preservation of unity, constitutional  legitimacy, and democracy are concerned, and, above all, the  mutiny must end.    [Al-Bunyan] But 'Ali Salim al-Bid rejects 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih's decisions dismissing him, al-'Attas, and some ministers.    [Al-Ahmar] He rejects them because he is a mutineer like  John Garang in southern Sudan. We indeed regard him as a rebel  against constitutional legitimacy. We had elected him as  Presidential Council member but he cannot act legitimately as  such and become a member before taking the oath which he and his  mutineering clique refused to do although the election results  were supported by the whole world.    [Al-Bunyan] Are 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's decisions legitimate  and constitutional?    [Al-Ahmar] Of course they are legitimate because he is the  head of state and supreme commander of the Armed Forces.    [Al-Bunyan] And is the head of 'Ali Salim al-Bid now the  target of this war?    [Al-Ahmar] No, we are not bloodthirsty like them. It seems  to me that it is they who want our heads because we insist on  preserving unity.    [Al-Bunyan] There are conflicting reports about the position  of the northern forces near Aden. What is the military  situation now?    [Al-Ahmar] That is a matter for the military.</p>

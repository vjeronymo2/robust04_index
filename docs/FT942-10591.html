			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Will the bait be tasty enough? - Ewen Macpherson asks whether venture capital trusts, launched last November, can encourage private investment in unlisted companies The UK government has high hopes for venture capital trusts. By creating 'conditions for new businesses to become established and for small businesses to grow', VCTs are seen as a key to cutting unemployment. The strategy - offering tax breaks to channel longer-term capital into unquoted companies - makes sense. Everyone accepts now that unquoted companies tend to create more jobs than quoted ones. But success depends on answers to two questions. Will the VCT rules attract investors to come up with the money? And will the money find its way to dynamic businesses? Of course, the viewpoints of investors and of managers of dynamic businesses are not always identical. There is a lot of squaring of the circle to be done before the VCT scheme, still at the discussion stage, takes final form. A strength of the VCT scheme is to draw on the skills of those with experience of investing longer-term capital in unlisted companies. First, however, there is a basic question to be asked about the pattern of shortage of longer-term capital. Ask an entrepreneur looking for Pounds 250,000 to set up a high-tech business, and he will tell you that capital is in very short supply. On the other hand, go to the managers of a substantial subsidiary company where there is going to be a management buy-out from a large industrial group and they may tell you that several venture capital companies are vying for the privilege of backing them. There is no case for tax concessions to attract investment to multi-million-pound buy-outs, which in the past decade have been a profitable market for the venture capital industry. The Inland Revenue's consultative document on VCTs addresses this point by suggesting a size restriction. VCTs would be allowed to invest only in companies with gross assets of less than, say, Pounds 10m. A Pounds 10m limit seems high if the aim is to help new and smaller companies. But one can see the government's reasoning. Allowing a trust to invest in fairly large as well as small companies might achieve a portfolio mix more attractive to investors. It can be argued that a better bait would be more substantial initial tax advantages for investors, rather than encouraging the trusts to move away from the core of the scheme - to provide funds for entrepreneurial businesses. A more appropriate limit on the size of eligible companies might be gross assets of Pounds 2m. But size is not the only issue. If the VCT scheme is to achieve its full potential for encouraging economic growth, those drafting the rules should recognise that there are two quite distinct categories of investment in the private equity market. One category finances growth - directly. This includes the funding of start-ups and provision of capital to fledgling businesses trying to get established. It also includes - though it is sometimes overlooked - the scope for investing in companies already established. They need capital to enable them to re-equip, enter new markets or expand in other ways, which often simply cannot be financed by overdrafts. Such growth calls for risk capital - the private company's equivalent of the quoted company's rights issue. The second category consists of investment in changes of ownership. This includes management buy-outs, management buy-ins and other restructuring operations. Restructuring - a feature of the 'enterprise revolution' of the 1980s - can bring about a valuable shakeout in the economy, but there is a significant difference between that and specific investment in immediate growth plans. Change of ownership represents a 'churning' of existing assets, and already there is enough capital chasing these deals. It could be stipulated as a condition of VCT status that the trust's portfolio should contain a majority of the first type of investment. There could be a minority of the second - 'churning' - type if the trust's managers wanted a more balanced portfolio. MBOs are perceived to be less of a risk, which is why they already attract so much investment. Arguably, though, the problem is not so much overall lack of capital as lack of demand. If small companies are held back for want of long-term capital, the reason sometimes seems to be that they are unaware that such capital exists - or that they are reluctant to use it. Directors of family businesses, for instance, may refuse to dilute their equity. If more of Britain's smaller companies strengthen their competitive edge by strengthening their balance sheets with capital from the VCTs, it could contribute significantly to job creation. But if VCT money goes largely to management buy-outs and buy-ins, the government will not get what it is hoping for. The author is chief executive of 3i Group plc.</p>

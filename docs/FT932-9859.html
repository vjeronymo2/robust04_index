			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Timetable for N-waste store is 'unrealistic' THE TIMETABLE for opening an underground store for nuclear waste at Sellafield in Cumbria was attacked as unrealistic by a government advisory committee yesterday. The radioactive waste management advisory committee's 13th annual report, published yesterday, said that 'disposal of radioactive waste is very unlikely to take place in the repository any earlier than 2010', more than three years after the target date. The vast underground caverns, to be constructed by UK Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste-disposal company, are intended to take up to 2m cubic metres of low- and medium-level waste from the UK's Magnox nuclear reactors and from British Nuclear Fuels' Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield - if the controversial plant is approved. The committee yesterday warned it might be difficult to find 'unequivocal evidence' of the proposed store's environmental safety because of the complexity of the geology and underground water flows near Sellafield. Nirex said yesterday: 'We have set a target that we believe is technically feasible, but it is conditional on factors not under our control, in-cluding ground conditions'. It added: 'We agree that the geological suitability of Sellafield is open to question. That is why we are spending such a lot of time and money investigating it.' Professor John Knill, the committee's chairman, repeated the committee's belief that there were 'no compelling waste management reasons' for a reprocessing plant such as Thorp. He questioned whether BNF's proposed policy of 'radioactive substitution' at Thorp would be environmentally neutral, as BNF claimed. BNF has reached informal agreements with Thorp's foreign customers to store permanently the low and medium-level waste from reprocessing their fuel, but to send back a 'radiological equivalent' of high-level waste. The pact is intended to reduce transportation costs. Prof Knill said: 'The full range of tests to prove that substitution is environmentally neutral has not been carried out - at least, we have asked for these tests but have not seen them.' Because different types of waste had different rates of decay substitution that was neutral at one time might not be at another, he said. BNF said yesterday it regarded substitution as environmentally neutral and had provided the committee with all the data it had requested.</p>

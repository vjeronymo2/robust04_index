			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUSTODY DECIDED FOR S.F. QUAKE ORPHAN;  </P> <P> COURTS: THE 10-MONTH-OLD BOY COULD WIN SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS IN A POTENTIAL  LAWSUIT AGAINST THE STATE. THE JUDGE SET ASIDE CLAIMS OF FOUR OTHER RELATIVES  AND AWARDED CUSTODY TO RANCHING COUPLE.  </P> <P> An Alameda Superior Court judge on Tuesday agreed to allow a 10-month-old boy  orphaned last October in the Bay Area earthquake to be raised on his second  cousin's cattle and hog ranch in the Central Valley.  </P> <P> Setting aside the claims of four other relatives, Superior Court Judge Roderic  Duncan decided to place the boy in the permanent custody of Arthur and Tonia  Lewis of Chowchilla, a small Madera County town. The complicated agreement,  which gives the other relatives visitation rights in alternate months, followed  a recommendation from social workers that the child be placed with the Lewises.  </P> <P> The boy, James Henry (Jimmy) Brown, was orphaned when a section of the  double-decked Nimitz Freeway collapsed on his teen-age parents. Jimmy, who was  riding in another car with his grandfather, was unharmed. Attorneys in the case  have said the child could win several million dollars in a potential lawsuit  against the state, which built the freeway section.  </P> <P> The bitterly fought custody case has become a cause celebre in the Bay Area,  where local TV stations and newspapers have provided extensive coverage.  </P> <P> The case began as a battle between two competing grandparents who claimed that  the other was unfit. Maternal grandmother Anita Williams and paternal  grandfather James Brown II accused each other of being interested only in  plundering the baby's potential future fortune.  </P> <P> But the judge surprised both grandparents and their attorneys on March 29 by  rejecting their claims and placing the child in the temporary custody of the  Lewises. The case was further complicated when custody petitions were submitted  by two other members of the Brown family -- Maj. Gerald Brown, the boy's  great-uncle, and paternal grandmother Vicki Reed, who is separated from her  husband, James Brown II.  </P> <P> In announcing his ruling, Duncan praised all parties for agreeing to the  arrangement. The relatives had a three-hour meeting earlier that morning to set  aside their differences.  </P> <P> "The families pulled back and realized that their personal wishes were not the  most important thing," the judge said. "Even someone who is 10 months old feels  the vibrations of that battle and will often bear the scars for years to come."  </P> <P> Arthur Lewis and the boy's attorney both said they hope that the child will now  be able to have a quiet, uneventful life.  </P> <P> "I think this is the best possible decision for my client," said Simone  Campbell, Jimmy's court-appointed attorney. "He won't have to see me or (the  courtroom) again for years."  </P></p>

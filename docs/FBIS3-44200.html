Can one talk about progress at  the talks?    [Dos Santos] No, I am not just consulted in this process  where a negotiated settlement to the conflict is sought. In my  capacity as president of the Republic and commander in chief of  the Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, I have a rather important  interventionist role to play. So I have intervened in the  process since its preparation stage. I have intervened in the  assessment of strategies and tactics. My intervention has also  had to do with the details of negotiation (?in Lusaka), the  observers, and so forth. So my intervention is rather  extensive. It could not have been otherwise (?if we are to end)  the war, which today affects all our lives. I believe there is  a solution. It may not happen as quickly as all Angolans of  good faith would wish, but UNITA has no other option than to  follow the path of reason now or some time from now.    [Reporter] Mr. President: At this stage, one can see that  the government is making efforts aimed at creating social  stability in government-controlled areas, particularly to help  resolve problems linked to the increasing cost of living. Mr.  President: How do you think the inflation rate can be brought  under control, and how can the country's productive sector be  reactivated?    [Dos Santos] Well, the government is studying the difficult  economic situation facing our country today. Those studies are  intended to help correct the macroeconomic imbalances that  emerged principally over the course of the last year. It is my  belief that, for as long as there is war, it will be very  difficult -- perhaps even impossible -- to satisfactorily  implement any government economic program aimed at a structural  readjustment that will correct those macroeconomic imbalances.  Basically, the circumstances [words indistinct] Angola's  conditions. (?There is a major war on). There is no movement  of people or goods. There is no transportation. There is  consumption [words indistinct] the armed forces. On the other  hand, there has been an increase in public spending and in the  General State Budget deficit. There is no...[pauses] perhaps  there is, but it will be extremely difficult to raise the fiscal  (?revenue and implement) a war tax or some other tax that will  help satisfy the needs prompted by war. In view of that, I  think that every measure we take will inevitably be a palliative  one lacking depth.    Obviously, [words indistinct] discussions by some of our  economists [words indistinct] basically, in a symposium, where,  I think, the great novelty was the proposal that a tax should be  introduced [words indistinct] and so forth. In our opinion,  though, we must first make a major effort to create areas of  relative political and military stability. Fundamentally [words  indistinct] relatively stable area where economic relations can  take place. If we manage that, then perhaps we will be able to  carry out a program to reduce the macroeconomic imbalances we  are experiencing today and to control inflation to a certain  extent. The government is making some studies, and I believe  that those studies aim precisely at creating those areas of  relative stability by means of a military effort and then by  achieving complete peace through a negotiated settlement.  Whether it be the one or the other, we would then proceed to  implement whatever economic programs we could to correct those  macroeconomic imbalances.    [Reporter] Mr. President: Angola has already felt the  effects of having joined the IMF. A report has come out saying  that the IMF recently reprimanded the Angolan Government. I  would like to ask: How have relations been between the Angolan  Government and the IMF?    [Dos Santos] There is constant dialogue between the  government and the IMF and between the government and the World  Bank. There are technical assistance programs under way,  notably in the areas of finance, the Central Bank, planning, and  so on. Obviously, there have been some differences. We are a  sovereign state. We had planned an economic recovery of some  three to four years, and those measures (?were) being discussed  with the IMF. We also started negotiating with the Paris Club  to have our foreign debt rescheduled, but then the situation in  Angola changed completely.</p>

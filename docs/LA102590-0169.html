			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FLASHBACK;  </P> <P> THIS WEEK IN COUNTY PREP SPORTS HISTORY  </P> <P> 10 YEARS AGO  </P> <P> It was not just another day at the beach for Santa Ana Valley Coach Jim O'Hara.  A week after quarterback Marvin Jones helped beat Santa Ana, 37-14, O'Hara  explained why Jones was his quarterback.  </P> <P> "We were at the beach two summers ago, and Marvin was throwing a football with  some friends," O'Hara said. "He could throw the ball 75 yards. Right then, I  decided to move him to quarterback."  </P> <P> O'Hara seemed to have a knack for identifying quarterbacks. Before the game,  Santa Ana Coach Tom Meiss tried to disguise the fact that his starter, Scott  Franklin, would not play; Meiss had another player wear Franklin's jersey  during warm ups.  </P> <P> O'Hara wasn't fooled.  </P> <P> "We had an idea Friday morning that Scott wasn't going to play," O'Hara said.  "To be honest, we didn't care who played quarterback."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5 YEARS AGO  </P> <P> Rule changes were giving offensive linemen a new way of playing -- a hands-on  approach -- and there were other, less-noticeable changes outside of the rules:  Knee braces were being used down the line.  </P> <P> Today, knee braces are common on the football field. But when Oakland Raider  trainer George Anderson introduced a brace to stabilize Ken Stabler's knee in  1979, the equipment was used solely for injured players.  </P> <P> By 1985, the braces were being used as preventive medicine. Edison Coach Bill  Workman made a team rule that all starting offensive lineman had to wear them  during practices and games.  </P> <P> But several studies and doctors didn't want the brace to be thought of as a  protective device.  </P> <P> "I know the American College of Sports Medicine came to the conclusion that  there is no reason why the knee brace should work," Workman said, "but the  practical application in four years at Edison is that they do work. We haven't  had a surgical knee operation here in four years."  </P> <P> Said Dr. Robert Cassidy of the Sports Medical Clinic of Orange County:  "Basically, the jury is still out. There are more players wearing them this  year, and we've certainly seen no difference in the number of knee injuries  that we treat at this office."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1 YEAR AGO  </P> <P> Better Late Than Never: Gary Bladow scored on a three-yard run with 1:53 left  to play and Shawn Porter out-jumped two El Modena defenders for a two-point  conversion pass from Jason Martian as Villa Park pulled out an 8-7 victory.  </P> <P> It's All Perspective: "We made him look pretty good, I think," Corona del Mar  Coach Dave Holland said of Tustin quarterback Andy Borza, who completed 11 of  14 passes for 183 yards and two touchdowns in a 24-7 victory over the Sea  Kings.  </P> <P> On a Roll: Estancia won its eighth consecutive game and remained unbeaten  behind the running of Josh Wojtkiewicz, who ran for a season-high 173 yards and  two touchdowns in 21 carries as Estancia defeated Newport Harbor, 28-10.  </P></p>

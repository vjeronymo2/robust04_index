			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Francis Briquemont, commander in  chief of the UN troops stationed in the war zone [in  Bosnia-Herzegovina], has strongly criticized the West's position  toward the war in Bosnia. In an interview with the news  magazine DER SPIEGEL, the Belgian general said he is tired of  listening to NATO's threats of air strikes on Serb positions.  Air strikes cannot solve the problems of the surrounded and  besieged towns and cities like Sarajevo. Permanent threats will  not make the warring parties more willing to make peace. The  West lacks a clear strategy. Too many opinions are being  expressed, too many resolutions passed, but not enough funds are  being made available to implement the political objectives.    The general, who will give up the supreme command of the UN  troops in former Yugoslavia earlier than scheduled, said the  Blue Helmets will therefore "soon be unable to continue to  provide humanitarian aid." Unless a peace plan is agreed  quickly, the Blue Helmet mission as a whole will need to be  questioned. Briquemont said literally: "It is an illusion to  believe that the UN troops can continue to provide humanitarian  aid indefinitely when shots continue to be fired at the same  time."    The article was prereleased in an edited version.</p>

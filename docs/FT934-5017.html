			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tax to maintain neutrality of pay in kind - Employers' loans The tax treatment of cheap and interest-free loans by employers is to change, with the aim of 'maintaining broad neutrality between the tax treatment of pay in cash and in kind,' the Inland Revenue said. The revenue stressed it intended that most season ticket loans provided by employers should continue to be exempt from tax, and gave details of an exemption scheme for smaller loans. It aimed to simplify legislation for taxing the benefit and to deal more fairly with loans to employees of banks and other lenders. The proposals, to take effect from April 6, are to change the rules for taxing this benefit to give effect to the restriction in mortgage interest relief; to replace the exemption for small benefits from loans with a new exemption for loans totalling up to Pounds 5,000; to exempt loans which employers provide to employees on the same terms as loans they make to the public; set new rate of interest for some foreign currency loans. The changes affect employees who currently pay tax on home loans provided by their employers and others with similar loans who have not paid tax on them (basic rate payers with home loans up to Pounds 30,000). The restriction in mortgage interest relief means basic rate taxpayers with a cheap or interest-free home loan of up to Pounds 30,000 provided by their employer should in effect pay tax on the benefit of the loan at the difference between the basic rate of tax (25 per cent) and the rate of mortgage interest relief (20 per cent for 1994-95). Higher rate taxpayers should pay at the difference between the higher rate (40 per cent) and the rate of mortgage interest relief (20 per cent). The revenue said existing legislation for taxing these loans could not easily be changed to give these results. The revenue said: 'The chancellor proposes to change the law so as to ensure employees with cheap or interest-free loans get tax relief on their loans in the same way as other borrowers.' There will be two distinct stages. First, the value for tax purposes of the loan will be calculated. This will be, as now, the difference between the interest (if any) paid by the employee and the interest would have been paid on the loan at the official rate of interest. This is a measure of the interest saved by the employee. It will be added to other income and taxed at marginal rate of tax. Second, the employee will get tax relief on the loan as if interest was paid at the official rate. Within the ceiling of Pounds 30,000, the employee will be entitled to mortgage interest relief on interest paid and on interest saved. The Inland Revenue will adjust PAYE codes in 1994-95. The rules will apply in the same way for 1995-96 with the proposal to restrict mortgage interest relief to 15 per cent. To avoid costs for employers, employees and the Inland Revenue in dealing with small loans, employer-provided loans are presently not taxed where the benefit does not exceed Pounds 300. The restriction of mortgage interest relief and the new rules for taxing this benefit would have resulted in many employees losing this exemption for small loans such as those to buy season tickets. The chancellor proposes to introduce a new exemption for small loans where: all the employee's cheap or interest-free loans total no more than Pounds 5,000, or all the employee's cheap or interest-free loans, excluding loans which qualify for tax relief, total no more than Pounds 5,000: eg, an employee with a cheap mortgage and an interest-free Pounds 2,000 loan to buy a season ticket will pay tax on the mortgage benefit but not on the season ticket loan. It is proposed to exempt loans made to employees on commercial terms by employers who lend to the general public where: the loans are made by an employer whose business includes the lending of money; loans are made to employees on the same terms and conditions as are available to members of the public; a substantial number of loans on those terms are made to public customers. The exemption will take effect from 1994-95 and apply to existing and new loans.</p>

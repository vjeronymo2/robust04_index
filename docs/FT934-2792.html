			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Trade ministers meet for last-ditch effort to settle Gatt differences Trade ministers from the four 'Quad' countries of the US, Japan, Canada and the European Union will meet in Geneva today and tomorrow in an attempt to settle outstanding disagreements on world trade reform before time runs out in the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations. It was uncertain last night whether there was enough room for compromise. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, who will be at the talks, said the odds had 'shifted in favour' of reaching a deal by the December 15 deadline but 'it's not in the bag'. Ministers will lend top-level authority to a virtual frenzy of talks between the 116 countries involved in the round, most of which must be finished by midnight on Sunday night. They will also give negotiators greater leeway to make difficult compromises at a time when lobbying pressure both in Geneva and in national capitals is intense. The main disputes that could still scupper the talks include US demands for dilution of proposed anti-dumping rules, and US threats to give unfettered access to its financial services market to only a small group of industrial countries. Mr Kantor said yesterday the US would not accept a pact that did not preserve US rights to retaliate unilaterally against 'dumping,', or selling goods below cost. On the European side, France is still digging in over US access to Europe's film and television markets. The two sides are still arguing over US threats to withdraw offers to liberalise shipping and port operations. Differences over a regime to control aircraft subsidies, plans to reconcile potential conflicts in trade and environment policies and the authority of a Multilateral Trade Organisation to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade appear to be closer to resolution. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director general, has set a Sunday deadline for completion of negotiations so that a final draft of the 450-page text of the Uruguay Round can be drawn up and translated by December 15, the deadline for the round. Intensive negotiations continued late into last night on all outstanding issues, with Japan facing immense pressure from the EU and the US to make new market-opening concessions following completion on Tuesday of a conditional US-EU market-opening package.

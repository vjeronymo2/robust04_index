			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Technology: Patents pack a costly punch To patent or not to patent? Inventors have asked themselves this question down the centuries. The earliest known patent of invention in England granted by Henry VI in 1449 gave John of Utynam a 20-year monopoly for a new method of making stained glass. Today's UK Patent Office, which also grants 20-year patents, was set up in 1883 and receives nearly 30,000 patent applications a year. As it points out, however, the existence of a patent is no indication that an invention has any merit or chance of selling. 'In fact, it may be easier to obtain a patent than to gain any commercial success for the invention it protects.' For most inventors, a patent will probably be the most positive result from all their efforts, since the success rate for inventions is very small. But it is an essential step if the new product has more than one application and can thus be licensed out to several companies for different uses. Apart from wanting to know whether or not to take out a patent, the hopeful inventor will also want to know the cost. Big companies, with their own patent experts and lawyers, will have enough expertise and experience to decide for themselves. But those working alone will need advice. The services of a patent agent can cost around Pounds 2,000. The agent will advise on the complex task of drawing up a description of the device or process so all possible applications and modifications are included. In some cases, especially where a process rather than a product is involved, it might be better to keep the invention a secret and rely on confidentiality agreements with partners to guard against copying. 'If you don't protect ideas, the chances are that the financial returns from innovation will be pretty slim,' says Ted Blake, the Patent Office's marketing services director. It costs Pounds 285 to obtain a patent - Pounds 25 for filing the initial application and Pounds 130 each for search and examination to check that the idea is new and meets legal requirements. Annual renewal from five years after filing costs Pounds 110. While this may not seem high, the costs can mount steeply when patents are taken out abroad. Since there is no such thing as a world patent, foreign protection has to be obtained by individual country filings, through the European Patent Convention (offering protection in 17 countries with a single filing), or under the Patent Co-operation Treaty, covering 59 countries. Mike Watson, the inventor of a cable coupling transformer which has been licensed by two companies, has spent some Pounds 25,000 on UK and foreign patents, including agents' fees. The different patents for James Dyson's cyclone-technology vacuum cleaner have cost around Pounds 750,000, with nearly Pounds 100,000 in annual renewal costs. Time is also an important factor. 'For very fast-moving products, the patent system is too ponderous,' says one patent agent. It may be better simply to get the product on to the market before it is overtaken by consumer taste, fashion, or the sheer speed of technological development. A significant aspect of patents is their deterrent effect. 'The right to sue someone (for infringement) can be a very valuable right in the commercial world,' the agent adds. This is especially true in the highly litigious US, where patents are often tested severely in court - either to browbeat potential competitors or as a softening up process before negotiation. Insurance can be taken out against lawsuits, but this tends to be costly. Ian Harvey, chief executive of British Technology Group, stresses the importance of policing patents. It obtained Dollars 6m (Pounds 4m) in an out-of-court settlement from the US government over the Pentagon's infringement of patents for the Hovercraft. The case cost BTG more than Pounds 1m to bring and was settled in less than five years; some US cases can take as long as 20 years. When sizeable markets and revenues are at stake, says Harvey, 'you have to have deep pockets and be seen to be willing to defend your patents'.</p>

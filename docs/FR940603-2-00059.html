Approximately $350,000 is available in FY 1994 to support this project. It is expected that the award will be made on or about September 25, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a 5-year project period. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to assist, collaboratively with NAPWA, in strengthening effective HIV/AIDS prevention education programs at all levels throughout the United States and its territories; to prevent HIV transmission and effect, maintain, measure, and evaluate behavioral change among individuals whose behavior places them at risk of HIV infection; to increase access to prevention and early intervention services for HIV-infected persons in order to reduce risks of further transmission and to maintain the health of asymptomatic clients; and to increase collaboration and support among agencies, organizations, groups, and constituencies providing HIV prevention services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CDC will collaborate in providing consultation and technical assistance in planning, operating, and evaluating program activities. Specifically, CDC will work with NAPWA to: (1) Facilitate collaboration with State and local health departments and other national and community organizations to reach persons most at risk for HIV infection; (2) assist in the identification of HIV prevention education programs, policies, practices, and procedures that have been demonstrated to be effective; (3) facilitate efforts in the provision of technical assistance and training to organizations that are involved in HIV prevention community planning; (4) assist with the development of plans to evaluate all program activities and to interpret evaluation findings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, Palestinian </F> representative, by Jordan TV correspondent for political affairs  Kassab Samawi in Amman on 4 January -- recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-al-Rahim] I am confident that the  [Jordanian-Palestinian] talks, which will be held tomorrow, will  further reinforce coordination. The Palestinian leadership and  the PLO Executive Committee have instructed the delegation to  act in a way that serves and reinforces the interests of both  sisterly peoples. There is no doubt that we do not want to see  any crack in the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. In fact,  we are keen to further strengthen this relationship,  particularly at this time, during which Israeli is trying to  evade its commitments to the peace process.    The Palestinian leadership noted, in its recent meeting,  that  coordination with Jordan is inevitable and necessary.    [Samawi] Your Excellency the Ambassador, his majesty the  king  reiterated in his recent speech the special nature of the  Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. In light of the  inevitability of coordination in this stage on the highest  levels, how did the Palestinian leadership in Tunis receive the  king's speech?    ['Abd-al-Rahim] The Palestinian leadership discussed his  majesty's speech in its recent meeting. It read the bright side  of the speech, which expressed concern for holding coordination  with the PLO, for crystallizing the independent national  Palestinian identity, and for highlighting the PLO's role. It  also highlighted the national Jordanian concern for reinforcing  coordination in all fields to serve the Palestinian people's  steadfastness and to ease their suffering inside the occupied  Arab territory.    Therefore, we received the speech differently from the way  others seem to have received it. We made a sound assessment of  its content. We found that, as in the recent meeting and before  that, his majesty has kept his pledge and was concerned about  all these objectives. This strengthens our negotiating stand in  this stage in which Israel is trying to weaken our negotiating  stand.</p>

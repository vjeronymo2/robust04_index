			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GRAF STRUGGLES TO STRAIGHT-SET WIN OVER MCNEIL  </P> <P> Steffi Graf struggled before ousting Lori McNeil Thursday in the third round of  the Player's Challenge Canadian Open at Montreal.  </P> <P> Graf won, 7-5, 6-3, the first time in five meetings she had beaten McNeil in  straight sets.  </P> <P> Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina and Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria, seeded second  and third behind Graf, had much easier times advancing.  </P> <P> Sabatini lost the opening game to Raffaella Reggi of Italy before winning the  next 12 for a 6-1, 6-0 win, and Maleeva defeated New Zealand's Julie  Richardson, 6-0, 6-0, at the hardcourt event at Jarry Stadium.  </P> <P> Fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva, Katerina's older sister, defeated Helen Kelesi  of Canada, 6-3, 2-6, 6-3, and fifth-seeded Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union  disposed of Britain's Jo Durie, 6-4, 6-2.  </P> <P> Martin Wostenholme launched a pair of decisive passing shots to gain an 11th  game service break to take a 7-5, 6-1 victory over Paul Annacone in  second-round play at the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships Thursday at Brookline,  Mass.  </P> <P> "I wasn't very sharp," said Annancone. "When I came to the net at five-all, he  hit a couple of good passing shots to break my service and I never could get  back into the match."  </P> <P> Of the 27-year-old Wostenholme, Annacone said: "He runs real well and returns  shots that you'd think were unreturnable."  </P> <P> David Wheaton withdrew after aggravating a hip injury suffered last week in  Toronto.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Boris Becker and local favorites Thomas Muster and Horst Skoff  scored victories and advanced to the quarterfinals of the Austrian Open in  Kitzbuehel, Austria.  </P> <P> Becker played unevenly but managed to oust Sweden's David Engel, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0.  </P> <P> Muster, seeded fourth, beat Marian Vajda of Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 6-0, and will  face Skoff in the quarterfinals. The sixth-seeded Skoff beat Spain's Tomas  Carbonell, 6-2, 6-0.  </P> <P> A third Austrian, 10th-seeded Anton Antonitsch, was beaten by Czechoslovakia's  Karel Novacek, 6-3, 6-7 (7-4), 6-4.  </P></p>

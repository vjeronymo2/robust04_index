			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW / L.A. FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> SALUTE CAPTURES ENERGY OF FESTIVAL  </P> <P> "A Salute to the Los Angeles Festival" at the Hollywood Bowl Thursday evening  proved in many ways a paradigm for the festival, of which it was a part.  </P> <P> The premiere of a silent color film by festival director Peter Sellars,  updating "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" and inspired by John Adams'  "Harmonielehre," dropped off the program almost as soon as it was announced.  </P> <P> As a replacement, Sellars served up the original silent classic, and preserved  "Harmonielehre" -- played by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by David  Alan Miller -- as the accompaniment.  </P> <P> Through the drastic, musically destructive expedient of repeating the first  movement of "Harmonielehre" between the second and third, Sellars made sight  and sound fit, at least loosely. He also had to tinker with the pacing of the  film.  </P> <P> The music, however, suffered. German Expressionism is the tie that binds here,  but reduction to accompaniment brought the mechanistic elements in  "Harmonielehre" to the fore, and the radical restructuring made no more sense  than would repeating the first movement of the "Eroica," for example, after the  Funeral March.  </P> <P> Miller and Co. did not advance the cause with their often imprecise  performance. Brass and percussion parts came through with pertinent vigor, but  many of the strings seemed to settle for rough approximations.  </P> <P> Eleanor Academia-Magda's explanation of the ensemble from her World Kulintang  Institute touched on some of the same ideas that Adams expressed in the printed  program, and the music had clear links to minimalism.  </P> <P> The five-member ensemble from the Reseda-based institute gave a lively,  awkwardly amplified introduction to the kulintang, sort of a Philippine  gamelan. Like gamelan, the kulintang seems to have two primary, intervallicaly  spicy melodic modes, each requiring a different set of gongs. The short,  unannounced pieces on this survey were largely up-tempo numbers, delivered in  keenly articulated rhythmic layers with flair and precision.  </P> <P> With a traditionally oriented and carefully paced powerhouse gospel set, the  F.A.M.E. Freedom Choir gave yet another dimension to harmony.  </P> <P> Led by Joe Westmoreland -- with the spirited assistance of Rickey Grundy and  Charles May, and a dynamic, often incomprehensible set of soloists featuring  the fiercely soaring male soprano of Dwayne Knox -- the chorus provided full,  unfettered vocalism.  </P></p>

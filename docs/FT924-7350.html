			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Top Lautro official may resign over investor protection A SENIOR OFFICIAL at the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry has said she would resign rather than work for the Personal Investment Authority which is to replace it because she said the new body will not take sufficient account of consumer interests. Ms Julia Leisching, chief policy and administration officer at Lautro, said in a letter yesterday to Mr Kit Jebbens, Lautro's chief executive: 'I can have no belief in or commitment to the goals of the PIA.' In her letter, Ms Leisching, who joined Lautro at its inception in 1988 from the Department of Trade and Industry's Insolvency Service, offered to resign. Ms Leisching said: 'I feel in the context of PIA that there is a grave risk that what should be the main agenda item, investor protection, is being marginalised by the interests of the various industry groups.' The PIA has been proposed as a self-regulatory body which would incorporate members of Lautro as well as two other self-regulatory bodies - Fimbra, which groups independent financial advisers, and some members of Imro, the fund managers' body. Debate has so far centred on how the PIA should be structured to ensure that all those it is designed to regulate join. Life insurance industry members of Lautro insist the PIA should also regulate the financial services arms of banks and building societies, which are now directly regulated by the Securities and Investments Board. Ms Leisching believes the creation of the PIA was forced by the inability of Fimbra members to pay for the cost of policing themselves adequately or their share of claims against the Investors Compensation Scheme. She said she could see little point in reordering the self-regulatory system to preserve a section of the industry that too often served consumers badly. 'Everyone knows that there is an oversupply of people in the industry and that too many poor quality tied agents were signed up,' she said.</p>

That it is laid down that the revenue of the Russian  Federation republic budget in 1994 is formed by:    value-added tax;    tax on the profit of enterprises and organizations;    excise duty on petroleum, gas, coal, spirits, vodka,  liqueurs, automobiles, and goods imported onto the territory of  the Russian Federation;    income from foreign economic activity;    income tax from individuals (at a rate of 1 percent);    deductions (taxes) on the reproduction, protection, and  defense of forests;    deductions on the reproduction of the mineral and raw  materials base, with the exception of deductions which,  according to the established procedure, remain under the control  of mining enterprises that independently finance geological  exploration work;    payments for the right to use natural resources;    tax on transactions involving securities, specifically  payments for the registration in the Russian Federation Ministry  of Finance of prospectuses on the emission of securities, and  also payments on deals made using securities;    income from the privatization of federal property, dividends  from shares belonging to the state, and income from the  commercial use of state property by enterprises, institutions,  and organizations;    money from land tax and rent for agricultural land paid into  the Russian Federation republic budget by national-state and  administrative-territorial formations for the financing of  centralized measures;    the state duty on cases examined by arbitration courts;    other taxes, duties, and payments determined by Russian  Federation legislation.    2. That the following are consolidated in the Russian  Federation republic budget: all non-budget state funds, whose  revenue is formed by compulsory payments by enterprises,  institutions, and organizations with the exception of the  Russian Federation Pension Fund, the Social Insurance Fund, and  the Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund, preserving the targeted  orientation of the consolidated funds.    The organs of state power of the components of the Russian  Federation are recommended to consolidate similar non-budget  regional funds within the budgets of national-state and  administrative-territorial formations.    3. That the channeling of excise received from the sale of  automobiles for citizens' personal use into the revenue of the  Russian Federation Federal Road Fund is discontinued. The  Russian Federation Council of Ministers-Government is to  introduce into the established procedure proposals on  compensation for losses in the revenue of the Russian Federation  Federal Road Fund.    4. That it is laid down that decisions of the federal organs  of power adopted after 1 January 1994 which lead to an increase  in expenditure in the budgets of national-state and  administrative-territorial formations are of a recommendatory  nature. The implementation of such decisions is carried out on  the basis of individual decisions of the governments of  republics within the Russian Federation and the administrations  of krays, oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and  the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, out of and within the  limits of the revenues of their own respective budgets.    5. That it is laid down that income tax receipts from  individuals which constitute the difference between the tax  rates established by the Edict of the Russian Federation  President dated 11 December 1993 No. 2129 "On the Regulation of  Certain Questions of the Taxation of Individuals," and the part  subject to inclusion in federal budget revenue are included in  the revenue of the budgets of national-state and  administrative-territorial formations.    6. That the Russian Federation Council of  Ministers-Government is permitted to transfer the following  revenues from federal taxation to the budgets of components of  the Russian Federation:    50 percent of the total income from excise on spirits,  vodka,  and liqueurs, with the exception of excise on goods of this type  imported onto the territory of Russia;    100 percent of the total income from other excise with the  exception of excise on petroleum, gas, coal, automobiles, and  goods imported onto the territory of Russia;    25 percent of the total income from value-added tax with the  exception of the value-added tax on goods imported onto the  territory of Russia, precious metals, and precious stones  deposited in the Russian Federation State fund and released from  it;    payments for the right to use natural resources according to  the norms established by legislation;    the payment of taxes on operations involving securities,  specifically payments for the registration of prospectuses for  the emission of securities in the localities.    7. That it is laid down that additional taxes and duties in  republics within the Russian Federation, krays, oblasts, the  autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and the cities of Moscow  and St. Petersburg and additional local taxes and duties not  stipulated by Russian Federation legislation may be introduced  by decisions of organs of state power of components of the  Russian Federation and local organs of state power. The payment  of these taxes by legal entities should be effected out of the  profit remaining to enterprises and organizations following the  payment of income tax.    8. That a financial support fund is to be organized for the  regions within the Russian Federation republic budget for 1994.    The Russian Federation Council of Ministers-Government is to  ratify by 15 February 1994, following coordination with  components of the Russian Federation, and implement as of the  second quarter of 1994 the procedure for the formation and use  of the aforementioned fund, which envisages common rules for the  determination of the scale of financial support to the regions  and the establishment of the direct dependence between the size  of the aforesaid fund and the revenue of the Russian Federation  republic budget.    9. That the Russian Federation Council of  Ministers-Government is to prepare proposals on changing the  Russian Federation budget and tax legislation which follow on  from the provisions of the present edict and to implement these  in the first quarter of 1994 in the Russian Federation Federal  Assembly.    10. That the present edict is to be submitted for  examination by the Russian Federation Federal Assembly.    11. That the present edict enters into force as of the  second quarter of 1994 unless a different one is adopted by the  Russian Federation Federal Assembly.    [Signed] Russian Federation President B.

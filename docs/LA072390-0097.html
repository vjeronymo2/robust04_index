			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH BOB;  </P> <P> MAN VS. MICROCHIP  </P> <P> Well, this is it, the final day of the Hollywood Park meeting. If I don't catch  SURELOCK today, I wish it well at Del Mar.  </P> <P> I lost $60 Sunday when only Paisano Pete among by triple horses won. I'll close  out today with $100 exactas on Bright And Right to Oh Dat Fox and Frontline  Fable in the third race.  </P> <P> Bob's Sunday Bankroll: $1,281  </P> <P> Sunday's Loss: $60  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,221  </P> <P> SURELOCK made a $24 profit when its win/place pick in the 10th race, Hot and  Smoggy, finished second and paid $5.20.  </P> <P> SURELOCK is, of course, incapable of making hunch bets. But the computer's  prediction in the last race on the last day at Hollywood Park is Final  Forecast, upon which it will bet $40 to win and $40 to place.  </P> <P> Computer's Sun. Bankroll: $1,720.50  </P> <P> Sunday's Profit: $24  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,744.50  </P></p>

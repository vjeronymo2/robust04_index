			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Gill hits back over payment MR KEN GILL, who retired last week as general secretary of MSF, the general technical union, yesterday hit back at critics who accused him of hypocrisy by accepting a lump-sum leaving payment of more than Pounds 50,000 on top of his pension of two thirds of his final salary of Pounds 55,000. Several other union leaders have recently received even more generous pay-offs, sometimes related to leaving early, and usually as a result of generous clauses for officials in union merger agreements. Mr Gill, a former chairman of the TUC's equal rights committee, said the payment to him was based on a formula of 1.5 per cent of salary for every year's service which applied 'to all staff and officials of MSF'. When the union was formed out of the merger of ASTMS, the white-collar union and Tass the technical union, in 1988, all Tass staff - plus Mr Gill the general secretary - received the superior benefits enjoyed by ASTMS, including the leaving payment formula.</p>

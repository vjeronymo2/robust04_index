			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD;  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS ENDORSE UTILITY TAX INCREASE  </P> <P> The Oxnard Firefighters Assn. has endorsed a ballot measure that would increase  utility taxes by 5% in an effort to prevent personnel cuts in the Fire  Department.  </P> <P> The endorsement for Measure C, which will appear on the June 5 ballot, follows  a similar endorsement by the Oxnard Peace Officers Assn.  </P> <P> Unless voters approve the measure, which would add about $5 million annually to  Oxnard's coffers, the Oxnard City Council will consider cutting eight  firefighting jobs and 27 positions in the Police Department.  </P> <P> Other departments face similar budget reductions as Oxnard tries to offset a  $2.7-million deficit brought on primarily by several unexpected expenditures,  including a $690,000 increase in the cost of the city's workers' compensation  program.  </P> <P> The tax would cost the average household about $4 per month.

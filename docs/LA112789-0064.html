			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAG TRADE FLEES TO SUBURBS;  </P> <P> HIGH COST OF L.A. PLANT SPACE IS DRIVING MANY GARMENT MANUFACTURERS TO CITIES  SUCH AS VERNON  </P> <P> When Bethlehem Steel closed its plant in Vernon in 1982, it was widely  acknowledged to be a major sign of the decline of heavy manufacturing in  communities located just southeast of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The plant closing was a special blow to Vernon, which borders Los Angeles along  Alameda and 25th streets. After all, Vernon was founded in 1905 solely to  foster industry, and the city's administrators have long held high the  community's motto -- "Exclusively Industrial."  </P> <P> Responding to the steel plant closing and the shutdown of other heavy  manufacturing operations, Vernon's administrators stepped up efforts to lure  garment makers and other firm involved in light manufacturing.  </P> <P> Vernon had only about 20 garment firms in the wake of the Bethlehem Steel  closing. However, leasing agents at real estate firms considered Vernon's  proximity to Los Angeles' burgeoning garment industry to be a selling point.  Seeing an opportunity, agents began to lead some fashioners of cloth to wide  open spaces in Vernon.  </P> <P> What has happened since is a riches-in-rags story. Vernon now has more than 100  garment industry firms, an increase of about 400% since 1983. Garment makers  have brought at least 10,000 new jobs along with their stitching machines over  that six-year period, a significant increase in a city with only about 45,000  private sector jobs.  </P> <P> Acknowledging this initial movement and citing economic factors such as the  rising cost of land in downtown Los Angeles, industry analysts and real estate  mavens are now predicting that larger numbers of clothing manufacturers will  head to small communities immediately south of Los Angeles. Some industry  observers, noting that the face of downtown is changing, forecast even more  change in the future.  </P> <P> Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, is  among those monitoring the changes. Kyser says manufacturers of garments and  the contractors that help assemble clothing are willing to consider a move to  Vernon because it is close to the garment district in downtown Los Angeles and  near the home of many garment workers -- communities such as East Los Angeles,  Huntington Park and Southgate.  </P> <P> "We've been tracking this for two or three years and we're seeing a definite  movement to Vernon and the City of Commerce," Kyser said. "Over the next 10  years we will see more changes as they (apparel producers) . . . continue to  slide south."  </P> <P> In a recently published study of the migration, Kyser concluded that many  clothing manufacturers are leaving the south and east edge of downtown Los  Angeles. Clothing makers with operations in those areas accounted for 42% of  the total garment-related employment in Los Angeles County in 1986, compared to  a 48% share in 1984, according to the study. As of 1986, there were a total of  36,643 garment workers in those parts of the downtown area, the study said.  </P> <P> As part of an effort to lure more garment industry firms to Vernon, one  developer -- Trammell Crow Co. -- last month opened a new industrial park  there. The $38-million facility, dubbed Vernon Business Park, contains 14  buildings and about 670,000 square feet of industrial space.  </P> <P> Developers are willing to build projects in Vernon and target the garment  industry because some garment company executives now feel they do not have to  operate in the heart of Los Angeles' garment district to be successful, said  Christopher Ludeman, a senior sales consultant in the commercial real estate  division at the Los Angeles offices of Coldwell Banker. Traditionally, garment  makers have been concentrated in an area bordered by Jefferson Boulevard on the  south, Grand Avenue on the west, 8th Street on the north and by the  intersection of Alameda Street and Washington Boulevard on the east.  </P> <P> "Nine years ago, garment makers wouldn't consider going beyond Washington  Boulevard," Ludeman said. "They were afraid to get away from the core of the  garment district."  </P> <P> The increasingly popular Vernon landscape is a relatively treeless sprawl of  square buildings with an obvious major asset -- space.  </P> <P> For Anthony Jeremiah, secretary-treasurer at Swede Sportswear, space was an  important consideration. Swede, which produces women's sportswear, had been  based on Maple Avenue, between Pico Boulevard and 12th Street in the garment  district, for more than 30 years before moving to several locations in and near  Vernon over the last three years.  </P> <P> Jeremiah said the company no longer felt bound to the downtown location when it  obtained a showroom in CaliforniaMart, an apparel exhibition center that brings  together clothing-buying executives from retail stores and local garment  producers. CaliforniaMart, completed in 1964 and located on Los Angeles Street,  between Olympic Boulevard and 9th Street, has been expanding for the past two  decades. Groundbreaking for construction of a 1-million-square-foot annex, a  building for menswear, is scheduled for early 1990.  </P> <P> "Companies have stayed in the garment district partly because it was convenient  for buyers (for retail stores) to quickly would visit various manufacturers,"  Swede explained. "With the success (of CaliforniaMart), manufacturers don't  have to be located in one area."  </P> <P> Jeremiah said the company decided to opt for cheaper space in the Vernon area  partly because his operation was being pinched by the growth of retailing --  some of it at outdoor stands -- near his former location.  </P> <P> "The sidewalks are jammed with merchandise," he said. "Parking was a problem.  Between the parking problem and the heavy traffic, we felt squeezed."  </P> <P> Analysts at the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce have also detected  changes. For example, they cite the transformation of the Cooper Building at  860 S. Los Angeles St.; once a center of garment making, the Cooper Building  became a clothing retail center by the early 1980s. Santee Street near Olympic  Boulevard is another notable example, observers say. Retailers set up shop  along Santee several years ago and now operate cheek-by-jowl with clothing  manufacturers.  </P> <P> As garment retailers envelop areas once considered manufacturing preserves, the  competition for space heats up, according to real estate analysts. Analysts  also say demand for space in the garment district has increased because  apparel-making -- the industry in Los Angeles County generates $6 billion in  annual sales -- has grown steadily. There are about 3,000 garment makers in Los  Angeles County and an equal number of contractors in the county. In contrast,  there were about 2,400 manufacturers and about the same number of clothing  contractors in the county in 1982, according to state records.  </P> <P> The demand has contributed to rising rents downtown, according to Coldwell  Banker. On a monthly basis, downtown space rents for 45 cents to 64 cents per  square foot per month, compared to 36 cents to 38 cents per square foot in  Vernon and 36 cents to 40 cents per square foot in the neighboring City of  Commerce, the company said. Property sells for $30 to $100 per square foot in  downtown Los Angeles, compared to $15 to $18 per square foot in Vernon and $15  to $20 per square foot in Commerce, according to Coldwell Banker.  </P> <P> For Bernard Lax, president of Louie Bernard Inc., the cost of space was a major  factor in the decision to move from Los Angeles to Vernon.  </P> <P> "The square foot price for garment manufacturing space (in Los Angeles) has  become prohibitive," said Lax, who produces women's sportswear and clothing for  boys and girls.  </P> <P> Lax, who relocated in 1987, said he was initially reluctant to move.  </P> <P> However, many garment company executives review the pros and cons of a move  from Los Angeles to neighboring communities like Vernon and decide to remain in  the garment district. For example, Monarch Knit &amp; Sportswear President  Sheldon Goldman shopped for space in areas southeast of Los Angeles and decided  to stay in the garment district. He said prices in those neighboring  communities have been rising rapidly.  </P> <P> "Prices are getting as high as in L.A.," Goldman said. "It's convenient here. I  live in L.A. . . . All of our suppliers are in L.A. The contractors and dye  operations are all within five minutes of us."  </P> <P> While many executives choose to stay in Los Angeles, some leasing agents and a  number of Vernon officials are gearing up sales pitches for garment makers  prepared to make a move. Lately, officials at the Vernon Chamber of Commerce  are touting the new Vernon Business Park.  </P> <P> Dolores Petullo, general manager of the Vernon chamber, is quick to note that  the new industrial park is located on the site once held by Bethlehem Steel  </P> <P> "The plant closing had a tremendous impact on the economy," she said. "Things  declined gradually after Bethlehem closed. . . . You have to change and adapt.  If you don't, you're going to be lost."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Gorodetskaya under the rubric </F> "Projections"; based on reports by INTERFAX and POSTFACTUM:  "Experts Believe That the Ruble Will Fall Still Lower, but  Because of the Council of Ministers Rather Than Gaydar"]    [Text] Sergey Pavlenko, first deputy chief of the working  center for economic reforms of the Russian Federation  Government, believes that Gaydar's resignation may certainly be  viewed as "a prologue to a general retreat from the course of  the reform and a transition to forming a `Soviet Government.'"  However, on the other hand, Mr. Pavlenko believes that the  departure of the first prime minister will "bring to the surface  the polarization of forces that exists within the government,  and will make the government more controllable--through the  parliament, through political pressure." Nonetheless, as Mr.  Pavlenko states, the fact of Gaydar's resignation will entail a  new cycle of inflation in any event, and the exchange rate of  the dollar will increase to 3,500-5,000 rubles [R] or perhaps  more. In his opinion, there are no financial causes for  inflation; it has been caused by "the mood of panic among  small-, medium-, and a proportion of large-scale entrepreneurs,  and in commercial structures" in conjunction with the departure  of Yegor Gaydar and general political instability.    In the opinion of Sergey Pavlenko, the departure of Yegor  Gaydar from the Cabinet of Ministers and the expected  resignation of Boris Fedorov, who attempted to pursue a firm  financial policy and came out in favor of reducing state  subsidies to industry, the military-industrial complex, etc.,  means that inflation will not be contained successfully because,  to this end, members of the government "must have personal  courage and not be members of the social group of industry  managers, but rather be a separate political force." In his  opinion, there are no such people among the expected new members  of the cabinet. Besides, at present "it is not even the change  of government that poses the greatest danger, but rather its  passivity in the environment of cadre and geographical  movements. At present, officials are not working, but rather  battling over slots in the new government building, the White  House," said the first deputy chief of the working center for  economic reforms.    In general, Sergey Pavlenko thinks that an enhancement of  the  reform is out of the question in the immediate future; the main  task is "to hold on to what has been accomplished by Gaydar, in  particular, to prevent the redistribution of property and  hyperinflation."    Meanwhile, a highly placed government expert who did not  wish  to be identified stated that a sharp drop in the exchange rate  of the national currency is not due to Gaydar's resignation at  all because the rate of inflation in 1994 was preordained by  decisions of the Russian Federation Government, made in November  and December 1993, concerning the almost twofold increase in  salaries for the employees of the budget-financed sector, the  payment of budget arrears on social programs going into  billions, and the allocation of subsidies to the coal industry.  All of this, in the opinion of the expert, "generates a powerful  inflationary charge for the coming months." The expert believes  that the growth of prices may be spurred on the most by the  indexation of fixed assets carried out effective 1 January. The  book value of funds acquired before 1 July 1992 is being  increased by factors of 26 to 44, those purchased in the fourth  quarter of 1993 by a factor of 1.4, and so on. As a result of  this, amortization allowances and, correspondingly, the producer  cost of all products will increase sharply. Besides, Russian  Federation Minister of Agriculture Aleksandr Zaveryukha is  demanding state investment exceeding the sum of R27 trillion for  the impoverished agro-industrial complex, intimidating the  government with the failure of spring field work (to be sure,  for now he has been promised R9 trillion for 1994, which is a  sizable amount, too).    A major increase in prices for services took effect on 1  January; transportation tariffs were raised. To the expert's  mind, it is absolutely obvious that all of these actions will  cause, in response, a wave of social demands to increase wages,  and will create yet another inflationary detonator.    In conjunction with this, the expert suggested that at a  minimum, the growth of prices by a factor of seven lies in store  for Russia in 1994 (the growth of prices by a factor of 4.7,  which is lower than in 1993 by a factor of two, is projected  officially). The expert doubted the reliability of official data  indicating a decline in the rate of price inflation in December  to 13 percent; he said that inflation had not dropped below 20  percent.</p>

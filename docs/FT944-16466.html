			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Muzak to the ears - Virginia Matthews considers the arguments for background music everyone loves to hate Astronauts listened to it in the Apollo lunar spacecraft and it was the last thing to be switched off in the American embassy as the US evacuation of Saigon reached its climax. Muzak, 60 years old this month, is to its critics inextricably linked to 'elevator music' - where Mantovani meets Liberace in achingly bland disharmony. Yet thanks to Muzak's thousands of clients, who consider customised music more as a sales tool than noise pollutant, Muzak's product is far from being stuck between floors. Invented by Major General George Squier, a retired US army signals officer, Muzak began as a dance medley service, played down telephone lines to subscribers for 11 cents a month. The notion of piped music was later seized on by the US's newly-influential industrial psychologists, who saw it as a cost-effective way to increase productivity in the workplace. As worker motivation appeared to improve with melody, so too did the enthusiasm of shoppers who appeared to linger longer and spend more. Following a series of successful Muzak experiments in big New York stores, a national phenomenon was under way. Now, Muzak's 12 channels - only one, the 'environmental music channel' could be described as elevator music, the rest being anything from contemporary jazz to the Rolling Stones - have spread to aircraft, hotel lobbies and restaurants, as well as to the waiting rooms of doctors and dentists. Piped music has also spread to switchboards, which play the 'hold music' that is designed to soothe irate callers, but which often raises, rather than reduces blood pressure levels. Curiously, Muzak has failed to thrive in Britain. For while its name is a by-word for those who dislike background music, the self-proclaimed 'audio icon' and 'tunesmith' from Cleveland Ohio, has not been in the UK since the early 1980s, when its last UK franchise ran out. 'We are used to being blamed for all background music,' says Leslie Fitter, the company's director of marketing. 'But as far as Britain goes, Muzak is blameless.' While Muzak continues to supply tapes to more than 200 international franchisees, mostly broadcasters, who receive the soundtracks via a satellite link, the piped music that has invaded the UK is entirely the work of others. Be it 'acid jazz' music played full pelt at fashion retailer French Connection, or Tommy Steele's Little White Bull keeping the tiny punters amused at Mothercare, retailers instinctively know what appeals to their own target audiences. Or do they? Ritter, who hints that a significant UK franchise deal is imminent, argues: 'Nothing comes close to the expertise of a company that has specialised in business music for 60 years. 'It's fine for a store manager to bring in his favourite CD, but no one should pretend that any real thought goes into it. 'Our service begins with a full consultation with a senior Muzak executive who finds out the demographic profile of the company, its desired atmosphere and how it is currently perceived. 'We then recommend a programme that both meets the firm's music needs and possibly includes a customised programme of marketing messages for use inside the store or on the switchboard.' If and when a deal with Muzak is struck in the UK, the full power of Muzak's service will be unleashed: everything from the hitline channel of today's top pop tracks, to the classical channel, country and western and oldies - a blend of 1960s and 1970s music that seems to go down so well with baby boomers. If piped music is genuinely unpopular with consumers, as its critics would have us believe, why do so many retailers continue to use it? Harrods, which uses both 'hold music' and in-store piped music, says: 'If music was a real irritant to our customers there is no way that we would play it. After all, the idea is to open wallets and purses, not to get them slammed shut. 'We believe that what people actually object to is this fashion for elevator music or meaningless noise, the sort of thing we would never play in our elevators or anywhere else for that matter. 'What is appreciated is music that is appropriate to the department . . . anything that adds to the ambience, rather than distracting from it, is welcomed by our customers.' While Harrods plays it safe by having music-free zones on the ground and first floors and in the lift areas, Mothercare's music is unmissable throughout the store. 'Our research indicates that the majority of the customers who notice it feel that the music adds to the enjoyment of their shopping trip,' says Mothercare. While 1990s industrial psychologists are less mesmerised by the power of music than their 1930s counterparts, Muzak's claims continue. The latest research from Cleveland suggests that piped music increases the number of shoppers who make it to the cash till by 17 per cent. In another study, two-thirds of customers say that Muzak is preferable to silence, adding that customer service is 'bound to be better' in piped music stores. But of the consumers who walk out of stores or hang up just as soon as Greensleeves starts up? Not a mention.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Treasury poised to deliver improved growth forecast: Increasing evidence shows economy gathering strength despite tax rises The Treasury is likely to revise upwards its forecast for UK economic growth this year on the strength of increasing evidence that activity has withstood the impact of April's tax rises. Treasury economists are drawing up a new forecast for publication about the end of next month. It is expected to upgrade last November's Budget forecasts for 1994 of 2.5 per cent growth of gross domestic product and 2.25 per cent growth for GDP minus oil and gas extraction. Economic indicators for April, published this month, suggested that the economic upturn is gathering strength. That trend is likely to be confirmed by early data for May, due this week. Economists expect Bank of England figures tomorrow to show that seasonally adjusted growth of M0, the measure of 'narrow' money - comprising mainly coins and banknotes in circulation - climbed to about 7.1 per cent in the year to May from 6.2 per cent in the year to April. M0 is regarded as a useful guide to the trend of retail sales, which grew strongly last month in spite of the effect of increased direct and indirect taxes. At about 7 per cent, M0 is growing at nearly twice the ceiling of the government's 0 per cent to 4 per cent 'monitoring range' for narrow-money growth this year. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply publishes its purchasing managers' index on Wednesday. This indicator is also expected to point to increases in activity. The forecasters' consensus of near-term growth prospects has been creeping upwards this month. A Treasury survey of 32 new independent forecasts in May found that the average expectation of growth was 2.7 per cent for this year and 1995 compared with 2.6 per cent for each year in April. The report earlier this year of the Treasury's panel of economic advisers - the so-called 'six wise men' - produced average GDP growth forecasts of 2.9 per cent for this year and 2.8 per cent for 1995. With growth projections ranging from 2.6 per cent to 3.4 per cent, each of the advisers forecast that growth this year would exceed the November Budget prediction. Seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office last week showed that first-quarter GDP was 2.6 per cent up on the first quarter of last year and 0.7 per cent higher than in the final quarter of 1993. However, after removing buoyant oil and gas extraction from the figures, economic activity only recovered in the first quarter to the average level of 1990. First-quarter GDP, excluding oil and gas, was 0.6 per cent higher than in the final 1993 quarter and just 2 per cent up on the first quarter of last year. Figures point to stable spending, Page 5</p>

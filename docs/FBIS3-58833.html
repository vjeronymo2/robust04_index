			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, financial policy </F> spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party of Germany:  "Brussels Does Not Need To Incur Debts"]    [Text] Bonn, 20 January -- In view of the currently 19.2  million unemployed in the European Union [EU], a continuing slow  economic cycle, and the fact that Europe's innovative potential  lags increasingly behind the United States and Japan, Commission  President Jacques Delors took the initiative. With his white  paper on more growth, competitiveness, and employment, which he  submitted at the EU summit in mid-December, he intends to fuel  the European economy.    In fact, the white paper Delors presented contains some  correct principles.     -  The Commission is aware that the EU  employment crisis must be overcome by creating internationally  competitive new jobs and technological progress; employment  programs of the old type are not suggested in the white  paper.    -  The white paper recommends more flexibility in business  and industry and a decrease in ancillary wage costs, without  intending to lower the well-tested EU social standards.    -  Great  importance is attached to the development of the infrastructure,  not least in view of the Maastricht Treaty and the planned  adjustment of the economic potential. The white paper,  therefore, suggests measures for the development of European  transport, energy, and telecommunications systems.    There is just one snag to the white paper, however: If the  Commission had its will, EU debts would increase further. At  the same time, the European Union would be authorized to incur  debts. The Commission suggests that the European Union should  borrow an additional ECU8 billion -- less than 16 billion German  marks [DM] -- annually, in addition to the existing programs.  Following some resistance at the summit, the EU Council has  ordered a study to analyze the matter.  <H5>  Right To Incur Debts at European Level </H5>   The European Commission intends to use the program presented  in the white paper in order to give the European Union a special  right to incur debts. Such a right to indebtedness at the  European level, however, is neither necessary nor desirable.    It is not necessary because there are already enough  instruments in the framework of the EU budget, some of which are  exclusively envisaged for the financing of trans-European  systems -- the cohesion fund, the structural fund, and the  medium-term research framework program. In addition, the  European Investment Bank can grant credits; the credit volume in  1993 was approximately ECU19 billion. Moreover, a European  investment fund will be created in 1994 that will primarily deal  with the financing of trans-European systems. Through this  fund, approximately ECU30 billion can be mobilized. There is no  indication that these funds will not be sufficient.  <H5>  The EU Budget Must Not Be Financed by Way of Credit </H5>   A special right to indebtedness of the Commission is not  desirable, because in this way, another debt vehicle would be  opened that would develop its own dynamism. It would provide a  loophole for member states to incur a debt that is not possible  nationally. The European Treaty, therefore, says for good reason  that the EU budget is not to be financed by way of credit, but  solely from the member states' own funds.    In addition, the Maastricht Treaty defines stability  criteria  for the future European monetary union. The upper ceiling of  indebtedness in the member states should not exceed 60 percent,  and new borrowing should not be higher than 3 percent of the  GDP. The necessary efforts to observe the convergency criteria  at the national level would lose much of their value, if  borrowing were shifted to the European level. It is  unacceptable that individual member states should try to fulfill  the stability criteria, whereas the European Union could incur  an excessively high debt. If this were possible, then this debt  would have to be allowed for proportionately regarding the  indebtedness of the member states, which, after all, have to pay  for interest and amortization.    In all member states, public debt has become a real obstacle  to growth and employment. Any further debt increase in the  European Union would complicate the necessary interest rate cuts  and would thus hinder investment in new jobs. Investors and  consumers are concerned about continuously increasing public  debt. Everyone knows that sooner or later, the state must apply  the emergency brake and initiate consolidation measures. The  more indebted the countries are, the more painful the spending  cuts, and the greater the need for tax increases. However, this  is extremely harmful for the cycle and the employment market.    What is more, the debt incurred by the Commission must also  be serviced. For the necessary interest payments, the  Commission must go to the member states to finance financing.  This means that the member states' payments to the European  Union would increase because of interest peyments. The wind  that is currently blowing into the European Union's face is  rather becoming stronger, as a result of such proposals and  analyses.    It is not necessary to create new debt vehicles, credit  programs, and special debt options of the European Union. What  is necessary, however, is to reduce debt at all levels and take  the convergency criteria of the Maastricht Treaty seriously. If  the available funds were not to be sufficient, readjustments  must be made in the EU budget in favor of the measures mentioned  in the white paper.    In Europe, too, the debt mentality must be broken. The  united Europe must not become a debt community. The disastrous  impact of further debts will threaten growth, competitiveness,  and thus the very goals that are to be implemented with the help  of the white paper -- the decrease of unemployment and the  improvement of competitiveness in Europe. I, therefore, call  upon the Federal Government to reject clearly the Brussels debt  plans.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yu Yong-won] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 30 January that the Defense  Ministry has decided to purchase three additional German-made  209-type submarines in the period between 1999 to 2001 at a cost  of approximately 600 billion won.    The Defense Ministry's decision was made at the Navy's  request. The Navy will have a total of nine submarines when  these three submarines are introduced. The plan to purchase the  additional submarines was confirmed recently and approved by the  president. The Navy is planning to build the three submarines in  the ROK in technological cooperation with the German maker HDW  Company beginning this year.    It has been learned that the additional submarines to be  purchased by the Navy will be equipped with more ultramodern  electronic devices and stronger offensive weapons than those  carried by existing 209-type submarines. A naval officer said on  30 January: "The decision to purchase three additional  submarines was made because it was determined that six  submarines are not enough, considering the fact that North Korea  has 25 submarines and neighboring countries, including Japan and  China, also have strong submarine capability."    The Navy purchased three 209-type submarines at a cost  ranging from 140 billion to 150 billion won each and is supposed  to purchase three more by 1998. The additional submarines to be  purchased by 2001 have a displacement of 1,200 tonnes, a surface  speed of 14 knots, and eight 12-inch torpedo tubes. These  submarines are considered to outperform North Korea's  Whiskey-class and Romio-class submarines.</p>

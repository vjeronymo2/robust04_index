A number of laws and regulations have been stipulated in  China since 1993 and the number of trade unions in  foreign-funded enterprises have grown a lot, participants said.    Trade unions have now been set up in 45 percent of the  foreign- funded enterprises where they should be organized  according to China's laws or regulations. In economic  development zones, where foreign-funded enterprises are given  some preferable policies, 60 percent of the foreign-funded  enterprises have trade unions.    Trade unions mediate labor disputes and give Chinese workers  legal knowledge and technical training.    Trade unions not only stimulate the production enthusiasm of  workers and reduce labor friction but also help maintain normal  operations of overseas investors' businesses, Yang Xingfu, vice  chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said at the  conference.    Trade unions should cooperate with foreign investors for  better development of the enterprises while protecting workers'  rights and interests, he said.    Trade union leaders from Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai,  Shandong, Guangdong, Fujian, Liaoning and some development zones  attended the meeting.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Councils face toughest cash squeeze LOCAL COUNCILS face the prospect next year of the toughest squeeze on their spending for more than a decade as a result of the government's determination to cut public expenditure. Ministers believe the Department of the Environment will be unable to achieve any increase at all in the Pounds 41.17bn the government has estimated councils in England should spend in the current year, and that the department will be lucky even to avoid a reduction in that amount. Despite increasingly tight limits on how much local authorities can spend on services, councils are already spending more than the government's estimates. Local-authority leaders will tomorrow use a meeting of the consultative council on local-government finance to press Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, about next year's spending. They plan to show that even following the government's lead in resisting pay rises unless they are accompanied by productivity increases, councils cannot set budgets at this year's levels without severe cuts in services. Spending on local-authority services rose consistently through the 1980s and into the 1990s, partly because of the introduction and then the demise of the poll tax, which was replaced by the council tax. Based mainly on property values, the council tax was introduced in April this year largely without the antagonism the poll tax attracted, taking much of the heat out of local finance. Ministers therefore feel more confident in imposing stringent limits on local spending, especially as the reductions in services forecast by local authorities as a result of the settlement for this year have failed to become a politically controversial issue. Local-government officials admit that even sympathetic DoE officials are not convinced councils had a difficult time setting budgets within this year's limits: only three authorities went through the formal process of having their budgets 'capped'. The cabinet's public spending committee, EDX, is expected to meet every day this week. Treasury ministers are keen to reach a settlement by the end of this month. Warnings on tax rises, Page 6</p>

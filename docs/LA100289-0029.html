			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> An Oklahoma television viewer wants so badly to see "The Last Temptation of  Christ" that he is suing a cable company that decided not to show the  controversial film. Felix H. Olim of suburban Midwest City filed suit Friday in  federal court to force Multimedia Cablevision to show the film on Cinemax when  it is telecast for the rest of the country. He also wants $1 million in  damages. Multimedia announced last week that it would not telecast the  controversial film in Oklahoma, Kansas and North Carolina when it appears on  the premium channel. Olim's suit says Multimedia "infringed upon the religious  rights of its 90,000 subscribers" by deciding to pre-empt the program. Cinemax  will broadcast the movie nationwide Monday and on four other dates in October.  The Oscar-nominated "Last Temptation" sparked national protests when it was  released 14 months ago because it portrayed Jesus as confused over his identity  and purpose and subject to human desires.

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Maastricht: Denmark to wait for its partners to act THE DANISH government has confirmed that it will make no proposals to resolve the political crisis surrounding the Maastricht treaty until its 11 partners have completed the ratification process. Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Denmark's economy minister, admitted that the Danish government could not sign the treaty as it stood because of the No vote in the recent referendum. But he pointed out that the treaty would not be valid until the 11 - assuming they all ratify the treaty - asked the Danish government to sign the document. He predicted that the other 11 member countries would not put the crucial question to Denmark.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF: BOLSHEVIK SALUTE BY WANG MENG TRANSLATED FROM THE CHINESE BY  WENDY LARSON (UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON PRESS: $19.95; 154 PP.)  </P> <P> Wang Meng's career closely parallels that of Zhong Yicheng, the hero of this  "modernist" novel first published in 1979: He joined the Communist Party as a  teen-ager, was exiled to the countryside after something he had innocently  written was branded as "rightist" in a 1957 purge, endured bitter years of  manual labor and was finally rehabilitated after the Cultural Revolution. Wang,  in addition, became China's minister of culture, only to be demoted again after  last year's massacre in Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> Zhong is tormented by the question: What does it mean if the party is good but  treats him badly? He decides that he must be bad. When his wife's love and the  passage of time moderate his self-criticism, Zhong concludes that the good  party made pardonable mistakes or, at worst, that his fate is a mystery. What  to a Westerner would be the obvious answer -- that the party is tyrannical --  is simply unavailable to him, because his whole identity is bound up in the  revolutionary idealism of his youth.  </P> <P> In a valuable afterword, translator Wendy Larson shows how Wang, less naive  than Zhong, hints at the unthinkable through the very structure of the novel,  which exactly balances "positive" and "negative" episodes and bounces Zhong  like a Ping-Pong ball between the paddles of logic and emotion. Wang implies  that the intellectual, capable of logic, is always the potential enemy of  revolutionary fervor; he has no place in communist society and must be kept too  frightened, guilty or exhausted to perform his natural function: to think.  </P></p>

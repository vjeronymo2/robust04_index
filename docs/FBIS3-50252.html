			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with unnamed intelligence "expert" by Attila </F> Schmidt; place and date not given: "The KGB Is Strong and the  CIA Is Rich -- There Were No Star Wars in Hungary"]    [Text] Irrespective of their social order, it is extremely  important for every country to have a firm economic background,  and this can also be seen from their military potential.  However, well- founded political, and mainly economic,  decisions require the knowledge of at least the plans, concepts,  and expected decisions of partner countries. This information  can be obtained openly through the press and foreign  representations; however, the intelligence services have to be  activated for the secret information; the intelligence services  will uncover the plans of the other side with the help of agents  and other secret means.    No country can avoid the struggle of intelligence services,  including Hungary. We spoke about this secret struggle with an  expert who does not wish to be named.    [Expert] Intelligence is divided into civil and military  sectors. Most medium-sized and smaller countries only have  military intelligence services. Of course, this does not mean  that these countries would give up the possibility to obtain  political, economic, and other information. They put the  military intelligence in charge of obtaining such information.  The intelligence services of the former Eastern Bloc were  organized according to the Soviet KGB model and, thus, a  military intelligence was also in operation in addition to a  civilian intelligence service.    [Schmidt] Does that mean that this duality stopped after the  change in the regime?    [Expert] No; only their names changed: They are active as  military and civilian information offices. The same applies to  the former partner countries.    [Schmidt] In the past decades, the CIA and the KGB became  known as the big "warriors." What was the difference between  the two organizations?    [Expert] The essential difference was that while the CIA is  an intelligence agency, only Group III/I in the KGB dealt with  intelligence gathering, Group III/II dealt with  counterespionage, and Group III/III (also famous in Hungary)  dealt with domestic surveillance. In the United States,  counterespionage belongs to the FBI.    [Schmidt] Which organization was "better," the CIA or the  KGB?    [Expert] It is impossible to give a clear answer to this  question because, while there was no internal competition within  the KGB because the entire organization was directed by a single  boss, there is constant rivalry between the CIA and the FBI  because each organization is led by a different boss and they  have to prove their importance. Thus, the KGB was strong, but  the CIA is much richer. However, it is a fact that both  organizations carried out a global and total intelligence  activity; they were present all over the world and they were  interested in everything. As the sole major intelligence power  of the world, the CIA has not changed its style these days  either.    [Schmidt] What information did the big intelligence agencies  want from Hungary?    [Expert] A separate department in the CIA dealt with the  Eastern Bloc countries. They were interested in these  countries' political and economic concepts, and they were also  interested in knowing the situation of the domestic opposition.  Naturally, they dealt specially with the main enemy, the Soviet  Union. One of the well-tested means of this struggle was to  force them into an arms race that involved huge amounts of  money. With Star Wars, they forced the Soviets to carry out new  military investments.    [Schmidt] What tactics did they use against Hungary?    [Expert] They could not influence us militarily because,  compared with the others, we had an "operetta army." Therefore,  we were "granted" an almost unlimited amount of credit. Our  indebtedness also "derives" from certain intelligence maneuvers.  This required that politicians should not be able to resist  temptation.    [Schmidt] What intelligence organizations were active in  Hungary?    [Expert] The Americans, the West Germans, the British, the  French, and the Italians. However, Hungary was not only  interesting to the Western intelligence services. Austria was,  at that time, already the most friendly country in our  neighborhood because the Romanians spied very actively against  us, but the East Germans and the Czechoslovaks were also present  in Hungary.    [Schmidt] What is the situation today?    [Expert] The East Germans have probably stopped their spying  activity in Hungary....</p>

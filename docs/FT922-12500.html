			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Brady happy with Russian reform plan RUSSIA'S economic reform programme remains intact and the planned financial support for it from the International Monetary Fund should be agreed in May, according to Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary. He said the concessions made by the Russian government in the past week's session of the Russian Congress of People's Deputies might amount to 'a very, very slight deterioration' of the programme. But the US had not changed its support for the economic reform efforts of President Boris Yeltsin and his first deputy prime minister, Yegor Gaidar, or its view that work on western financial support for Russia should continue. Mr Brady, who spoke to journalists on Thursday after briefing Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, about his trip to Moscow and eastern Europe, said there were some encouraging economic signs in Russia and eastern Europe. The proliferation of street markets in Moscow pointed to the emergence of an entrepreneurial spirit. Low east European wage levels relative to those in western industrialised countries should encourage investment and exports. However, Mr Brady warned that growth in the industrial world was too low to deal with the problems of the former communist countries and below the level needed in the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and the rest of the world. He indicated the US would again raise the issue of growth when G7 finance ministers and central bank governors meet in Washington this month. A year ago, Mr Brady ruffled feathers in Europe and Japan by urging more expansionary policies to combat a slowdown in growth. Following his latest trip, he said government officials in Europe now shared US concerns. Mr David Mulford, US treasury under-secretary for international affairs, said Japan could adopt a 'more stimulative attitude' to investment as part of a plan to boost activity, while there was a growing recognition in Germany that the country's mix of policies might be hindering growth. Germany's high interest rates were 'not just a Bundesbank issue', Mr Mulford said.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Ex-Communists hail E German poll tally Leaders of the reformed communist Party of Democratic Socialism believe their big gains in Sunday's local government elections in eastern Germany are more than a mere blip in the party's fortunes. 'We have shown we are a force to be reckoned with at local level in the east,' said Mr Lothar Bisky, chairman, after the party pushed ahead of the opposition Social Democrats in urban areas. In the northern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the PDS won 25 per cent, 6 percentage points more than in 1990; in Saxony-Anhalt, which will hold its first state elections on June 26, it increased its share by 7.3 percentage points to 20.2 per cent; in Saxony, the party's tally went up 5 points to 16.7 per cent; and in the southern state of Thuringia, it gained 4.5 percentage points to 15 per cent. Three factors account for the party's electoral success. First, it inherited the local grassroots organisation of the former East German Communist party which, before unification, had 2.3m members. With 131,000 of them in the PDS today, including 10 per cent who never belonged to the old apparatus, it has remained active at the local level. 'That is our great strength,' said Mr Bisky. 'The established west German parties never developed a proper grassroots network in eastern Germany.' Second, for easterners, the PDS is seen as a viable social democratic party, as Mr Rudolf Scharping, head of the Social Democrats, has failed to convince them that he has policies which are ideologically distinguishable from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats. 'The PDS will simply drain votes away from us,' said Ms Dagmar Szabados, SDP deputy mayor of Halle, who was running third behind the PDS, while the CDU mayor, Mr Klaus Rauen, was set for re-election. Third, the PDS is seen as unsere, or 'our' party, as PDS voters repeatedly explained on Sunday. 'We are not commies. We are not hardliners. We are east German democratic socialists, despite what the wessi (west German) politicians say,' said Mr Bisky. These factors make life difficult for the SPD. Although it increased its share of the vote in the east, it will only be able to dislodge four of the five CDU-dominated state governments with the help of a coalition with the Greens and the PDS. 'We cannot join with the PDS. It would be unacceptable,' said Ms Szabados. 'The only solution is that Scharping gets his act together.' The SPD has less than two weeks to turn the tables in Saxony-Anhalt, and four months in the other states. The recent confidence boost for the PDS will make their struggle even harder.</p>

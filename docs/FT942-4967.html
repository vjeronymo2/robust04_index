			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Smiths pays Dollars 150m for US medical group Smiths Industries, the aerospace and healthcare group is paying Dollars 150m (Pounds 100m) for Deltec, a US medical equipment manufacturer owned by Pharmacia of Sweden. The deal will add more than one-third to Smiths' Pounds 181m annual sales in healthcare. It will also result in a book profit of SKr600m (Pounds 50.6m) to Pharmacia, which is scheduled to be privatised this month. Deltec, based in St Paul, Minnesota, makes portable infusion pumps and injection ports. In 1993, it had sales of about Dollars 100m and operating profits of more than Dollars 13m. The cash will come from Smiths' existing resources. The company will pay Dollars 98m for Deltec's equity and repay inter-company debt of Dollars 35m. The balance of Dollars 17m will be paid as Deltec's non-US offices change hands. This is Smiths' second healthcare acquisition in less than two years. In October 1992, it bought Intertech Resources, the US medical equipment company, for Dollars 110m. Intertech had annual sales of less than Dollars 50m and Smiths said yesterday that 'there are more reasonable prices being asked for medical companies these days'. Deltec has more than 80 per cent of its sales in the US and Smiths said that the non-US market for the company's products 'remains to be exploited'. Two thirds of Deltec's sales are of a pump that allows a patient receiving medication to leave a hospital. The pump continues to supply the patient without the need for direct nursing care. Although each pump costs more than Dollars 3,000, and must be fitted with Deltec's proprietary medication-containing cassettes, there are greater savings to be made from not having the patient in hospital, said Smiths. 'The wearing of the pump provides doses of medicines to people who do not need a hospital bed. The driving force in the US (healthcare business) is getting people out of hospital beds,' said the company. Patients occupying beds typically cost hundreds of pounds a day. For Pharmacia, the disposal represents a move to concentrate on the core business of drugs manufacture. The company has accumulated a disparate group of businesses through acquisition. The sale of Deltec has been planned since February, said Pharmacia. The company will keep the rights to sell Deltec's products in parts of Europe but not in the UK, Germany and France.</p>

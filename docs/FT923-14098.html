			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Boards' linguistic silence speaks volumes MOST directors of the biggest UK companies fit the stereotype of the insular Brit unable or unwilling to communicate in a foreign language. They lack both the language skills and the overseas work experience necessary to face the challenge of international competition and global markets, according to a survey published today. The latest board of directors study by Korn/Ferry International, the executive search firm, says that fewer than one in five boardroom directors of leading British companies speaks a foreign language and two thirds have no experience of working abroad. Of the 581 directors of 179 UK listed companies who responded to the survey, 84 per cent spoke no foreign language. Fourteen per cent spoke one foreign language and 2 per cent spoke three or more. The proportion of directors with language skills was no higher in companies that generated more than half their business overseas last year. Questionnaires were sent to the 335 UK companies in the Times European 1000 list and the next 500 largest British companies. Mr Michael Brandon, a Korn/Ferry International director and author of the study, said: 'Unless British boards take rapid steps to acquire the necessary international skills and experience, UK Ltd is in danger of becoming a foreign subsidiary.' Perhaps the occupants of British boardrooms could learn a lesson or two from the UK's top exporting companies. A straw poll conducted by the FT yesterday among Britain's 10 most successful exporters showed that they generally bucked the survey's findings. Rolls-Royce, Shell UK and BP said virtually all their directors had been based overseas at some stage, and most had at least a conversational grasp of another language. Of Shell UK's 12 directors three are Dutch nationals 'who speak English better than the English'. However top marks go to Mr David Simon, BP's new chief executive, who read modern languages including French at university, speaks three other languages fluently, and studied for his MBA at Fontainebleau. IBM UK said the majority of its directors would have conversational French at the very least since most had worked at the company's European headquarters in Paris, and Ford UK said all but two of its 10-man board had worked overseas. Ford boasts a German-speaking chairman in Mr Ian McAllister together with a native German speaker in Mr Albert Caspers, and a Spanish-speaking personnel director. ICI said it did not know the level of language skills among its eight non-executive directors but of the eight executive directors, four had more than one language. At Pearson, the FT's parent company, three of the 13 board members are foreign nationals, another is a foreign resident and only one director speaks no foreign language. However, another board member makes up for this by boasting four languages, including Hausa from north Nigeria. The study also examines the composition of the British boardroom, the balance between executive and non-executive directors, and the composition of audit and remuneration committees. Other main findings are: Only 11 of the 581 directors were women and no company had more than one woman on the board. Eight of the 11 women were non-executives. Three quarters of UK companies had separate chairmen and chief executives - as recommended by the Cadbury report on corporate governance. In a quarter of those companies, the chairman was a full-time executive playing a leading role. There was still, however, an overall majority (55 per cent) with chairmen who were either part-time or non-executive, or full-time but not playing the leading role in the organisation. As the concentration of power and the level of involvement of the chairman reduces, it becomes more likely that the majority of the board will be non-executive. Among companies with non-executive chairmen, 55 per cent had a non-executive majority, but among companies with a strong chairman role, the proportion was less than 20 per cent. Just under 60 per cent of the top executives of the largest companies with turnover of Pounds 1bn or more have university degrees, while roughly one in five is a qualified accountant.

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUST OUT OF AFRICA  </P> <P> Having just returned from two weeks in Africa, reading the Nov. 11 Travel  Section cover story ("Camp Kenya") was a great pleasure.  </P> <P> I would amend your recommendations for hotels in the Masai Mara, Kenya, to  include Governor's Camp, located in a beautiful series of bends in the Mara  River and overlooking the plains and distant escarpments of the Rift Valley.  Prices run about $320 a day for two, with all meals, game runs, laundry  included. The tent houses are large, lamp-lit at night with a full bath,  including bidet. So it manages to be a bit rustic and luxurious at the same  time. The meals and the staff were wonderful and the animals abundant.  </P> <P> DICK SARGENT, Los Angeles  </P></p>

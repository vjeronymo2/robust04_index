			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Chong Yon-chu from Washington] </F>   [Text] In connection with the fact that the ROK Government  had recently decided that U.S.-made sausages were not  appropriate for imports, the U.S. Trade Representative Office  determined that there exists a secondary import barrier in the  ROK for imports of agricultural products and began to listen to  views on this issue from U.S. agricultural circles. The Trade  Representative Office is likely to present these views to  pressure the ROK Government at trade negotiations.    In the Federal Gazette dated 9 June, the U.S. Trade  Representative Office asked "U.S. agricultural exporters to hand  in their views on problems facing them with regard to the 77  items of goods to which the ROK Government opened its markets in  1989 by 8 July."</p>

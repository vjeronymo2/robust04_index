			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Concession urged to boost collieries: What future for coal? NATIONAL Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, sug-gested yesterday that the bulk of the UK electricity market should be reserved for coal-based power as a way of sustaining the UK coal industry. This would involve clearing gas-fired and oil-fired power stations from the 'franchise' market in England and Wales, where regional electricity companies have a monopoly to sell to households and small businesses. This market accounts for 70 per cent of all power demand, but prices have been fixed artificially high to help coal. The company said clearing the franchise market would enable British Coal to increase sales to National Power and PowerGen, its two main clients, from an expected 30m tonnes a year for the four years from 1994, to up to 50m tonnes. In evidence to the Commons' trade and industry select committee, which is inquiring into the economics of the coal industry, National Power said the solution would have the advantage of subjecting the economies of combined cycle gas turbines to the test of the market. CCGTs would be restricted to the non-franchise market, which supplies large customers and in which British Coal is unable to compete effectively. Gas-fired power stations are a significant contributor to the decline of coal demand, but their cost is the subject of considerable debate. Regional electricity companies are able to pass on their costs to customers whether or not they are economic. Mr John Baker, National Power chief executive, said it was possible that uneconomic CCGTs could displace 5m to 10m tonnes of coal a year. 'The regional electricity companies cannot have it both ways. Either the CCGTs are economic and they should fight in the fully contested part of the market, or they are not economic, in which case they should not go ahead.' In a six-page submission to the committee, National Power said it would support a larger market for British Coal, above the 40m tonnes tentatively agreed for next year and 30m thereafter. It believed there was room in the market as a whole to accommodate 40m tonnes a year of British produced coal on long term contracts. National Power was also willing for transitional assistance to be given to British produced coal providing it became competitive with world coal at the end of the transition. The government, it suggested, had three courses. It could either leave the market to determine British coal's future, subsidise coal so that it is offered for sale at world market prices, or require electricity consumers in the franchise market to buy British Coal output. In the last case these consumers would bear the additional costs, in effect continuing to pay a coal levy through electricity bills as in recent years.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24): Supportive columns - A guide to the information about trusts that is published each day in the FT / Investment Trusts HOW CAN you use the Financial Times share price pages to help you choose an investment trust, and to follow your trust once you have bought shares? Almost two whole columns of the share listings pages are devoted to investment trust share prices, with the trusts listed in alphabetical order. One important point to note is that many trusts have more than one type of share capital. The most common types are: Capital shares. These have no fixed repayment value and pay no income. They depend for their return on the trust managers growing the assets of the trust. Income shares. These get all the income of the trust, and have a very high yield. But their repayment value may be low or virtually zero, so some investors may simply be converting capital into income. Warrants. These give the investors the entitlement to buy further shares at a set price. The price of warrants can be highly volatile and they can expire worthless; they also pay no income. Zero-coupon preference shares. These pay no income but should be redeemed at a much higher price in future. They thus offer steady capital growth and are useful for people who do not pay capital gains tax. If you are thinking of dabbling in any of these specialist classes of share, or others such as stepped preference shares, you really need a stockbroker's advice. Once you have sorted out the class of shares you want, you can glean further information from the share price pages. In most cases, we show the net asset value (supplied by County NatWest Wood Mackenzie) and the discount or premium on which shares trade. This can be quite a good guide for general trusts - in theory, the wider the discount the better. But care needs to be exercised. A wide discount may reflect a poor management record. Any narrowing of the discount might be counteracted, therefore, by poor asset growth. In addition, if the trust has a large proportion of unquoted stocks, then the discount might reflect investor suspicion of the real value of that unquoted element. And the 'discounts' applied to capital shares of split trusts may be an illusion, if the trust has zero-coupon shares with a steadily rising claim on the asset base. That said, it is obviously better to buy shares in an international general investment trust on a 20 per cent than on a 10 per cent discount. The listings also show the yield on each share. Again, caution is needed before you assume that the highest yielding shares are the best. High yields on income shares may reflect the prospect of capital loss; and on general trust shares, a high historic yield may also reflect the expectation of a dividend cut. One should also remember that yields in Britain are higher than those in overseas markets, so geographical specialist trusts may not offer much of an income. Monday's listings show slightly different information, in particular the dividends for the last year, the dates on which the dividends are paid, and the last date on which the shares went ex-dividend.</p>

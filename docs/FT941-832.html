			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (9): An extraordinary innovator / Profile of Hank Greenberg 'We do try to understand risk. We try to work out plans to manage it successfully,' says Hank Greenberg, explaining one of the basic philosophies of American International Group, of which he is chief executive and chairman. 'In fact,' adds Mr Greenberg, 'we welcome new developments of risk in society because it gives us new opportunities'. On the surface this sounds unexceptional. Yet AIG's success in implementing Greenberg's philosophy marks the company off from many of its competitors in both the United States and other insurance markets and has been the basis for the group's success. By any standards AIG's growth over the past 30 years has been formidable. It has increased its premium income from just Dollars 237m in 1968 to nearly Dollars 16bn in 1993. And although its market capitalisation base is still smaller than those of Europe's biggest companies, such as Allianz,AIG is much more profitable than most of its rivals with pre-tax profits of Dollars 2.6bn in 1993. How has the success been achieved? For a start, Mr Greenberg keeps an iron grip on costs which can be up to a third lower than some of its competitors. Unlike some of its US rivals AIG has no pretences of maintaining an organisation that can sell all types of insurance products to all types of customers in every US state. 'To believe you have to go into business to protect other businesses is a mistaken judgement or that you have to have a certain market share regardless of results is a mistaken policy,' explains Greenberg. Mercilessly critical of underwriting standards in the US industry, and a policy - commonly followed by many rivals - of compensating insurance losses with investment income, and in recent years by capital gains, Mr Greenberg explains that AIG puts much more emphasis on underwriting profits. 'Underwriting is our first business and that is what we judge ourselves on,' says Mr Greenberg. Certainly AIG is not frightened of the sudden and exceptional risk. 'The market place eliminates one-time big losses but unusual events occur on a frequent basis. It is kind of hard to take them out and say they are not occurring.' Whereas many insurance companies have quit difficult markets such as those offering cover for environmental pollution, AIG has stuck with its customers. 'We are in the risk business,' says Mr Greenberg. 'If we fail to respond to the needs of society or corporate society then we are simply encouraging self-insurance.' AIG spends heavily on its divisions which 'research and develop' new products. 'We eagerly seek things out rather than continuing to do just what we did yesterday,' adds Mr Greenberg. This philosophy takes AIG into what many more conservative companies would consider high-risk markets overseas and in the US. AIG, which started as a Shanghai-based underwriting agency in 1919, is now back in China, for example - as the only foreign insurance company licensed to underwrite business. The achievement at least partially reflects Mr Greenberg's own personal determination. He has visited the country every year since 1975 to maintain contacts. AIG subsidiaries are leading participants in the life insurance markets of south-east Asia and are actively seeking to build up business in eastern Europe. By acquiring an interest of more than 20 per cent in the Robert Plan, a New York-based insurer, which successfully specialises in high risk motor insurance, Mr Greenberg signalled an interest in the crime-ridden markets of inner-urban America, which have been 'red-lined' by principal competitors. Robert Plan makes money in New York by rigorous screening of potential customers and claimants. But nowhere has this philosophy been clearer than in tough commercial risks such as US legal liabilities. During the 1970s, when US insurance companies left the liability insurance market over fears about esclating court awards in product liability and medical malpractice, many corporate buyers were forced to examine self-insurance and risk management for the first time, sometimes setting up captive insurance companies, dedicated insurance subsidiaries. AIG set up a risk management company, which advised companies on captives, helped them administer claims and plan insurance and reinsurance arrangements. Later in the mid-1980s when the market for liability insurance shrank further, AIG expanded its business, combining with three other companies to offer a basic liability insurance facility to US business. AIG also offers a series of specialist liability insurance products. For example, the AIG subsidiary, National Union Fire of Pittsburg, is a big underwriter of directors and officers insurance - which protects boards and senior management against legal action from creditors and shareholders. Lexington, another subsidiary, specialises in placing property and liability risks for health care, construction and some other industries, and pioneered insurance products which provide insurance for employers suffering lawsuits alleging discriminatiion or sexual harassment, especially after the disabilities and civil rights legislation of 1991 and 1992. One of the principal features of all these products is risk control programmes, which help customers root out practices which would give rise to legal action, reducing AIG's exposure to potential claims. For example, National Union has assembled a national panel of specialist law firms to help clients deal with litigation by shareholders. AIG's interest in the US liability system has led Mr Greenberg to take a highly visible public stance on environmental laws, which potentially threaten the viability of sections of the insurance industry. Owners or operators of waste sites ordered by the government's environmental agency to clean-up polluted areas under the so-called 'superfund' laws, face a bill for billions of dollars. Many are already suing their insurance companies for the bill and - depending on the decisions of many state and federal courts - much of the cost could eventually hit the insurance industry. Mr Greenberg says AIG's exposure is minimal. 'AIG was a very small company in the 1960s and 1970s when many of these sites were created.' Nevertheless AIG is pressing for change. Mr Greenberg says that reform proposals unveiled earlier this year by the Clinton administration are too 'convoluted', insufficiently different from the current regime and have little chance of becoming law. He will continue to press for reform to a structure which has become 'bizarre' and 'hurts economic development'.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Employers oppose rule change for pensions Senior directors of several large companies including Imperial Chemical Industries and Unilever told MPs at an unpublicised meeting that they opposed a central recommendation of the Goode committee on pensions regulation, it emerged last night. The Goode proposals were drawn up in the wake of the Maxwell scandal. Directors of the companies, which also included the J. Sainsbury and Tesco retail chains, were invited to a meeting by members of the Conservative majority on the Commons social security committee. The directors said they rejected Goode's proposals for legislation ensuring that at least a third of trustees are appointed by scheme members. That was put forward by Goode because employee contributions make up a third of most schemes' assets. The Tory majority on the committee asked the businessmen to give evidence at a special meeting. It was called last week after the Conservatives rejected the first draft of the committee's report. They opposed it for advocating too many new rules. The Tories are determined that the government should avoid over-regulation. The handling of the issue, including the involvement of some of the biggest employers in Britain, has enraged some Labour members of the committee. They are considering publishing a minority report in favour of further regulation to prevent the possibility of further pension scandals. Ministers fear that if the Goode proposal were implemented it might seriously undermine occupational pensions because managements might question the value of such schemes if they did not have absolute control of the trustees. They are 'delighted' that the company chiefs gave evidence to the committee underlining their view that it would be a mistake to over-regulate. The government, which is to publish its white paper later this year, favours a code of 'best practice', which would leave the composition of the board of trustees to the management, as is now the case. While some of the companies which appeared before the committee already allow scheme members to appoint more than a third of trustees, they oppose a change in the law which would force them to comply with the measure. One of the companies said: 'There is now so much regulation that no pension fund can be sure that they are keeping up with the latest requirement.' According to a Whitehall official, the message from employers to ministers is: 'Resist the temptation to over-regulate.' Schemes critical, Page 12</p>

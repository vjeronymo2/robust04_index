			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (3): Stakeholding is the buzzword  -Andrew Adonis analyses the responses of business school students GREEN not mean, pragmatic not Utopian. That sums up the outlook of today's generation of business students - if a recent survey of 700 of them from five continents and 23 countries is any guide. The survey was conducted by the Prince of Wales' Business Forum to coincide with last month's annual congress of the the AISEC international student organisation, held at Brighton in the UK. It shows the extent to which a decade of sloganising about 'stakeholding' and 'responsibility to the environment' have sunk in. Asked to rank the roles of a company in order of importance, the students, whose average age was 21, put high quality goods and services top. Skill training came second and safeguarding the environment third (see inset). Shareholders get short shrift, their interests prioritised (in the management jargon) behind quality, research, workforce, even being 'a positive force for social change.' If that sounds a bit soppy, other questions show the greenery and social conscience of today's students to be of anything but the 'save the whale' variety. On the contrary, their elders might be taken aback by the hard-headed attitude to politics and the world beyond business. Donating funds to not-for-profit organisations came last of the students' priorities, below 'exerting influence on government economic policy'. Corporate reputation and success-within-respectable-bounds are what matter most to the students surveyed, all of them at business schools or studying business at university. It is exhibited graphically in responses to the question: 'which perceptions of a company will be most important for its corporate reputation?' Bottom came: 'Good at spotting short-term opportunities for high profits'; but second from bottom was: 'generous benefactor, contributing to charity'. So Hanson and Rowntree are both out. 'Stakeholding' is the international buzz-word: to the question 'will stakeholders - not just shareholders, but employees, customers, consumers and local communities  - expect more, the same level or less corporate responsibility in the future than today?', nine out of ten said 'more'. Corporate reputation was felt to be particularly important in establishing companies overseas. Here again, however, the element of calculating cost-benefit is barely suppressed: although a little over half of the respondents believed 'corporate community affairs' to be an 'essential aspect of modern good business practice', four in ten thought such matters were best left to the company's marketing and PR departments.

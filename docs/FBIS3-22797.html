			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Admiral Marcel Duval, former chairman of our the </F> National Defense Studies Committee and director of DEFENSE  NATIONALE: "What Future for the Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation  Treaty?"]    [Exerpts] The Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which covers a  25-year period, will expire in 1995. Negotiations will then be  needed to set the terms for its renewal. Admiral Marcel Duvan  was kind enough to carry out an analysis of nonproliferation, of  the treaty, of the concerns of different nuclear and nonnuclear  states, and finally of the prospects for the future,  particularly for our country. We are most grateful to him for  this very complete study. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Future Prospects </H5>   Having taken stock of nonproliferation, the term hitherto  used to describe the totality of measures to prevent the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, let us now examine  its future prospects on the eve of its expiry in 1995. As for  the NPT itself, its indefinite renewal, which naturally is  desired by the nuclear powers, would require an affirmative vote  by 83 countries, since it is estimated that 165 countries will  then be party to it. As the general assumption is that 45  positive votes are guaranteed, those of at least 38 developing  countries will also have to be secured. The Conference of  Nonaligned States, which met in 1992, set the following  conditions for extending the treaty: the cessation of nuclear  tests; an end to the production of nuclear weapons;  implementation of the START treaties; and the total elimination  of these weapons by a given deadline. Furthermore, during the  conference to prepare the revision of the NPT, which took place  in May 1993, it appeared that many nonnuclear states, not all of  which were nonaligned states, will oppose indefinite extension  and may even propose a two-year trial period, at the end of  which their demands would have to be implemented through  international treaties.    We have seen that the United States has now decided to meet  most of these demands by proposing the conclusion of a treaty  totally banning nuclear tests, and of another prohibiting the  production of fissile materials for explosive use. For its  part, the United States has already declared a moratorium on its  tests until 1995, and stopped its production of fissile  materials, while also accepting international monitoring of its  stocks. In addition, it has ceased modernization of its nuclear  arsenal, since, for the first time for 50 years, it is no longer  running a nuclear program now that it has ceased further work on  its mobile strategic missile, and it canceled both its light  strategic missile program and its programs for new nuclear  warheads for its Trident submarine missiles and for new nuclear  missiles for its B2 bombers. It has also undertaken the  dismantling required by the START treaties, even though these  have not yet been ratified by the other parties. In the face of  this voluntary disarmament, some have wondered, analyzing  statements by Americans in senior positions, whether this did  not amount to a delegitimization by the United States of nuclear  weapons so as to derive maximum advantage from its undisputed  conventional superiority over any possible adversaries anywhere  in the world.    Nevertheless, problems may still arise with other  protagonists involved in the renewal of the NPT and the adoption  of any other planned nonproliferation agreements linked to it.  First, take the chaotic situation in the former Soviet Union,  which particularly raises, as has been seen, the problem of  Ukraine's adherence to the NPT. There will then remain the task  of dismantling those nuclear weapons affected by the START  treaty, which will take over 10 years and will require  considerable financial assistance, not to mention the  difficulties arising from the international monitoring of its  implementation. To these concerns we should add, mindful of the  Chernobyl catastrophe, those over the safety of nuclear plants  for peaceful purposes and over the possibility of subjecting  these plants to the controls which will inevitably be required  by a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for  weapons use. Finally, it is obvious that the degree to which all  these proposals are welcomed in 1995 will be primarily  influenced by the actions taken before this expiry by China, the  most "proliferating" state whose actions frequently differ from  its statements and which has the right of veto. It will also  depend on the behavior of the undeclared nuclear powers. In  other words, it will depend on Iraq's respect for its commitment  to accepting long-term monitoring of its disarmament; on the  outcome of the present confrontation over monitoring North  Korea's installations; regarding Israel and Iran, on the peace  process presently under way in the Middle East; while it may be  hoped that the mutual deterrence between India and Pakistan will  prevent their dispute over Kashmir from degenerating into open  war. History teaches us that disarmament of all kinds is far  more often a consequence of peace than the necessary  prerequisite for it. This means that the struggle to prevent  proliferation is undoubtedly far more of a political process,  particularly at a regional level, than a matter of preventive  technocratic measures. This does not imply that the latter have  no effect, even if it is only to do everything possible to avoid  the use of nuclear weapons in haste or in error, since, once the  "nuclear taboo" has been breached, they have failed in their  peace-keeping purpose.  <H5>  Consequences for France </H5>   We now have to consider the consequences of all the above  for  France, which for the past 35 years has based its defense policy  on the peace-keeping effect of nuclear weapons, and has largely  based its foreign policy on the independence of its deterrent.  Thus, the "French exception" in this area will be particularly  challenged by the nonproliferation measures to be submitted in  1995 to the international community.    Of these, the major concern is obviously the total cessation  of nuclear tests, since this not only poses both for ourselves  and for others a threat to the safety of existing weapons, but  would also prevent us from developing new programs, even though  we presently have at least one major one under way, the M5,  which, by considerably increasing both range and performance, is  intended to give our "new generation" of nuclear-missile  launching submarines (SNLE) "all-out" capabilities. To this  technological constraint is added the psychological, and hence  political one, which is bound to challenge the two super powers'  previously-announced renunciation of mobile strategic missiles  and multiple warheads, and of terrestrial and naval tactical  nuclear weapons. In contrast, the cessation of production of  fissile materials for explosive use would not appear to have any  major consequences for our defense, at least over the medium  term.    The increase in "denuclearized zones" would also seriously  limit the freedom of action of our nuclear submarines, as they  presently carry almost 90 percent of our nuclear deterrent  capability. If this process were to extend to Europe, following  the apparently conceivable withdrawal of U.S. airborne nuclear  capacity still deployed there, then this would put an end to the  possibility of eventually establishing a European deterrent.  For this reason, and also to finally frame a common policy in  this matter, it would be desirable to discuss all these  nonproliferation measures within the European Union, or, failing  this, on a Franco-British basis, as allowed by the recent  establishment of a "Joint Commission on Nuclear Policy and  Doctrine." At the national level, it would also appear  desirable to reactivate the "Council on Exterior Nuclear  Relations," set up in 1976 to respond to the concerns then  beginning to be aroused here by proliferation.    The survival of our national deterrent, together with the  need to consider establishing such a deterrent at the European  level, must be justified in terms of the effectiveness to be  expected of them in the face of threats which can be foreseen  over a fairly long term. In this respect, the threat emanating  from the still considerable nuclear arsenals located in the  territory of the former Soviet Union has in no way disappeared,  however unlikely any aggression by them appears at present. The  greatest danger is probably that of the possibility of these  nuclear weapons falling into the hands of groups of varying  degrees of responsibility, for whom the exercise of our  deterrent, backed up by the threat of massive reprisals, would  run the risk both of being unacceptable to international public  opinion, and of being ineffective. The same would apply, we  believe, to any "troublemaker" located outside Europe who, armed  with a few primitive weapons and suitable ballistic vehicles,  would hide in some kind of "aggressive sanctuary," or even  perpetrated nuclear blackmail.    In the face of such possible threats, two schools of thought  are taking shape here. The first holds to the above doctrine,  restricting it to the instance of major aggression, actually  directed against our national territory, for which it feels the  present arsenal is adequate. The second considers there is a  need for a limited "nuclear counterthreat," capable of  deployment overseas and intended to "inhibit" the destructive  capacity of a terrorist state, and if need be to "decapitate"  it. This would require, in the view of this school, very  accurate mobile weapons with reduced collateral effects, with  adjustable power, and the capability to penetrate the ground,  and would thus mean new programs, and hence the need to carry  out tests. In contrast, a rapprochement seems to be emerging  between the two schools over the possible benefits, in the face  of these new threats, in possessing a system based on ballistic  theater antimissiles, or in other words a mobile system, even  though during the Cold War France was opposed to any global  system. Some consider that the disadvantage of establishing  such a system is that it could give the "South" the impression  that it is about to replace the "East" as the Western world's  enemy.    The expiry in 1995 will therefore force us to formulate a  view on all these matters. As for doctrines, we do not feel it  is desirable to specify too closely the future conditions in  which our nuclear deterrent could be used, or particularly to  say what will not be done, so as to keep all our options open.  It appears obvious that this deterrent will not be able to  remain the absolute priority it was during the Cold War; but, as  is amply proved by the present debates over nonproliferation and  also those over the future course of the Security Council, it  will certainly retain its political dimension. As it is no  longer possible to "disinvent" the nuclear weapon, France must  protect itself from its human know-how and its technical  capabilities in this area, as these are largely what will ensure  its future status as a "major medium power," and, if necessary,  its survival if it were to be the object of any major aggression.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Furayh Abu-Middayn, who holds the justice portfolio  in the Palestinian Autonomy Authority, says Israel is prepared  to release all the Palestinian prisoners in exchange for three  soldiers missing since the al-Sultan Ya'qub battle. He asserts  that the prisoner release matter was concluded in Oslo, but the  MIA issue is hindering the release.    Abu-Middayn says Israel is still holding 8,000 Palestinian  prisoners.</p>

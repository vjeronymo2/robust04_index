			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Losses widen to Fl 196m as Fokker takes charges Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer which is majority-owned by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) of Germany, said losses widened to Fl 195.8m (Dollars 110m) in the first half from Fl 127.0m in the same period of 1993. It blamed the deterioration on sizeable charges taken to finance reorganisations and buy back sales contracts as well as charges needed to take account of 'disappointing sales proceeds'. The company, which released the figures after the close of bourse trading, said it expects full-year losses to be lower than the Fl 460m posted in 1993. Fokker described the prospect of narrower full-year losses as a 'turnround point' and repeated earlier forecasts of a return to profitability in 1996. It gave no single figure for first-half charges, which are scattered over various parts of its profit and loss account, but a spokesman described them as 'hefty'. Fokker delivered one Fokker 50 and 14 Fokker 100s in the first six months, and it also delivered other aircraft through lease agreements. At the same time, it signed contracts for the delivery of 35 aircraft at future dates. 'The problem is not so much the number of aeroplanes sold or those that remain unsold but the fact that the difficult conditions on the international aviation market mean that the price we get for our aeroplanes is under pressure,' the spokesman said. Total revenue, including both actual turnover and changes in the valuation of work in progress, fell to Fl 1.41bn from Fl 2.10bn in the first half of 1993. Total costs also fell, but at a slower rate, to Fl 1.72bn from Fl 2.0bn. The results would have been worse if it had not been for the recent Fl 420m sale-and-lease-back of Fokker's technology to Rabobank of the Netherlands. The proceeds, booked as extraordinary gains, were partly offset by extraordinary charges of Fl 225m earmarked for restructuring. The transaction was part of a wider Fl 2bn financial restructuring being carried out with the support of DASA, which belongs to the Daimler-Benz group and which has already extended a Fl 600m convertible loan. The rest of the restructuring involves a Fl 1bn reduction in working capital through the creation of a separate leasing company. Fokker will take a minority stake in the new company.</p>

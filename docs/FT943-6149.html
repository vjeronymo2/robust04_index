			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Tiny Rowland faces his day of reckoning: Roland Rudd and Robert Peston look back to 1973 to explain why Lonrho's great survivor will find it harder to win this time 'In the best interests of the company, Mr Roland Rowland should cease to hold the office of chief executive.' Thus spoke the majority of Lonrho's board in 1973, but Mr Tiny Rowland survived. More than two decades, later Mr Rowland may face a similar motion from an equally hostile board, following disclosures of what Mr Rowland costs the company in salary, expenses and other costs under his direct control and the sale of a film to a company connected to Libya. At a board meeting tomorrow, Mr Dieter Bock, the German joint chief executive of the international trading and mining group, may attempt to win the majority vote of directors needed to strip Mr Rowland of his chief executive title. The issue which has brought the current battle to a head appears to be far removed from the last attempt to topple Mr Rowland. Mr Rowland's recent decision to sell a film on the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie to an Egyptian company connected to Lafico, Libya's trading arm, possibly breaching United Nations sanctions, has infuriated Mr Bock's supporters. But, in reality, the Pounds 200,000 Libyan sale has only brought hostilities to a head. They have been been simmering for the past year between the two joint chief executives whom Mr Rowland last year called 'indivisible'. Mr Bock's main reason for wanting to get rid of Mr Rowland is strikingly similar to those of the so-called 'straight eight' led by the then deputy chairman, Sir Basil Smallpeice in 1973. The majority of directors are now said to be shocked to discover that Mr Rowland, who is 76 and has run Lonrho for 33 years, costs the company more than Pounds 5.5m a year in salary, expenses and other costs under his direct control. A Financial Times analysis shows: Mr Rowland's salary is more than Pounds 1.2m; He receives almost Pounds 500,000 as a contribution to the costs of his two homes, in Chester Square, London, and Hedsor Wharf in Buckinghamshire; Lonrho's Gulfstream private jet costs about Pounds 2m a year in running and finance costs; About Pounds 200,000 is paid by Lonrho for the education of dependents of African politicians and agents; There is almost Pounds 1m of other personal business expenses related to the winning of international business; More than Pounds 300,000 is incurred in costs relating to employees who work directly for Mr Rowland. What is remarkable is that Mr Rowland should continue to be such a substantial cost centre for the company 21 years after he was first criticised for his lavish corporate lifestyle. In 1973, the company owned Mr Rowland's house, and he lived in it rent free. At the time, the board estimated that this represented implicit payments to Mr Rowland of Pounds 300,000 in total since the house had been bought in the late 1960s. His business expenses were running at around Pounds 1m a year and the use of his Mystere jet angered the majority of the board's directors as much as it does today. Disclosure of Mr Rowland's expenses during Lonrho's first boardroom battle, as well as other revelations about the company, prompted the then UK prime minister, Sir Edward Heath, to remark that 'it is an unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism'. Mr Rowland sought to justify the costs on the grounds that only by entertaining African politicians in a lavish manner could the company reinforce its business links with the continent. He argued it would be 'disastrous for the company' if he was to relinquish the role of chief executive. With more than 75 per cent of the group's profits derived from Africa, he could with some force argue that he was integral to the company's success. No one has ever disputed Mr Rowland's contacts or ability to work with African leaders. But Lonrho in 1994 is a different company. Africa is no longer seen as so important to its future. There is no longer the threat of the nationalisation of Lonrho's African assets if the company was to remove Mr Rowland as chief executive, as there was in the 1970s. Moreover, a greater proportion of Lonrho's African earnings today comes from mines in Ghana and South Africa, rather than general trading profits. Mr Rowland also faces a more formidable opponent in Mr Bock than he did in Mr Smallpeice. The German financier, owner of 18.8 per cent of the com-pany's shares, has already swept out most of the old guard on the board who supported Mr Rowland through thick and thin. He has also succeeded in bringing in the first non-executives to the board for more than two decades. Out of the 13 directors on Lonrho's board Mr Rowland can count only on the support of the chairman, Mr Rene Leclezio, who retires at the end of October and Mr Robert Dunlop, who retires at the end of September. One African director, Mr Sam Jonah from Ghana, may abstain in the event of a vote to remove Mr Rowland as chief executive. But the remaining nine, which include the two non-executives, may be as united as their predecessors in wanting to strip Mr Rowland of his executive powers. If they succeed, Mr Rowland could try to appeal over their heads directly to shareholders, as he did in the 1970s, by trying to call an extraordinary general meeting. But this time he would have to find a sympathetic big shareholder or buy another 3.5 per cent to take his shareholding up to the 10 per cent required to call an EGM. The last time he faced dismissal from the board he owned about 20 per cent of the company. Unlike 20 years ago, Mr Rowland can no longer count on the support of any army of loyal shareholders. Investment institutions, most of them supportive of Mr Bock, now control around 40 per cent of the shares. The odds are therefore stacked heavily against Mr Rowland's continued survival as joint chief executive. Indeed, if 75 per cent of the board were against him, he could lose his place on the board altogether. But as the first 'straight eight' experienced to their detriment, a majority on Lonrho's board does not necessarily ensure victory against Mr Rowland. It is likely to be a nerve-wracking 24 hours for the majority of Lonrho's directors.</p>

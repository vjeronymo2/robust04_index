			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System The French franc firmed at the end of last week to its best levels against the D-Mark in almost a month as political tensions surrounding European monetary union faded. The franc ended at 2 per cent of its allowed swing above its central Ecu rate.  The peseta was undermined by news that the Spanish budget deficit rose to Ptas 1.1 trillion in the first five months of 1992 against Ptas 700bn in the same period last year.</p>

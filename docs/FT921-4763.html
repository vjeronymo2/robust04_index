			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome Wellcome must be gratified to note that the week after the announcement of the Wellcome Trust divestment has seen a drop in the company's shares of only 9 per cent. Since the sale may triple the amount of stock in the market, the reaction suggests there is something to the argument that dealing liquidity has a value almost as great as that of scarcity. The question is whether the future will continue so smoothly. The Wellcome sale may be equivalent to a large privatisation, but there are significant differences. In particular, the seller is not a government anxious to curry favour with voters. The main interest of the Wellcome Trust is to extract the best price from its holding, which hardly points to discount deals yielding instant profit for small private investors. That presumably means heavy reliance on overseas and UK institutional investors. A tender system similar to that which operated for the recent BT sale would establish a satisfactory clearing price for such buyers. But, in the end, the price will be heavily influenced by demand from the US. Growing signs of recovery there this week ought to mean investors will place a diminishing emphasis on pharmaceuticals in favour of cyclical stocks.</p>

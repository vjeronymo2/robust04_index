			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BICC completes purchase of KWO BICC, the cables and construction group, yesterday announced it had completed the purchase of KWO, Germany's third largest cable maker. KWO has been bought for DM58m (Pounds 24m) from the Treuhandanstalt, the agency responsible for privatising industry in eastern Germany. The company, located around the industrial heartland of east Berlin, makes telecommunications cabling, signalling equipment and power cables. Nearly a fifth of its turnover is exported to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Mr David Hingston, managing director of the newly named KWO Kabel, said BICC was also committed to capital spending of DM80m by the middle of 1994, as part of the 'huge restructuring costs' involved in making KWO competitive and profitable. The Treuhand has borne the cost of redundancies as the workforce has been cut from 8,000 three years ago to 2,200. Last year, KWO recorded turnover of DM320m, 'a low figure because of the restructuring,' Mr Hingston said. He added that the new company was expected to increase turnover to DM400m next year. The management, which is largely British but will be predominantly German by the end of this year, stressed it was determined to increase productivity. Productivity is currently two thirds, and wages 60 per cent, of western German levels. The KWO acquisition has provided one of the outlets for the Pounds 154m BICC raised in a rights issue last May. It also bought a North American cables company and increased its stake in GEGC of Spain. About 40 per cent of the turnover in BICC Cables (a separate division from the North American and Australasian cables operations) comes from continental Europe. The group had total turnover of Pounds 3.79bn in 1991.</p>

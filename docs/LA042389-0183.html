			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER VIETNAMESE AND FORMER CIA CHIEF  </P> <P> I was deeply incensed by Councilman Frank Fry's remark about the South  Vietnamese. The cultural diversity that surrounds me in Orange County is  something that I cherish. I live next to Little Saigon and I delight in its  differentness, just as I do in other areas of the county that house other races  and ethnic groups.  </P> <P> When I am allowed to participate in a ceremony or event such as the Tet  Festival, which I enjoyed, I am given the chance to glimpse a part of our large  world. Fry's desire for a community of homogenized clones would lead to a  bleak, monotonous life.  </P> <P> KAREN M. ALLEN  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SKIPPER TO QUIT NAVY AFTER TRIAL IN REFUGEE CASE  </P> <P> Capt. Alexander Balian, the Navy skipper convicted last month of dereliction of  duty for failing to rescue a boatload of Vietnamese refugees, said Tuesday that  he is resigning from the Navy after 26 years because he believes he will never  again be allowed to command a ship.  </P> <P> "I don't see the Navy assigning me to a command at sea again, which is what I  love, so I intend to pursue endeavors that will give me similar satisfaction,"  Balian said in an interview. "I'm going to make it easy on the Navy."  </P> <P> Balian was convicted last month in a court-martial for failing to give adequate  aid to the refugees, who were drifting in a junk in the South China Sea last  June 9 when they encountered the Dubuque, an amphibious transport dock  commanded by Balian. He ordered that they be given food, water and directions  to the nearest land, but decided not to pick them up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drifted Another 19 Days  </P> <P> The refugees drifted another 19 days after the Dubuque passed them by, and have  said they resorted to cannibalism when their supplies ran out.  </P> <P> Shortly after his court-martial ended at the Subic Bay Naval Base in the  Philippines, Balian said he would remain in the Navy and fight the conviction  as well as the Navy order relieving him of command of the Dubuque.  </P> <P> Balian said Tuesday that he will continue his legal appeals, but decided to  leave the Navy because of its insistence that he take a desk job in  </P> <P> Washington, where he was to have become assistant chief of staff for the Naval  Telecommunications Command.  </P> <P> Balian has been visiting relatives in Los Angeles and was in San Diego on  Tuesday to consult with his attorneys, Dan Donato and Lt. Cmdr. Ronald  Petronio, who are preparing his appeal.  </P> <P> Balian, who grew up in Los Angeles, had requested that he be transferred to a  base somewhere in California, but was told there were no jobs available for  him, he said. After he notified Navy officials that he intends to resign, they  agreed to assign him to an unspecified job at the Naval Shipyard in Long Beach  until his resignation takes effect July 31, Balian said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hoping for Reversal  </P> <P> He, his wife and two daughters have been living in Sasebo, Japan, where the  Dubuque is based. He said he wants his daughters, who have reached college age,  to be able to attend California universities as residents of the state so that  their tuition will be lower.  </P> <P> "But the ultimate reason why I did it (resigned) is that I'm hoping the appeal  will reverse this case, but, even if it does, the stigma attached to this  situation . . . in my mind terminates the potential to excel in this Navy  career, to advance or get a position of command at sea," he said.  </P> <P> Balian, 48, a highly decorated veteran of the Vietnam War, was on the Navy's  fast track and was a likely candidate for eventual promotion to admiral before  the refugee incident occurred.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Hung Out to Dry'  </P> <P> In a bitter statement to reporters in the Philippines last month, Balian said  he had been made a "scapegoat" by the Navy and was "hung out to dry."  </P> <P> The Navy began investigating the incident last summer after the surviving  refugees were rescued by Philippine fishermen and began telling stories of  killing and cannibalism that occurred aboard the junk.  </P> <P> About 110 refugees boarded the junk at Ben Tre in southern Vietnam last May 22  for what they believed would be a four- or five-day trip to Malaysia. But the  craft's engine failed on the third day out. Only 52 people survived.  </P> <P> Balian argued that, at the time of the encounter, he believed the junk was  seaworthy and that the supplies he provided would sustain them for the seven  days it would take them to reach land.  </P></p>

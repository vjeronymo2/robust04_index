			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / After the deluge: Andrew Hill watches the clean-up in flood-ravaged Piedmont The search for culprits began before the rain stopped. The civil protection agency, hydroelectric companies, politicians, crooked engineers and cowboy builders all came under suspicion. But the Piedmontese know where responsibility lies for the devastating floods early last month. They can even name names: Tanaro, Belbo, Borbore, and many more - the tributaries of the river Po and the tributaries' tributaries, which during the weekend of November 5-6 swelled and burst, leaving more than 60 people dead, thousands homeless, and many of the region's thriving small businesses under a metre of mud. Visiting the Tanaro valley this week, it was difficult to find the smallest watercourses. They have all returned to the innocent-looking culverts and gullies out of which they broke a month ago. Even the wide Tanaro hides itself under swathes of fog for most of the morning. But if you take the road from Asti to Alba (you have to drive: the railway alongside the road is still a flood-buckled wreck), you get an idea of the damage wrought by the river that joins the two towns. Although the valley is miles inland, it is like following the course of an estuary at low tide. Four weeks on, with the help of government grants, the army, and volunteers from as far away as Venice and Sardinia, Piedmont is picking itself up. The worst-hit factories are still not admitting visitors, and it was only on Thursday that Ferrero, the Alba-based confectionery company, officially recognised that the worst of the crisis was over with a ceremony of thanks to the municipality and the soldiers who helped clean up the chocolate factory. In other Italian regions, still struggling with the aftermath of recession, cynics now claim that the flood will prove a perverse boon for an already wealthy region, with insurance companies and emergency subsidies paying for new machinery. That is not how they see things at Sacla, one of Italy's best-known small producers of vegetable preserves, pickles and pasta sauces. At 3am on the morning of Sunday, November 6, the few staff present at the Asti headquarters were anxiously watching the torrential Borbore, a tributary of the Tanaro, when the Tanaro itself came in through the back door and submerged the factory's storage tanks, computers, archives and 550 tonnes of produce. 'Everything that was touched by the water - even if it was already packed and hermetically sealed - was thrown out,' says the cigar-toting Lorenzo Ercole, managing director and son of the company's founder. Unlike many smaller companies, Sacla was insured. But the total damage could cost L5bn (Pounds 2m), compared with annual turnover of about L120bn, and Ercole is not sure all that can be recovered. However, from the beginning, he has insisted that Sacla should not 'play the victim', as he puts it, if only because he feared clients, particularly Italian stores, would switch to other suppliers if they thought Sacla was suffering. In fact, Ercole claims that only one full day of production was lost and the most important part of the factory - the bottling department - was unaffected. The workforce rallied round immediately, and by Sunday afternoon, was already beginning sgomberare the factory, to use the resonant Italian term for cleaning up. The same story is told by other companies across Piedmont. At Ferrero in Alba, more than 1,000 workers pitched in to save the Christmas sales of the famous pralines, such as Ferrero Rocher and Mon Cheri. Across the hills in Canelli, centre of the spumante sparkling wine district, employees of Gancia, the oldest spumante manufacturer in Italy, turned out to salvage the company's grape-pressing equipment at nearby San Stefano Belbo. Franco Ferrero, who normally works in the Gancia export department, says that when he arrived in the afternoon, the stainless steel equipment, installed only five years ago, was invisible beneath a metre of muddy water. Gancia was lucky. Shortly after the floods, Vittorio Gancia, the patriarch of the 145-year-old family-run company, was able to reassure customers that 'Gancia spumante will, as always, grace Italians' Christmas dinner tables'. But the town of Canelli, royally overlooked by the Gancia family castello, has only just cleared the layer of mud from the central square. Max Gancia, export director of the company, estimates that about 80 per cent of the town's shops and offices were affected. It took a week for electricity, gas and fresh water to be restored to some areas. It may be true that Piedmont's medium-sized companies, often cited as the power behind the Italian economy, will not lose much from the crisis. Compared with small-time farmers, they are mostly reasonably well-insured or have sufficient cash flow to pay for the clean-up. But if nothing else, these modern entrepreneurs have relearned a lesson that their more down-to-earth grandparents and great-grandparents knew well: you may be able to count on export and profit growth, but you should never take the gurgling stream next door for granted.</p>

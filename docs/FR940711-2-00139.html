			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Changes Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Amex has neither solicited nor received any comments from its members, participants, or others. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  states that exchange rules should be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and processing information with respect to securities transactions and to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The risks posed by uncompared trades and by the long span of time between trade execution and trade comparison (as long as five business days for equity transactions until 1990) came under intense scrutiny after the Market Break of October 1987. The leading studies of the Market Break of 1987 identified uncompared trades as a major stress point in post-trade processing which, together with the unprecedented trading volume and the unprecedented price volatility during the Market Break, posed an unacceptable threat to the marketplace. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  The Commission, in its recommendations to Congress in February of 1988, proposed that markets accelerate their efforts to compare all trades on trade date. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> For an analysis of the 1987 Market Break and the changes in clearance and settlement effected in response, refer to Division of Market Regulation, Market Analysis of October 13 and 16, 1989,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 118&hyph;129 (December 1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Testimony on the Securities and Exchange Commission's Recommendations Regarding the October 1987 Market Break delivered by David S. Ruder, Chairman, Commission, before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs at 23&hyph;24 (February 3, 1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since 1988, the Amex, among others, has sought to improve clearing operations and to reduce exposure to losses associated with market volatility occurring during the period between execution and settlement. The Amex reduced its comparison cycle in stocks first from T+5 to T+3 and then to T+1 in 1990. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated above, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change which shortens the Amex comparison cycle from T+1 to trade date will make Amex's comparison process safer in terms of the risks resulting from market price volatility and more efficient in terms of the time and expense involved in post-trade processing. The Commission believes that the proposal will offer additional protection to investors, brokers, and other persons that safeguard investors' funds and facilitate investors' transactions. In the Commission's view, this proposal will provide fundamental and important improvements to the marketplace. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filings in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Trade-date comparison is to be phased-in by both Amex and NYSE on a parallel schedule, and the NYSE has begun some aspects of its phase-in program. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  Accelerated approval of this proposal will permit Amex, as well as the NYSE and NSCC, to provide their clearing members with a more coordinated implementation of trade-date comparison. Furthermore, because neither the Commission nor NYSE received any written comments on the NYSE's proposal, which was very similar to the Amex's proposal, and because the Amex did not receive any comments from its members in response to its Information Circular, <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  the Commission does not expect to receive any comments on this proposal. Therefore, the Commission believes there is good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a discussion of the NYSE's implementation of trade-date comparison, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34153 (June 3, 1994), 59 FR 30071 [File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;08] (order approving proposed rule change). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Implementation of Equity Trade Date Comparison,'' Amex Information Circular  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 94&hyph;147 (April 6, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

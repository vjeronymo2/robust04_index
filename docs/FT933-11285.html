			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Finance shake-up at Independent MR ANDREAS Whittam Smith yesterday announced he is stepping down as chief executive of Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent and Independent on Sunday, after nearly six years. He has combined the jobs of editor of The Independent and chief executive since early in the life of the publication. A financial restructuring, which will probably involve a rights issue, is planned when a new chief executive is in place. 'I have come to the conclusion that doing both jobs is bad for the company and bad for me,' Mr Whittam Smith said yesterday. Mr Ian Hay Davidson, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, said the restructuring would almost certainly lead to a change in the balance of the company's shareholdings. Two European newspaper groups - El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy  -are the largest shareholders, each with 18 per cent. Both have indicated their willingness to go to 50 per cent each. While not ruling this out Mr Whittam Smith yesterday emphasised that he was seeking 'a plurality of shareholders'. Before extra cash is raised the company will draw down around Pounds 3m from its overdraft facility - Pounds 1.5m for each title - to fund immediate developments. Existing cash, cost-cuttings and cash flow are likely to take the money available to between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m although the company would not confirm the exact figure. The money will be used to introduce colour printing on both titles and pay for new sections and for promotion. These decisions come at a time of falling sales and the failure of the company's attempt to buy the Observer. Apart from editing The Independent Mr Whittam Smith will 'keep an eye on' the Independent on Sunday as group editor-in-chief. Mr Ian Jack will continue to edit the Sunday paper and Mr Whittam Smith's fellow founder Mr Matthew Symmonds will remain executive editor of the daily. Mr Whittam Smith will become deputy chairman of Newspaper Publishing.</p>

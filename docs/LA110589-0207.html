			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP WRAPUP;  </P> <P> NEW-LOOK CARSON WINS ON FINESSE; ERRATIC BANNING FALLS TO CRENSHAW  </P> <P> There's a new look to the Banning and Carson football teams as they prepare for  their annual showdown Thursday night at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Banning looks uncharacteristically erratic, as evidenced by a 20-18 loss to  Crenshaw on Friday.  </P> <P> And Carson, once the model of hard-running football, has developed into, of all  things, a finesse team on offense.  </P> <P> Is nothing sacred?  </P> <P> Carson went to a four-receiver passing offense last year to take advantage of  the talents of quarterbacks Perry Klein and Fred Gatlin. But the Colts kept  defenses honest with a balanced attack that featured running back Errol Sapp  and an outstanding offensive line.  </P> <P> This season, Carson is passing out of necessity because of an inexperienced  group of running backs and offensive linemen. Through seven games, the Colts  (6-1) have passed for 1,000 more yards than they've rushed for, 1560-560.  </P> <P> "There's no way we can run over teams like we used to," Coach Gene Vollnogle  said. "We have to out-finesse them. We'd like to run the ball, but we're just  not physically able to do that."  </P> <P> The Colts never tried to establish a running game Friday night in a 29-8  Pacific League-opening win over Dorsey at Veterans Stadium. Quarterback Armin  Youngblood came out throwing and didn't stop until he had shattered the school  record with 40 attempts.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Carson, most of the passes failed to find their way to Colt  receivers. Youngblood was only 16 of 40 and was intercepted five times, setting  a rather dubious school record in the process.  </P> <P> But with the help of a dominating defense and the sure hands of wide receiver  Michael Ross, the Colts didn't need many completions to destroy Dorsey.  Youngblood finished with 298 yards passing and three touchdowns.  </P> <P> Ross became the most prolific pass receiver in Carson history with eight  catches for 205 yards and touchdowns of 71 and 29 yards. The school records set  by the senior included:  </P> <P> Most catches in a career, 65, breaking the old mark of 64 set by Jamie Williams  in 1982-83.  </P> <P> Most receiving yardage in a career, 1,266, breaking the old mark of 1,241 set  by Williams.  </P> <P> Most receiving yardage in a game, 205, breaking the old mark of 172 set by  Melvin Smith in 1984.  </P> <P> Most touchdown catches in a career, 17, tying the record shared by Wesley  Walker (1971-72) and Ron Carver (1966-67).  </P> <P> Most touchdown catches in a season, 10, tying the record shared by Walker  (1971) and Michael Wilson (1976).  </P> <P> "I'm a little surprised," said Ross, when informed of his 205-yard night. "But  I had a feeling I was close to 200. I just try to make the big plays."  </P> <P> Vollnogle says Carson will be more capable of making big plays when Tydus  Winans, the Colts' other starting wide receiver, returns to the lineup. Winans  sat out his second consecutive game with a strained achilles tendon, but might  return for Thursday's 7 p.m. game with Banning.  </P> <P> "Hopefully we'll get the other half of our offense going (next week) with  Winans," Vollnogle said.  </P> <P> Somewhat overlooked, except to the coaches, has been the excellent play of  Carson's defense.  </P> <P> Led by linebackers Edgar Ta'Ase and Nkosi Littleton, the Colts held Dorsey to  46 total yards and just two yards rushing. They have allowed only 106 yards  rushing this season, but are a long way from the school record.  </P> <P> The 1987 Carson defense gave up minus 90 yards rushing in 12 games. If you are  wondering how a team could hold opponents to minus yardage for an entire  season, remember that sacks count against rushing totals in prep football.  </P> <P> In 1987, outside linebacker Arnold Ale, who is redshirting at UCLA after  playing for Notre Dame's national championship team last year, set Carson  records for most sacks (22), most tackles for losses (43) and most yards  tackled for losses (222) in a season.  </P> <P> Banning, after building an 18-0 lead midway through the third quarter,  eventually lost to Crenshaw when Kevin Hicks returned a punt 79 yards for a  touchdown with 4:37 left to play at Gardena High.  </P> <P> Vollnogle said he will try to keep the ball away from Hicks when Carson meets  Crenshaw on Nov. 17.  </P> <P> "That guy is super," the coach said. "He's the best running back I've seen.  We're not going to kick the ball to him. He's like the Rocket (Raghib Ismail)  they have at Notre Dame."  </P> <P> Vollnogle didn't think Banning's first loss (the Pilots are 6-1-1) would have  much of an effect on either team heading into Thursday's game.  </P> <P> "I don't think it will bother them," he said. "The Banning-Carson game is still  the Banning-Carson game. Banning is going to play their best game, and  hopefully we're going to play our best game."  </P> <P> The message on the marquee outside Hawthorne High on Friday night read, "This  is the big one!"  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Hawthorne, it turned out to be a big one for the Leuzinger  football team.  </P> <P> The Olympians assured themselves of a spot in the Southern Section Division II  playoffs with a 23-14 victory, handing Hawthorne its first loss of the year and  dropping the Cougars into a first-place tie in the Bay League with Palos  Verdes.  </P> <P> "They kicked our butts, that's all there is to it," said Hawthorne Coach Goy  Casillas, whose team, ranked No. 1 in Division II, fell to 8-1 overall and 5-1  in league play.  </P> <P> Quarterback-defensive back Zac Odom was perhaps Leuzinger's most determined  player. After allowing Hawthorne wide receiver Jermaine Jones to slip past him  for a six-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter, Odom tripped and fell on  the Hawthorne track. This led to some finger-pointing by Jones.  </P> <P> Odom responded by leading Leuzinger to 16 unanswered points in the second  quarter, including a two-yard touchdown run. Hawthorne pulled within 16-14 on a  39-yard run by tailback Chris Alexander in the third quarter, but Odom again  gave Leuzinger a cushion with a 54-yard touchdown pass to receiver Donald Byrd.  </P> <P> With one game remaining, Leuzinger (7-1-1, 4-1-1) pulled a half-game behind  co-leaders Hawthorne and Palos Verdes (8-1, 5-1) in the Bay League race. All  have clinched playoff berths.  </P> <P> Still fighting for a post-season bid are Rolling Hills (6-2-1, 3-2-1) and Santa  Monica (5-3, 3-3). With only four possible spots available, counting a  wild-card berth, the last playoff position will be determined in Thursday's  Palos Verdes-Rolling Hills and Leuzinger-Santa Monica games.  </P> <P> Most teams play on Thursday this week because Veterans Day will be honored on  Friday.  </P> <P> West Torrance clinched its first league title in three years Friday night with  a decisive 52-14 win over visiting North Torrance.  </P> <P> The Ocean League champions were led by running back Josh Moore, who scored  three touchdowns on runs of 34, 7 and 93 yards to help the Warriors improve to  8-1 overall and 6-0 in league play. North (2-7, 2-4) was eliminated from  playoff contention.  </P> <P> The lone bright spot for North was wide receiver Eric Hansen, who caught eight  passes to give him a South Bay single-season record of 80. He also moved into  the No. 10 spot on the all-time CIF-Southern Section list.  </P> <P> After West, four Ocean League teams are contending for the two remaining  guaranteed spots in Division VII playoffs. In games Thursday, second-place  South (4-2 in league) faces North, third-place Redondo (3-2-1) meets Mira Costa  (3-3), and Morningside (3-3) plays last-place Centennial.  </P></p>

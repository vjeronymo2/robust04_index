			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Uruguay Round 'would protect food standards' A URUGUAY Round world trade agreement would protect, in some cases enhance, food safety standards, not undermine them, as many environmental lobbyists claim, a report* by the Consumers Union, a leading US consumer group, says. The present draft Uruguay Round text, blocked over farm subsidies, would 'clearly allow the US to keep all its standards, only some of which are higher than Codex' - the Rome-based Codex Alimentarius Commission which sets international food standards. The Consumers Union says it has written pledges from the Bush administration that US standards would not be diminished. International harmonisation could improve US food safety standards, it adds, noting 27 per cent fall below international standards, it adds. The report debunks 19 'myths' created by environmental lobbyists to suggest the Round would erode national sovereign rights to protect the environment and set high food safety standards. *Understanding Gatt: Is the Uruguay Round a Benefit to Consumers or Threat to Food Safety and the Environment.

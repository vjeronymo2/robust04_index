			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Auditors qualify accounts of Regalian Properties THE uncertain future of the UK property market has prompted auditors to qualify the accounts of Regalian Properties, one of the best-known UK-quoted property companies. Ernst &amp; Young, the auditors, qualified the accounts because of 'the very considerable uncertainty that continues to affect the property markets and the difficulty of placing valuations on potential development sites,' together with the uncertain timing of property sales and risk of a breach of bank covenants. Regalian's fate is likely to be shared by many other property developers this year, in the view of Mr Eugene Bannon, an Ernst &amp; Young partner. 'It will not be unusual to find qualification on uncertainty of value,' he warned. 'We are required to get supporting evidence (for valuations). In a stagnant or bombed-out market, it is very difficult to get that evidence,' he said. Mr David Goldstone, chairman of Regalian, said he believed that auditors' caution concerning property accounts had been heightened by the recent difficulties of Olympia &amp; York, Speyhawk, Mountleigh and Heron. The problems in valuing property were highlighted last week when Heron's portfolio was valued at Pounds 1bn, Pounds 300m less than a valuation a month earlier. Regalian, which announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 26.8m (Dollars 48.77m) for the year to March 31 and passed its final dividend, made provisions of Pounds 32.9m against its portfolio. A block of luxury flats in Kensington Palace Gardens and a development site at Paddington, both in London, are the chief sources of uncertainty. Although Kensington Palace Gardens is now valued at about half the asking price of Pounds 120m a year ago, the unusual nature of the building makes it difficult to value. The auditors also queried the timing of Regalian's planned development in Paddington, still valued at Pounds 23m. A provision of Pounds 5m was taken against a Pounds 10m development site at Heron Quay in London's Docklands, which has been mothballed because of the insolvency of Olympia &amp; York, its partner. Mr Goldstone's son Lee, who has worked at Regalian for 12 years, has left because of the constraints on new development over the next four years. Regalian's net asset per share fell from 146.8p to 104.8p. At its year-end, it had gross debt of Pounds 130.1m and net assets of Pounds 122.7m. The loss per share was 19.74p, compared with last year's earnings of 8.02p. The share price fell from 22p to 15p. Lex, Page 16</p>

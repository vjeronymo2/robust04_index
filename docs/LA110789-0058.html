			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> DEPOT RESTAURANT LEASE APPROVAL DUE  </P> <P> The City Council is expected to ratify a seven-year lease today with a new  operator for a restaurant and bar in the 94-year-old Capistrano Depot.  </P> <P> A proposal to the Community Redevelopment Agency from City Manager Stephen B.  Julian would have Trackside Dining Inc. take over the business in the aging  train station which the city bought two years ago for $910,000.  </P> <P> Terms of the proposed lease, which has two, seven-year renewable options, start  at 4% of gross sales for the first year, with a minimum monthly rent of $3,500.  Rent would increase in the second year to 5% of gross sales with a $6,000  monthly minimum. For the remaining five years, rent would be 6% of sales, with  an $8,000 monthly minimum, according to Julian's report.  </P> <P> One of four finalists in the city's two-year search, Trackside Dining consists  of a partnership between Utah restaurant manager Peter Henderson, and Orange  County building contractors Eric Hooykaas and Stephen Dahle. The company owns a  cafe in a former railroad station in Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> Henderson said that once the agreement is final, he would shut the depot in  January for five months to refurbish the interior and to comply with a city-  funded asbestos removal project.  </P> <P> "The thing that sold me to the property was the architecture," Henderson said  of the quaint, Victorian-style brick station covered with thick bougainvillea  bushes.  </P> <P> The station was built in 1895 by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway  Co. as a stop between San Diego and Los Angeles. It now serves several hundred  Amtrak commuters on 16 daily trains along that same route.  </P> <P> In the 1960s, the little-used station was boarded up by the railroad. Brothers  Jim and Pete Tyson bought it and opened a restaurant in 1975 and continued to  operate it after the city bought it. Their contract expires Dec. 31.  </P> <P> "When I first started here as a busboy, we used to have to take a flag and run  up and down the tracks for 250 yards to get the train to stop," said restaurant  manager Jim Conter, a 14-year employee.

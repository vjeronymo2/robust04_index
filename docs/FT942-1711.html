			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Drug cartel link denied Colombia's president-elect Mr Ernesto Samper yesterday vehemently denied accusations that his election campaign had benefited from contributions by the country's Cali cocaine cartel. A tape containing conversations allegedly detailing possible contributions was released in Bogota yesterday, only three days after the the election success of Mr Samper, a member of the ruling Liberal party. The tape was released by Mr Samper's defeated opponent, the Conservative Mr Andres Pastrana. The prosecutor general is investigating the case. Mr Samper said his campaign treasury had not received any money 'of doubtful origin' and offered his accounts to the prosecutor general for examination. Mr Pastrana played the tape and said it could not in any way be interpreted as involving his own campaign. He asked Mr Samper to issue a statement saying he would resign as president-elect if it was shown the Liberal treasury had received money from drug traffickers. Diplomats have said they would be surprised if some drug money had not entered the campaign of both the run-off candidates, though they stressed this could have occurred without the candidates' knowledge.</p>

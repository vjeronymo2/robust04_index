			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Observer: Legal device Mary Arden, the QC who was recently made a judge, seems suddenly to have changed her title. As a senior legal counsel, she was always referred to as Miss. Now on the bench, she has become a Mrs. Confusingly, she is married, but has always retained her maiden name as a trade name. Apparently judges cannot be referred to as Miss, the joke being that they are all married - at least to the law.</p>

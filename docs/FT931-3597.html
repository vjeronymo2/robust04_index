			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Newcastle stadium project The redevelopment of Newcastle United FC's north stand (pictured above) at St James's Park has begun following the award of a Pounds 5.6m design and construction contract to the BALLAST NEDAM CONSTRUCTION company. The redevelopment calls for replacement of the 4,000 standing capacity with a new stand and two wrap-around stands to the east and west of the new stand which will provide seating for approximately 11,100 people. The main structure will be built in steel which will support the pre-cast concrete terrace deck, stair and wall components.</p>

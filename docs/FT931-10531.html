			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / People: Charles Schwab to set up in UK Ethel Daly is moving to London to set up shop in Mayfair on behalf of America's biggest discount stockbroker Charles Schwab. 'It had always been part of our strategy to come to Europe; it was just a question of timing,' says Daly, newly appointed managing director of the international division, who arrives to tell the story of the US recovery, and the relative attractiveness of equities since dollar interest rates are so low. She has been at Schwab, which boasts a 49 per cent share of the discount market at home, and has around 2m active investors with Dollars 66bn in client assets, since 1987. Her last job was as senior vice-president of retail service delivery which involved managing 90 branch and seven regional offices in the eastern part of America. She says she has a fair amount of international experience, including during her time at Crocker National Bank in the late 1970s where, working on the foreign exchange operation systems side, she led a group representing West Coast banks which were then introducing the European payments system SWIFT. With chairman and founder Charles Schwab in London next month to launch a new product and unveil the European strategy, Daly will not elaborate on the service she, with two others, proposes to market. And the competition? 'I'm trying not to be arrogant, but in terms of the overall package, I don't think there is anybody,' she comments from the company's headquarters in San Francisco.</p>

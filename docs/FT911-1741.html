			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Blenheim rises 27% to Pounds 18.4m in tough trading BLENHEIM GROUP, the exhibition and conference organiser, shrugged off difficult UK trading conditions to report a 27 per cent advance from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 18.4m in interim pre-tax profits. The shares gained 27p in yesterday's rising market to 820p. Mr Neville Buch, chairman, attributed the profits advance to Blenheim's strategy of reducing its dependence on any single currency bloc, sector or event. 'Following the acquisitions made in previous years, we have been consolidating our position and developing the profitability and prospects for the group's portfolio of events.' The dividend for the half-year to February 28 was pitched at 7p (6p) on earnings per share of 47.4p (40.7p). The French contribution at Pounds 31.2m (Pounds 31.5m) was again the largest slice of group turnover of Pounds 71m (Pounds 51m). But the areas of fastest growth were the US with Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 1.6m), Switzerland Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 300,000) and the UK with Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 10.5m). Mr Buch projected that 'further benefits' from acquisitions and from 'ongoing attention to management systems and controls' would materialise in coming months. Some 95.6 per cent of projected revenues for the full-year had been realised or contracted. Interest payments on the group's net debt of Pounds 26.2m more than quadrupled to Pounds 2.7m and the shareholders' funds figure in the balance-sheet remained strongly negative. Interest cover was comfortable enough, with operating profits of Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 14.6m), The group has decided to change its financial year-end to December 31 with effect from September 1 1991. Directors intend to recommend two interim dividends and a final payment during the 16 months to end-December 1992. COMMENT Blenheim appears to be growing up. The onset of a period of consolidation after its rapid expansion of the 1980s is coinciding with a more sober presentational approach. This may not be unrelated to the hard-nosed football writer Mr Phil Soar's appointment as group managing director. The day may even dawn when the company feels embarrassed at the sight of last year's annual report - a lavish confection of garish birthday cakes and telescopic candles containing a family portrait of the board sporting 'We Are 10' lapel badges. The change of tone is in keeping with Blenheim's evolving circumstances. Acquisition opportunities will be fewer now that most large commercial exhibition markets have been rationalised. And the spectacular cost savings of recent years (the group now pays Pounds 10.25 a sq metre for partition panels that cost it Pounds 19.50 in 1982) will be harder and harder to keep going. In short, the group's fortunes look set increasingly to mirror the underlying performance of the commercial exhibitions sector. Assuming full-year profits of Pounds 27m, the prospective multiple is about 12.5.</p>

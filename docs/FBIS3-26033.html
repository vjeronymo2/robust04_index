The figure represents a 16.1 percent rise over the previous  year and accounts for 24.7 percent of China's total exports.  The growth rate is the lowest in the past few years.    Last year, exports of instruments for machinery and  electronic products took up a large part. Exports of machinery  and electronics by foreign-funded enterprises continued to grow  at a high speed.    Exports of machinery and electronics which had been  processed  in China last year also increased much more than the general  growth rate.    The United States, the European Community, Hong Kong and  Japan are the major markets for machinery and electronics,  covering 73 percent of the total such exports.    Such exports to Singapore, Pakistan, Taiwan, the Republic of  Korea and Latin America last year also increased by a large  margin.    South China's Guangdong Province was the largest exporter in  this regard last year, and its export volume hit 13.63 billion  U.S. dollars, an increase of 18.7 percent over the previous year  and accounting for 60 percent of China's total export of  machinery and electronics last year.</p>

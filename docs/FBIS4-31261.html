			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Geneva, June 7 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Foreign  Minister Aleksa Buha said on Tuesday morning [7 May] that an  agreement on a cessation of hostilities throughout  Bosnia-Herzegovina might be signed at another meeting, probably  at Sarajevo airport, rather than at the current talks in Geneva.  This is a prediction based on the rather modest results  produced by bilateral contacts held on Monday by U.N. envoy to  former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi with Bosnia's warring Moslems,  Serbs and Croats, Buha told TANJUG. He stressed that, in its  latest proposal submitted to Akashi, the Bosnian Serb delegation  had offered a cessation of hostilities for a year, whereas the  Moslem-Croat delegation had asked for a ceasefire of between  four and six weeks, but not longer.    With the widely differing positions the delegations are  embarking on the second day of the Geneva conference and what  they hoped late on Monday would be a meeting in plenum. Akashi  told reporters on Monday evening that a ceasefire agreement  might be signed on Tuesday, with luck.    Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic said on Monday that  the Serb delegation was in favour of a permanent cessation of  hostilities and was willing to endorse Akashi's plan for a  four-month ceasefire with slight modifications. Akashi's  spokesman Michael Williams said he expected the Geneva talks to  end on Tuesday, but indicated they might continue if agreement  were not reached.</p>

Officials close to Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery said  that there was "a very strong advance in the balance of opinion  by company chief executives about the outlook for activity which  is now clearly positive, returning to a very high level."    INSEE said that the balance of opinion about the general  outlook, between those who thought that output would increase in  the next few months and those who thought the opposite, had  risen to the point of the autumn of 1990 to a score of plus 14  in March from plus three in February.    The balance of opinion about the performance of their own  particular companies also returned to a positive score in March,  the period covered by the survey.    The Ministry also noted "a very marked improvement" in  orders  from abroad and that this affected most sectors. But the sector  of professional equipment was experiencing only a modest  improvement.    The Ministry said that a few more months would be needed for  the recovery to be felt throughout industry.    The car sector had experienced a "spectacular improvement."  The balance of opinion among manufacturers about future output  had risen by 100 points between February and March, moving from  a score of minus 30 to plus 70.    "This improvement arises from the stimulatory measures taken  by the government and should result in a big increase in the  number of new cars registered during the next few months," the  officials said.</p>

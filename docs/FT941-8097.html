			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Borrowers play safe with floating-rate note issues Most of yesterday's supply of new issues in the Eurobond market came in the defensive form of floating-rate notes (FRNs) as the persistent weakness in government bond markets deterred issuers and underwriters alike from committing themselves to fixed-rate offerings. Officials at the Asian Development Bank were said to be anxiously waiting for a stabilisation in the markets so they could launch their first offering of global bonds. The market had expected the proposed Dollars 750m transaction, which will be jointly led by IBJ International and Salomon Brothers, to surface tomorrow but now believes it will not appear until later in the week. The African Development Bank is also likely to tap the Eurodollar sector for around Dollars 500m when market conditions improve. Among yesterday's issues, UCB Group, a subsidiary of Compagnie Bancaire of France, raised Pounds 500m through an offering of mortgage-backed FRNs through a special-purpose vehicle called Leo 2. UCB performed a similar securitisation last year. Lead manager JP Morgan said the deal was the largest offering of sterling-denominated mortgage-backed notes to date. JP Morgan said the notes sold out quickly as investors were attracted by their relatively high yields. The discounted margin on the notes with an average life of 1.4 years is 18 basis points over the London interbank offered rate while the discounted margin on the notes with an average life of 5.1 years is 30 basis points over Libor. Woolwich Building Society also tapped the Eurosterling sector with a Pounds 200m offering of five-year FRNs which yielded 15 basis points over Libor. Lead manager UBS said the offering injected fresh liquidity into the sterling FRN market where issuers had called more than Pounds 1bn worth of paper since the new year. Elsewhere, Toyota Motor Credit Corp, whose triple-A rating was affirmed by Standard &amp; Poor's earlier this month, raised SFr150m through an offering of six-year FRNs. Lead manager SBC said the offering, Toyota's first public transaction in the Swiss bond market, was targeted at retail investors interested in intermediate maturities. The notes, which carry a first coupon of 4 per cent and then Libor minus 20 basis points thereafter, had an issue price of 100 5/8 and were quoted at minus  3/8 point in the afternoon, within fees of  3/4 point. The Kingdom of Sweden has appointed a permanent dealer group to its Dollars 10bn debt issuance programme. They are Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, the arranger of the programme. The Sydney Futures Exchange is planning to list flexible options, a derivatives product introduced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange last year, Reuter reports. The flexible option was the industry's most successful product launched in 1993 and has been widely accepted by derivatives participants as complementary to the fast growing over-the-counter markets, the SFE said.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Reliance ahead at Rs32.1bn by year-end RELIANCE Industries, the Indian chemicals and textiles conglomerate, reported a 96 per cent increase in net profits to Rs32.1bn (Dollars 1.03bn) for the year to March 1993. The company, which last year became the first Indian group to tap the international markets for fresh equity, says sales jumped 39 per cent to Rs41.05bn. Operating profits increased by 53 per cent to Rs88.2bn. Exports increased to Rs16.8bn, up 62 per cent. Mr Anil Ambani, joint managing director, said Reliance, the fifth-biggest industrial group in India, had achieved the result in a 'difficult environment further aggravated by dumping' from foreign chemicals producers who were off-loading their products in India.

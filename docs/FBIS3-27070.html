			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Russia today  reaffirmed its support for a peaceful solution to the Bosnian  crisis, saying that it is imperative to rule out the possibility  of any provocations and acts of sabotage of the peace process.    A Russian Foreign Ministry statement said today that Russia  has made efforts in carrying out the initiative of lifting the  siege of Sarajevo and putting the city under the United Nations  control.    "We have been seeking and are still seeking the  implementation of this initiative by acting openly within the  framework of U.N. Security Council resolutions," the statement  said. "We continue this line now, despite the serious  aggravation of the situation around Sarajevo for well-known  reasons."    On February 5, a motar attack on a crowded market center in  Sarajevo, the capital of the warring Bosnia-Herzegovina, killed  at least 68 citizens and injured over 200. Four days later, the  NATO issued an ultimatum threatening to impose air strikes on  positions around the city. The ultimatum expires on Sunday [20  February].    The statement said that Bosnian Serbs had adopted a decision  to withdraw their heavy guns from around Sarajevo in reply to  the demand of the U.N. Security Council.    "We hope that this expression of goodwill by one of the  warring factions at the critical moment for the settlement (of  the conflict) will be followed by concrete actions," said the  statement.    It said: "We are calling on the (Muslim-led) Bosnian  Government to hand over its heavy guns around Sarajevo under  U.N. control without delay, as envisaged by the U.N.  secretary-general's plan proposed in his letter to the Security  Council on February 10."    The statement also called on the United States and the  European Union nations to exert, in the spirit of their  statements preferring a political solution of the problem, the  necessary influence on the Bosnian Government to make it  cooperate with the United Nations in reaching full deblocking  and demilitarization of Sarajevo.    "At this crucial time it is extremely important to rule out  the possibility of any provocation and acts of sabotage of this  peace process," the statement stressed.    It also said after lifting the siege of Sarajevo the U.N.  Security Council could immediately start considering ways to  establish U.N. administrative rule in the city, as well as  measures to strengthen other safe heavens on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

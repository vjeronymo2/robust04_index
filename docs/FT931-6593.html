			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Dispute delays Sellafield plans TENSION IS rising in government departments over the question of whether British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site will be used to store other countries' radioactive waste for many decades. The Trade and Industry Department received a report from the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee before Christmas saying that Sellafield could be used for long-term waste storage, but the department has so far refused to discuss the implications with the Environment Department. BNF has repeatedly rejected charges that its Sellafield-based Thorp plant for reprocessing nuclear fuels, which has taken nearly 10 years and Pounds 2.8bn to build, would become a 'nuclear dustbin'. It argues that most of its overseas contracts require customers to take back reprocessed waste. The latest tension arises over a BNF 'waste substitution' proposal - which means customers will take back only the 'radiological equivalent of their waste'. Under this proposal large volumes of waste would be left at Sellafield. BNF wants Thorp to start operating soon. Unless the waste substitution plan is implemented, however, this may not happen. Japanese customers, who with German customers account for much of Thorp's order book, have made preparations to take back only a small amount of highly radioactive waste. While some customers have said publicly that they are committed to their contracts with BNF, others are increasingly apprehensive about taking back the reprocessed waste because of the high storage and shipping costs and political sensitivity. Environment Department officials have been refused some details of BNF's customer contracts by the Trade Department on grounds of commercial confidentiality, making an assessment of long-term waste storage at Sellafield more difficult. Before Thorp can start operating it needs authorisation from the Pollution Inspectorate. According to one official the inspectorate is unlikely to submit its recommendation to the Environment Department before May because the decision has become so sensitive that 'we need to be seen to get every dot and comma right'. BNF has claimed that if Thorp does not go ahead the UK will lose Pounds 900m in profit in the next 10 years. Officials are concerned, however, that difficulties over sending reprocessed waste back to customers could undermine those projections.</p>

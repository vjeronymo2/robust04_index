			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tanya Tsekova: "41st Socialist Party Congress </F> Ends"]    [Text] Sofia, June 6 (BTA) -- Zhan Videnov was reelected  chairman of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) by secret ballot  at its 41st Congress. The voting continued all night and part  of the day today. Of 688 votes 640 were for Videnov. DUMA, the  BSP daily, reported the news on its front page two hours before  the voting had actually started. Several copies of the  newspaper, circulated in the congress hall shortly after  midnight, gave the news much to the surprise of some MP's and  above all of Aleksandur Marinov, considered an alternative  candidate for the leadership.    The highlights of the 41st Congress are calls for early  parliamentary elections and for the BSP in office. The congress  lasted one night and one day more than had been scheduled.  While the counting of the votes for supreme leadership was  still in progress, the delegates broke into song and had a  national dance. "We are rehearsing for the jubilation on  election night in the autumn," a delegate cried. Leader Zhan  Videnov joined in the dance.    The top leadership of the anti-communist Union of Democratic  Forces (SDS), which has been pressing for early elections for  over a year, held an extraordinary meeting today. "It was  interesting for us to see the Communist Party adopt a major idea  upheld by the SDS," SDS leader Filip Dimitrov told the press  later on. In his view, all major political forces and  institutions have recognized the need of parliamentary elections  in the autumn.    Proceedings at the congress were smooth. Most delegates  backed the party leadership. The only issue to provoke debates  was whether a party programme should be adopted at the congress,  or by an all- party consultation in September. Quite a few  delegates insisted on the first option but the majority voted  for the second one. The congress adopted the basic principles  of a party programme, a draft election platform and a new  statute.    In the draft election platform the Socialists declare  themselves in favour of national consensus, against ethnic  confrontation, for Bulgaria's single-nation character and  territorial integrity. They will be applying a new economic  reform model, including a comprehensive policy of social  protection, socially-oriented mass privatization, halting the  decline in output, reduction of unemployment, returning the land  to its former owners and setting up farmer cooperatives on a  voluntary basis. The BSP calls for goodneighbourly relations  with all Balkan countries, active and independent policy,  absolute neutrality in the Yugoconflict and total integration  into the European structures.    The congress voted a resolution proposed by delegates from  Kurdzhali, Khaskovo and Smolyan (southeastern Bulgaria, a region  populated predominantly by ethnic Turks). The BSP will oppose  by legal means parties and movements which act counter to the  national interests and security and try to forcibly Turkicize  Bulgarians professing Islam, the resolution says.    In another resolution the congress condemned the court  trials  of former communist state officials, charged with plunging the  country into an economic crisis, calling the trials "political."  The Socialists will make efforts to rehabilitate Georgi  Atanasov and Stoyan Ovcharov, respectively prime minister and  minister of economics under Zhivkov.    Many asked how much it cost to hold the well-organized forum  in the most prestigious convention centre, Sofia's National  Palace of Culture. The BSP Press Office said the three  scheduled days of the congress had cost 750,000 leva and all  MP's of the BSP (about 100) had donated 5,000 leva each towards  the congress. According to staff members of the convention  centre, however, the rate for the largest congress hall is  300,000 leva per day which, added to the cost of materials  printed on glossy paper, of the hall where briefings were held,  and refreshments for the delegates, brings the total to about 4  million leva, sources outside the BSP said.    The congress reelected Stefan Prodev editor-in-chief of the  DUMA daily. Asked by delegates to account for the premature  report on Videnov's election as leader, Prodev said it was based  on polls by the press -- an answer which satisfied the delegates.</p>

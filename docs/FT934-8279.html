			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch zinc plant may have to close THE BUDEL smelter in the Netherlands, which produces about 5 per cent of the western world's zinc, will have to close by the middle of 1995 if no agreement about waste storage can be reached with the Dutch authorities by the end of this year. The future of the smelter, which is jointly owned by Billiton, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, and Pasminco, the Australian resources company, is threatened because it produces cadmium-containing hazardous waste called jarosite. Pasminco has revealed that attempts are being made to use low-iron zinc concentrates (an intermediate material) - if these can be found in sufficient quantities - to eliminate jarosite from the waste. Budel, Pasminco and another Australian resources group, CRA, are working on this process. The Fl 310m (USDollars 163m) already provided by Budel's shareholders to solve the jarosite problem will probably cover the cost. Pasminco also said it expected agreement to be reached with the Dutch authorities about Budel's long-term survival before the year-end.</p>

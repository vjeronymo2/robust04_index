			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ikea makes Dollars 20m offer for Stor IKEA, the Swedish-based furniture retailer, is making a cash bid for Stor, a Californian home furnishings chain, whose shares trade on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market. Stor is a relatively small operation with four outlets - three in southern California and one in Houston, Texas - and Ikea's Dollars 3.10 a share offer values it at Dollars 19.8m. However, this is the first time the privately owned Swedish group has made an acquisition in the US and the extra outlets will significantly boost its fast-growing presence in North America. Ikea said one of the four Stor stores duplicates a site it plans to open in California. This store will be closed. The remaining three stores will be converted to the Ikea format. Annual sales of the four Stor outlets stand at around Dollars 70m. At present, Ikea operates seven outlets in the US, mainly on the east and west coasts, and annual sales last year were Dollars 284m. This represented a 68 per cent increase on the previous 12 months, making the US one of the retailer's fastest growth markets. Aside from the three ongoing Stor outlets, Ikea plans to open two stores in California in the spring. This should give it at least a dozen US outlets by late-1992.</p>

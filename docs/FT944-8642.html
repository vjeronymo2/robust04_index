			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Banks selling derivatives 'not aggressive' Banks are not overly aggressive in selling derivative products, according to a new survey by a US risk management consulting firm. Eighty senior corporate finance executives from multinational corporations, mainly from US and Europe, respond-ed to the survey conducted by Irvington, New York-based Emcor Risk Management Consulting. Only 12 per cent of those respondents believe banks are too aggressive in their marketing. All respondents use derivatives to manage their currency exposure, either through hedging or other techniques, 95 per cent of respondents 'managed' their interest rate exposure in the same way, while approximately 30 per cent 'managed' their energy and commodity exposures.</p>

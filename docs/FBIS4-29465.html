			<p>BFN     [Text] The Nomura Securities group will support  medium-sized companies moving into Asia. Nomura-Jafko [as  published] Investment Asia (NJI), the group's investment  promotion company, will construct a large industrial complex in  Vietnam in cooperation with a local corporation, and will invite  into it 100 medium Japanese companies which are trying to cope  with the problem of high-yen. Nomura Securities Company will  also raise venture funds [preceding two words in English] to  procure the necessary funds. In China, Nomura Citic [as  published], the group's management consulting company, will help  subsidiaries of large corporations establish plants there. The  group's operations are drawing attention as they show a new way  of helping fund-short medium companies go overseas.    NJI and a development corporation in Haiphong, Vietnam, will  build an industrial complex of about 170 hectares in the  Kuantwan [as published] District in the suburbs of Haiphong.  All the required construction costs, which are expected to run  to about 10 billion yen, will be borne by the Nomura group,  which will then levy rents on the companies to operate in the  complex.    The companies using the complex are expected to be those  making electric appliances and auto parts, for whom the impact  from the recent high yen is most serious. This is the first  time that a group made up of financial institutions and  securities companies will take a lead in constructing an  industrial complex in Vietnam.    By helping the companies advance overseas, the group can  strengthen ties with them, and gain the chances of doing  business like brokering fund procurement. A final preliminary  survey will be done by the end of this month. With details of  the project such as total investments and construction period  finalized, a joint venture company to implement the project will  be set up in August.    Vietnam is expected to open a stock exchange next year. As  such, if the Japanese companies to move into the industrial  complex form joint ventures with local firms, they will be able  to have their stocks listed on the Vietnamese stock exchange.  In future, Nomura Securities will raise 10-20 billion yen in  venture funds for the companies listed with the stock exchange.  The idea is to recycle funds from Japan's institutional  investors back into the Vietnamese market and to make the  Japanese companies use them as their working funds.    In China, Nomura Citic in Beijing is now functioning as a  channel for inducing Japanese companies. There is a plan for  subsidiary companies of large electric appliance manufacturers  to move to Shanghai in a group together. The Nomura group will  support the efforts to transfer production bases to China.    The reason the medium-sized enterprises want to move their  production bases to Vietnam or China is because labor costs in  these countries are cheaper than in Japan and because  high-quality labor forces can be secured despite this. Some  people complain that this can lead to a hollowing out of the  domestic industry, but the Japanese companies' transfer of  plants to the cheap-labor Asian region is expected to grow to be  able to maintain their international competitiveness in the  current situation of the yen's value continuing to rise.</p>

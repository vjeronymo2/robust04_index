Provincial leaders, including Li Changchun [provincial party  secretary], Ren Keli, Fan Qinchen, and others attended the forum  presided over by Hu Shujian, director of the provincial party  committee united front work department and vice chairman of the  provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  Committee.    Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Li Changchun first took  the floor at the forum by briefing the non-CPC personages on the  recently concluded Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth Henan  Provincial CPC Committee.    Secretary Li Changchun also expressed the hope that all of  the non-CPC personages attending the forum would show utter  devotion, freely speak out, and put forth views so that the two  documents adopted at the aforementioned plenary session could be  amended. The two documents are: "The Henan Provincial CPC  Committee Opinions on Implementing the CPC Central Committee  Decision on Building a Socialist Market Economic Structure" and  "The Henan Provincial CPC Committee Work Report."    In their speeches, all of the non-CPC personages unanimously  agreed that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth Henan  Provincial CPC Committee had been held at an appropriate moment,  the two documents adopted at the plenary session are of overall  guiding significance to Henan's work, and the work report  delivered at the plenary session by Secretary Li Changchun on  behalf of the Henan Provincial CPC Committee had realistically  summed up Henan's work in 1993 and laid down both goals and  guiding principles for Henan's work in 1994. [passage omitted]    After conscientiously listening to a series of views voiced  by the non-CPC personages, Li Changchun stressed: As we are to  build a socialist market economy in 1994, we will certainly come  across many more problems. However, the crux of the matter lies  in economic growth. We should strive to develop the economy on  the one hand and cut down outlays on the other. I hope that all  non-CPC personages present at this forum will join hands in  putting forth views and proposals aimed at speeding up Henan's  development.</p>

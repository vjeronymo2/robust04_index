			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCTOR'S FREE TESTS A CRUCIAL WEAPON IN FIGHT AGAINST AIDS  </P> <P> One day in 1987, Stephen J. Gabin sat in his Century City medical office and  settled an internal battle he had been fighting for seven years. By testing  himself for the AIDS virus, the physician, 42, put an end to the fear he had  carried from the time he treated his first HIV-infected patient in 1980.  </P> <P> Gabin, a leading Los Angeles AIDS expert with one of the region's largest AIDS  practices, turned his doubt into a personal crusade for early testing for the  disease, a crusade that began well before two recent medical reports confirmed  the case for early testing for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> On July 1, Gabin decided to provide free, anonymous testing for the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Director of Century City Hospital's  AIDS-care unit, Gabin expected his two-month progrm to administer more than 800  tests.  </P> <P> Experts note that the figure is more than double the number tested at an  average county-contracted testing site over the same period. More important,  they applaud his effort as a signal to doctors and patients that the battle  against AIDS will be a long and difficult one, and that testing and education  remain the most effective means of fighting the disease.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overcome Denial  </P> <P> "The barriers are that people have denial and the physicians have denial, and  that's what his message is trying to overcome," said Dr. Neil Schram, member of  the Los Angeles County Medical Assn.'s AIDS Commission.  </P> <P> "He not only is encouraging people to think about getting tested, but he is  encouraging people to discuss getting tested with their physicians."  </P> <P> "I was very concerned," said Gabin, "that people didn't fully realize that the  idea of testing made more sense than it did a few years ago."  </P> <P> Raised in Philadelphia, Gabin began in medicine as a general practitioner in  Orange County 15 years ago. In 1977, he began to specialize in treating gay  men, who now make up 95% of his practice, including 700 to 800 infected with  HIV.  </P> <P> "I wanted to make a strong commitment both to my patients and the community at  large that people who might have been exposed to HIV should be tested."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Employs Publicist  </P> <P> Gabin, who employs a publicist, also acknowledges that he makes "a good living"  at his practice and that his free program has added to it, but he said his  intent was simply to fight AIDS with every means at his disposal.  </P> <P> The doctor's program ended just as the nation's largest AIDS advocate groups  have endorsed voluntary and confidential testing as the best way to take  advantage of new drugs found to delay the onset of AIDS symptoms, findings  released in recent reports.  </P> <P> Gabin said the size of response to his offer, about 400 per month, indicated  that some people prefer a private setting to government-sponsored clinics for  testing.  </P> <P> By comparison, only about 1,100 to 1,200 HIV antibody tests are administered by  all seven county-contracted locations each month on average, said John  Schunhoff, assistant director of the AIDS program office with the Los Angeles  County Department of Health.  </P> <P> About 15% of the participants in Gabin's program have tested positive, similar  to the 14.4% infection rate for county test sites.  </P> <P> "The message that could be interpeted by other doctors is that AIDS is such an  important disease that as physicians we should do everything possible,  including paying for the tests if that's what it takes, to get those patients  who have engaged in risky behavior in the past to be tested," said Dr. David  Dassey, deputy medical director of the AIDS program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Seeking U.S. Funds  </P> <P> Citing a state report, Schram said that as many as 250,000 to 300,000  Californians may be infected with HIV, with up to one-third of those living in  the Los Angeles area. A substantial majority has not been tested.  </P> <P> Gabin is considering pressing for government funds to subsidize private  physician AIDS testing, he said, but public health experts say that more  important is the message sent to other doctors.  </P> <P> "From my perspective, one of the big problems in getting people tested is that  gay men and (intravenous) drug users are afraid to share that information with  their physicians because they are afraid their physicians will reject them --  and in too many instances that is a valid concern," said Schram, an internist  and former member of the Los Angeles City Task Force on AIDS. Gay and bisexual  men, intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs face the greatest risk of  infection, as do sexual partners of people in these high-risk groups.  </P> <P> "Most doctors don't like talking about sex and they don't like talking about  illegal drugs, (but) you have to take that step. If you can take that first  step, then you can see risky behavior and then you can say, 'Be tested,' "  Dassey said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ground Floor of Treatment  </P> <P> Gabin attributed his own efforts to being gay himself. He began working on gay  issues when friends and relatives told him that their doctors ignored problems  often confronting gay males.  </P> <P> His focus brought him in on the ground floor of AIDS treatment, and Gabin has  devoted successively more time to the disease.  </P> <P> "My patient population since about 1977 has been largely made up of gay men,  and so I found myself in a situation where we were seeing a new disease process  in front of our eyes. We didn't have any choice but to learn about it," Gabin  said.  </P> <P> Gabin declined to comment on the cost of his program, but Schunhoff of the  health department said the county is reimbursed by the state $44 per test to  pay for lab and personnel costs. According to figures quoted by Schunhoff,  testing for 800 people alone could cost about $3,600.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of similarities between fighting AIDS and fighting a war,"  Gabin said, "and when lives are on the line, it's hard to be anything but 100%  committed.  </P></p>

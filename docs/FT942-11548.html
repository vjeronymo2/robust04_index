			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Energy efficiency targets not ambitious enough Sir, Your article 'All eyes on efficiency' (April 27) questioned whether the regional electricity companies (RECs) can be serious about saving energy if profits are tied to volume sales. The Energy Saving Trust, in its response to the Offer consultation paper, Electricity distribution: price control, reliability and customer service, believes the director-general should adopt a more ambitious approach to promoting efficiency in the distribution business than is the case under the current price control mechanism. In recent years, inter-fuel competition has stimulated the electricity industry to develop many energy-efficient solutions, reflecting the fact that it is only through developing new efficient electro-technologies that the electricity companies can compete with other fuels which are generally cheaper. But, in practice, technological development has been mainly directed at high demand users in the commercial and industrial sectors. It is for these reasons that the Energy Saving Trust recommended to Offer that it should treat low-demand customers (less than 100kW) differently from those of high demand, by making a more significant reduction apply in the volume sales component of the supply price control formula. The trust proposes a three-factor price formula, based on the number of customers, fixed costs and volume. A significant reduction in the existing volume sales component, coupled with some degree of compensation to the RECs for the energy savings attained, would increase the incentive to the RECs to invest in demand-side management measures. In order to achieve widespread benefits to the broadest range of customer types, we believe the RECs should receive an allowance within the distribution price control for investment in demand-side measures. This amount (Pounds 40m in 1995-96, Pounds 90m in 1996-97, Pounds 125m in 1997-98 and beyond) would initially be raised from low-demand users of the distribution system, who would of course also receive the benefits of the subsequent investment. On a practical level, the trust is already working with the RECs on a number of energy efficiency schemes aimed at domestic consumers and small businesses. All will provide considerable benefits to the customer and the environment. Eoin Lees, chief executive, Energy Saving Trust, 11-12 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6LB</p>

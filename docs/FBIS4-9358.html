			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Green Party Chairman Zoltan Medveczki by </F> Zoltan J. Gal; place and date not given: "A Small Mammal Among  Dinosaurs"]    [Text] Before voting for a party, some 250,000-300,000  people in Hungary are first curious to know what party did what  for environmental protection. The achievement of the Hungarian  Green Party [MZP] is perhaps the biggest surprise of the  election campaign so far: They succeeded in presenting a  national list after gathering the nomination slips. The stormy  phase in the history of the MZP began in the spring of 1993 when  many people left the party. The views of the party's current  leaders -- like the view on the so-called neo-Zionism -- have  been repeatedly labeled as fascist. The national list of the  700-member MZP is led by Zoltan Medveczki. We interviewed the  31-year-old forest ranger and party chairman.    [Gal] Many people find your success surprising....    [Medveczki] This is not a success for us; this is below our  expectations.    [Gal] What did you expect?    [Medveczki] We thought that the elections would enable us to  finally prove that green politics is neither rightist nor  leftist.    [Gal] Why? Where do you stand?    [Medveczki] In front. We could be called small mammals  among the huge socialist and democratic dinosaurs.    [Gal] Your achievement is nevertheless surprising, all the  more so because, as far as we know, you looked for candidates  through advertisements.    [Medveczki] This is a professional way of selecting  candidates. Nixon also answered a newspaper advertisement, and  later he became President.    [Gal] All over the world, the green parties regard  environmental protection as a major goal. What would you do for  this?    [Medveczki] The MZP is also engaged in politics for the  benefit of environmental protection, human protection, and  health protection. Environmental protection should be treated  as a symptom, and not as a cause. This means that we Hungarians  should also use green technologies instead of the obsolete  technologies. Most cars in Brazil are running with alcohol made  from sugar cane. Sugar beet could be grown along the highways in  Hungary, and then the cars would also be running with alcohol  here. And we would only laugh at the Arabs if they increased  the oil prices in the meantime.    [Gal] If I understand it correctly, surplus sugar cane is  used for fuel production in Brazil. In Hungary, however, all  that produce that would give way to the planting of "fuel sugar  beet" would be missing. Am I mistaken?    [Medveczki] Nothing would be missing. We are growing wheat  in vain along the highways. In addition, this way, we also eat  the lead together with the bread, and then we are surprised to  learn that Hungary has the biggest number of cancer cases.    [Gal] You often declared that you support the construction  of the power station at Nagymaros. You must be quite alone with  this opinion.    [Medveczki] We start from the premise that a lot of money  has been invested in the construction of the dam. We are also  aware of the advantages of such a dam.    [Gal] But there is no water in the Danube.    [Medveczki] This is precisely the point! The Danube is  carrying less and less water and, therefore, dams are essential.  Such dams should be constructed in as many places as possible,  because these dams modify the unfavorable climatic effects and  increase the level of ground water. Besides, the secretary of  the MZP was the first person who refused to listen to anyone  here and went to Slovakia to get information there.    [Gal] We quote from your party's leaflets: "Hungarians  should eat Hungarian fruit, including apples from Szabolcs,  peaches from Kecskemet, watermelons from Csany." They should?    [Medveczki] The consumption of national plants is the basis  of our national independence. It is a proved fact that everyone  should eat the products of the ecosystem in which he lives,  because he can only digest this type of food.    [Gal] Another slogan: "Among the political organizations in  Hungary, it is only the Green Party that is deliberately  fighting against the following monstrosities: prostitution,  homosexuality, an immoral way of life.... microwave ovens,  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and McDonald's." How does a  political party fight against prostitution, homosexuality, and  an immoral way of life?    [Medveczki] We would inform the people that there would be  no need for prostitution with an adequate sexual culture.  Prostitution and homosexuality are the hotbed of AIDS.  However, these monstrosities are constantly advertised in  Hungary. No children will be born from a relationship between  two homosexuals, and we would not like to see the Hungarian  nation disappear from the Carpathian Basin.    [Gal] I think this violates human rights and also the  Constitution of the Hungarian Republic.    [Medveczki] If the homosexuals start thinking, they will  realize that we are also fighting for them by strengthening the  role of the family with our positive advertisements. We Green  men like women, and the Green women like men.    [Gal] The MZP also set up a police group and a defense  commando unit. What for?    [Medveczki] We will defend not only others, but also  ourselves against those who attack us.    [Gal] A commando unit attacks, it does not defend.    [Medveczki] The condition of acceptance in this unit is a  basic knowledge of aikido. This combat sport uses the attack  energy for defense. If you want to hit me, I will not kick your  head off, I will only defend myself. Besides, this commando  unit has various tasks. We will have to face tremendous  catastrophes in the near future, and this might urge people to  blow up the nuclear power stations. The life defense commando  unit would find these people and neutralize them.    [Gal] You also declared war on the so-called neo-Zionism.  What is that?    [Medveczki] More correctly, it is pseudo-Zionism. We would  like the Arab-Israeli conflict to end. Both Jews and Arabs  should be informed that they are not the ones who confront each  other in this conflict; those who are inciting this war are the  ones that confront each other.    [Gal] People find several similarities between the symbol of  the MZP and the Nazi symbol.    [Medveczki] I would suggest those who judge our party on the  basis of such outside appearances to try to use this on the  United States or the FTC [a Budapest soccer club], because these  two organizations also have the same eagle in their symbol. It  is strange that the orange used by the Federation of Young  Democrats in their advertisements does not bother anyone,  although the orange is a non-Hungarian fruit.</p>

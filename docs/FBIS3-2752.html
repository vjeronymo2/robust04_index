			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Xiao Rui (5135 3843): "How Premier Li </F> Peng's `Government Work Report' Was Drafted"]    [Text] Beijing, 10 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- This is a  crucial year, in which China will advance toward the  establishment of a socialist market economy structure. A  comprehensive, pragmatic, and highly manipulative "government  work report" will produce a positive impact on China's reform,  opening up, stability, and development this year.    The "government work report" delivered by Li Peng at the  Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress today  was drafted after extensively heeding opinions of various  sectors and collecting information from various quarters.    On 13 January this year, the "government work report"  drafting group was officially set up, composed of 12 members  from seven comprehensive departments comprising the State  Council's Research Center, the CPC Central Policy Research  Center, the State Commission for Restructuring Economy, the  State Economic and Trade Commission, the State Planning  Commission, the People's Bank of China, and the State  Statistical Bureau. In a small, quiet building on picturesque  Yuquanshan, located in the western suburbs of Beijing, the  drafting group worked painstakingly for more than 20 days. At  first, they set to writing separately, and afterward worked  together to have the draft report completed in mid-February.    What is worth mentioning is that all the members of the  drafting group are from authoritative comprehensive departments,  and most of them have outstanding theoretical achievements and  practical work experience. They have active minds and are of  relatively high quality. Owing to their day-to-day work, they  are more familiar with the overall conditions of China's society  and some problems that temporarily exist.    These drafters are: Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the  State Council's Research Center; Huang Jian, deputy head of the  Comprehensive Group of the above center; Shen Bonian, head of  the Financial and Economic Group of the above center; Guo  Zhenying, head of the Industrial and Communications Group of the  above center; Huang Shouhong, research fellow of the  Agricultural Group of the above center; Zou Ping, deputy head of  the Cultural and Educational Work Group of the above center; Li  Jiange, deputy director of the Policy and Legislation Department  of the State Economic and Trade Commission; Lin Zhaomu, deputy  director of the Research Center of the State Planning  Commission; Peng Sen, deputy director of the Comprehensive  Department of the State Commission for Restructuring Economy; Wu  Xiaoling, deputy director of the Structural Reform Department of  the People's Bank of China; Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of the  State Statistical Bureau; and Zheng Xinbiao, deputy head of the  Cultural and Educational Work Group of the Central Policy  Research Center.    During the drafting process, the draft "government work  report" was repeatedly discussed and revised at the State  Council's executive meetings, as well as at meetings of the CPC  Politburo and its Standing Committee. In addition, the drafting  group extensively solicited the opinions of various localities,  departments, democratic parties, personalities without party  affiliation, and representatives from various grass-roots units.  Premier Li Peng called discussions five times to listen to the  revised proposals from various sectors. Therefore, the report  read by the premier today should be said to have fully  represented the will of all strata, quarters, and personalities  from various circles. It has defined the keynotes and charted  the course for China's reform this year.    An authoritative source said: The themes of Premier Li  Peng's "government work report" are to deepen reform and  maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development.  What attracts people's attention is that he particularly  stressed the necessity of handling the relationships among  reform, development, and stability.    Development is the only way for China to attain a lasting  good order, and is the ultimate goal that comes up to the  expectations of the people. Reform is the motive force for  achieving rapid development, and stability is a guarantee for  reform and a prerequisite for development. The three aspects  are closely related to one another.    Careful people may have discovered that this year's  "government work report" is concise, to the point, relatively  short, and unadorned.    A person in charge of the drafting group said that one of  the  reasons for the shortness of this year's report is that major  policies and principles have been defined. The drafting group  strove to be concise in writing and focused on the major tasks  to be grasped by the State Council this year. Hence, the report  does not list in detail all achievements scored by various  departments last year and the tasks to be performed this year.</p>

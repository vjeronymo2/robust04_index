			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Barclays expands in France BARCLAYS is spending Pounds 50m to virtually double the number of its branches in France this year. 'We have to ride out the recession in France, just as we have done in the UK and US', said Mr Andrew Buxton, the banking group's chairman. Barclays, which reported a 1992 loss of FFr987m (Pounds 115m) - including provisions of FFr900m against bad debts - would still lose money this year, but would break even next year, he predict-ed. 'Our strategy is to deliver a particular skill to our customers rather than try to take the major French banks head-on across the board', he said. This 'particular skill', he said, consisted of linking current accounts to an interest bearing deposit account. In response to French authorities' objections last year Barclays had had to make transfers between the two accounts less automatic. But Mr Buxton forecast that 'sooner or later, consumers' wishes will have an effect on the French market'. 'We have gained a considerable number of customers with this', he said, and as a result Barclays was expanding the number of its retail branches from 50 to 90 during 1993.</p>

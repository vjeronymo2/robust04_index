			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Al-Fayeds sell Sears stake THE Al-Fayed brothers set the seal on weeks of speculation yesterday as they unloaded their stake in stores group Sears. Market analysts put losses to the House of Fraser owners at over Pounds 60m on a 10.6 per cent stake they first began building five years ago at an average price said to be around 140p a share. The 156m shares were bought by Goldman Sachs at around 100p and sold into the market at 101p a share in a bought deal. The Sears share price ticked off slowly during the day, opening at 105p and slipping to the major placing price of 101p by the close. However, it was unclear whether the broker had sold the entire stake. Some dealers suggested that Goldman was still holding around 10m Sears shares. A spokeswoman for the house said the placing was oversubscribed and the bulk of the shares got away successfully. The final total recorded on SEAQ, taking into account both sides of the deal was 309m. The deal had been hinted in the market for several weeks as talk of various brokers involved in pre-placing exercises did the rounds, suggesting stiff competition for the business. The shares were said by dealers to have been placed with institutions, although it will not be known whether any other group has taken the opportunity to acquire a large chunk of the stock.</p>

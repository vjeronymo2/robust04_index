			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICAN COMMUNITY  </P> <P> One of the nicest developments for the fre-trade future agreements between  Mexicoand the U.S. is the strong interest that the Mexican government is now  showing in the 15-million-strong Mexican-American community, particularly for  investment and expertise.  </P> <P> Already it has established a "Program for Mexican Community Abroad" that is run  from a special office in the Interior Ministry in Mexico City.  </P> <P> A high government official has admitted that they have finally become aware of  the growing political and economic importanceof the Mexican-American community.  They want this community to "lobby for us in U.S. society much like the smaller  U.S. Jewish population has championed successfully Israel's cause."  </P> <P> Certainly our great state would benefit from all this since we have about half  of all Mexican-Americans in America. Even a modest $10,000 investment in Mexico  can bring hefty profits. With increasing success south of the border, the  Mexicans will have more moneyto buy from us, particularly from our state.  </P> <P> JOHN F. MENDEZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

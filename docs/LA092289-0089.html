			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 19 DIE AS SCHOOL BUS, HIT BY TRUCK, SINKS IN WATERY PIT  </P> <P> At least 19 students died and dozens more were injured when their fully loaded  school bus plunged into a water-filled gravel pit Thursday morning after it was  was hit by a truck carrying soft drinks.  </P> <P> The bus, on its way to nearby Mission junior and senior high schools, had just  picked up two more students when it was hit by the truck. Many of the students  were standing in the aisles. Initial reports were that the blow by the truck  was glancing, perhaps because bus driver Gilbert Pena was swerving to avoid the  collision.  </P> <P> The bus, possibly carrying as many as 80 students, went flying into the  unbarricaded gravel pit just beside the road, plunged 40 feet to the water,  flipped upside down and came to rest on its side. It then sank and was  completely under water.  </P> <P> Screaming children trapped in the bus struggled to get out through open windows  and the bus door. Many of those who did get out stood on the bus and waited for  help to arrive.  </P> <P> The collision was the worst accident involving a school bus in Texas history  and the third-worst school bus accident ever recorded.  </P> <P> "I just freaked out," said Alex DeLeon, 18, as he described the bus falling  headlong as he held tight to the seat in front of him. He said he grabbed his  sister, Regina, pushed her out the window and then pulled himself free. "I was  on the outside in a second."  </P> <P> Many others did not make it, including Raul Flores, who had not planned to go  to school, but his mother had insisted. In the aftermath of the crash, the  boy's mother wept and said it was her fault that her son was dead.  </P> <P> Another mother had to be taken by ambulance from the crash site after she saw  the bodies of her two teen-age daughters pulled from the bus.  </P> <P> A young man walked up to DeLeon as he stood in front of the Mission Hospital  Thursday afternoon. The two shook hands and then DeLeon shook his head.  </P> <P> "Your brother didn't make it, man," DeLeon said.  </P> <P> The young man, sobbing, with shoulders drooping, walked slowly back to his car.  </P> <P> Nearby, David Valadez complained bitterly about what he thought was inaction by  police officers and firemen at the scene, saying that he saw only one policeman  swim to the bus while others only urged the students to grab ropes that had  been tossed over the steep rocky cliff. He said also that medical care was not  administered quickly enough.  </P> <P> "I know a lot of kids who could have survived if they had been given  (cardiopulmonary resuscitation)," said Valadez, who rushed to the scene because  he feared his children were on the bus. They weren't, because his wife had  taken them to school.  </P> <P> "This is America, and this shouldn't happen. You had a lot of people in shock  and the police were not doing anything to treat it," he said.  </P> <P> Several others echoed Valadez's complaints, saying that Lt. Rudolfo Reyes of  the Alton Police Department was the only policeman who initially went in the  water to pull the children out. Reyes said he did go down a ladder that was  already in place when he arrived but was reluctant to say anything more about  the matter.  </P> <P> "There's not much I can say about that," he said. "The citizens and children of  Alton are our responsibility."  </P> <P> The accident occurred about 7:40 a.m. at a spot where two arrow-straight roads  intersect in this rural area dotted with orange groves. The truck, driven by a  man identified as Ruben Perez of Mission, was on one road and the bus was on  the other. Texas Highway Patrol Sgt. Dave Baker said that the accident was  still under investigation and no charges have been filed.  </P> <P> Baker said also that a team from the National Transportation Safety Board was  en route to conduct its own investigation. He said he had heard reports that  Perez said his brakes had failed when he tried to stop at the intersection.  </P> <P> DeLeon and other survivors said the truck driver ran a stop sign. The truck  remained alongside the road after the accident.  </P> <P> Roads were dry and the weather was clear at the time of the crash.  </P> <P> "We're going to look at everything from front to back," Baker said.  </P> <P> When police officers and ambulances arrived, the students, ranging in age from  12 to 18, were taken to several area hospitals, and a command post was set up  at the Mission Community Center. One officer estimated that at least 125  emergency vehicles were used during the day.  </P> <P> Lists of the students were compiled, one of the living and one of the dead. As  relatives poured into the center, they were told to go either to a hospital or  to a temporary morgue to help identify the bodies.  </P> <P> Women wailed in abject grief when told to go to the morgue. And, at the  hospitals, more relatives crowded into the lobbies, waiting for news of their  kin.  </P> <P> "It's been a nightmare," hospital worker Maria Garza said.  </P> <P> It has been a bad year for the people of the Lower Rio Grande Valley and the  string of towns adjacent to the Mexican border. Last summer, a department store  collapsed in Brownsville, killing 14 people and injuring 47. Then Hurricane  Gilbert, one of the worst in memory, hit the valley last fall, followed by the  discovery this spring of a string of ritualistic murders in nearby Matamoros,  Mexico.  </P> <P> As the day went on, counselors and ministers visited the families of the dead,  while the curious tried to talk their way past police barricades to the crash  site. The last of the bodies was brought up by divers about two hours after the  wreck.  </P> <P> The nation's worst school bus accident occurred in 1976, when a bus plunged off  a freeway ramp, killing 28 Yuba City, Calif., high school students and a  teacher. In 1959, 27 people were killed when a bus went into a creek in  Prestonsburg, Ky.  </P></p>

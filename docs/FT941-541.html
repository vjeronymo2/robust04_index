			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Berlusconi seeks coalition deal: Divisions on right may slow formation of Italian government The Italian media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi yesterday began attempting to pull together a coalition to govern the country after the landslide general election victory of the rightwing Freedom Alliance. The formation of Italy's 53rd postwar government will be slowed by the differences among the three partners in the alliance and by the complex procedures for the new parliament. A senior member of the outgoing government of prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi last night said a 'clear majority has emerged from the polls', and 'it is now up to that majority to form a new government'. But observers said a new government was unlikely to be installed before the end of April. The Freedom Alliance - composed of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini - won 366 of the 630 seats in the chamber of deputies. The victory, conceded early yesterday by all Mr Berlusconi's rivals, marked a clear break with Italy's postwar political system and offered the prospect of a rightwing government pledged to radical free-market policies. Last night, Mr Berlusconi, who entered politics less than four months ago, said he was ready to sell his business empire to avoid any conflict of interest if he became Italy's next prime minister. 'If someone wants to buy them (the businesses) I've got nothing against it,' he said in a television interview after his sweeping victory over the leftwing Progressive Alliance. Newspapers headlined the sheer scale of his victory but also highlighted divisions within the three parties and the veto announced by Mr Bossi on Mr Berlusconi becoming the next premier because of his business empire. The difficulty of finding common ground between the three parties which had formed the Alliance for mutual convenience and without an agreed government programme knocked the euphoria from Monday's financial markets. Shares on the Milan bourse fell almost 2 per cent, wiping away half of Monday's gains. Mr Berlusconi had a three-hour meeting yesterday with Mr Fini to establish the broad lines of parliamentary alliances. He appeared keen to sound out first the MSI/National Alliance. Mr Fini's position is reportedly easier to square with Forza Italia even though the MSI does not endorse the free-market economic policies of Mr Berlusconi. Mr Berlusconi let it be known through his aides that he hoped the League might soften its aggressive opposition to forming a government with the MSI. The failure of the left to attract a bigger vote raises doubts about the future of Mr Achille Occhetto, of the former communist party of the Democratic Left (PDS). Although the PDS vote held up well at 21 per cent, the Progressive electoral strategy was said to be too defensive.

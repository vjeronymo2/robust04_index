			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Modest growth in spending forecast CONSUMER SPENDING will grow only modestly in the next three years, reflecting sluggish increases in real incomes and only slim declines in the savings ratio. The Society of Business Economists, which represents many leading private-sector financial analysts, says in its latest assesment of the economy that a modest upturn has started and will slowly gather momentum next year. Mr David Kern, chairman of the society's forecasting group, said: 'We believe there is little prospect that growth will accelerate to 3 per cent or more over the next three years and expect GDP to rise to 1.5 per cent in 1993, 2.5 per cent in 1994 and 2.3 per cent in 1995.' The society believes that the debt overhang, job insecurity and tighter fiscal policy will limit the recovery. The forecasts are based on the view that the UK's ability to sustain recovery depends on a rise in investment and exports. recovery.</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / International Company News: Thyssen may merge steel units THYSSEN, Germany's biggest steel maker, is examining urgent economy measures which could lead to the merger of its two main steel subsidiaries. Following inconclusive negotiations with Krupp on co-operation in special steel manufacture, which ended last month, the group immediately started 'intensive talks on the possibility of internal co-operation', it said yesterday. Group profits fell 25 per cent in 1991, the third consecutive decline, mainly because of difficulties in international steel markets, which were underlined yesterday by the announcement that British Steel is to close its works in Ravenscraig, Scotland, with the loss of 1,220 jobs. A report containing 'several different concepts' will be presented to the Thyssen supervisory board on January 17, a spokesman said. These include possible collaboration in marketing, manufacture and buying. Talk about merging Thyssen Stahl and the loss-making special steels company, Thyssen Edelstahl, was 'speculation'. Both subsidiaries are due to publish results later this month which will show continuing losses at Thyssen Edelstahl, which lost DM176m (Dollars 111.3m) on sales of DM3.9bn in 1990, and further deterioration at Thyssen Stahl, where profits fell 16 per cent in the same year on turnover of DM10.5bn. Both have been hit by low world prices and demand, and are now feeling increased pressure from the slowdown in the German economy, which is heavily dependent on the metalworking industries. Internal restructuring at Thyssen, flagship of the German steel industry, which accounts for 25 per cent of the country's total 40m tonnes annual output, will mark a further important step in the rapid rationalisation of companies and capacity. Four months ago, Krupp launched its takeover of Hoesch to create a group with around 8m tonnes capacity. Voest Alpine, the Austrian company, said last month it would close its only German special steelworks in Dusseldorf by the year-end. Mannesmann, the smallest of the country's Big Four steel groups, recently announced a joint venture in tube manufacture with Hoesch. Thyssen Stahl, meanwhile, is building a mini steelworks in collaboration with AFV Beltrame in Oberhausen. The new plant, which marks a switch from traditional, labour-intensive integrated works, will produce 250,000 tonnes a year and employ around 475 workers.</p>

"We hope they will be freed in the next few days," a Chinese  diplomat said. "The Yemeni Government is working hard for their  release."    The three were kidnapped Saturday morning while working on a  road between Hija, 127 kilometers (75 miles) north of Sanaa and  Ma'rib, 173 kilometers (100 miles) east of the capital, embassy  officials said.    Yemeni sources meanwhile said the Chinese were kidnapped by  three people wanted by the police for various murders.    There were no details on what the kidnappers wanted and  where  they were holding the technicians.    The three were working under the terms of a Yemen-Chinese  cooperation accord. In the 1980s China helped the former north  Yemen build several roads, including one between Sanaa and Hija.    The Chinese were kidnapped the same day that Ahnum tribesmen  in the country's northwest freed three French tourists they had  held for 20 days in a bid to force the government to build a  road through their region.</p>

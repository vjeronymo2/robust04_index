			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Doubts over the future of N Ireland power chief THE GOVERNMENT is facing renewed controversy over its plans to privatise Northern Ireland's electricity supply industry amid reports that the chief executive of Northern Ireland Electricity, Mr Anthony Hadfield, is to be removed by his own board. NIE yesterday denied a report that Mr Hadfield had been sacked. It would not comment on a separate report that Mr Hadfield's three-year contract would not be renewed when it expires in July. However Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, said last night that according to reliable information he had received, a decision was taken 10 days ago by NIE's board. Mr McNamara, with other Northern Ireland MPs, has publicly attacked the government's decision to break up and privatise NIE, the public utility which has a virtual monopoly in the province. Mr Hadfield, who is also deputy NIE chairman, was expected to play an important role in the privatisation process. According to some MPs, NIE managers and senior trade union officials his removal from the board could put a question mark over the future of the government's plans.</p>

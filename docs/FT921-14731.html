			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: A&amp;A expects losses for fourth quarter and year ALEXANDER &amp; Alexander, the world's second largest insurance broker, said that it expects to make losses in the fourth quarter and 1991 overall after taking a Dollars 75m charge to cover an operational restructuring and various asset write-downs. The company said that it also plans to sell certain 'non-core operations' during the first three months of 1992, including a non-broking business in the Netherlands and a Florida operation that administers workers' compensation self-insurer funds. It said that the sales should generate about Dollars 57m, reducing to about Dollars 40m after tax. A&amp;A, which has seen net profits slide from Dollars 34.9m to Dollars 24.8m in the first three quarters of 1991, said more than half the special charge relates to restructuring costs. This principally affects the US operations, where the company has the largest concentration of offices at present. The company said it planned to divide offices into three main categories: those handling global accounts, which would be concentrated in 16 cities; regional centres which would look after small commercial business; and 'middle market' offices, concentrating on national and regional business, and focusing on certain specialised areas like healthcare and energy. It declined to say how many jobs would be affected, but suggested that this should not exceed the rate of job losses seen over the past three years - around 400 a year. The company also said that it was maintaining its regular quarterly dividend at 25 cents a share. A&amp;A has had a particularly painful year, with flat commissions, a slow turn in the property/casualty cycle, and declining investment income. Cost-containment has, therefore, become a high priority. The announcement came after the market closed. A&amp;A shares were unchanged at Dollars 20 3/8 .</p>

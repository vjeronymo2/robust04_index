			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Tallinn, April 12 -- Leaders of two Estonian  private TV-companies -- EVTV and RTV, Viktor Siilats and Mart  Siimann told a press conference on Tuesday [12 April] that an  agreement had been concluded between them to use the former  Ostankino TV-channel on the basis of equality, and said that  broadcasts will be started on April 18.    RTV will have its broadcasting time on Mondays, Wednesdays,  Fridays and Sundays from 18.00 to 24.00 and RTV on Tuesdays,  Thursdays and Saturdays from 17.10-24.00 and on Sunday from  9.00. The leaders said that at the beginning the companies will  remain independent corporate bodies, at least till autumn, after  which a possible joining can be discussed. At the beginning  both companies have their independent programmes with some  possible joint programmes.    The two TV-companies had their own TV-channels which,  however, did not cover the whole territory of Estonia for  technical reasons. After Ostankino TV broadcasts were stopped on  March 28 because of a debt of 2.5 million kroons of the Russian  TV company to the Estonian Broadcast Transmission Centre, the  channel was allocated to RTV and EVTV at their application.</p>

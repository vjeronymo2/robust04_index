			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Gu Wanming (7357 8001 2494)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- During his recent  investigation and study tour of Guangdong Province, Li Tieying,  member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, state  councillor, and minister in charge of the State Commission For  Economic Restructuring, pointed out: Establishing a modern  enterprise system is the correct method for reform of  state-owned enterprises -- it signifies that enterprise reform  is shifting from the government delegating powers to enterprises  and letting enterprises retain more profits, to establishing a  new enterprise system. This has great significance for  improving the management of large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises. All localities should make positive efforts to  seek new ways to effectively practice the public ownership  system and should study the state economy's microeconomic  organizational forms under socialist market economic conditions.    From 12 to 20 April, Li Tieying conducted investigations and  studies in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Huizhou, Foshan, and Zhanjiang  cities on how to experiment with establishing a modern  enterprise system. He heard reports by concerned departments of  provincial and city authorities on enterprise reform; inspected  some enterprises; and held a special meeting attended by  comrades in charge of Guangdong Province and various cities,  secretaries of party committees of concerned departments, and  factory directors (managers) of some enterprises, to seek their  opinions.    The central authorities' various macroeconomic reform  measures are being smoothly implemented in Guangdong, and the  Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee and government have done a  great deal to implement these measures. Compared with the same  period last year, the value of the province's sold industrial  products increased 18.6 percent in the first quarter of this  year, financial revenue increased 48.8 percent, total retail  sales of consumer products increased 33 percent, and total  exports increased 96.1 percent. Li Tieying held that  Guangdong's economic situation was good. He said: Although some  practical difficulties and problems have cropped up in the  course of development, most of them are just problems pertaining  to development -- they are temporary. The central authorities  are currently taking measures to solve some of these problems  that are common in all localities. Guangdong has placed great  importance on enterprise reform. All the cities I have visited  have seriously studied and boldly practiced enterprise reform  measures. They have conducted a great deal of studies on reform  of the property right system, social insurance system, and  enterprises' three systems [labor, personnel, and wage  distribution system] as well as on preserving and increasing the  value of state assets, and on improving and injecting new  vitality into enterprise management.    Li Tieying pointed out: Enterprises experimenting with  establishing a modern enterprise system should primarily study  ways to improve the enterprise legal person system; decide the  main investment channels for enterprises' state assets; decide  enterprises' legal person organizational form; establish a  scientific enterprise management structure; reform the  enterprise labor and personnel system; improve the enterprise  financial and accounting system; enable party organizations of  enterprises to serve as a political nucleus; and improve  enterprises' trade union work and democratic management by  workers. In addition, they should study ways to establish a  macroeconomic regulation and control system, social insurance  system, unified market system, and socialized service system in  line with the market economy, in order to organically integrate  macroeconomic reform with enterprises' microeconomic reform.    Li Tieying stressed: We should strengthen leadership over  the work on experimenting with establishing a modern enterprise  system, and should establish a responsibility system for  carrying out the work. Major comrades in charge of concerned  localities and departments should personally take charge of the  work of the 100 enterprises selected to experiment with  establishing a modern enterprise system under the State  Council's guidance; well-trained personnel should be assigned to  assume specific responsibilities. All responsibilities should be  affixed to individuals in charge, and they should ensure that  work is carried out in a down-to-earth manner. Li Tieying said:  The term "modern enterprise system" is a general term for an  enterprise system in which enterprises' property rights, powers,  and responsibility are clearly defined; government  administration is separated from enterprise management; and  scientific enterprise management is practiced. A modern  enterprise system may be implemented in various specific forms.  All localities should act in light of their local conditions,  proceed from the actual situation, and make use of beneficial  experiences from abroad while exploring new ways to establish a  modern enterprise system. As reform continues to deepen, we  should continue to change the way we think, and must not be  bound by our current understanding of things, which may impede  our efforts to deepen reform. Li Tieying added: In  experimenting with establishing a modern enterprise system, we  should step up investigation and study work, and sum up  experience regularly. Experimental work should be carried out  steadily and in an active and down-to-earth manner -- we must  not rush headlong into mass action or do work just for form's  sake. Currently, we are experimenting with establishing a modern  enterprise system; we should endeavor to achieve some results.  This is not the time to promote the system in all enterprises.  The term "modern enterprise system" is scientifically defined;  we should not regard the system as a basket and throw everything  into it because this will tarnish the system's reputation. For  enterprises experimenting with establishing a modern enterprise  system, we should do a good fundamental job -- we should  transform their operating mechanisms; improve their internal  management; improve their efficiency; improve their  profitability; and carry out the various economic policies and  macroeconomic regulation, control, and reform measures adopted  by the central authorities, in order to lay a good foundation  for the next-step reform.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- The Pyongyang Circus  Theatre in Kwangbok Street of the capital city is drawing a  capacity audience every day with the show given by acrobats from  many countries in the current 12th April Spring Friendship Art  Festival.    The festival involves many well-known and talented acrobats  including international circus festival prize winners.    "Aerial plastic stunt" performed by Russian acrobats, which  had carried off a prize at an international circus festival in  France, is acclaimed for the successful aerial performance of  movements requiring courage and high technique.    The Bulgarian acrobats in "pole balancing" demonstrate  skillful movements such as feats on a pole standing on the  forehead and midair backward somersault. Their "aerial flight  on trapezes" also deeply impresses the audience.    The acrobats from China in all pieces fully show their  skill,  unique technique and distinguished stunts. "The wedding day of a  girl" delights the audience with its comic scene.    The audience is enchanted by "mixed plastic trio," a  world-famous acrobatic piece which had been awarded the grand  prix at an art festival in Cuba and the Silver Lion Prize at the  national circus festival. The acrobats present thrilling scenes  by standing on their hands with bowls piled on their heads and  soles of their feet.    An Egyptian acrobat, an international circus festival prize  winner, shows quick and nimble movements in spear revolving and  Mongolian acrobats successfully perform "hand feats".    The "plastic trio" performed by three brothers from Morocco,  prize winners at several festivals, displays difficult and  complex movements on a low disc to be acclaimed by the audience.</p>

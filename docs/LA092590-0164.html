			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCUMENTARY ;  </P> <P> U.S. DOCTORS PAY A SOVIET HOUSE CALL;  </P> <P> THE TEAM OF PHYSICIANS FROM ALASKA FOUND VAST DIFFERENCES IN MEDICAL CARE. THEY  ALSO FOUND AN APPRECIATIVE COLLECTION OF PATIENTS.  </P> <P> Dr. Fritz Craft, 34, an American dentist filling teeth in a hospital in this  remote seaport on the Bering Sea, could not believe it when his first adult  patient jumped up and hugged him at the end of his appointment.  </P> <P> Then it happened again. And again.  </P> <P> Anesthesia, it turned out, is rarely used when repairing cavities in the Soviet  Far East. So for the first time in most of their lives, Craft's Soviet patients  were experiencing painless dentistry.  </P> <P> No wonder the outbursts of emotion.  </P> <P> For 32 members of an Alaskan medical expedition to this part of Siberia, the  example was just one of many they discovered during a 17-day tour of the Soviet  Union's northeasternmost corner -- a tour that underlined for them and for a  Times reporter allowed to accompany the mission vast differences between U.S.  and Soviet health care.  </P> <P> Often, conditions and procedures were primitive by American standards. The  visitors saw novel techniques unfamiliar to most in the United States, some of  them showing medical promise, others smacking more of folk medicine. There was  the "bone-stretching" procedure, the use of enormous quantities of electricity  in shock therapy, the use of ultraviolet light tubes as treatments for colds.  </P> <P> "Any time a child has an earache, sore throat, runny nose or cold, we have them  sit with an ultraviolet light in their ear, nose or mouth for a few minutes,"  explained the Soviet doctor on duty in the medical ward of the Fairy Tales  Kindergarten in Bilibino,  </P> <P> site of the world's only nuclear power station above the Arctic Circle.  </P> <P> As he spoke, a little girl and a boy were seated at a tiny table with  ultraviolet light tubes up their nostrils. Another girl had a tube in her  mouth. "Colds in this, the coldest place on Earth, are passed around quickly,"  the doctor noted. "We found that the ultraviolet light treatment has cured and  reduced colds in our kindergarten by 40%."  </P> <P> The ultraviolet machine is just one of the numerous exotic medical devices  never before seen by the American doctors who visited clinics and hospitals in  the small cities of Pevek, Bilibino, Anadyr and Magadan, and a number of rural  communities in Magadan Oblast (region), across the Bering Sea from Alaska.  </P> <P> Steve Carr, 42, a physician's assistant with the Alaska State Dept. of  Corrections, visited a hospital in Talja where he saw 1,000 volts of  electricity fired through the body of a woman being treated for depression.  </P> <P> "The hair on her head stood straight up," Carr said. "I was told the  electricity was run through her to realign her nervous system. She was seated  in a chair mounted on thick rubber mats. Obviously, she wasn't grounded. If  someone had touched her, they would have been electrocuted."  </P> <P> In the United States, a typical shock treatment -- known as electroconvulsive  therapy, or ECT -- would use 150 volts of electricity, according to an American  mental health specialist.  </P> <P> The Russians here have other techniques that would look strange to an American  doctor. Heated demitasse-size suction cups are placed on patients' backs to  keep fluids from settling in lungs and are put on other parts of the body for  all sorts of aches and pains.  </P> <P> Many traditional home remedies are used in hospitals -- herbal medication, hot  packs on the chest, mustard plasters, chopped garlic around the neck, hot tea,  honey and vodka.  </P> <P> High-frequency current is prescribed for muscle stimulation. Ultrasound is a  common procedure. Weird-looking electromagnetic field machines with a claw-like  device suspended over one's head are supposed to cure headaches.  </P> <P> All these are part of normal treatment in hospitals where medicinal mud is  often applied on the belly of a pregnant woman, on the belly of a woman wanting  to get pregnant, for arthritis, bursitis, and other such ailments.  </P> <P> The American doctors were fascinated with the possibilities offered by some of  the Russians' exotic procedures but expressed a great deal of skepticism about  most of the unorthodox practices they saw in the hospitals.  </P> <P> One unusual surgical procedure developed here, however, has already been  introduced in Alaska -- the Gavril Ilizarov bone-stretching technique.  Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Michael Holloway, 45, has used the procedure 40 times in  Alaska since he was here on a similar expedition last year. It is applied to  cases where a patient, due to either birth defect or injury, has one leg  shorter than the other.  </P> <P> Holloway explained the procedure this way: Wires drilled into bones are  attached to external metal rings. The rings are connected to rods and bolts  that are turned with a wrench one-fourth of a millimeter four times a day. When  the desired length is achieved, the bone is held in place to allow  consolidation.  </P> <P> When performed properly, there is regeneration "not only of a healthy bone, but  also of skin, muscle, blood vessels and nerves lengthening up to 10 inches in  the leg," Holloway said. "People that are crippled don't have to stay crippled  with this remarkable discovery."  </P> <P> What the Soviet health care system lacks is at least as striking as some of its  more unusual procedures and techniques.  </P> <P> Although there are many doctors, there is a serious shortage of specialists.  The system also lack materials and supplies. Needles and syringes, for example,  are used repeatedly.  </P> <P> There is an acute shortage of birth control products, and abortions are common.  In a Pevek hospital last year, there were 900 abortions and 500 births.  </P> <P> Anchorage ophthalmologist Marvin Greendahl, 46, hoped to perform a simple  surgery on interpreter Tatiana Khokhorina's 3 1/2-year-old son, who has a  congenital cataract with 50% vision in the affected eye. But he was unable to  operate, he said, "because, unfortunately, there is no high-tech ophthalmology  equipment in the entire Magadan region."  </P> <P> "If Tatiana's son does not have the operation, he will lose sight in the eye,"  Greendahl said. "I'm making arrangements to fly the boy to Alaska for surgery  later this year. It's impossible to do the type of eye surgeries here that we  do every day in the United States."  </P> <P> Royann Royer, 35, who teaches dental hygiene at the University of Alaska, found  a great fear of dentists among children here. "They cry with pain because there  is no anesthesia. Dentists have no X-ray machines. Dental equipment is  low-speed, prolonging pain."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the children also tend not to brush their teeth every day. It's  easy to understand why. Toothpaste is a product in seemingly perpetual short  supply throughout the Soviet Union, and the local variant "tastes terrible,"  noted Craft. "When I gave them American toothpaste, they went bananas over it.  They wanted to brush more."  </P> <P> Common medical practice here often seems bizarre by U.S. standards, starting  with the pay of the doctors.  </P> <P> Under the past 73 years of communism and the dictatorship of the proletariat,  doctors and nurses, along with engineers and teachers, have made among the  lowest salaries in the country -- half to one-fifth as much as common laborers,  mechanics, bus drivers and miners. It is from the working class, not the  professional class, that much of the leadership of the country is derived.  </P> <P> Dr. Nina Tihovska, 38, a cancer specialist in Magadan City, earns 500 rubles a  month (the equivalent of about $800 at the official exchange rate) -- twice as  much as doctors in other parts of the Soviet Union because of Siberia's  remoteness and harsh climate. She said the reason 70% of Soviet doctors are  women is because men prefer to earn much higher salaries as workers, leaving  the lower-paying jobs to women.  </P> <P> Joe Ryan, a hospital administrator, and Steve O'Connor, a paramedic, were  quickly ushered out of a maternity ward in Pevek, a seaport nearly on top of  the world, at the edge of the Arctic's East Siberian Sea and icebound most of  the year.  </P> <P> "You'd have thought we had the plague," said Ryan, 57, director of the Indian  Health Service Hospital in Bethel, Alaska.  </P> <P> What Ryan and O'Connor didn't know was that in general, only women are  permitted in Soviet maternity wards. Even the new father is forbidden to see  his wife or child for six days, when they leave the maternity wing of the  hospital.  </P> <P> Unlike America, where hospitals discharge patients as soon as possible, here a  15- to 30-day stay is common for a relatively minor problem or procedure.  </P> <P> Soviet hospitals try to make up for their technical shortcomings in other ways.  "The Soviet doctors seem to be knowledgeable and their surgical skills appear  to be excellent," commented Alaska hospital administrator Joe Ryan.  </P> <P> Also, he added, "there is a great deal of loving and care on the part of Soviet  doctors and nurses.  </P> <P> But they lack modern instruments and technology. It is like the 1930s."  </P> <P> In Bilibino, Galina Nikonchok, 35, a hospital head nurse, showed Brian Saylor,  42, of the Anchorage Health Department, the record room where a red  cloth-covered medical record book is kept for every person living in the city.  </P> <P> Each book starts with a birth certificate. Every time the person visits a  doctor or a hospital, an entry is made in the book until the final recording of  the death certificate. If a person moves, the record book is sent to the  hospital in the new location.  </P> <P> Children's hospital walls are decorated with colorful murals and drawings of  fairy-tale and other characters, including even Mickey Mouse. Children wear  Mickey Mouse T-shirts by Soviet artists.  </P> <P> Communist propaganda posters line hospital corridors. In one hospital were  photographs from the Afghanistan war. In hospitals throughout Magadan Oblast,  one can see V. I. Lenin and Mickey Mouse side by side.  </P> <P> The 32 members of the Alaska medical expedition flew from Anchorage to  Provideniya in a chartered Aeroflot turboprop. From there the expedition split  into four groups, flying to various centers in rural areas of the Magadan  region. Helicopter flights were made to remote camps where Soviet medical  brigades provide health care for nomadic reindeer herders.  </P> <P> Ted Mala, 43, a physician and University of Alaska professor, led the  expedition. Alaska's Democratic Gov. Steve Cowper has described Mala as "the  key player in the unfolding relations between the Soviet Far East and Alaska."  </P> <P> Mala went to Moscow in 1985 and later visited the Siberian Academy of Medical  Science. He is a founder of the International Union for Circumpolar Health  </P> <P> and was the organization's first secretary.  </P> <P> With a membership consisting of all nations at the top of the world, the  union's purpose is to research health problems common to the global far north.  </P> <P> In June, 1988, Mala became founder-director of the Institute for Circumpolar  Health Studies at the University of Alaska with an initial $500,000 funding  from the Alaska Legislature. He led his first medical expedition to Siberia  last summer. His Soviet counterpart, who coordinates the expeditions in the  Soviet Union, is Dr. Alexsei Lebedev, 47, the minister of health for Magadan  Oblast.  </P> <P> Mala is credited by many with melting the "ice curtain" that previously existed  between Alaska and its neighbor across the Bering Sea. America's first male  Eskimo physician, Mala attributes his success in breaking down the barriers  between the two nations "to the magic of my heritage," and adds, "You see, my  father was an Eskimo and my mother was Russian."  </P></p>

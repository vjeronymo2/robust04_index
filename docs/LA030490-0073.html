			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USE OF TECHNICIANS WOULD FREE PHARMACISTS TO SPEND MORE TIME AS CUSTOMER  ADVOCATES  </P> <P> Harry Bernstein takes a common sense approach ("Prescription for Pharmacist  Shortage," Feb. 6) by advocating wider use of technicians in pharmacies. While  this measure alone will not solve the current national pharmacist shortage, it  would certainly help.  </P> <P> Until now, the use of pharmacy technicians has not been allowed in California  in any setting other than a hospital. A recently adopted Board of Pharmacy  regulatory amendment would change that, if approved by the state Office of  Administrative Law. We have used pharmacy technicians successfully in hospitals  for years, and I think other pharmacy practice settings would benefit from  their use as well.  </P> <P> One important reason for using pharmacy technicians is to make the pharmacist  more accessible to patients. Pharmacists have a professional obligation to  promote safe and effective use of drugs. This requires that they counsel  patients on the appropriate use of their prescription medication and make  themselves available to answer questions that patients may have about their  prescriptions. It is difficult for pharmacists to meet this responsibility if  they personally have to perform all the steps involved in filling a  prescription. That's where technicians come in.  </P> <P> We encourage your readers to think of their pharmacists -- whether in the  community pharmacy or in the hospital -- as their advocates in all matters  related to drug therapy. We're here to help, and we want to.  </P> <P> MAX D. RAY  </P> <P> Sacramento  </P> <P> The writer is executive vice president of the California Society of Hospital  Pharmacists.  </P> <P> </P></p>

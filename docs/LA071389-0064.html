			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> FIRM WINS CONTRACT TO TEST FOR ESCAPING GAS AT LANDFILL  </P> <P> The Whittier City Council has approved a contract with Kleinfelder/Mandeville  &amp; Associates to test for escaping gas at the Savage Canyon Landfill.  </P> <P> The testing and monitoring process, which will cost the city about $122,000, is  required by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, according to city  officials.  </P> <P> Whittier officials have until Sept. 1 to complete testing for the possible  escape of landfill gas into the atmosphere. Organic compounds emit gases as  they decompose. The AQMD limit on the amount of acceptable gas released into  the atmosphere is 50 parts per million of atmosphere.  </P> <P> Although two other firms submitted proposals that were lower in cost,  Kleinfelder/Mandeville was selected because it already has acted as a liaison  between the AQMD and the city, according to a staff report.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Hui (0060 6540): "Theoretical and Practical </F> Bases for Establishing Labor Unions in Rural Enterprises"]    [Text] Since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Congress,  China's rural enterprises have grown exponentially, developed  rapidly and become an important component of the national  economy that exerts significant leverage in building socialist  modernization. By the end of 1992, the total number of rural  enterprises reached 20.78 million, employing 105 million people,  producing an annual output value of 177 million yuan, of which  127 million yuan represented industrial output value or about  one-third of China's total. The abrupt start and rapid  development of rural enterprises represent an unanticipated  major byproduct of the reform and opening policy as well as  great historical progress in China's rural economic and social  developments. Therefore, establishing rural enterprise labor  unions by a planned and systematic approach, adjusting as  required to the trend, firmly adhering to reality and testing  the approach under different circumstances, has significant  meaning in terms of promoting development of rural enterprises  in China.  <H5>  I. Theoretical Basis for Establishing Rural Enterprise Labor </H5> Unions    Rural enterprise development is both an important component  and a notable feature in establishing socialism with special  Chinese characteristics; it is a road that socialist China must  travel in order to industrialize. In carrying out  industrialization, capitalist countries generally have built up  industries by bankrupting agriculture and developed urban cities  at the expense of rural areas. China as a socialist country  cannot travel down this road. It is a fact of life that some 80  percent of China's population live in rural areas. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping and the Party and Central Government, therefore, have  advocated giving strong and enthusiastic support to the new  initiatives represented by the rural enterprises, vigorously  mobilizing millions of peasants to enter into industry and  commerce, promoting a new model of laborers who "leave their  farmland without leaving their village homes, and who work in  factories without going into the cities," and accelerating and  strengthening the growth and vigorous development not only of  the labor rank and file but of the rural enterprises themselves.    Rural enterprise development is important not only in  liberating and developing the society's productive force under  Marxism, but also in terms of minimizing the three great  discrepancies. For a developing socialist country like China  with a large population and limited resources, the question of  how to gradually eliminate the three great discrepancies and  realize common prosperity has very serious theoretical as well  as practical implications. Rural enterprise development opens up  a major route for reducing the three great discrepancies by  effectively strengthening grass-root political power in the new  era represented by an industrial-agricultural alliance and at  the same time maintaining the integrity of the socialist system.    Development of a market-oriented economy implies that more  and more people will no longer depend on agriculture for their  livelihood. China is in the early stages of socialism and will  gradually be changing from an agricultural nation with a  majority of population engaged in farming to a modern industrial  nation in which nonfarm population will be in the majority. The  rapid development of rural enterprises has changed the  structures of industrial enterprises and labor rank and file  concentrating in urban cities and areas. By 1992, among the 105  million people employed in rural enterprises, approximately 20  million were classified to be "of farming origin, now employed  as laborer;" these people basically have completed the  peasant-to-laborer transition and now possess the basic  characteristics of the labor class. A majority of these laborers  are found in the large and medium-sized cities and suburbs along  the southeastern coastal areas, and mainly employed in  enterprises operated by villages and townships. Although as a  category these laborers originally came from rural areas, they  have basically left agricultural pursuits to devote full-time to  industrial production; their source of livelihood come from  wages and their lives are increasing integrated with socialist  production. Some of the rural enterprises have come close to or  reached domestic and international advanced standards in terms  of technological facilities, production scale, management  standard and economic strength. Along the coastal areas and in  the large and medium-sized cities and surrounding areas, there  are many townships that now possess the special characteristics  of modern life. The workers in these townships are radically  different from the traditional peasants in methods of  production, social living, economic and labor relationships as  well as concept of values; these workers attach greater  importance to the ideology of collectivism and to organizational  rules and regulations and they themselves are becoming a major  driving force in reform and opening and economic construction.  <H5>  II. Establishing Labor Unions Is An Objective Requirement in </H5> Rural Enterprise Development    Rural enterprise labor unions are the inevitable products at  a certain stage of rural enterprise development. For rural  enterprises to continue to develop rapidly, labor unions need to  be established because of economic imperatives as well as the  need for public support of the masses.    Rural enterprises have numerous advantages. From the time  they were established, they have developed under market  competition in which only the strong and fit survived, and they  have demonstrated strong vitality. But in the process of  development, several rather common contradictions have remained  unresolved: First, the contradiction between the ideological and  technical-cultural quality of the work force and the  increasingly modernized enterprise management. According to  studies, close to 20 percent of the rural enterprise work force  has a cultural level of less than secondary or primary  education, less than 3 percent has completed secondary schooling  or specialized training, and some 43 percent of the total work  force are employed in non-technical jobs. Second, the  contradiction between the enterprise management and the lively  and vigorous market operating system. Rural enterprises have  their own lively special characteristics in production  management, labor utilization, internal allocations, etc. But  due to special circumstances and certain historic conditions,  some rural enterprises are still weak in management. Third, the  contradiction between the speeding up of enterprise development  and the lack of coordination in labor relations. Many rural  enterprises still have problems in labor utilization and  allocation, working conditions and social welfare.    Establishing labor unions represents the urgent and sincere  desire of the rural enterprise work force. The workers consider  it honorable and satisfying to be members of the labor class by  joining labor unions; their desire to join is increasing daily  and they hope to exercise their democratic rights through the  labor unions and, as union representatives, enter into  discussions with management on enterprise production, labor  utilization and protection and social welfare; they hope that  labor union representatives can help maintain and protect their  personal benefits; they also hope that labor unions can assist  by providing them with opportunities for further study and  training. The majority work force in rural enterprises has shown  a great deal of enthusiasm for joining labor unions; according  to a survey of 1,200 rural enterprise laborers conducted by Wuxi  City, 86 percent of those surveyed indicated they would like to  join labor unions.    Establishing labor unions also represents the desire of many  rural enterprise party and government leaders. Faced with fierce  market competition, many rural enterprise cadres in Suzhou City  deeply feel the need to catch up in "five aspects in which they  are falling behind," namely, as the scale of enterprise is  enlarged, the leadership system is falling behind; when  enterprise development requires that ideological, moral and  technical qualities of the work force be raised continuously,  the education of workers is falling behind; because important  enterprise decisions also require taking into account the  feelings of the masses and their benefits, democratic management  is falling behind; while enterprise leadership needs to  understand in a timely fashion the thoughts and feelings of the  work force, the work in communicating with workers and labor  welfare are falling behind; and finally when factory directors  and party secretaries are busily engaged in production  management, the task of studying and improving labor protection  and welfare is falling behind. Many enterprise managers in Wuxi  City generally agree that they are "too busy to cope" with four  problem areas, namely, enterprise management, ideological  education, technical training and solving issues of labor  protection and welfare. It is urgently hoped that [rural  enterprise labor unions] will effectively "assist" in the same  way as labor unions in State-owned enterprises to organize the  masses for self-management, to help the enterprise by exercising  oversight, and to assist the enterprise leadership to carry out  tasks which strengthen the enterprise's drive and competitive  strength. According to a survey of over 2,000 rural industrial  and commercial enterprises in the suburbs of Wuxi City, 98  percent of the managers agreed that labor unions should quickly  be established among the rural enterprises.    For rural enterprises to get on track with modernized  management and socialized production and to more effectively  engage in market competition, we will need to depend on the  Party and Government to devise progressive, comprehensive and  relevant policies and regulations; much work remains to be done  by all parties, with labor unions helping to organize the work  force and the laborers themselves relying on their own strength  to make progress and at the same time to help promote progress  in the rural enterprises.  <H5>  3. Basis in Policy and Law for Establishing Rural Enterprise </H5> Labor Unions    It has been exactly 10 years since China's first rural  enterprise labor union was established in 1983. During the past  10 years, the Party, Government and labor union organization  have paid close attention to the growth of this new army of  labor rank and file. In 1984, the All-China Labor Federation  began to organize rural enterprise labor unions on a trial  basis. In 1988, the CPC Central Committee Politburo Standing  Committee, after discussion, approved in principle the "Basic  Concept of Labor Union Reform" which states: "All rural  enterprises which meet the required conditions should establish  labor unions based on the principle of free will of the  workers." In August that same year, document No. 17 (1988) of  the CPC Central Committee Office of General Administration  points out that with rural enterprises developing and  strengthening on a daily basis, the trend to establish labor  unions should be followed. In 1992, the "Labor Union Law of the  People's Republic of China" was promulgated, which clearly  specifies that: All workers whose main livelihood is based on  wages received from rendering physical or mental labor in any  enterprises, organizations or work units -- regardless of  nationality, ethnicity, sex, occupation, religious belief or  educational level -- shall have the right to legally organize  and join labor unions. Not long ago, given the concern of leader  cadres and comrades in the Central Government, responsible  personnel of the All-China Labor Federation and the Agricultural  Ministry, after discussions and coordination, reached agreement  on the issue of rural enterprises establishing labor unions and  made a number of joint recommendations in the minutes of the  meeting. These recommendations provide the basis for political  support, legal protection and implementing steps for rural  enterprises to establish labor unions.    With support from party and government leadership and joint  efforts of labor organizations at all levels, close to 20,000  rural enterprises have established labor unions with a total  membership approaching 3 million persons, while some 2 million  persons are in the process of being unionized. Practically  speaking, establishing labor unions in rural enterprises is  beneficial in several areas: it strengthens party leadership of  having rural enterprises to follow and fulfil in practice the  labor class objectives; it strengthens ideological political  work and technical job training to raise the quality of the work  force; it stabilizes coordination of enterprise-labor relations  to maintain the legitimate benefits of the work force; and it  strengthens management, promotes development and improves  economic benefits of the enterprises.  <H5>  IV. Positively and Practically Carry Out the Work of </H5> Establishing Rural Enterprise Labor Unions    Gradually establishing rural enterprises labor unions is a  glorious mission which history has assigned to us. However, in  establishing rural enterprise labor unions, certain concrete and  practical conditions must also be met. These conditions include:  the enterprise having a legal corporate status, a fixed  production site, a certain scale of production, facilities as  well as technical expertise, engaging in normal production with  a stable work force and earning relatively good economic  returns. Based on analysis of data, only 2 percent, or about  400,000, of all rural enterprises at present meet all the  conditions for establishing labor unions, and their work force  totals approximately 20 million workers. These enterprises are  mainly located along the southeastern coastal areas and in the  large and medium-size cities and their environs, and most of  these are collective enterprises operated by villages and  townships.    From China's overall standpoint, establishing rural  enterprise labor unions at present is still in an experimental  stage and should be expanded in principle, but it cannot be done  in one stroke. Rural enterprises in the coastal areas, being  developed, ready and able to meet the requisite conditions, can  gradually proceed on a trial basis; for rural enterprises in  China's central area, labor union organizing work is only in the  preliminary stages but can be expanded on an experimental basis;  in the western area, however, the requisite conditions for  establishing rural enterprise labor unions should strictly be  observed; but all "foreign funded" rural enterprises,  particularly the "three-sources combined" type, should speed up  the establishment of labor unions.    Among the already established rural enterprise labor unions,  we should focus on their special characteristics, concretely  develop them and strive to raise their working standards. There  are some commonalities between rural enterprise labor unions and  their urban counterparts. The former should concentrate on  learning from the rich experiences of the latter. At the same  time, rural enterprises have their own special characteristics.  They cannot copy or transfer wholesale the modus operandi of  their urban counterparts; rather, by studying and learning from  the work experience of their urban counterparts, rural  enterprise labor unions should bravely explore, experiment,  gradually shape and perfect the operational parameters of labor  unions with special rural enterprise characteristics. Rural  enterprises should view enterprise production and economic  returns as an integral whole, and mobilize the work force to  contribute to the various missions and tasks involved; carry out  effective education to raise the quality of the work force;  organize the laborers to participate in democratic management,  and tap the strength of the masses to run a good enterprise;  protect and maintain the legitimate benefits and interests of  the work force by coordinating labor relations and stabilizing  the labor rank and file; pay special attention to difficulties  encountered by the workers, and assist in making and  administering gradual improvements in labor conditions and  worker welfare; perform more practical services for the workers;  prepare and concretely develop cultural and physical programs to  energize and enrich the workers' spiritual livelihood, etc.; and  fully develop the special advantages of labor unions.    Establishing rural enterprise labor unions is a major task  that requires an overall, political and mass-oriented focus, it  absolutely should not be treated simply as an operational task.  With leadership party and government support at all levels, we  must probe deeply into the lower levels and investigate, study  and constantly summarize experiences of our work in order to  shape and perfect relevant policies and measures to promote  healthy development in the work of establishing rural enterprise  labor unions.</p>

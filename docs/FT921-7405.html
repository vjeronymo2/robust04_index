			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead UNILEVER, the consumer products group, reports on Tuesday its figures for the fourth quarter and full year. With the US poised uncertainly between recession and recovery, the British economy in the doldrums and growth petering out in continental Europe, the results will depend heavily on the success of Unilever's continuing efforts to improve margins through cost-cutting. Analysts' forecasts for full year pre-tax profits range from Pounds 1.8bn to Pounds 1.84bn, a modest increase on the Pounds 1.78bn earned in 1990. Much of the difference between the forecasts is due to assumptions about how Unilever will allocate extraordinary charges incurred during the year. British Gas will report results for the 12 months to December 31 on Thursday. Because the company is this year changing its accounting year end from March 31 to December 31, it will also supply a figure for the nine months to December 31. Most analysts expect profit before tax for the year to December to be between Pounds 1.24bn and Pounds 1.28bn. British Gas has already indicated it will announce a dividend for the full year of 6p. UK insurers are bracing themselves to report some of the worst results in the history of the industry next week. Two composites (general and life companies) - Commercial Union and Royal Insurance  - report next week. Both will post losses for 1991. CU, which reports on Wednesday, will do best with a loss restricted to between Pounds 60m and Pounds 70m compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.4m last year. Royal Insurance, which reports on Thursday, has been devastated by losses from mortgage indemnity claims and could see its losses rise from Pounds 270m to Pounds 310m, up from Pounds 187m in 1990. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, reports its full-year results on Tuesday. Analysts expect the company will for the first time make a Pounds 1bn profit compared with Pounds 860m last year. Analysts will be looking carefully at the growth rate of SmithKline's pharmaceuticals sales, which have been slower than some of its rivals. In particular, they will be looking carefully at revenues from Kytril, SmithKline's treatment for nausea in cancer patients. It competes directly with Glaxo's Zofran. ICI, the chemicals giant, reports its full-year results on Thursday. The company is expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 835m. The figures are unlikely to demonstrate any sign of an upturn in demand for commodity chemical. Attention will be focused on the success at the pharmaceuticals division (about 70 per cent of the group's profit) and the progress of the company's rationalisation programme. The final dividend is expected to be maintained at 34p.</p>

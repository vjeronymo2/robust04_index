			<p>BFN     [Text] Groznyy, will react "extremely negatively" if the  Russian authorities extend the state of emergency to part of  Malgobek and Sunzhen Regions in Ingushetia, Chechnya's  presidential structures told Interfax on Tuesday. An official  reaction will follow as soon as the decree signed by the Russian  president on this score is "studied carefully enough."    The decree signed by Boris Yeltsin on Monday provides for  the  imposition of a special regime virtually throughout Malgobek and  Sunzhen Regions in Ingushetia. These regions are disputed by  Chechnya and Ingushetia, and Groznyy, views them as inherently  Chechen territories.    As Chechnya's Foreign Ministry told Interfax, Groznyy, will  view the deployment of Russian troops in Malgobek Region as an  "aggression by a foreign country." Chechnya's Foreign Minister,  Shamseddin Yusef, told Interfax that "adequate measures will be  taken to rebuff an aggression by Russian troops."    In the meantime Interfax learned from military sources in  Groznyy that on Wednesday Chechnya's armed forces are beginning  military exercises. The exercises are to take place in the  "territories bordering on adjoining states." Last week  Chechnya's troops went on high alert in connection with the  possible imposition of a state of emergency in Malgobek and  Sunzhen Regions of Ingushetia by Moscow.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / BAe may make Hawks for S Africa BRITISH AEROSPACE is holding discreet talks with South Africa on a possible contract for the Hawk military jet, once the United Nations lifts its embargo on defence sales, David White writes. A deal would involve either supplying UK-built Hawks, which are designed both as trainers and as light combat jets, or licensing their construction in South Africa. The company would not confirm that it was in negotiations with the state-owned South African group Denel. It added that any deal was clearly not possible under present circumstances. Contacts have been held at government level on potential opportunities for UK defence companies if the embargo is lifted following South Africa's elections next year.</p>

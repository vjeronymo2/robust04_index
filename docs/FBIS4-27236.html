			<p>BFN     [Text] Vietnam's Archeological Institute has conducted  excavations on a number of major islands belonging to Truong Sa  [Spratly] Archipelago of Truong Sa District, Thanh Hoa Province,  and found many artifacts testifying to Vietnam's sovereignty  over the region. Following are some details of the new  discoveries.    Archeologists found 350 pottery and porcelain pieces in the  southeastern part of the archipelago. They are similar to the  old potteries of Hop Lu and Cay Communes in Hai Hung Province,  about 50 kilometers east of Hanoi. The potteries of these two  communes were seen in the plain, in the midland, and also in  coastal regions in northern Vietnam. Old potteries from Hop Lu  also appeared in Truong Sa. This proved that in the 15th and  16th centuries, Vietnamese fishermen and traders were using the  Truong Sa Archipelago as a terminal to anchor their ships and as  a stopover place on their way to the high seas for fishing and  for dealing with foreign partners.    On Nam Yet Island, Vietnamese archeologists also excavated  165 old pottery pieces at a depth from 44 to 52 centimeters and  also [words indistinct] with heaps of shelves. These artifacts  prove that Nam Yet Island was a dwelling place of people in the  late Tran dynasty and early Le dynasty from the 15th to the 16th  centuries.    Also on Truong Sa Island, the archeologists found old coins  of the Minh Mang, Thieu Tri, and Tu Duc reigns of the Nguyen  dynasty in the 19th century. Scientific research is being  carried out by archeologists on the Truong Sa Archipelago.    The latest discoveries help the study on the social and  material life of a part of Vietnamese people's history in the  offshore region. They also serve as concrete evidence of  Vietnam's sovereignty over the Truong Sa Archipelago through  different periods of history. It is an undeniable fact.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / MPs likely to attack cost of compact discs THE MUSIC industry is expected to be criticised this week by a parliamentary committee report questioning the prices charged for compact discs. The report could be followed swiftly by an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, hinted at the end of last month that a referral may be made and that he would announce his decision in two to three weeks. Judging by the attitude of MPs their report to be published on Wednesday is likely to be highly critical. At ill-tempered public hearings of the national heritage committee last month members from all parties accused industry representatives of over-charging for CDs. Sir Bryan said at committee hearings that he still had an open mind about whether the UK music industry operated a complex monopoly on CDs. He added, however: 'There is enough information there to make me concerned about the situation.' He said that the lower price of CDs in the US had persuaded him the issue needed to be examined again, even though his predecessor, Sir Gordon Borrie, found no reason to call for an MMC investigation as recently as April last year. Sir Gordon said then he could see little reason why CD prices were so high, but that consumers appeared willing to pay the prices charged. Sir Bryan told the the recent committee that matters which needed to be explored included restrictions on CD imports from the US. In a letter to the Financial Times today Mr John Deacon, director-general of the British Phonographic Industry, denies that CD prices are 40 per cent higher in the UK than in the US. He says that, taking exchange rates into account, the difference is 10 per cent to 15 per cent. Letters, Page 14</p>

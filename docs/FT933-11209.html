			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Lex buys Arlington for Pounds 50m LEX Service is consolidating its position as the UK's largest car distribution and leasing company by acquiring the Arlington group of 36 car and truck dealerships from Unigate for Pounds 49.5m in cash, including the repayment of Pounds 20m in debt. The acquisition will push up the number of Lex car, van and truck dealerships to 129, well on the way to the group's target of 150 and significantly more than its main rivals, Inchcape, Hartwell, AFG, and T Cowie, according to figures supplied by Automotive Management magazine. It will increase Lex's share of the new car market in the UK to 3.6 per cent, from 3.1 per cent. The deal, to be completed tomorrow, is also an important step for Unigate, which has been refocusing its business on food and distribution. The proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt, with gearing expected to drop to about 43 per cent, from 60 per cent. It comes less than three months after Unigate was forced to postpone the public offering of Black-eyed Pea and Taco Bueno, its US restaurant chains, after the two reported poor sales in March and April. That move had been expected to raise between Dollars 220m and Dollars 250m. Arlington is the UK's 12th largest dealership group, ranked by volume, selling 9,200 new cars and trucks in the year to March 31, when it posted a pre-tax profit before Pounds 800,000 of exceptional items of Pounds 3m on sales of Pounds 262m. Commenting on the acquisition yesterday, Sir Trevor Chinn, Lex chairman, said: 'The Arlington group is particularly valuable to us because of its scale and geographic fit with our dealerships and because it adds a number of key franchises which we wish to develop.' Last year Lex expanded its dealership network with the acquisition of Swan National from the TSB. Last week, it announced it was re-entering the import business by acquiring a controlling interest in a joint venture which will have the exclusive right to import Hyundai cars.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUMOR POWER: 'JUST GET HIM TO DENY IT . . . '  </P> <P> Lyndon Johnson always loved the knee-slapper about the old Texas congressman  who after decades in office suddenly had someone dare to run against him. So he  hired a press agent and commanded: "Plant a story in the newspaper that says my  opponent had sexual relations with a pig."  </P> <P> Duly startled, the young press agent asked about the proof. "Proof -- hell!"  thundered the old pol. "Just get him to deny it!"  </P> <P> Which brings us, of course, to Lee Atwater and Newt Gingrich.  </P> <P> They are known to their band of disciples in Washington as skilled players of  political hardball. But they are proving, even to stalwart fellow Republicans,  to be players of sandlot sleazeball.  </P> <P> Just when we think we've got their number, they come up with a pitch that is  even more down and more dirty.  </P> <P> So one day, there is House Republican Whip Gingrich -- you remember him as the  man who quite properly nailed Jim Wright for taking money, but turns out to  have found his own loophole to get money from fat cats on a book deal. Newt is  on television bragging about how he's got his little list of "another nine or  10 -- maybe more than that -- House Democrats" who violated House ethics rules.  </P> <P> And then the Washington Post reported that one of his aides, Karen van  Brocklin, had spoken with that newspaper and other major news organizations  asking whether they planned to do stories looking into the personal life of new  House Speaker Thomas S. Foley. The respected New York Daily News columnist  Lars-Erik Nelson quoted a Gingrich aide as telling him, "We hear it's little  boys." Nelson has since identified the aide as Van Brocklin.  </P> <P> Now comes Lee Atwater's gang at the Republican National Committee. They have  mailed to party leaders around the country an unsubtle, unsavory memo that  seems to be written to raise suggestions about Foley's sexual preferences.  </P> <P> The four-page memo is titled: "Tom Foley: Out of the Liberal Closet." It  compares Foley's voting record with that of an openly gay congressman, Barney  Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat.  </P> <P> Like L.B.J.'s joke about the candidate and the pig, the Republican National  Committee memo quickly achieved its real purpose: On the day Foley was elected  speaker, the television networks also carried full reports of the memo and, of  course, its innuendo; newspapers carried it the next day. The quotes were out.  Grand Old Party mission accomplished. A-OK, GOP.  </P> <P> And over at the Republican headquarters, Atwater then went through the motions  of doing all the honorable things. Of course, he immediately called Foley and  issued an apology for the way the memo was interpreted. You see, the memo was  only trying to point out that Foley is a liberal. Nothing more.  </P> <P> At the RNC, officials all swore that Atwater had not known of the memo until  after it was mailed. It was written by RNC Communications Director Mark Goodin;  it was approved by RNC Chief of Staff Mary Matlin, who says she focused only on  what Goodin told her was the purpose of the memo -- to attack Foley for having  a liberal voting record. She says she never noticed the blatant sexual  innuendo, even though there is not a politically connected person in this  politically incestuous capital who was unaware of people who've been trying for  days to peddle all sorts of rumors about Foley and others.  </P> <P> Atwater's initial response, despite his apologia, was to take no action against  Goodin, his longtime associate. But that, of course, only raised more questions  about who really ordered and/or approved what. A day later, the now-unproud  author, Goodin, resigned. Bad judgment, all those at the RNC explained.  </P> <P> But what Goodin was guilty of was carrying out -- a bit excessively -- the  spirit instilled from above. It is a spirit that needs an emergency injection  of civility. And apparently, only George Bush can order that.  </P> <P> It is a measure of the sickness that pervades this capital city that the New  York Times felt the need to devote the 18th paragraph of its article on the  election of Foley as Speaker of the House to the following news:  </P> <P> "Members of Congress, speaking privately with Mr. Foley, have been told by the  Washington Democrat that he is heterosexual. He has been married for 20 years."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mohit Sen: "CPI's Debacle in UP"] </F>   [Text] An absolutely sensational development has taken  place in Uttar Pradesh [UP] as far as the Communist Party of  India [CPI] is concerned. And all said and done it is the CPI  which is the main Communist formation in that sprawling and  strategic State of the heartland of India. What happens to it is  of the greatest relevance to all Communists there and throughout  the country.    What has happened is that practically the entire veteran  leadership of the CPI in Uttar Pradesh has collectively decided  to join the Samajwadi Party led by Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav.  These leaders include Mr. Mitra Sen Yadav who was at the time of  his leaving the CPI the secretary of its Uttar Pradesh unit, an  MLA [member of Legislative Assembly] from Fiazabad, just  adjacent to Ayodhya. Joining him are Mr. Guru Prasad, for long  the assistant secretary of the Uttar Pradesh unit of the CPI and  for some time the all-India president of the Agricultural  Labourers' Organisation of the CPI and Mr. Ramchander Baksh  Singh, the veteran leader from Banabanki district and the sole  CPI representative in the UP Legislative Council.    The most important of the rebels is Dr. Z.A. Ahmad. There  are, of course, reports that he may not quit the CPI though he  has not so far denied that he is with the rebels. He has,  however, made it absolutely clear on many occasions that his  sympathies lie with Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, whom he believes  represents the wave of the future for defeating the BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party] and advancing towards the emancipation  of the oppressed. Dr. Ahmad is no ordinary leader of the CPI. It  would be appropriate to recall just who he is. Coming from a  highly placed family in the undivided Punjab he became a  Communist in London in the early 1930s where he worked  successfully for a doctorate in the London School of Economics.  He, along with Sajjad Zaheer and Hiren Mukherjee, were the first  of the "England returned" Communists to be followed a decade  later by Mohan Kumaramangalam, Indrajit Gupta, Nikhil  Chakravarthy, N.K. Krishnan and others. On returning to India he  plunged into the freedom struggle and soon drew attention to  himself as that rare phenomenon of a highpowered intellectual  who was also a mass worker. On top of it all he came from a  distinguished Muslim family and was an ardent secularist,  patriot and radical. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru took him to the  AICC [All India Congress Committee] headquarters in Allahabad as  one of his secretaries when he was the president of the Congress.    Among the other secretaries of Panditji was Dr. Rammanohar  Lohia. The two learned lieutenants of the then Congress  president got on well together since both strongly supported  their leader's combining patriotism and nationalism with  socialism. Dr. Lohia was just the opposite of what he later  became. He was then a Nehruite. Dr. Ahmad was right from those  days a convinced proponent of the need for Congress-Communist  unity and also of the need to pay special attention to weaning  the Muslim masses away from the influence of communalism.    Dr. Ahmad went on to become one of the tallest and best  known  leader of the then single CPI. He was a member of its all-India  leadership from the forties and has been there in one or another  official position for over half-a-century. It has to be said to  his credit that he never accepted the official thesis of the CPI  that the Muslim League and its demand for Pakistan represented  the freedom urge of the Muslims and their desire for equality  with the Hindus though in a distorted form. He never accepted  that the content of the demand for Pakistan was just though the  form was perverse.    Much the most important characteristic of Dr. Ahmad was,  however, his belief and personification of that belief that the  Communists should also be Congressmen. All through his political  life he has worn khadi and a Gandhi cap. He represented the very  important tradition which is still alike in Uttar Pradesh of  radical and revolutionary nationalism, i.e., of Congressmen who  accepted Communism in one or another form and of Communists who  accepted the Congress whatever its form. It is on the basis of  this belief that he staunchly opposed the anti-national and  so-called "Left" revolutionary line of Mr. B.T. Ranadive in  1948. He equally staunchly opposed the anti-Congress,  obsessively anti-Nehru and "casteist socialism" of Dr. Lohia.    The tragedy of Dr. Ahmad, however, began, in the mid-1950s  when for personal and factional reasons he opposed P.C. Joshi's  call for a National Front of Congress, Communists and all  progressives. From then onwards in one or another way he did his  best to deny his past and to remain a Communist leader on the  basis of accepting anti-Congressism in howsoever a sophisticated  form. So down the slippery path he went till he landed up as the  drum beater and pillion rider of Mr. V.P. Singh whom he  portrayed as the new Messiah of the secularists and the  downtrodden. He accepted what he had so valiantly fought in the  "first fine careless rapture" of the passionate idealism of his  Communist youth.    The CPI leaders and veterans who have gone or deciding to go  to the Samajwadi Party have been motivated by various impulses.  High on the list is the authoritarian behaviour of the Central  leadership of the CPI which forced its UP unit to align --  unsuccessfully in the matter of seats, as it turned out -- with  the Janata Dal of Mr. V.P. Singh. The MP [Member of Parliament]  unit had wanted to ally with the Samajwadi Party because, in  their view, it was the party most capable of defeating the BJP  and also because it was not completely anti-Congress as  demonstrated by it conduct during the no-confidence motion in  the Lok Sabha. The so-called "young" leaders being encouraged at  the Centre and in the States by the small coterie which  functions as the effective all-India leadership of the CPI also  cause concern and even a measure of revulsion among the  veterans. The most influential factor behind the decision -- of  the CPI veterans in UP is, however, their lack of courage in  breaking with anti-Congressism. They are trapped by the decades  of anti-Congress campaigning within and outside their party that  they have done. It is a Frankenstein which they cannot fight but  have to obey.    Their anti-Congressism, however, is of a somewhat subtle  variety. It is an anti-Congressism which postulates an  alternative to the Congress which is also not with the BJP and  can even ally with the Congress but which, in any case, not with  Right reactionary or counter-revolutionary formation. On no  account can they prove even to themselves that the Samajwadi  Party is more anti-imperialist, more nationalist and more  secular than the Congress. As for being more effective than the  latter in combatting the BJP this is true at the present moment  in Uttar Pradesh. Elsewhere it is the Congress which undeniably  occupier that preeminent position. Would Dr. Ahmad and his  colleagues of UP advise that counterparts in other parts of  India to join with the Congress on the basis of that logic?    In Andhra Pradesh, for example, it cannot be claimed that  the  TDP [Teluga Desam Party] is more capable of rallying the secular  forces than the Congress. Nor can the same claim be made for the  DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] in Tamil Nadu. The erstwhile CPI  veterans cannot blame their critics who change them with joining  the Samajwadi Party for the sake of seats and other perks of  power. They can answer their critics to some extent, out any  rate, if they advocated what can be called the criterion of  "anti-rightist effectiveness" as the basis of party and personal  behaviour. This would clearly imply that allying with the  Congress is a legitimate choice for communists. It would have  important positive consequences for political alignments in the  context, in particular of the elections due at the end of the  year.    There is, however, a more basic point that needs to be made.  The Samajwadi Party is not just an anti-BJP party. It is a  specific type of anti-BJP party. It bases itself in reality,  whatever be the figleaf rhetoric, on backward casteism and  Muslim communalism. This is becoming clearer with every passing  day. What else is the meaning of the caste clashes that are  taking place in Uttar Pradesh and the rift that is so clearly  developing between Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mr. Kanshi Ram?  The situation in Uttar Pradesh has developed quickly only  confirmation that one fragmenting force cannot be relied upon to  combat another. In the end both conflict with modern and  progressive nationalism which alone can be the basis of our  country and people's advance.</p>

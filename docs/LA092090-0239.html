			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMEDY: PROP STAR;  </P> <P> GALLAGHER AIMS HIS STEAMROLLER AT THE COACH HOUSE  </P> <P> Gallagher is the undisputed king of prop comedy, which -- depending on how you  look at it -- is either a compliment or the ultimate put-down.  </P> <P> Many comedy purists say props are the lazy comic's way to a cheap laugh.  Gallagher doesn't do interviews, so the only thing speaking in his defense is  success: One of the top-drawing comics around, Gallagher stars in his own TV  specials and commonly sells out big halls in multinight runs.  </P> <P> The long-haired comic's loud and loyal Orange County following has a chance to  see him in a smaller-than-usual setting as he comes to San Juan Capistrano to  play the Coach House, where he opens a five-night run Monday, Sept. 24.  </P> <P> Props aren't the only thing on the bill in his long shows (he topped 2 1/2  hours in a series of 1988 performances at Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre). He'll  delve into topical issues, try his hand at whimsical wordplay and banter with  the crowd. But it's the props that steal the show.  </P> <P> They range from raucous vaudeville stunts to devilishly inventive visual puns.  </P> <P> His Rolodex watch, complete with little file cards, is a favorite with  audiences.  </P> <P> A traditional show-closer is the Sledge-O-Matic -- a big mallet with which he  smashes melons and other messy inanimate objects (watch out if you sit in the  first few rows).  </P> <P> One of his newer additions speaks to the lengths to which he'll go to get a  laugh. It's a real live steamroller, which Gallagher uses to run over audience  volunteers. One slight modification: the roller is made of foam rubber.  </P> <P> Who  </P> <P> Gallagher.  </P> <P> When  </P> <P> Monday, Sept. 24, through Saturday, Sept. 29, at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Where  </P> <P> The Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> Whereabouts  </P> <P> Interstate 5 to the San Juan Creek Road exit. Left onto Camino Capistrano.  Coach House is in the Esplanade Center.  </P> <P> Wherewithal  </P> <P> $29.50.  </P> <P> Where to call  </P> <P> (714) 496-8930.  </P></p>

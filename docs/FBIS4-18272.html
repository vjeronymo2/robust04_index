			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["deu" report: "Witnesses: German Tanks Used Against </F> Kurds"]    [Excerpt] Bonn -- The Foreign Ministry is increasingly  confronted with accusations by Alliance 90/Greens, human rights  organizations, and church groups that it is one-sidedly  supporting the position of the government in Ankara in the  conflict between Kurds and Turkey. Representatives of such  organizations and politicians of Alliance 90/Greens called on  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany)  in Bonn on Wednesday [30 March] to exert pressure on Ankara to  come to a political solution.    After their return from Turkey, observers of the local  elections last weekend and other eyewitnesses reported again in  Bonn that, in contrast to its assurances, Ankara is using German  weapons against Kurdish civilians. A Franciscan monk said that  he observed a "massive presence" of BTR-60 armored personnel  carriers in the battle area, took photographs of the vehicles,  and passed the pictures on to the German Embassy in Ankara.  Bonn had delivered 300 of these vehicles of the National  People's Army (NVA) to the NATO partner.    Despite the many pieces of information, the Foreign Ministry  insisted that it has no proof that German weapons are used  against Kurds in violation of the previous agreement. If there  are no photographs, "we have a different situation," Foreign  Ministry spokesman Michael Gerdts said. If the accusations  prove to be true, Bonn will "react immediately." Responding to  repeated admonitions by Kinkel, the Turkish Government assured  that it will use the delivered weapons only within the framework  of the NATO treaty, that is only for defense in case of an  attack from the outside. In October 1993 a picture that showed  a Kurd being dragged behind a BTR-60 armored vehicle had caused  international excitement. However, since 10 BTR-60's in Turkey  came from Russia, it was not possible to clarify the origin of  this one vehicle without any doubt.    Tilman Zuelch, chairman of the "Society for Threatened  Peoples," also accused the Foreign Ministry of always brushing  off information that German weapons are used against Kurds. "We  no longer take the Foreign Ministry's behavior seriously,"  Zuelch told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG on Wednesday: "A dialogue is  completely pointless."    Since 1990 alone Bonn provided Ankara with armament materiel  worth more than 1 billion German marks. Among other things, 240  Leopard tanks and 13 Phantom combat planes came from western  Germany; in addition to the 300 armored personnel carriers and  60 million rounds of appropriate ammunition, materiel from the  NVA stocks includes 256,000 Kalashnikovs with 100 million rounds  of ammunition, 5,000 machine guns, as well as more than 100,000  antitank guns. The GSG-9 trained 3,000 men of the Turkish  special unit "Black Bugs." German election monitors claim that  they came into contact with this special unit in the Kurdish  area in southeastern Anatolia last week.    In a response to an inquiry by Alliance 90/Greens, the  Federal Government now admitted that it knows about the exports  by a grenade-producing facility from Germany via the Netherlands  to Turkey. Bonn approved the export of the entire facility from  Lower Saxony to the Netherlands. Now the government stated that  the application by the Dutch "included the indication that a  `temporary loan' of the facility to a Turkish company is being  considered." The Federal Government has "no official knowledge"  of the fact that German experts are now erecting the facility in  Turkey. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Hopes and realities in interest rate effects THE hope of lower interest rates helped Tokyo make a 5.4 per cent gain on the FT-Actuaries World Indices last week, while the reality of cheaper credit prompted a round of profit-taking on Wall Street, leaving the US index only 2.1 per cent higher on the week. Tokyo's recovery helped the world index rise by 1.9 per cent in local currency terms; without the Japanese contribution the index would have shown a gain of 0.8 per cent. The prospect of lower interest rates in Europe remains muted, however, following Denmark's 'No' to the Maastricht Treaty in early June. Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at BZW, believes that Germany's overshooting of its M3 target has effectively ruled out a cut in German interest rates this year. 'This effectively constrains action in other centres which need easing more,' he says. Last Sunday the Bank of Italy was obliged to raise its discount rate to defend the lira, which had fallen steeply the previous week on devaluation fears. The weak currency and bond markets deepened the depression in the stock market, which dropped 4.1 per cent last week to its lowest level since February 1988. Kleinwort Benson believes the market has over-reacted to a spate of bad news and that the underexposure of both domestic and foreign investors, as well as the low trading volume, suggest that it is worth being contrarian on a 12 to 18-month view. 'We believe that it's worth picking up some of the stock currently being oversold,' the broker says in its latest report. Mexico provided the second-best performance of the week, recovering 4.7 per cent after its recent fall. Latin American Securities says the market reacted positively to the postponement of the Banacci share offer, and to news that the US and Mexico had reached a preliminary agreement to liberalise their trade in financial services.</p>

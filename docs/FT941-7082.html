			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Training targets criticised as too low Employers yesterday warned the government that national targets for the attainment of vocational qualifications and their academic equivalents may be too low if the UK is to compete effectively in the future. The warning came from the employer-led National Advisory Council for Education and Training Targets at a conference to present its first annual report on progress towards the targets. These were established by the Confederation of British Industry with the government's backing. The council says that one of the main targets for the year 2000 is likely to be reached: for 50 per cent of young people, up to and including 21-year-olds, to have reached a level-three National Vocational Qualification or its academic equivalent of two A-levels. At present 37 per cent of young people have reached this skill level. The report suggests, however, that the UK should be aiming higher. 'International comparisons point to the need to do so,' it says. 'In Japan 80 per cent of young people reached a comparable level in 1986 and in France the target is 80 per cent by the year 2000. 'Achieving 50 per cent - even before 2000 - is unlikely to bring a significant improvement in the UK's competitiveness.' Another target that may be too low, says the council, is that which aims for 50 per cent of the workforce to be qualified to at least NVQ level three or its academic equivalent by the year 2000. Mr Peter Davis, Nacett's chairman, said yesterday that the council would be reviewing all the targets later this year after consultations. He said that additional targets might need to be established. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told the conference that winning in world markets depended on improving the skills of the workforce. Mr Heseltine is preparing a white paper on international competitiveness, to be published in May. The role of improved skills is expected to be an important theme.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway boosted crude oil production by 14% in 1992 NORWAY LAST year boosted crude oil production by 14 per cent and gas production by 5 per cent, while adding significant reserves which comfortably exceeded aggregate production, according to a report published yesterday. Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie says Norway's oil production attained a record average level of 2.21m barrels a day over the whole of last year, but surged above 2.3m b/d during the fourth quarter. Discoveries and reserve upgrades in 1992 reached 1.3bn barrels of oil equivalent, which more than replaced aggregate production of 985m barrels, the report says. Although drilling activity fell 11 per cent to 29 completed wells, ten new discoveries yielded about 27m barrels of oil equivalent per well. This represented a success rate of 34 per cent. WoodMac says Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, made the most significant discovery, of about 250m barrels of oil, but Norsk Hydro drilled more wells. Statoil found the oil in the relatively unexplored Nordland II area of the mid-Norwegian shelf. Separately, the analyst believes the most sought after acreage in Norway's 14th licensing round is found in the northern North Sea where some of the largest oil discoveries off Norway have been made. Applications for the 50 blocks and part blocks on offer have to be submitted by March 1 and allocation is expected in the third quarter. 'Despite the harsher fiscal terms which were introduced during early 1992, we expect companies to compete aggressively for the acreage made available,' WoodMac says.</p>

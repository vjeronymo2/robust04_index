			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Investors take European profits - The prospects for government bonds after last week's turmoil THE RETREAT in European bond prices triggered by last week's sell-off in the US Treasuries market appears to have been prompted more by a desire to realise profits than by a fundamental change of sentiment. There was a valid case for selling US bonds because of stronger economic data and expectations of rising short-term interest rates next year. But why should Europe suffer? Further cuts in short-term rates are still expected throughout Europe, and these are likely to pull bond yields down again. Continued economic weakness is keeping inflationary pressures at bay. And, apart from the UK, most European countries appear to be lagging the US economic cycle by several years. 'There is still value in European bonds. Friday's sell-off was quite dramatic and it may well be a chance to buy,' said Mr Jonathon Davies, a bond analyst at UBS. The main reason for selling European bonds last week seemed to be that investors and traders want to lock in the phenomenal profits they have made so far this year. According to JP Morgan's government bond index, Spanish and Italian bonds provided total returns of around 28 per cent for the first 10 months of the year. These markets suffered most severely in last week's sell off, which pushed 10-year Spanish bond yields up by about 30 basis points to 8 3/4 per cent and 10-year Italian yields up by 40 basis points to 9.56 per cent. Mr Rob Gambi, manager of international fixed interest and currencies at AMP Asset Management in London, said that he had moved funds out of the Italian bond market 'on the basis that it had hit our target for the whole year,' and because the market can become illiquid when it starts to fall. Looking ahead, however, he thinks that the Italian market is still a good buy. Even after last week's sell-off, most bond fund managers are still overweight in European bonds. 'We would certainly see it as a temporary correction (in European bond prices),' said Mr Gordon Ross, director of investments at Lombard Odier Investment Management, the Swiss bank's London-based fund management arm. Some markets, like Germany, ended the week only fractionally lower, as investors switched into bunds in search of a safe haven. Moreover, the decline in bond prices was frequently led by sales of futures contracts, according to traders. Nervous fund managers who sold futures contracts to protect themselves against further price falls did not necessarily sell bonds. 'There have been a lot of hedging trades, so a lot of downward pressure has come through the futures market,' said Mr Davies. Price declines have also been concentrated in the longer maturities. Because the most actively-traded bonds in most markets have maturities of 10 years or longer, these bonds tend to be the focus of attention. However, the short end of the market fared much better. For example, the yield on five-year gilts was unchanged at around 6.15 per cent at the end of last week, while 10-year gilt yields backed up from 6.84 to 6.93 per cent. This steepening of the yield curve was evident in most markets. Many investors believe that in the last leg of the European bond market rally, the short end of the market will benefit from any further rate cuts more than the long end of the market, causing yield curves to steepen. Shorter-dated bonds are seen also seen as more defensive in volatile market conditions. 'We are approaching the end of the calendar year and there is a general tendency to reduce risk,' said one fund manager. 'We are still very long Europe, but we are looking at shortening duration in Denmark and France.' However, it is not all plain-sailing. Further selling of US Treasuries would continue to drag down European bond prices. Low rates in the US have prompted a huge inflow of funds from US money market and bond funds this year. Any reversal of that flow is undoubtedly bad news for Europe's bond markets.</p>

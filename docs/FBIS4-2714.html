			<p>BFN     [Text] Over the past two months since the new taxation  system was introduced, Hainan's tax revenue has seen a steady  increase. By the end of February, the province had collected  486 million yuan in industrial and commercial taxes,  representing an increase of 77.5 percent over the same period of  the previous year, and completed 16.4 percent of the tasks  assigned by the state, of which the central tax amounted to 119  million yuan and the local tax stood at 366 million yuan.    Since the beginning of this year, in accordance with the  requirements of the new taxation system and in light of the  realities of the Hainan special zone's market economic structure  and economic development, tax authorities at all levels in the  province have done a good job of investigating tax funds and  have delegated tax collection plans at all levels down to the  tax collecting units. At the same time, they have persisted in  managing taxation in accordance to the law and have strengthened  tax collection and management, thus enabling the province to  maintain a relatively good momentum of tax revenue growth. In  terms of taxes, business tax, state-owned enterprises' income  tax, and additional revenue from education fees saw  comparatively large increases.</p>

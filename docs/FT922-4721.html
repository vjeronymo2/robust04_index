			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's Those Names persuaded to sweat it out rather than resign their Lloyd's membership may be having second thoughts. Yesterday not only brought news that Chatset, an independent analyst, had raised its forecast of the market's losses for the 1989 underwriting account from Pounds 1.4bn to more than Pounds 2bn. In a perhaps more alarming development the quoted managing agency group Sturge Holdings said 1990 would be up only modestly on the previous year. Sturge's results for the 12 months to September will reflect its 1989 income. But it was the group's gloomy comments on the outlook for subsequent years - and the consequent halving of a dividend investors previously hoped it could maintain - which caused yesterday's 35 per cent fall in the shares. The problem is not just lower commission as underwriting losses continue into 1990. Sturge will be hit in 1993 and 1994 by a reduction in the fixed charges it levies on Names and by new deficit charges designed better to reflect the impact of bad years in the agency's overall rewards. In the long run these changes are meant to give Names a fairer deal. The question is how many will be around to benefit.</p>

Mr Zhu, executive vice premier and head of the  central bank, has recently accepted a suggestion from his  advisers not to leave the hot seat until most of the basic laws  and regulations defining a legal structure for the country's  banking and financial system have been passed.    Chinese economic sources said yesterday Mr Zhu wanted a more  independent Central Bank immune from government intervention.  But he acknowledged that his dual role as vice-premier and  central bank governor contradicted the principle. But he  believed no one can yet take over his role and steer his radical  reforms to restructure China's centralised banking system into a  market-driven one under the current political situation.    A senior aid to Mr Zhu defended the leader's dual role by  pointing out that, under Mr Zhu's leadership, the central bank  had been released from its former role as financier of the  government deficit. "It is during his governorship that the  central authorities made the decision that the central bank  would be no longer responsible for covering deficit or  overdrawal of state coffers," deputy governor of the People's  Bank of China Zhou Zhengging told reporters at a news conference  at the on-going National People's Congress.    Mr Zhou also defended the vice-premier's austerity program.  He said the reforms "effectively boosted a rapid and healthy  development of the national economy and controlled the total  quantity of the monetary supply."</p>

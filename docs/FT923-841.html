			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Danieli slightly ahead at L45bn DANIELI, the Italian heavy engineering group which specialises in mini-mills for the steel industry, raised net group profits to L45bn (Dollars 36m) in the year to June 30, from L44bn in 1990-1991. In spite of the slight profits rise, the company said difficult market conditions required a reduction in the dividend to L180 for ordinary shares and L200 for savings stock from L220 and L240 respectively. The company explained that the move was necessary to build up resources. Turnover, affected by the worldwide crisis in the steel industry, fell by 1.7 per cent to L759bn from L772bn in 1990-1991. The latest reduction in sales and earnings continues a difficult period for the group, which has seen earnings slide for the second year running after reaching L61.5bn in 1989-1990. Danieli gave no indications about the current state of its business, beyond saying that new orders were in line with expectations. In January, it won a L780bn deal from Iran to modernise the country's biggest steel plant.</p>

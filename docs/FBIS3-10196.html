Colombian oil sales  to Cuba will start in July. We will sell them between 15,000 to  20,000 barrels a day; something like a third of what the  island's consumes.    [Mines and Energy Minister Guido Nule Amin] "What we are  trying to do is establish commercial relations [with Cuba]  similar to the ones we have established with other countries in  the world."    [Gutierrez] People here, however, see several stains on the  business, not caused by the black gold per se. Cuba does not  have a sound payment capability and experienced oil people do  not like the agreement very much.    [Former Mining Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo] "Colombia  should not subsidize [Cuba] by selling oil cheaper than what can  be obtained elsewhere. Second, the sale has to be carried out  under strict banking and commercial conditions."    [Gutierrez] The Cubans have presented the possibility of  refining our oil in their country as part of their payment.    [Former Mining Minister Guillermo Perry] "It depends on the  efficiency of their refineries, how much they will pay for the  crude oil, and the price we will get for products other than the  gasoline we need."    [Gutierrez] For others who know this business, the oil  refinery should be done here.    [Perry] "What Colombia needs is to have an export  petrochemical refinery, and it should be established in the  Morrosquillo gulf where the two oil pipelines merge."    [Gutierrez] In addition to the economic issues, the  political  ones also cast doubts on this business. Colombia is seen as  giving oxygen to the Castro dictatorship and this jeopardizes  its commercial relations with the United States.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / EOC rebuffed in part-timers case: Appeal court curtails legal role of commission THE EQUAL Opportunities Commission has no right to bring judicial review proceedings against the government, the Court of Appeal ruled yesterday. Mr Alan Lakin, legal adviser to the commission, said: 'This severely undermines our position.' The court said the commission - which has a statutory duty to enforce the law and to promote equal opportunities - should concentrate on assisting individual women to take cases through the industrial tribunal system, and play an 'advisory' role to government. The statement is a blow to the commission's strategy of mounting legal challenges on issues which it believes affect large numbers of women. The Appeal Court's statement came in a ruling, by a 2-1 majority, upholding a High Court decision to reject a challenge by the commission to the government over the rights of part-time workers - 90 per cent of whom are women. The EOC argued that the government was failing to comply with European Community obligations to protect part-timers from less favourable treatment than full-timers, particularly in relation to redundancy and unfair dismissal. Lord Justice Kennedy and Lord Justice Hirst agreed the challenge had not been properly brought. Lord Justice Dillon disagreed, saying he would have granted a declaration that the UK was in breach of Treaty of Rome obligations and European law by providing less favourable treatment of part-time employees working between eight and 16 hours a week. The judges unanimously rejected the commission's claim that the criteria for the calculation of redundancy pay discriminated against part-timers. The commission was refused permission to renew its challenge in the House of Lords. It is considering whether to appeal to the Lords directly. The ruling means that, under national law, an employee working fewer than eight hours a week remains ineligible for redundancy pay or unfair dismissal compensation. A full-time employee working 16 or more hours a week qualifies for redundancy pay and compensation for unfair dismissal after two years of continuous employment, while someone working between eight and 16 hours takes five years to qualify. Part-timers who have previously worked full-time are not given any credit for periods of full-time work when their payments are calculated. The commission failed to persuade the appeal court to intervene on the grounds that all of this was contrary to Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, which lays down equal treatment for men and women at work, and the EC's directives on equal pay and equal treatment. The commission said the majority decision that the organisation had no legal right to seek judicial review in this type of case was 'disturbing'. Mr Lakin said: 'The commission believes its duty is to act on behalf of this group of women by preventing them from having to go through lengthy, expensive and stressful proceedings.' The commission believes judicial review is the most efficient use of its small legal budget of about Pounds 600,000 a year. Last year it used judicial review proceedings to establish that women serving in the armed forces may not be sacked for becoming pregnant. The Department of Employment said: 'We have always argued that these regulations are necessary to preserve job opportunities for women and to minimise the burden on business.'</p>

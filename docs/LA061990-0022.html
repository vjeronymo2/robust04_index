			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG CZAR ASSAILS STATE'S NARCOTICS LAWS AS TOO WEAK  </P> <P> Federal drug czar William J. Bennett lectured California legislators Monday,  criticizing their anti-drug legislation as too weak and deserving of no better  than a C-minus on the narcotics-fighting grade scale.  </P> <P> "When is the Legislature going to act for the people and govern in a sensible  way?" Bennett asked at a Capitol press conference during a one-day visit to  Sacramento. "The Legislature has failed its responsibility for passing tough  laws. Republicans and some Democrats want to get tough laws through, but  they've been blocked."  </P> <P> Earlier, in a speech to the Senate, the director of the federal Office of Drug  Control Policy said that the most important thing the state can do is to  increase the penalties for drug offenders.  </P> <P> "State sentences for drug crimes are much more lenient than federal sentences,"  Bennett said. "California has not met its responsibility to enact tough  sentencing laws. Thirty-five states have tougher sentencing laws -- and no  state has more reason for a tough law than California."  </P> <P> Bennett said California ought to get tougher on users as well as traffickers.  He said the state should revoke the professional and driver's licenses of  convicted drug users and encourage private companies contracting with the state  to begin drug-testing their employees.  </P> <P> He suggested also that the Legislature recriminalize the possession of small  amounts of marijuana. "The law is far too lenient. Most people get started on  hard drugs through marijuana," he said.  </P> <P> Democrats reacted with skepticism. "There have been a number of laws already  passed to increase the penalties on drug traffickers," said Sen. Bill Lockyer  (D-Hayward), chairman of the Judiciary Committee. "But I'm not willing to  assume that whatever the federal law is we should adopt it.  </P> <P> "I would estimate that Bennett's recommendations would cost about $5 billion,"  Lockyer said. "I want to ask which tax he wants to raise to pay for that."  </P> <P> Reporters also asked Bennett how the state could afford to implement his  program at a time when California prisons are filled to 175% of capacity and  the state faces a $3.6-billion budget deficit.  </P> <P> He replied that the federal government, which has more than doubled its  spending on anti-drug programs in California, would help pay for the increased  law enforcement costs. He also suggested that the state could pay for some of  the programs by stepping up efforts to seize the assets of convicted drug  dealers. But he added that the Legislature would have to "readjust your  spending" to construct more prisons.  </P> <P> During his speech, Bennett praised some California anti-drug programs, such as  a recent law that regulates the sale of chemicals that could be used to  manufacture drugs. He also singled out for praise Los Angeles' DARE program,  which sends police officers into schools to warn students about the dangers of  drug use.  </P> <P> But Bennett said California was not doing enough to combat drugs. He blamed  this failure on "the obvious resistance from a number of legislators" and such  liberal lobbying groups as the American Civil Liberties Union.  </P></p>

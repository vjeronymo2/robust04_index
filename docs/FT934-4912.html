			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Poll ban held off The Russian election commission last night postponed a decision on a call from Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a first deputy premier, to ban the Communist party and the Democratic party from further participation in the election campaign because of their criticism of the draft constitution. The draft, which will be voted on in a referendum to be held on the same day as the elections - December 12 - has become increasingly controversial since President Boris Yeltsin threatened to deprive parties of the right to appear on TV if they criticised it.</p>

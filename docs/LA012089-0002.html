			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INAUGURATION EVE: BUSH LAUDS FRIEND, MENTOR  </P> <P> With the eight years of the Ronald Reagan presidency at an end, George Bush, in  a solemn and celebratory rite as old as the Republic, becomes the 41st  President of the United States today.  </P> <P> The President-elect spent 15 minutes Thursday with Reagan in the Oval Office,  bidding a private farewell to the man, he said, "whose shoes are going to be  pretty darn hard to fill."  </P> <P> "I wouldn't be President if it wasn't for my teacher and my friend," said Bush  of the 77-year-old Reagan, when the two spoke to senior staff members after  their meeting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bush Evinces Optimism  </P> <P> As streets near the U.S. Capitol and the White House were blocked off and  elaborate plans were completed for the transfer of power at the stroke of noon  today, Bush evinced the optimism that so marked Reagan's tenure.  </P> <P> It was a day of sunny skies and brimming anticipation for the close of one era  and the beginning of another. It was a day on which Reagan and Bush took care  to keep the focus on the new team and on what lay ahead.  </P> <P> "I really feel this: Our best days are yet to come," Bush told a group of  youthful supporters.  </P> <P> Throughout the week of inaugural revelry, in full swing well before the  swearing-in ceremony itself, Bush has mixed celebration with symbolism. He met  with an array of visiting delegations including blacks, schoolchildren and the  handicapped, and he keynoted banquets, music shows and testimonials.  </P> <P> He has also dispensed some substance. In an interview with news agency  reporters Thursday, he defended his decision to delay the resumption of  U.S.-Soviet arms-control talks scheduled next month and indicated that he is  not ready to commit the United States to a summit conference with Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1989.  </P> <P> "I think the Soviets understand that my intention is not to drag my feet but to  simply do a prudent reassessment," Bush said.  </P> <P> Bush said that his inaugural address today on the western steps of the Capitol  will be "broad and thematic." It will be, he said, "a broad appeal to the  American people to pitch in and help. It will be an expression of satisfaction  about how far we've come as a nation, and a recognition that we've got a long  way to go."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tends to Paper Work  </P> <P> On his last day as vice president, Bush, 64, kept mostly to himself. In between  a morning gathering with young supporters and a night-time appearance at an  entertainment gala, Bush spent much of his time in his office tending to paper  work, officials said.  </P> <P> He left the White House complex at 4:20 p.m., waving to workers at the windows  of the Old Executive Office Building next door, and went to the stately  Jefferson Hotel to visit his 87-year-old mother, Dorothy Walker Bush.  </P> <P> At the prime-time extravaganza later Thursday at the Washington Convention  Center, Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle sang the "Star Spangled  Banner" and clapped along with country music performers. The event, featuring  some of the biggest names in show business, was televised by CBS.  </P> <P> As the show closed, Bush took the stage and said to the crowd and the  television audience: "I expect that every one of the other 40 presidents  pledged in his mind and soul to represent all the people. Well, this 41st  President-to-be feels exactly the same way."  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Attend Church Service  </P> <P> Bush plans a quiet morning before he takes the oath of office. He intends to  attend a church service and spend a few hours with the 21 family members  gathered in Washington for the inauguration.  </P> <P> The President-elect, First Lady-to-be Barbara Bush, their daughter and four  sons and spouses, and the Bushes' 10 grandchildren all moved on Wednesday into  Blair House, the government guest house across Pennsylvania Avenue from the  White House.  </P> <P> This afternoon, they will all move into the White House for a weekend of  celebration, before the Bush children and grandchildren set out for their homes  spread from Maine to Colorado and Texas.  </P> <P> Offering a peek at life inside the stately townhouse, Bush spokesman Alixe Glen  said that a temporary playroom was strewn with coloring books, computer games  and popcorn, and a courtyard had been turned into a parking lot for big-wheeled  tricycles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Timed to the Second  </P> <P> At the Capitol, the schedule for the inauguration has been timed to the second.  Because the 35-word presidential oath that Supreme Court Chief Justice William  H. Rehnquist will administer takes about 45 seconds to recite, the actual  swearing-in is set to begin at 11:59:15 a.m. If the timing works to precision,  the oath will be completed precisely at noon, the moment at which Reagan's term  ends.  </P> <P> Bush and his wife plan to arrive at the White House shortly before 10:30 a.m.  to have coffee in the Blue Room with President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, and  with Quayle and his wife, Marilyn. From there, Reagan and Bush are to ride  together to Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> Reagan, who will be a spectator at the swearing-in of his successor, is  scheduled to leave the Capitol 45 minutes later by helicopter, head for Andrews  Air Force Base and depart for Los Angeles International Airport and his new  home in Bel-Air.  </P> <P> The Reagans, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, have deliberately  kept a lower profile as inaugural events began unfolding during the week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defer to New President  </P> <P> "The Reagans have felt that this is George Bush's inauguration and these events  are his inaugural events," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> During the interview with news service reporters, Bush sought to stem  speculation that he is planning to start his presidency with a bang by  unveiling a package of new programs in the first 100 days.  </P> <P> "That doesn't really apply" when a sitting vice president in sync with the  outgoing Administration takes over the presidency, he said. The last time such  a succession occurred was in 1836, when Martin Van Buren followed Andrew  Jackson.  </P> <P> Indeed, Bush offered little hint of imminent significant changes, saying that  he supports the Reagan Administration's recent decision to open talks with the  Palestine Liberation Organization and that he does not plan to begin immediate  negotiations on the budget with Congress, which currently has Reagan's budget  proposal. On the budget, he said he would not dispatch his negotiators until  after he meets Tuesday with congressional leaders.  </P> <P> While Bush kept mostly out of the public eye on Thursday, Mrs. Bush was the  center of attention at a special tribute at the Kennedy Center. An adjacent  plaza on the banks of the Potomac River became a mob scene of mink coats and  limousines as some 225 members of Bush's extended family joined thousands of  invited guests in saluting the incoming First Lady.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush responded with her characteristic humor and nonchalance after she was  feted in three separate theaters by the Houston and National Symphony  Orchestras, the Mora Arriagas Mariachi Band, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band  and the Gatlin Brothers, Bush's favorite country music group.  </P> <P> "If we did this (in) one more theater, I think I'd roll over and die," she  said.  </P> <P> "I want you to look at me," said Mrs. Bush, whose matronly appearance is often  contrasted with Nancy Reagan's attention to high fashion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Then . . . It's Over'  </P> <P> With that, she stepped back from the microphone and pulled open the jacket of  her royal blue suit. "Hair done, makeup, designer clothes," she pointed out. "  . . . all this week. Then . . . it's over."  </P> <P> There was also a final jibe at her husband, who had complained Wednesday about  her constant nagging over details of their move into the White House.  </P> <P> "Once you're President-elect, every single American knows where you are every  single day. Do any of you remember where George Bush was last week? He was  fishing."  </P> <P> Staff writer David Lauter contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INAUGURAL EVENTS AND BROADCAST COVERAGE TODAY  </P> <P> 8 a.m. (PST) -- Departure for Capitol  </P> <P> President and Mrs. Reagan and President-elect and Mrs. Bush drive from White  House to Capitol.  </P> <P> 9 a.m. -- Swearing-in Ceremony  </P> <P> The Capitol, west steps, followed by President Bush's inaugural address.  </P> <P> 10 a.m. -- Congressional Leadership luncheon for President and Mrs. Bush  </P> <P> Statuary Hall, the Capitol.  </P> <P> 11:15 a.m. -- Inaugural Parade  </P> <P> Pennsylvania Ave., Capitol to White House.  </P> <P> COVERAGE  </P> <P> Live television coverage will begin at 7 a.m. on NBC Channel 4, CBS Channel 2,  ABC Channel 7 and Cable News Network.

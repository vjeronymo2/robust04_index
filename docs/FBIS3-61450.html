			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. A. Kist; UDC 541.15, 546.06.02, 621.039.86] </F>   [Abstract] The radiocarbon method for dating archeological  specimens of biological origin is based on measurement of the  carbon-14 activity under the assumption that this nuclide  stopped entering the organism during the time of its demise.  Many other assumptions are also made. In the present work the  possibility of a change in isotope composition in cotton and  flax fabrics as a result of heterogeneous isotope exchange  between the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere and that in the  fabric. Labeled carbon dioxide is shown to be fixated strongly  in the fabrics. It was concluded that changes in carbon isotope  composition in archeological specimens are possible and that  this factor must not be overlooked. References 2: 1 Russian, 1  Western.</p>

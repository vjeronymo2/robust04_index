			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Unitised policies questioned ACTUARIES HAVE expressed concern about the adequacy of reserves guaranteeing the returns on certain life companies' unitised 'with-profits' policies. A working party set up in 1991 by the actuarial professional bodies in England and Scotland has confirmed that life assurance companies have been rapidly switching 'with- profits' business to the unitised form first introduced in the mid-1980s. The working party's survey of 29 'mainstream' with-profits offices found unitised with-profits reserves at the end of 1991 totalling Pounds 17.4bn - 21 per cent of all with-profits reserves. The actuaries welcome the retention by the life offices of the right to impose a 'market value adjuster' - a unit price reduction - in unusually adverse investment conditions. But adjusters can prove controversial for investors, who have little guidance on when they will be applied or how large they might be. Half the offices have imposed adjusters at some time on surrender of policies, but not necessarily across the board; most appear to regard them as a last resort. Half the companies have restrictions on their application, and most offer guaranteed minimum annual returns. The working party says some of these guarantees now look 'rather onerous'.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Chileans start US trade talks Preliminary talks about the possibility of Chile's accession to the North American Free Trade Agreement, or of a bilateral trade accord with the US, are due to start in Washington today. Discussions between the five-member Chilean mission and the US trade representative's team will focus on investment protection issues. Although Chile has signed investment protection agreements with several countries, a US official doubted whether these met the stringent criteria demanded by Washington. Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chile's finance minister, stressed that today's talks were strictly technical and that formal negotiations could not begin until the US Congress had passed enabling, fast-track legislation. Once that had been done, Mr Aninat expects negotiations will proceed much more rapidly than they did with Mexico. 'We can learn from the Mexican negotiations,' he said. The US administration hopes to add fast-track to ratification of the Gatt Uruguay Round, now before Congress, but controversy over approval of the round could overshadow discussion of Chile. The Clinton administration, which has repeatedly stressed its commitment to sign an accord with Chile, has not yet decided whether this should take the form of a bilateral agreement or full access to Nafta. Canada, now the second most active foreign investor in Chile after the US, has pushed for Chile's integration to Nafta. Mexico, which already has a free trade agreement with Chile, in principle favours extending Nafta to other Latin American states. The AFL-CIO, the US labour organisation, has come out in favour of a bilateral accord on the grounds that protection of labour rights contained in Nafta is not sufficiently rigorous. Mr Richard Gephardt, Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, has proposed that labour clauses be written into the text of any agreement with Chile rather than negotiated as side issues.</p>

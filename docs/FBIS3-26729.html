This is the gist of the speech made by Chen  Huanyou, provincial party committee secretary and governor, at  the provincial summing-up and commendation meeting on  antipoverty work. On 29 January, the provincial party committee  and government held this meeting to give a warm welcome to the  honorable return of the provincial party committee's second  antipoverty work team, sum up the province's antipoverty work in  recent years, and commend 198 advanced workers and 75 advanced  units in antipoverty work. Cao Hongming, deputy secretary of  the provincial party committee, chaired the meeting.    Cao Keming, Xu Zhonglin, Gao Dezheng, Jiang Yongrong, Zhang  Huaixi, Duan Xushen, and other provincial leaders attended the  meeting. The Yancheng City party Committee and Government, the  provincial planning and economic commission, the provincial  antipoverty work team stationed in Shuyang, and other units as  well as representatives of antipoverty team members gave reports  on their experience in this regard.    Chen Huanyou delivered an important speech on antipoverty  work. He said: Antipoverty work is a very important and  significant issue. Helping people in economically weak areas to  break away from poverty and become prosperous as soon as  possible has been an important issue to which the provincial  party committee and government have paid a good deal of  attention. According to the strategy of "stressing reform and  opening up of more economically developed areas, mainly along  the Chang Jiang, and accelerating economic development on the  one hand; stressing the reform in economically weak areas with  localities north of Huai He as the center and stepping up the  pace of breaking away from poverty and becoming prosperous on  the other hand," the provincial party committee and government  have further supported economically weak areas in developing the  economy in the aspects of personnel, capital, and materials  during the past couple of years. The provincial authorities  concentrated efforts to strengthen infrastructure construction  in northern Jiangsu and as organized the linkup of units  directly under the provincial authorities with poor townships  and towns by dispatching work groups to help develop the economy  and by promoting an exchange of cadres between northern and  southern Jiangsu to carry out cooperative activities. Through  the joint efforts of all sectors around the province,  particularly the hard work of cadres and people in economically  weak areas, gratifying achievements have been made in  antipoverty work. In view of the conditions in areas north of  Huai He, a road of development for braking away from poverty and  becoming prosperous as soon as possible has been found and  preliminary achievements have been scored in the course of  practice. The agricultural production rose steadily, structural  readjustment was remarkably accelerated, and the development of  a diversified economy has become the main source of the increase  in peasants' income. New vitality was added to industrial  production and some townships and towns formerly weak in  industry are starting their own backbone projects.  Infrastructure construction continued to be stressed; the  construction of markets saw a good beginning and more and more  peasants are participating in the circulation services.  Individual and private economies became active by the day;  labor export grew rapidly; peasants had higher income and  collective accumulation increased. Another 400,000 people in  Jiangsu shook off poverty in 1993. The per capita income of  most of the 58 poor townships and towns, which were emphatically  supported by the provincial authorities, has exceeded 600 yuan;  of which, the per capita income of 30 townships and towns in  Shuyang County exceeded 700 yuan, the village revenue increased  by 20.3 percent over the previous year, and the income of  village-level collective economies reached 20,000 yuan on  average. If economically weak areas develop along such a  course, they will surely bring about an even greater change by  the end of this century.    Chen Huanyou stressed in his speech that we should further  implement various antipoverty measures and strive to beef up the  capability of economically weak areas in self-development with a  strong sense of urgency and a high sense of political  responsibility, so as to step up the pace of breaking away from  poverty, becoming prosperous, and moving toward a relatively  comfortable life. On this year's antipoverty work, Chen Huanyou  noted that the provincial authorities should stress the  following issues: 1) Supporting the work with policies -- it is  necessary to continue to implement and improve the policies of  supporting the economic development in poor areas and to provide  the support in the aspects of personnel, capital, and materials.  We should do our best to add more key projects in northern  Jiangsu. 2) Organization and coordination -- in line with the  principle of taking measures suitable to local conditions,  rational division of labor, supplementing each other's  advantages, and joint development and having consolidated the  linkup of the north and south, we should further expand economic  alliance and cooperation between economically developed cities  and counties and their less developed counterparts through  various forms and levels. The provincial authorities should  take measures to help launch projects with participation of both  the north and south. 3) Intensifying infrastructure  construction, particularly the construction of power supplies  and transport networks, with a view to making an end of  no-electricity villages and basically establishing highway  networks among cities, counties, and townships within three  years or so.    Chen Huanyou announced at the meeting: The provincial party  committee has decided to keep dispatching antipoverty work teams  to poor areas this year, appropriately readjust and expand  supporting areas, and make greater efforts in antipoverty work.  Some units originally stationed in Shuyang this year will be  transferred to Guanyu and Suining. He hoped that units  concerned would take the overall conditions into consideration,  happily accept the mission assigned to them by the provincial  party committee, overcome difficulties through all possible  means, and do a good job in their work. In addition to doing  their best to give personnel, capital, and material support,  leading comrades of various rear units should go deep into  townships and towns involved to give more concrete guidelines  and solve actual problems there. He called on antipoverty work  teams to conduct their work with creativity. The major tasks of  the teams are assisting localities in reform, opening up,  developing the economy, handling well the relations between  reform and development and stability, and promoting a  comprehensive social progress. All work teams should go deep  into the realities of life, intensify investigations and  studies, forge close ties and unite with local cadres and  people, and do more actual and helpful work for the localities  wholeheartedly. He demanded that party committees and  governments of localities, where the work teams are stationed,  actively strengthen their ties with work teams, keep in touch,  respect, and support each other at work and unite together to  advance forward.    Chen Huanyou also demanded that all cities and counties link  up with economically weak townships and villages level by level  and help them promote coordinated regional economic development.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Gloomy profits forecast by leading Japanese brokers JAPAN'S 14 leading securities houses do not expect to make a profit for the first half of 1992-93, prompting Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, to urge the industry to reform itself in order to regain investor confidence. Nomura Securities, the largest of Japan's Big Four houses, revised its pre-tax profit estimate down from Y20bn (Dollars 160m) to zero for the six months ending September, and said it expected an after-tax loss of Y7bn, its first since 1954. Weak stock prices and low turnover also bruised the country's 10 second-tier brokerages, all of which are cutting staff. Two other members of the Big Four, Daiwa Securities and Nikko Securities, forecast no pre-tax profits, while Nikko expects an after-tax loss of Y500m, compared with a profit of Y1.2bn last year. Yamaichi Securities expects a pre-tax loss of Y18bn and a net loss of Y17bn, its second successive year of losses. Yesterday's downward revisions came in spite of confidence in April that the worst of the turmoil in the Tokyo market was over. Brokers had forecast a daily average trading value of Y350bn to Y400bn, but the figure until August was around Y240bn. The industry now expects stock brokerage commissions for the first half to be about 35 per cent lower than a year earlier. Since emergency support measures were announced last month the market has gained strength and brokers hope this a sign that earnings will improve in the second half. For the full year, Nomura forecasts a pre-tax profit of Y20bn, down from a previous estimate of Y60bn; Daiwa Y12bn (Y50bn); Nikko Y15bn (Y47bn); and Yamaichi Y1bn (Y30bn). The brokers plan to take advantage of the emergency measure that relaxed regulations forcing them to disclose potentially embarrassing appraisal losses on their securities portfolios. All the houses said they would not announce these figures. Mr Hata, who introduced the emergency package, said the brokers must regain the trust of individual investors by making the market more 'transparent and fair'. He said the industry must prevent a repeat of the scandals that undermined investor confidence, and continue their streamlining programmes. While the Big Four continue to struggle, most of the 10 leading second-tier brokers face an even more difficult trading environment and are likely to announce further staff cuts and branch closures before the year is out. All 10 houses have forecast first-half losses, and only Kokusai Securities, which has had particular success in bonds and derivatives, expects a full year profit, a modest Y2.5bn before tax and Y2bn after-tax. The largest pre-tax losses for the first half are expected at New Japan Securities, Y19.2bn; Kankaku Securities, Y18bn; and Sanyo Securities, Y16.4bn. Yamatane Securities, now arguing with its banks over the funding of its restructuring, forecast a pre-tax loss of Y5.1bn, compared with a loss of Y2.3bn last year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------                       THE BIG FOUR BROKERS  ---------------------------------------------------------------             First-half forecast to end-September 1992                against the same period 1991 in Ybn  ---------------------------------------------------------------                Operating         Pre-tax         After tax                 Revenue        profit(loss)     profit/loss              1992     1991   1992       1991   1992       1991  --------------------------------------------------------------- Nomura        175    246.1      0       39.7    (-7)    (18.1) Daiwa         130    193.6      0       20.6      0     (10.8) Nikko         120    165.3      0       12.1   (-0.5)    (1.2) Yamaichi       98    138.6   (-18)      (5.4)   (-17)    (3.8)  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: company figures  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

The CAR expresses its profound gratitude to  all those who worked toward the success of these elections in  many ways, particularly the CEN, the International Monitoring  Committee, friendly countries, the French and Burkinabe military  observers, the international civilian observers, the security  forces, the prefects, and the mayors. The CAR also wishes to  thank the electorate who turned out in their numbers during both  the first and second rounds of the poll.    Finally, the CAR thanks its activists, particularly its  representatives at polling stations, for the quality work done.  The CAR considers the victory achieved by the opposition as the  victory of the entire Togolese people, who have in this manner  expressed their desire for change, for the birth of a new Togo  in which all Togolese, civilian or in the army, feel a sense of  brotherhood irrespective of their political persuasion or tribe,  so that the social and political conditions conducive to  reviving our country's socioeconomic development may be created.  To this end, it is important that the men and women who will  direct the nation's affairs following these elections are chosen  in accordance with the will manifested by the people.</p>

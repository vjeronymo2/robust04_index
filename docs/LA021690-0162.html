Flaherty.  </P> <P> Prosecutors had sought to make Berry, 40, the first pet owner in the nation to  be convicted of murder because of the actions of his dog. But a jury convicted  him Dec. 22 on the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter and found him  guilty of two other felonies -- owning a mischievous animal resulting in death  and cultivating marijuana.  </P> <P> Berry's 53-pound dog, Willy, chained in front of a marijuana patch the  defendant was growing in suburban Morgan Hill, killed 2-year-old James Soto on  June 13, 1987.  </P></p>

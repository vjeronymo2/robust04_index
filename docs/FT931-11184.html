			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Another US group deserts France THE controversy over loss of foreign investment in France deepened yesterday when two US companies - the paper group Kimberly-Clark, and a subsidiary of S C Johnson, the maker of cleaning products - both confirmed reductions in their operations. Eurofab, an S C Johnson offshoot which makes Johnson's Wax near Tours, is to close with the loss of 193 jobs by June, to concentrate production at larger and cheaper sites at Mijdrecht in the Netherlands and Frimley in Britain. This was part of a European restructuring plan announced by S C Johnson last September, in which plants in Spain and Portugal will also close with the loss of 400 jobs out of a European workforce of 3,250. The group wanted 'to concentrate production on high volumes and leading edge technologies, allowing the optimisation of quality and the creation of integrated supply chains. The level of investments needed is such that not all European production sites could benefit,' it said. Kimberly-Clark, meanwhile, is to cut 312 jobs at a plant near Rouen, one of its two French plants. About 150 workers will remain at the plant, which makes paper handkerchiefs, kitchen towels, hygiene products and industrial rags. The US group is investing FFr80m (Pounds 9.86m) to update the plant, and concentrate its European production of Kleenex there. No jobs are being transferred abroad.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever The acquisition of a French ice-cream business for FFr1.9bn has all the hallmarks of a model Unilever deal. The Anglo-Dutch group has been stalking the privately-controlled Ortiz-Miko for years, waiting for the opportunity to prise it free. The addition of the business will hardly transform Unilever's prospects but it will usefully strengthen its presence in the weakest of its main European markets, enabling it to leapfrog Nestle' in the process. Unilever can easily afford the diversion of cash flow. The price seems fair for such a strategic nugget. The acquisition will also serve a broader aim, helping Unilever centralise its European ice-cream production while strengthening its local distribution network. Unilever is now clearly intent on concentrating its resources on product areas of greatest strength. The acquisition of Kraft's ice-cream business in the US in September betrayed similar purpose. The intriguing aspect to the Ortiz-Miko deal is BSN's presumed involvement as an asset broker. The French group will now walk away with a desirable prepared meals business. Such asset swaps are likely to become an increasingly common feature of the European food industry as companies seek to dominate discrete market segments. That, though, will doubtless excite the interest of the Brussels competition authorities. Given Unilever's existing grip on the European ice-cream market, it would be perfectly justified to take a closer look.</p>

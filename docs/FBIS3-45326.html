But they believe banking authorities will permit conversion  once the dust has settled on the yuan exchange-rate reforms.    From January 1, all foreign companies were required to open  yuan accounts with their banks for payments received in local  currency. But remittances in hard currencies from yuan accounts  will have to wait until the banking authorities have worked out  the regulations.    This follows the decision to unify the two-tier currency  system by adopting a single managed-float exchange rate of about  8.7 yuan to the U.S. dollar, close to what was previously  available in swap centres. Previously, the other rate used was  the official rate of 5.8 yuan to the dollar.    Several foreign airlines have reported that conversion into  foreign currencies from these accounts has been frozen, whereas  they do not encounter any problems with foreign exchange  certificates (FECs), which are still freely converted into U.S.  dollars at the old official rate of 5.8. British Airlines  manager Charles Phelps-Penry said, "We are still able to remit  FECs at the old rate of 5.8 to the dollar. But at the moment,  they are not allowing yuan remittances because the Chinese  authorities are still working out the regulations. We have been  given to believe that this is a temporary situation, pending  publication of final regulations."    Because FECs are being withdrawn gradually from circulation,  they are converted immediately into U.S. dollars when companies  deposit them into their bank accounts. FECs can also be  switched into yuan, but they are first converted into U.S.  dollars at the old exchange rate of 5.8 and then re-converted  into yuan at the new rate of about 8.7.    Hans Hauri, China World Hotel's general manager, said that  yuan payments through credit cards by his hotel guests could be  converted directly into U.S. dollars. Conversion for cash  payments in yuan was also allowed but was slightly more  complicated. The chief representative of another airline said,  "They are allowing deposits from credit-card sales in yuan to be  remitted although it is a different matter for yuan cash  deposits." He added that as long as the freeze was temporary,  it would not pose a problem as the airline could use the bulk of  the yuan earnings to finance its local expenses.    Hong Kong Bank's Beijing chief representative, Gordon Lam,  said he expected the freeze in yuan remittances to be only  temporally and that the Bank of China would clarify the  situation once it had come to terms with the changes.    Many foreign investors who have been in China for the last  three to five years hope that this problem can be resolved soon,  as their operations are at a stage where they are beginning to  produce profits to be repatriated. For them, the availability  of foreign exchange is a source of concern, because they are  competing with domestic enterprises and the Chinese for the  limited hard currencies.    "Although you still have the swap market to go to and  exchange yuan into foreign currency, how available is the  foreign exchange -- especially to investors now in their third  or fourth year of operation, where there is enough profit being  generated for repatriation?" said Johnny Chen, treasurer of the  American Chamber of Commerce. "There is not enough hard  currency for investors as a whole," said Mr Chen.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPER BOWL XXIV;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS 55 DENVER BRONCOS 10;  </P> <P> THE CELEBRATION STARTS EARLY FOR 49ER FANS;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO: REVELERS SPILL OUT OF BARS AND INTO THE STREETS AFTER THEIR  TEAM'S 55-10 VICTORY.  </P> <P> "No Mercy! No mercy! No mercy!"  </P> <P> That's what 49er fans began chanting at a sports bar early in the second half  of Sunday's 55-10 drubbing of the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV.  </P> <P> There wasn't much else for them to say.  </P> <P> The 49ers took an early lead and never looked back. Starting quarterback Joe  Montana did not leave the game until his team put a record 55 points on the  scoreboard.  </P> <P> But die-hard fans wanted more.  </P> <P> After the 49ers second consecutive Super Bowl victory, thousands of fans  streamed out of the bars and into the streets, hugging strangers and  optimistically chanting "Three-peat" -- hoping for a third championship next  year.  </P> <P> People converged on Market Street near downtown by car, foot and subway.  Traffic on the street was at a standstill for about three hours.  </P> <P> Many were lighting fireworks, shouting and honking car horns.  </P> <P> Most were peaceful. But there was at least one minor fist fight.  </P> <P> By 7 p.m., police were out in force as boisterous fans also began to gather on  Broadway in North Beach and on Geary Boulevard west of Japantown.  </P> <P> The mood for the past two weeks had been confident. Fans took for granted that  the 49ers would blow out the Broncos. "I'm almost embarrassed," said Gary  Beers, manager of Pat O'Shea's, one the city's most popular sports bars. "It's  almost anticlimactic. It's almost routine. The Niners are in a league by  themselves."  </P> <P> After the biggest blowout in Super Bowl history, some Bay Area fans said they  wanted more -- although they have had a lot to cheer about in the past 18  months. Besides the 49ers' back-to-back championships, baseball's Oakland  Athletics have won two consecutive American League pennants and the 1989 World  Series, and the San Francisco Giants won the National League pennant only to  lose the series to their cross-bay rivals.  </P> <P> Are the fans here spoiled?  </P> <P> "Sure we're spoiled. But we're also the best," said Bill Roberts, 25, as he  took a break from leading cheers at Pat O'Shea's. "We'll be even better when  the Raiders come home.  </P> <P> "This is the best place to be for sports. The best teams and the best fans."  </P> <P> After Montana threw his second touchdown pass, a seven-yard toss to Brent  Jones, the bar became a sea of high-fives.  </P> <P> Some people jumped on tables to cheer for the 49ers.  </P> <P> "No, we're not spoiled yet," Beers said. "If they have another year of success,  they're going to be like Lakers fans -- expecting them to win it every year."  </P> <P> Some Bay Area fans think they are fortunate to have so many winning teams.  </P> <P> "They have winners here," said Karen Jaich, an assistant film producer who  moved to San Francisco six years ago from Simi Valley. "But they appreciate  them. They've had a lot of heartbreak here, too."  </P> <P> Jaich was typical of the "die-hards" who waited hours to get into their  favorite sports bars. She stood in Pat O'Shea's with two beers in her hand as  her husband waited in line to join her.  </P> <P> At most sports bars there were lines stretching around the block before  opening. Once open, people could only enter when a patron left.  </P> <P> There was still a line in front of Pat O'Shea's when the game ended and fans  started partying outside on Geary Boulevard.  </P> <P> But some left the bar early, bored with the lopsided contest.  </P> <P> "It wasn't much of a game. It was a disappointment," said Craig Russell, who  only watched the first quarter. "I'm a fan, I just had other things to do --  like my laundry."  </P> <P> Others, such as George Bell, who worked at his gym instead of watching the  game, could have cared less.  </P> <P> "It's not a bad thing they won," he said. "I guess it's good for some  businesses."  </P> <P> Several immigrants said they didn't understand the game, but enjoyed the  excitement of having a championship team in their adopted city.  </P> <P> Than Aung, who moved to San Francisco from Burma eight months ago, said, "I  think I understand it, but not very well. I'm excited. It's a party."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["War Racket Precipitating Self-Destruction" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim  Yong-sam recently issued a "special alert order" to the puppet  army, crying for "perfect" war preparations against the North  through the "cooperation system" with the United States. The  puppet prime minister openly incited "unification through  Northward march" and the puppet defence minister opened to the  public a new war scenario against the North codenamed New  Operation Plan-5027.    Commenting on this, a MINJU CHOSON analyst today says:    The ill-boding military moves in South Korea are so grave  that they cannot be overlooked. This shows the puppet clique is  driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the dangerous  brink of war.    The Kim Yong-sam clique is a group of the most treacherous  political charlatans and warmaniacs who depend most heavily upon  outside forces among the successive puppet rulers.    As long as there are such fools who stoop to any infamy  against fellow countrymen for the sake of the interests of  outside forces, the nation cannot avoid misfortune." Such  traitors must be removed from the nation in time.    If the South Korean puppets continue military provocations  and unleash a war in collusion with outside forces, they will  have to pay dearly.    The Korean people and People's Army will deal a severe  retaliatory blow at the aggressors if they dare provoke the  socialist motherland.    The South Korean puppets must look straight at the reality  and refrain from rash acts.</p>

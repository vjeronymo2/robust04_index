			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "This Is How Italy Moved to the </F> Right"]    [Text] Rome -- Everything has changed, but the terms  "Right" and "Left" still retain a precise political meaning.  This is evidenced by an SWG [Integrated Research Services] poll  conducted from 1990 to the present.    The most obvious result is the increased number of Italians  who resolutely profess to be right-wing. However, the results  of the SWG survey, which we publish with this report, should be  read taking into account the various stages in our recent  history, starting from the remarkable percentage (39.6 percent)  of those who professed to be center-left in 1990, at the height  of the five-party system. By the end of 1991, on the eve of the  local elections, this group began to disintegrate, flowing into  the Center and center-right categories, headed by the Northern  League.    After the 1993 municipal elections, the center-left  continued  to crumble away, while the Left gave signs of recovery and the  Right started its new, uninterrupted growth. The number of  center-left citizens diminished proportionally by half, the  center-right became stable, and the Left's rise was confirmed.  In fact, the resulting polarization reflects the new electoral  model, which completely upset the previous balance of forces.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Question: In the present political context, does your allegiance go to... |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Percentage    |Oct 90        |Oct 91        |Dec 93        |May 94        |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Right         |8.6           |9.3           |10.6          |21.5          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |center-right  |9.0           |16.3          |16.0          |16.5          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Center        |21.2          |23.5          |25.2          |24.5          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |center-left   |39.6          |30.8          |22.8          |11.3          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Left          |21.6          |20.1          |25.4          |26.2          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

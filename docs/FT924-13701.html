			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK electricity The electricity regulator yesterday delivered a timely reminder of his ability to spoil the power generators' party. PowerGen was due a sharp ticking-off for abusing its position in the electricity pool last year. A pointed reminder of the possibility of a full monopolies commission inquiry by 1995 was unexpected in the context of what was otherwise a narrow, technical report. By going out of his way to link an inquiry to the generator's prices and profits, Mr Littlechild touched on the most sensitive point of an industry doing very nicely without price-based regulation. On a bearish view, the threat of price controls in the constrained sector of the electricity market - the occasional generation of additional power at premium rates to meet demand surges - might be interpreted as the thin end of the wedge. Dark mutterings about forced changes of ownership in this area add to the suspicion that the regulator sees the industry's broader structure as flawed. The outperformance of National Power and PowerGen shares this year has been based squarely on anticipation of a favourable coal contract with British Coal, backed by supply agreements with the regional electricity companies. This is still likely, despite the delay. A small yield discount to the market, though, relies on faith that the generators can cut costs and maintain prices without interference.</p>

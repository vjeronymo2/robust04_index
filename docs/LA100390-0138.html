			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NAIA OKS 2 BASKETBALL DIVISIONS  </P> <P> Schools will be separated into two divisions each in men's and women's  basketball under a resolution adopted today at the 50th annual NAIA convention.  </P> <P> The proposal, which has been considered at the three previous National  Association of Intercollegiate Athletics conventions, was approved 257-143.  Three delegates abstained.  </P> <P> The divisional setup, similar to that for the small colleges that compete in  NAIA football, will begin for a two-year trial period in 1991-92. Schools will  determine what division they play in -- with financial-aid capabilities and  enrollments among the determining factors.  </P> <P> The NAIA said separate championships will be held in the two divisions for both  men's and women's basketball.  </P></p>

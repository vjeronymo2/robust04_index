			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Observer: Reverse charges While police chiefs may prove easy pickings when it comes to stealing mobile telephones, travelling locksmiths can be a tougher prospect. Witness the one who had his phone nicked soon after being set up in business by the Prince's Youth Business Trust. Distraught at the loss, which cut him off from his main source of orders, he used another phone to get through to his own number and begged for the return of the instrument, offering Pounds 50 and no questions asked. The line went dead. But his wife had an idea. She called the number, asked the man who answered if he was a locksmith, then on being told 'yes' said she'd lost the key to her flat and would he come and help. After bidding the price up to Pounds 65, the man agreed. When he arrived, the waiting police posse took him off to the lock-up.</p>

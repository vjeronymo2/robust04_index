			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / The FT Interview: Cheshire cat among the pigeons - John Birt of the BBC talks to Raymond Snoddy John Birt, the director-general of the BBC, is reluctant to confess. But press him hard enough and he says: 'I have - I am sorry to say it, it's a genuine feeling - a strong sense of success.' Probe a little deeper and Birt, who as recently as March, was under widespread attack when it was revealed he had a consultant's contract with the corporation and was not a staff member, goes further: 'I don't think I have had an unpleasant time. I think I have had one of the most satisfying years of my life. There is a very, very strong feeling here of achievement.' For Birt and the BBC it has indeed been a remarkable year. The corporation has experienced one of the most radical changes in its history - Producer Choice has been implemented. This is the name given to the move away from a 'command economy', where all services to producers were provided from the centre, to an internal market where producers control their own budgets and can buy outside services. As a result, several thousand staff jobs have gone but Pounds 100m has been saved this year to spend on programmes. Even more important for the BBC is the government's decision to allow the compulsory annual licence fee, now Pounds 83, to rise in line with retail prices for the last three years of the corporation's Royal Charter until the end of 1996. This relatively generous licence fee settlement indicates that the government acknowledges the BBC is taking serious steps to cut costs. For Birt, the year has been not just one in which he survived a public mauling, but also one in which he achieved a significant victory over his opponents in the organisation - those he has mocked as ancient warriors pointing their old muskets. The licence fee award is a triumph that even Birt's most begrudging detractors would have to recognise. It might also pave the way for Birt to deliver a second, perhaps more startling, win. In the debate over the Royal Charter - the conditions under which the BBC operates - he may be able to persuade the government that there is a continuing role for a universal licence fee, which every television set owner must pay, in an age when cable and satellite television offers ever-increasing choice. So does Birt feel he has won? 'Won is a funny word. Won in what respect?' he asks. He adds that there is a growing public understanding of the BBC's achievements in reforming itself over the past few years and again creating hits, such as Absolutely Fabulous, and dramas, such as Scarlet and Black. There is, Birt says, a sense that programmes are being put first and 'a degree of excitement' that a public sector institution is reforming itself and doing it effectively. But won? 'I'm not going to use that expression. I don't even think like that. That implies that you've passed a finishing post. We are not through the charter review debate, nor is the job finished,' Birt says. He is speaking in his first newspaper interview for almost a year. Apart from wanting to spell out the scale of the accomplishment at the BBC, he also wants to counter the arguments advanced by Ian Hargreaves in his pamphlet, Sharper Vision, published recently by Demos, the independent think-tank. Hargreaves, a former director of news and current affairs at the BBC and now deputy editor of the Financial Times, argued that the BBC's future would be most effectively protected by privatisation, including a stake for the staff. Over a 10-year period the company would move towards a mixed method of funding - licence fee, advertising and subscription - and would thus be liberated from ties to government. While the political battle for such changes has almost certainly been lost, they have aroused high-level interest - Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has started looking at the export potential of British programmes, and is known to be intrigued by such radical views. Birt's disagreement, in particular with the idea of mixed funding, is total. 'If you change the method of funding, you are inevitably going to change the nature of the institution and the programmes it supplies,' he says. In a commercially funded system such as ITV, however regulated, you take decisions on a business basis, he says. As programme director at London Weekend Television, Birt commissioned such popular and profitable programmes as Blind Date and London's Burning. Advertising on the BBC would put the two systems of broadcasting 'in naked and direct competition', changing both ITV and Channel 4 as well as the BBC. Birt believes that in 10 years the BBC licence fee, now 23p a day, will be more defensible and seem better value as viewers get used to paying much larger sums for cable and satellite channels. He concedes, however, that the BBC has to find easier ways for poor people to pay. The corporation is also developing a more aggressive global strategy - exploiting 'the most powerful broadcast media brand name in the world' and its programmes by transmitting television and radio programmes around the world in both English and local languages. Bob Phillis, the BBC deputy director-general and head of the World Service, is working on a comprehensive plan for all the corporation's business interests. The main points include organising the BBC's activities on a regional basis, setting up an arm's-length relationship with BBC Enterprises, the commercial wing, and creating specialist satellite television channels with or without partners. 'We will greatly increase the amount of money coming into the BBC from our commercial activities chiefly outside the UK,' says Birt, who believes that the contribution could rise from about Pounds 60m a year to three times as much by the end of the decade. While he acknowledges the sense of hurt and insecurity the rapid reforms he has initiated have already caused, the modernisation of the BBC will continue apace. Overheads are still too high, there is still excess capacity  -which means more jobs will go - and too many middle managers are inflexible and uncommunicative with their staff, and will have to be replaced by younger people, Birt says. Mostly he talks of success and is hard put to think of any serious errors made over the past year. Producer Choice has been 'a very great success', and modest teething problems must be set against the massive gains. There has been no recent switch in the BBC's programme philosophy, he adds; policy has merely been caricatured as wanting to provide only those programmes, such as opera and hard-hitting documentaries, that commercial television is less likely to make. The policy was, and remains, to offer high-quality programmes for the entire audience. 'No change. There has been no change. No change whatsoever. No. No,' says Birt. Surely most people would regard his freelance contractual arrangement with his employer as a grievous error? 'Weeeeeell. I mean, wouldn't they?' he says, adding that when he arrived at the BBC in 1987 'dozens of people in ITV' had exactly the same arrangements, and at the BBC 'other members - plural - of the BBC board of management had exactly the same arrangements'. As the row fades into history, there seems to be no doubt in Birt's mind, as he enters his second year in charge of one of the world's most famous broadcasting organisations, that his first year was 'a very great success indeed'.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Leading Article: A moment for truth in Bonn TODAY'S meeting in Bonn between Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany is a moment for sober reflection on the troubles at the heart of the European Community. Because this is their first encounter since the storm that blew down the exchange rate mechanism, monetary matters will undoubtedly loom large. With the two countries still at odds over agriculture, so will the EC's position in the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. With Bosnia burning and the European Community's role there under a deepening shadow, the two leaders may find time to fret together about the former Yugoslavia. But there is more at stake today than these individual issues. It is time for the French and German governments to take a more fundamental look at the strengths and weaknesses of their relationship, and to talk frankly about their interests - both where they coincide and where they diverge. Nobody should underestimate the underlying strength of the Franco-German partnership. Taken individually, the issues that divide them are still relatively minor compared with what they have in common. Divisions over multilateral trade cannot detract from the economic integration that has made each the other's largest trading partner by far. Disharmony over exchange and interest rates should not eclipse the two governments' shared desire to proceed towards a single currency. Neither these disputes nor friction over foreign policy can call into question the role of the Bonn-Paris axis as the driving force of the European Community. On the contrary: when the relationship comes under stress, the instinctive reaction in both capitals has long been to close ranks. Unflappable Balladur That is one way of reading the events since the collapse of the old ERM. Despite the widening of currency trading bands, the ineffably unflappable Mr Balladur has gone about his business as if little has changed, with a downward tweak of interest rates here, a suggestion of closer economic policy co-ordination there, and the occasional diatribe against currency speculators. The Bundesbank, having cheekily urged its partners not to cut and run after the debacle that it helped to provoke, may (just may) oblige with a half-point cut in the discount rate today, enabling both countries to pretend that they are on course together for the second phase of Emu. Harmony will be restored, and the French will top it off - at a price - with a promise to co-operate over the Blair House agreement with the US on agricultural subsidies. Franc fort The problem is that these agreements, like many that have preceded them, will deal with the symptoms of the malaise, not the cause. On the monetary front in particular, Mr Balladur's understandable reluctance to admit the demise of his franc fort policy still leaves him performing an awkward balancing act between the needs of his domestic economy on the one hand, and the dictates of European policy (and French self-esteem) on the other. The former cries out for lower interest rates; the latter appears to dictate a floor under the exchange rate. And if he continues to insist on subordinating the former to the latter, he will depend as much as ever on the whims - and perceived domestic policy priorities - of the Bundesbank. Sooner or later as the political temperature in France rises, the two imperatives seem bound to collide. It is undoubtedly a horrible dilemma. What it - and the accompanying political clamour in Paris - underlines is the way in which the balance of power between France and Germany has shifted since German unification. For all his public poise, Mr Balladur is crossing the Rhine today essentially as a supplicant. It is Germany, more than France, that now has real policy choices in Europe; and as the ERM debacle illustrates, post-unification Germany will sometimes choose to subordinate the needs of European co-operation to the interests of combatting inflation at home. The underlying problem in the Franco-German marriage is that the two countries have yet to conduct a full and frank discussion of how their European ideals relate to their national interests. If today's meeting helps to clarify that fundamental question, it will have served a useful purpose.</p>

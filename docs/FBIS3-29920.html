They claim that "a special inspection of  two military sites must be made". Commenting on this, an  analyst of MINJU CHOSON today says: What Hata said is a very  unreasonable balderdash intended to put a brake on the  implementation of the agreement reached between the DPRK and the  IAEA with much difficulty after repeated negotiations.    The inspection agreed upon this time is not routine and ad  hoc inspections pursuant to the safeguards agreement but an  inspection under the special situation in which the DPRK  temporarily suspended the effectuation of its withdrawal from  the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty.    We do not think that the foreign minister of a country put  his nose into our inspection issue, not knowing this.    Hata's claim for "special inspection of two military sites"  reveals his sinister intention to spoil the agreement on  inspection for guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards which  was reached with much difficulty and force a "special  inspection" upon us at any cost.    His rigmarole is nothing but a petty trick to divert  elsewhere the attention of the world from Japan's nuclear  armament by obstructing the solution to our nuclear issue and  aggravating the relations between the DPRK and the IAEA and  between the DPRK and the United States.    We warn that Japanese Foreign Minister Hata and his likes  must act with discretion, clearly knowing what the "special  inspection" means and what consequences it will entail.</p>

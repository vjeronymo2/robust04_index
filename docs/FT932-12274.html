			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Big travel groups defend position BRITAIN'S THREE largest travel companies say it would not be in their interest to use their dominant position to shut out competitors. Executives from Thomson, Owners Abroad and Airtours have told the Association of British Travel Agents convention in Majorca that their travel agents will continue to sell holidays from a large number of tour operators. Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, said yesterday that Pickfords Travel, which he purchased last year, sold the holidays of hundreds of tour operators and would continue to do so. He admitted, however, that the decision to buy Pickfords from the transport group NFC was partly motivated by a desire to ensure that Airtours did not suffer at the hands of Thomson, the biggest travel company, and its Lunn Poly retail chain. Airtours and Lunn Poly have had disputes in the past over pricing and the display of brochures.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission rejects the above arguments as collateral attacks on Order No. 561. ARCO recognized that the present rule merely implements that regulation when it stated that ``the Commission has indicated in Order No. 561&hyph;A that it intends to proceed on the basis that it has this power'' to prevent an oil pipeline from putting into effect a market-based rate until the Commission concludes that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  Nonetheless, the Commission sees no merit in the above arguments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comments at 9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The indexing method sets the maximum lawful rate subject to exceptions which must be proven. For purposes of analyzing the legal issues presented, the Commission must assume that market-based rates would be higher than indexed rates because an oil pipeline is free to file for rates under the index without justification. Hence, an oil pipeline must show that it is entitled to an exception to charge more than the index would permit. In this context, the application is in essence a request for waiver of the maximum rate. Such a moratorium on filings for market-based rates (except under the application process) comports with the Commission's power to restrict filings of proposed rates higher than those determined by the Commission to be just and reasonable. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Cf., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 780 (1968). (``The Commission may under Sections 5 and 16 [of the Natural Gas Act] restrict filings under Section 4(d) of proposed rates higher than those determined by the Commission to be just and reasonable.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is true that this treatment of market-based rates differs from the Commission's approach to filings by oil pipelines for cost-based rates. However, the difference is justified. It is appropriate to take the present action with respect to market-based rates for oil pipelines in order to ensure that presumed market forces will not be the basis of effective rates for the transportation of oil when an oil pipeline's application ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> its waiver request) is under consideration. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  The Commission cannot permit market-based rates without an affirmative showing that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Farmers Union Central Exchange, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> FERC, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  734 F.2d 1486, 1510 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  With respect to the AOPL's contention about gas storage rates, the Commission notes that those cases were considered mostly in certificate proceedings. While Koch Gateway Pipeline Company's proceeding was a rate filing, it involved the continuation of an experimental program that had been previously approved as part of a settlement. 66 FERC &para;61,385 (1994). In addition, oil pipeline market cases have been lengthy and have gone beyond the statutory suspension period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the Commission is taking the approach that an oil pipeline must file an application for market-based rates, Marathon's reliance on Section 6(3) of the ICA is misplaced. Simply put, there is no rate investigation. Rather, the investigation is into whether the oil pipeline possesses significant market power in the relevant markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AOPL also maintains that the Commission is not authorized by the ICA to adopt market-power filing requirements. It argues that, under Section 6(3) of the ICA, an oil pipeline seeking to change its rates need only file a notice of proposed change with the Commission, and that the Commission's authority under that action is limited to rules and regulations for the ``simplification'' of schedules. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  The AOPL adds that the ICA does not require the submission of material in justification of a proposed rate change unless and until that rate change is set for hearing. It asserts that the oil pipeline's statutory burden of proof under Section 15(7) of the ICA does not attach until the matter is set for hearing. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  The AOPL last maintains that the Commission's characterization of the market power application as a nonrate filing does not cure the statutory shortcoming because if it is not a rate filing there is no statutory basis for the application. It further maintains that, in any event, the characterization is wrong as shown by the caption of this proceeding and the collection of information form (FERC 550 ``Oil Pipeline Rates_Tariff Filings'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comments at 18.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 15(7) provides in pertinent part:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At any hearing involving a change in a rate, fare, charge, or classification, or in a rule, regulation, or practice, the burden of proof shall be upon the carrier to show that the proposed changed rate, fare, charge, classification, rule, regulation, or practice is just and reasonable, and the Commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over all other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the order in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cost-of-Service Filing and Reporting Requirements for Oil Pipelines,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> issued contemporaneously with this rule, the Commission has the authority to adopt filing requirements beyond the mere form of notices and schedules. The Commission may require information upon which to determine how to act on a filing. In any event, as discussed above, the Commission views the application required here as in essence a waiver request, which will enable the Commission to make the required affirmative finding that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets before it permits market-based rates as an exception to the indexing approach. Nothing in the ICA prevents the Commission from setting forth the requirements of a waiver request, including placing the burden of proof on the person seeking the waiver. Even if the application is a rate change under Section 15(7), the Commission is not compelled to hold a hearing, but if it does hold a hearing, the hearing may be resolved on the written record. The required application simply starts the hearing process and the statutory burden of proof would affix. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  With respect to the AOPL's arguments about the caption to this proceeding, it merely reflects the end result of the process_market-based rates. Further, the form for the collection of information merely recognizes the end-result_oil pipeline rates and, in any event, is purely ministerial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The AOPL maintains that the scope of discovery is limited under the Commission's rules of practice and procedure (18 CFR 385.402(a)) to issues set for hearing. It submits that the Commission will put the ``procedural cart before the horse by requiring production of discovery_related information before the scope of contested issues has been established.'' Comments at 40. As stated in the text, the Commission has the authority to adopt filing requirements and to set forth the requirements for a waiver as the first stage of the investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

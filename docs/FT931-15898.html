			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Debate, drama and the young at heart - Radio in 1992 THE BBC's Radio 2 and Radio 3 have changed significantly this year. Radio 1, meanwhile, maintains its well-established principle of entertaining the young-in-heart, with well-judged mediation in campaigns likely to matter to the young-in-body - AIDS, for instance, drugs, suicide and ethnic affairs. Radio 4 has only made one serious alteration I call to mind, the switch of Woman's Hour from afternoon to morning. There is no point in reopening the arguments about that now, though I can take the opportunity of saying what a good programme this is. Radio 2 up-dated its image a little, to the resentment of older listeners, who I think regard it as a channel to play them what they have known all their lives, as for the most part it does. Radio 3 was up-dated in its way, too, with more conversational presentation and more time devoted to the analysis of popular entertainment. I do not pretend to enjoy Night Waves; but now I need not often listen, for Classic FM has sprung up in the independent field to provide an alternative service. Radio 3 at any rate goes on with its plentiful choice of live and recorded concerts as well as intelligent comment on music and the other arts (such as Test Matches). There was a series of features on the ecology - and there is still a play once a week. It has scored high in drama. We had Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet in the spring, and lately a succession of pieces from the dramatic uprising of the 1960s. There were two plays from the Spanish, wittily adapted by the expert John Clifford, Inez de Castro and Fernando de Rojas's La Celestina. Then we were given the contemporary Romanian play Vlad the Impaler, a quasi-historical piece about that prince, begetter of Dracula and allegory of Ceausescu; and the Russian Yerofeev's Moscow Train, that ran through wild country to Moscow Station. Rabbi Lionel Blue's quarter-hour on the Last Supper was one of my favourite programmes of the year. Radio 4 was as generous with drama as Radio 3 with music. I pick a random Radio Times from my pile and find in that week three plays over an hour long (one repeated), three roughly an hour long, and seven half-hours, five of them instalments of serials. The Classic Serials are not always classics, but who minds? They are handy when they dramatise books we all know about but have not necessarily read; the year's miscellany included Humphry Clinker, Pere Goriot, The Mill on the Floss. The less classic serials included Decline and Fall and Little Women. For me, Radio 4 is the debate channel. Its Radio 4 Debates are real debating-society stuff. But also there were series about current affairs - The Politics of Choice at election-time, in which political matters were raised without politicians; and Who Believes in Britain?, that surveyed not only our own Church but Buddhism, the Hindus, Islam, Judah and the Sikhs. In July there were five programmes on The Future of the Arts, and in September four talks by Sir Roy Strong on their funding. We learnt about the Radio 4/Radio Times Enterprise Awards for business initiative. Talks and features proliferate, though they tend to lag behind current affairs. Not always: William T. Vollmann's Yugoslavian Notes gave a great pictorial background to the Yugoslavian crisis. Sometimes the features led the way - Michael Buerk's series on Africa last winter gave a picture of Somalia that we only now fully visualise. The American election gave rise to The Fading Dream about the electorate, and, more amusingly, to a Chicago production of Of Thee I Sing. Current affairs might surface anywhere; there was a fine feature in Woman's Hour about the new baby unit in Holloway Gaol. Costing the Earth was a series prompted by the Rio summit, but found a second wind on ecological subjects; yet even Lord Tebbit did not bring them in on Desert Island Discs, that faultless Sunday entertainment. Radio 5 had trouble finding its feet, but at least its day-long, everyday coverage of the Olympics went down well. Otherwise I found myself constantly burdened with serials for the young. In February, Nothing Ever Happens Here, about an American boy's impressions of England, was fun; later examples, less so. But having secured its age-group, the Radio 5 anti-glue-sniffing programme was as good as Radio 1's. A Family Learns Spanish had too little Spanish in it, but there are three Sunday evening programmes genuinely helpful for those wanting to learn French, German or Italian. There has been some good stuff on the World Service. A six-part history of Japan was more interesting than it sounds; and there was a novel celebration of Columbus's 'discovery' of America, The Invaders' Legacy, an anthology of all that was wrong in South America. Nor must I forget LBC, which broadcasts many of the winning pieces from the Woolwich Young Playwrights' competition, or a good play from Radio Clyde. ***** Auguries in 1993's first week? On Radio 4: Sex in the Head on Saturday (modest erotic thoughts) and Two People on Friday (lesbian problems) and the start of two unpromising comic series, Craig Brown's appalling Welcome to My Wireless (Sundays) and Miles Kington's imaginary interviews (Mondays). On Radio 3: Twelfth Night with a Caribbean accent, on or near Twelfth Night, and Paul Scofield reading Seneca's letters. Radios 1, 2 and 5, wait and see. And Classic FM gave Marschner's opera The Vampyr on Sunday. Keep on listening.</p>

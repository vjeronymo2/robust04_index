			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Technology: Strong feelings over patent dispute - The multimedia industry may soon turn into a legal minefield US computer software companies are up in arms over the granting of a basic patent on multimedia databases to Compton's New Media, a small software company best known for its development of an electronic multimedia encyclopedia that is sold on a CD-Rom, similar to an audio compact disc. Compton's has shocked the industry by announcing that it has been granted a patent that covers any computer-controlled system that searches through a database and retrieves text with images or audio or video information. The company is seeking royalties amounting to 1 per cent of revenues from sales of multimedia products ranging from personal computer databases to interactive television. It has said that it will reduce or eliminate royalties on the patent to software developers that use Compton's as a distributor. Many in the software industry are convinced that Compton's claim to have invented a novel process for searching multimedia databases is false. 'This patent basically claims that Compton's invented multimedia,' says Philip Dodds, executive director of the Interactive Multimedia Association (IMA), a trade association representing more than 260 companies in the rapidly emerging multimedia industry. Compton's patent covers a search system process that is common and considered non-proprietary, the industry group maintains. Compton's patent now seems certain to be challenged in the courts. Several industry groups including the IMA and San Francisco's Multimedia Developers Group are banding together in an effort to get the patent overturned. Compton's, however, is determined to assert its patent rights. 'We simply want the public to recognise Compton's NewMedia as the pioneer in this industry, promote a standard that can be used by every developer and be compensated for the investments we have made to make multimedia a reality for developers and end users,' said Stanley Frank, president and chief executive. The dispute has raised strong feelings in the software industry because it comes just as multimedia products appear set to break into the mainstream of personal computing. Dozens of software companies have launched CD-Rom titles for home and school use and sales of PCs complete with stereo sound and video capabilities are booming. The fledgling multimedia industry could soon turn into a legal battleground says G. Gervaise Davis III, a partner in Davis &amp; Schroeder, a California-based law firm specialising in intellectual property issues. Thousands of multimedia patent applications have been filed in the past few years, he notes. However, the row over Compton's multimedia patent is only the latest example of a much broader problem with software patents. Critics charge that software patents covering basic ideas are stifling the creativity of the small companies that have led innovation in the software industry by limiting access to fundamental ideas. Until seven years ago, the US Patent Office did not grant patents on software. Since then, more than 10,000 software patents have been granted, but there are as many as 15,000 software patent applications waiting for approval. Yet the US Patent Office is ill-equipped to examine properly these claims, industry critics charge. The agency lacks the expertise or resources to fully research 'prior art' that can invalidate patent applications. As a result, several sweeping patents have been granted for basic computer processes that are not novel, the IMA complains. A group of US firms including Apple Computer, IBM, Digital Equipment, Lotus Development and Microsoft have formed the Software Patent Institute, which is building a database of software inventions for the Patent Office's use in an effort to avert software patent disputes. But Compton's patent issue is spurring industry pressure for broader reforms. The IMA has called for the formation of an industry commission to review pending patents and provide the Patent Office with the expertise it currently lacks. Some are also calling for changes in US patent laws to give patent challengers an opportunity to make their case before a patent is granted. Currently, in the US, patent filings are secret until approval is granted. This means that anyone wishing to dispute a patent must either challenge the patent in the courts or ask the Patent Office to re-examine the patent. Both are lengthy and expensive procedures. In the meantime, the challenger must pay royalties to the patent holder or run the risk of being liable for triple damages for willfully infringing the patent. Such disputes are nothing new in other sectors of the high-technology industry such as semiconductors and computer hardware, where patents have long been recognised as a primary means of protecting intellectual property rights that enable innovators to recoup their investments in technology development. Yet in the software industry, patent rights are a relatively new phenomenon and one that few developers have previously encountered. Although many may see the dispute over Compton's patent as a threat to innovation, it may well prove to be a catalyst for broader understanding of intellectual property rights in the software industry and improvements in the patent process that will eventually benefit all software developers.</p>

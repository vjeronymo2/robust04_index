			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Brazilian Government has repudiated, through  Brazilian newspapers, the annual report on human rights issued  by the U.S. State Department. The U.S. report released  yesterday included Brazil among the countries that violate  civilian rights.    In its reaction to the U.S. report, the Brazilian Government  considers as unfounded charges of disrespect for civilian rights  because the document does not consider the efforts by the  Brazilian federal, state, and municipal governments to solve the  problem.    The Brazilian Government believes the subject must be  discussed by international organizations and stresses that the  accusation is unacceptable because the U.S. Government does not  release reports on human rights violations in its own territory.</p>

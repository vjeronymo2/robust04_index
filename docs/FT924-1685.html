			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Half IBM's 25,000 staff cuts to fall on European plants ALMOST half the 25,000 job cuts planned for next year by International Business Machines, US computer group, are expected to fall in Europe, the company's single largest market. IBM's European subsidiaries employ about 100,000 people. The company said yesterday that under the restructuring programme announced on Tuesday about 12,000 jobs would go in Europe, half in marketing and administration and half in manufacturing and development. Mr John Akers, IBM chairman, told analysts in New York that the company's European business had declined 'precipitously and unexpectedly' since the beginning of October, a collapse which has clearly shaken the company's senior executives. Manufacturing sites at risk of contraction or closure include the semiconductor plants at Corbeil-Essones in France and Sindelfingen in Germany, the mainframe plants at Montpellier in France and Valencia in Spain and the printer plant at Jarfalla in Sweden. Forced redundancy is no longer being ruled out anywhere. IBM is expected to deal with overcapacity at some plants by sharing manufacture - for example, with Siemens of Germany in semiconductor memories  -or by building products on a contract basis for other companies. Yesterday, country managers were starting discussions, expected to take several months, to agree the necessary cuts. Many were predicting, initially, job losses which far underestimated the totals demanded by Mr Akers on Tuesday. Business units such as IBM PC, the company's personal computer arm, will have full authority over the plants manufacturing their product and will be able to cut jobs or close facilities without reference to country managers. Responses from individual European subsidiaries yesterday reflected a measure of confusion following the announcement from headquarters. Germany: IBM Deutschland said it planned 2,500 redundancies in 1993 after cuts of 2,000 this year. No closures were yet planned. France has lost 2,400 staff this year and plans to lose another 1500 in 1993. There are no plans for plant closures. The UK intends to lose 1,000 jobs next year, the same total as in 1992. The Greenock personal computer plant in Scotland, which employs 2,200 people, is thought to be safe as demand for its products is strong. Italy is losing about 800 people a year through natural wastage and hopes to contain shrinkage to roughly the same level next year. No plant closures or compulsory envisaged. The Netherlands: No job losses are expected in addition to a programme which should see staff fall from 5049 to 4230 by the end of 1995. There are no manufacturing plants. Spain No decision on cuts have yet been taken.

All Kazakh consumers have been ordered to pay debts for  received fuel within a couple of weeks. National bank and a  number of commercial banks will grant them certain credits for  that.    Custom duties on export coal deliveries will be abolished  and  tariffs on deliveries within the territory of the republic will  be reduced.    However, it will be very difficult to return all the debts  as  their sum is astronomical: Only the debt for wages in the  Karagandaugol totals about 180 million tenge (approximately 16  million U.S. dollars).</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy The foreign exchange market seemed determined to look on the bad side of yesterday's UK unemployment data. If August's 5,800 rise in the jobless total really is a signal that the recovery is weakening, the chances of a rate cut have presumably increased. That supposition, together with Mr Norman Lamont's new onslaught on the prime minister, was enough to send sterling lower. Whether there is much logic in this view is another matter. Unemployment has risen slightly in each of the last two months but it is still 70,000 below January's seasonally-adjusted peak. Mr Major may have taken another knock from his former chancellor but he has little to gain by reaching for the interest rate lever in reply. Mr Lamont himself blocked this route by warning against politically-motivated interest rate cuts in his resignation speech. In their desire to sober up after the violent reaction to Wednesday's inflation data, the markets may have overlooked the other message in the unemployment figures. Average manufacturing earnings are still growing at 5 per cent, while the improvement in both unit labour costs and productivity has slowed. The latter may be a statistical consequence of this week's revision of manufacturing output, but lower production only makes the earnings data all the more disappointing. At any rate manufacturing earnings are hardly compatible with the inflation miracle which the gilts market has been promising itself. Markets generally may be in for a rough ride as this realisation sinks in.</p>

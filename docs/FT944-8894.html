			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (3): Image has taken a battering - Technology The image of Massachusetts as a hotbed of high technology has taken something of a battering in recent years, writes Tony Jackson. In the 1980s, the Route 128 corridor around Boston was trumpeted as the east coast's answer to Silicon Valley. Now, say the critics, look at the contrast. Silicon Valley has wonderful high-tech companies such as Intel and Hewlett-Packard: Massachusetts has disasters such as Digital Equipment and Wang. In fact, the comparison is skewed by one simple fact. Wang and Digital were among a handful of big, well-established Massachusetts companies which concentrated on mini-computers, which turned out to be a blind alley in the era of the networked personal computer. Forget the headlines, say the state's defenders. A pool of highly talented workers, backed by a well-developed venture capital industry and the enormous resources of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, make Massachusetts as much a hotbed as ever it was. Professor Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School goes further. 'I think we have now eclipsed Silicon Valley,' he says. 'The latest Inc. 500 report (on the 500 fastest growing private companies in America) showed that Massachusetts had 33 companies on the list, and California had 71. California is around 14 per cent of the nation's economy and Massachusetts is 2.5 per cent. Do your sums, and Massachusetts is much the more exciting.' Part of this, he says, has to do with developments in technology. 'California hit on the PC and the workstation while we had the mini-computer,' he says. 'So we had a pause while they charged ahead. But the wave of the future now is networking, and we have company after company in the telecoms networking business. And while the west coast may have the consumer software, we have the sophisticated business software. The Massachusetts cluster is better positioned to ride the wave in the next phase.' In addition, he argues, Massachusetts now enjoys a much better relationship between government and business. 'One reason this area was down in the mouth in the late 1980s was the anti-business attitude: high taxes, and incredibly liberal regulatory plans.' Under Governor William Weld, this has changed. 'California has replaced us as the anti-business state. It was so prosperous that people got to feel that any amount of social activism could be afforded. It will take longer to turn California around than it did Massachusetts, because it's such a big state.' Another fundamental reason advanced for Massachusetts' strength in high-tech is its universities, in particular MIT. The links here are all-pervasive and date back more than a century. Professor Merton Flemings, head of the department of materials science and engineering, chairs a task force on links between MIT and industry. 'From its earliest days, MIT had an intimate association with industry in Massachusetts and New England,' he says. 'Alexander Graham Bell spent time studying at MIT, and the telephone was invented in the Boston area.' The defence giant Raytheon was founded by MIT graduates just before the war, Digital Equipment just after. EG&amp;G, a local specialist in nuclear weapons and power plants with sales of Dollars 2.7bn, was founded by an MIT professor and two of his students. The main areas of commercial promise, in Professor Flemings' view, are information technology, materials science and engineering, manufacturing technology in general and healthcare. 'Information technology remains a very strong area,' he says. 'In the development of small companies, we may even lead in this field.' And then, of course, there is biotechnology. In Massachusetts as elsewhere, this has a poor image at present. A string of biotech companies, most recently Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass., has wrought havoc in the stock market by revealing that some of their much-hyped new pharmaceutical products have turned out to be duds. Professor Flemings takes the long view. 'The biotech industry here remains strong, and new companies continue to be formed. The stock market may have taken a bath, but I think we'll see continuing and growing strength in the Massachusetts region.' This is warmly seconded by Mr Henri Termeer, head of Genzyme, the third-biggest US biotech company, also based in Cambridge. New England, he points out, has the second-largest concentration of biotech companies in the US, after the Bay area around San Francisco. Massachusetts, he says, has some 140 biotech companies - 'around the same number as in the whole of western Europe.' In the industry's last big bout of fund-raising, in 1991 and the first quarter of 1992, Massachusetts companies raised 20 per cent of the Dollars 6bn total. Genzyme's own commitment to the area seems beyond dispute. In round terms, the company has 1,000 employees in Massachusetts, 500 elsewhere in the US and 400 abroad. It has also just spent Dollars 100m on a new plant next door to the Harvard Business School on the Charles river. When considering where to put the plant, Mr Termeer says, he also looked closely at a site in North Carolina. 'At one point I was reported (in a local Boston paper) as saying we were about to choose between the two. The governor was in my office the next day, asking what he could do to help.' The decision in favour of Massachusetts, he claims, was based less on financial incentives than on the state's determination to make the company feel welcome and to smooth the way to the early commissioning of the plant. In fact, he says, Massachusetts is not a friendly environment for a manufacturer in his industry; labour costs are high, regulations are burdensome and there is no tradition of pharmaceutical manufacture as there is in North Carolina or New Jersey. However, he says, 'I gambled on the notion that the goodwill I saw, and the tremendous technological backbone of Harvard and MIT, would allow the beginning of a manufacturing cluster in Harvard.' Whether this will work remains to be seen. Meanwhile, he argues, Massachusetts has a further important advantage in his industry: the availability of committed and knowledgeable investors. On the one hand, he says, there are a large number of venture capital funds in the area, always on the look-out for opportunities. In addition, there are the big fund management houses. 'They have healthcare analysts who become much more familiar with what's happening here because of their proximity. As a result, Massachusetts companies have a disproportionate amount of local funding. Fidelity is a big investor in Genzyme: we have done eight financings, and Fidelity has taken around 5-10 per cent of the initial offering in well over half of them.'</p>

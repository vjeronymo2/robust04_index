			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / France prepares to reform state-run pension system THE French government has started to prepare proposals for its long-awaited reform of the pension system with a view to presenting a legislative package to parliament next spring. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, has formed a working party to produce provisional proposals for reform of the existing state-controlled system. At present the working party is operating on an informal basis. However, Mr Alphandery hopes to have finalised the details of the package by the end of the year. Pension reform is one of the most pressing and complex issues on the French government's financial agenda. The system worked well in the 1950s and 1960s when France had a large, young working population. But it now faces collapse as the population has aged and a proportionally smaller group of workers struggles to support a growing number of pensioners. The simplest solution would be to alleviate the pressure on the state system by encouraging the French to invest in private pensions. However, previous governments have baulked from the electorally risky task of persuading the French to pay extra for their own private pensions while continuing in the state system. Mr Alphandery is said to be determined to change the system. His ministry has already demonstrated an ability to devise original schemes, notably the 'Balladur bond', which raised FFr110bn (Pounds 12.8bn) covered by privatisation sales of the same amount over the next 18 months.</p>

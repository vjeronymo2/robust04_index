			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 25 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The  international community is taking too long to act against the  blatant aggression by Serbia on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yang  Di-pertuan Agong (the Malaysian king) Sultan Azlan Shah said  Monday.    For too long, the international community has failed to act  against the blatant aggression by Serbia on the independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the atrocious violation and abuse of human rights of the Bosnian  people, he said at a state banquet in honour of visiting  Albanian President Dr. Sali Berisha at Istana Negara (the  palace) here. He said there was no excuse, whatsoever, not to  act against the Serbs to end the violence and suffering of an  entire nation and people and to restore peace and stability in  that region.    His majesty said although Malaysia and Albania were far from  each other geographically, Malaysians were well aware that the  ugly conflict and ethnic cleansing occurring in  Bosnia-Herzegovina cast a long and dark shadow over Albania and  the entire Balkan region.    We understand and share your anxiety and concern on a  possible spillover of the war into Albania, threatening your  peace and stability. Indeed the tense situation in Kosovo is  also of grave concern, he said.    Berisha, in his speech, praised Malaysians for their  generous  political, technical, and economic assistance to Albania and  added that Malaysia was among the first countries to offer help  after Albania decided to adopt an open policy.    He said Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's visit to  Albania last year opened a new and important page in the  relations between the two countries and in strengthening the  friendship between their peoples.    The friendly relations and cooperation with Malaysia were of  special importance to Albanians, he said.    Indeed, our two peoples and countries, though located far  apart geographically, are always closer with their feelings and  hearts. This, first of all, because of the historical spiritual  links and of the common values they share, he said.    Berisha said both countries with a Muslim majority were  characterised by the religious pluralism and at the same time by  the religious harmony.    Berisha also praised Malaysia for its great concern about  the  situation in the Balkans as well as its efforts through  political activity and participation in the peacekeeping forces  in the region in order to provide a solution for the crisis.</p>

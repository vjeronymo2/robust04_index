			<p>BFN     [Text] The South Korea National Democratic Front [SKNDF]  Central Committee issued on 14 May a statement concerning the  discovery of 70 kilograms of plutonium, which is enough to  manufacture nine nuclear bombs, at a plutonium plant in Japan.  The full text of the statement is as follows:    Seventy kilograms of plutonium, enough for manufacturing  nine  nuclear bombs, has recently been discovered in Japan's plutonium  plant for developing [words indistinct] nuclear fuel.    All countries of the world as well as the international  community are now greatly concerned about and angry with the  detection of the large amount of plutonium warding off  international surveillance in Japan that claims to be a model in  accepting so-called international nuclear inspections.    The discovery of as much as 70 kilograms of plutonium is  vivid proof showing that Japan has secretly produced and  stockpiled a huge amount of plutonium while accelerating its  nuclear armament under the cloak of peaceful nuclear  development, and has actually used the accumulated plutonium for  military purposes.    At the same time, it clearly proves that the International  Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] surveillance system is, in nature,  not aimed at the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, but no  more than a means of pressure and aggression that enables  nuclear states, including the United States, to realize their  ambition to dominate nonnuclear states.    In order to turn the attention of Asia and the rest of the  countries concerned about Japan's nuclear armament to North  Korea, the Japanese authorities are playing the role of shock  brigade drumming up the United States' anti-North Korea nuclear  commotion. They are accelerating their full-fledged nuclear  armament behind the curtain of the (?commotion) over the  so-called suspicion of North Korea's nuclear development.    In fact, there have been open attempts in Japan to  politicize  and legalize Japan's nuclear armament while opposing and  distorting the peace law that prohibits the possession of  nuclear weapons. Even absurd remarks stressing the  unnecessariness of the three principles for denuclearization are  heard.    Japan began the full-fledged development of nuclear weapons  in the 1950s and has now become an unquestionable nuclear power  [myongsil sangbuhan heak taeguk] with fissionable nuclear  materials, the technology for manufacturing them, and the means  of nuclear transportation.    Japan has strongly pushed ahead with the ambitious plan to  secure highly-condensed uranium and plutonium and has  accumulated 26 tonnes of plutonium. The amount of plutonium  stockpiled by Japan will reach some 100 tonnes in the early 21st  century.    Japan is now building a nuclear waste reprocessing plant to  extract plutonium from the enormous amount of spent nuclear fuel  used by 38 reactors being in operation at the Nikaimura nuclear  complex. The plant, which will be completed soon, will produce  eight tonnes of plutonium a year. This means that Japan will  obtain enough plutonium to manufacture more than 1,000 [word  indistinct] nuclear bombs a day.    Japan's ambition to secure a huge amount of plutonium is  well  shown by the fact that it abruptly began in April to operate  Monju, a fast-breeding reactor installed in Tsuruga, Fukui  Prefecture, running counter to the worldwide trend of opposing  fast-breeding reactors.    In addition, Japan succeeded in the test firing of the  homemade long-range No. 1 F-2 Rocket early this year to pave the  way for its possession of strategic nuclear missiles.    Japan's nuclear armament and its attempt to become a nuclear  power belong to today's reality, not to tomorrow's [word  indistinct].    The discovery of the concealed 70 kilograms of plutonium is  indeed a proof of Japan's frenzy in nuclear development.    The SKNDF Central Committee sternly punishes and denounces,  along with the peace-loving popular masses of the world, the  Japanese authorities' maneuver to produce, stockpile, and  secretly bring in the awful nuclear weapons that will drop on  our nation and mankind, with the tacit permission from the  United States and the IAEA.    At the same time, in the name of the nation, the SKNDF  Central Committee sternly protests the nation-selling Kim  Yong-sam group that is pushing ahead with its full-pledged  nuclear weapon development in collusion with the Japanese  reactionary authorities, behind the curtain of the U.S.  anti-North Korea nuclear commotion to destroy North Korea, where  the fellow countrymen live.    The Japanese nuclear armament (?threatens) peace in Asia and  the world. Japan's maneuver to become a nuclear power is  increasing the nuclear war danger on the Korean peninsula.    Despite these facts, the United States and the IAEA are  maneuvering to pressure North Korea by fabricating and  amplifying the suspicion over the fictitious nuclear development  of North Korea, while ignoring Japan's nuclear armament, whose  true nature has been revealed. This is a significant  infringement upon the international justice, peace, and  impartiality.    We expect that governments, political parties, and  organizations of countries in the world as well as international  organizations, which love justice and peace and pursue common  prosperity and development, will deter Japan's ambition of  nuclear armament and will even more broadly organize and round  off the struggle to establish a new order for controlling  nuclear development based on international impartiality.    The SKNDF will continue to strongly wage the antiwar and  antinuclear peace movement to cope with Japan's nuclear armament  maneuver that threatens the Korean peninsula, Asia, and (?the  whole world) and with the anti-North Korea nuclear commotion by  the United States and international reactionary forces [kukche  pandong seryok] aimed at making the Korean peninsula the victim  of a nuclear war.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / IMF 'facing a busier future' The International Monetary Fund's second half-century will be busier than its first, if Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director, has his way. Setting out his vision of the IMF's future at a Washington news conference, he said it needed to play a larger role as a manager of the international economic system, while increasing its efforts to promote sustainable growth in former communist countries and the developing world. He said big changes in the 50 years since the IMF and World Bank were created, at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire, included the greater mobility of international capital and the bigger role of developing countries in the global economy. The globilisation of economic activity brought about by capital mobility made national economies more inter-dependent and made effective central co-ordination of policies more necessary than ever. However, he signalled that the consultative process of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries was not ideally suited to the task because it excluded developing countries. It was 'crystal clear that we must try to promote more participatory decision-making', with developing countries playing a role commensurate with their economic importance. The IMF's interim committee, which meets twice a year and includes 24 finance ministers from industrial and developing countries, provided a 'remarkable framework for participatory decision-making.' Its role should be strengthened to reflect the challenges posed by globalisation of the world economy. Mr Camdessus brushed aside a suggestion by the Bretton Woods Commission  - an independent group of experts headed by Mr Paul Volcker, a former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board - that the IMF should focus on its global monetary responsibilies and not duplicate the work of the World Bank in promoting growth in developing countries. The fund, he said, needed to do more, not less. It was working on a package of measures to increase economic support for clients, especially ex-communist countries, involving increased access to its loan facilities and a new allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs), the fund's artificial reserve asset created in the 1960s to supplement global stocks of gold and foreign exchange reserves. Mr Camdessus said countries planning to implement strong adjustment programmes under stand-by or extended fund facilities should be able to borrow up to 90 per cent, rather than 68 per cent, of their quotas with the fund. (An IMF quota is akin to the membership fees paid when joining a club.) He also favoured increased access to the systemic transformation facility, a loan facility designed for former communist countries. On SDRs, two options were being discussed. Equity considerations justified a restricted allocation to the 37 countries (including some eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union) which had joined the fund since the last allocation in 1981. However, he believed there was also a strong case for a general increase in SDRs to all members to increase global liquidity when inflation was low. Mr Camdessus said he would continue to press all members to make their currencies fully convertible on current account transactions. At present, only 93 of 179 had achieved this. But it was time 'for the IMF to go an extra mile' and insist that members also liberalise transactions on capital account, which had not been envisioned by the fund's founding fathers. Free capital flows would promote greater efficiency in resource allocation. However, although greater capital mobility was desirable, it also raised the 'risk of sudden crises', even in countries with sound policies. So, Mr Camdessus would continue to press for the creation of a new IMF facility to give members resources with which to defend themselves against speculative attacks in financial markets.</p>

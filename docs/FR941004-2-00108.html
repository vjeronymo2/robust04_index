			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Provisional Rules of Procedure have been circulated by the CITES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretariat to the Parties. The Rules of Procedure must be adopted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plenary of the COP at the outset. The only difference between the Rules of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedure for COP8 and the Provisional Rules circulated by the Secretariat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are in Rule 15, paragraph 3, which was modified by the Standing Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at its thirty-first meeting in Geneva, 21&hyph;25 March 1994. The modifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended by the Standing Committee, and indeed all of the Rules of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedure, are not official until they are adopted by the COP. Rule 15,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph 3, refers to secret ballots. According to the Rules of Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted at COP8 (which did not differ from those at COP7), when a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegation proposes that a vote be taken by secret ballot, an open vote is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to approve this proposal; a majority of all Parties voting must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve a secret ballot before it is implemented. The revised Rules of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedure recommended by the Standing Committee, amended at the suggestion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the observer from Zimbabwe at that meeting, require that only six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties (the proposer and five seconds) request a secret ballot for it to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be implemented for a particular vote.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the Standing Committee meeting, the United States delegation opposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifying the Rules of Procedure. The proposed COP9 position of the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States remains in opposition to this modification of the Rules of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedure, which operated effectively at both COP7 and COP8. In numerous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international fora (e.g., GATT, UNCED), it has been the position of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States to promote openness in the dealings of intergovernmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations. The United States believes that since a delegation at a COP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is accountable to its government, it should not need to vote in secret.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States is also very concerned that making secret ballots too  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> easy will unnecessarily delay the work of the COP. The United States also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that it is inappropriate for the minority (possibly only six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countries) to dictate to the majority how votes should proceed. The United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States believes that a rule allowing a few countries to require use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secret ballot could lead to excessive use of this option. Secret ballots  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are extremely slow and time consuming. For budgetary and other reasons,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic voting cannot be provided at the COP, which would have minimized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time necessary to conduct a secret vote. Regardless of how few or many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secret ballots are taken at the COP, however, all U.S. positions and votes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on issues will be publicly disclosed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Election of Chair and Vice-Chair of the Meeting and of Committees I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and II and of the Budget Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No documents will be prepared for this item. Support election of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conference Chair from the United States, and highly qualified Committee and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vice Chairs representing the geographic diversity of CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Chair of the CITES Standing Committee (New Zealand) will serve as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary Chair of the Conference until a permanent Conference Chair is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elected. It is traditional for the host country to provide the Conference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chair, and the United States will propose a person with substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> executive skills and international negotiating experience to be nominated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as Chair. This person, if elected by the parties, will serve as Presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer of the Conference and also of the Conference Bureau, the executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> body which manages the business of the Conference; other members of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bureau include the Committee Chairs (discussed below), the nine members of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Standing Committee (see Agenda Item IX), and the Secretariat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major technical work of CITES is done in the Committees, and thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee chairs must have great technical knowledge and skill. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, CITES benefits from active participation and leadership of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives of every region of the world. The United States will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support election of Committee Chairs and Vice Chairs of the Conference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having requisite technical knowledge and skills and also reflecting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic and cultural diversity of CITES. The United States is now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consulting with the Secretariat and the Standing Committee regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitable candidates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> V. Adoption of the Agenda and Working Programme  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See Doc. 9.1 (Rev)_Provisional Agenda for COP9; Doc. 9.2 (Rev)_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisional Working Programme for COP9; Doc. 9.2.1 (Rev)_Provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Working Program for COP9 Committee I; and Doc. 9.2.2 (Rev)_Provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Working Program for COP9 Committee II. Support adoption of an agenda and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working program that guarantees a smoothly operating meeting that addresses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all species and implementation issues; the U.S. nominee to serve as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conference Chair, if accepted by the parties, will be responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management of the overall agenda, in consultation with the Bureau.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / German Elections - October 16: East Germans reluctant to come to party - The FDP is struggling to find its constituency Mr Werner Kolmorgen is exactly the kind of person the Free Democrats, the junior partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing coalition, wants among its ranks in eastern Germany. Full of enthusiasm after the Berlin Wall collapsed five years ago, Mr Kolmorgen set up his own car repair and sales business in the small town of Teterow in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. He also joined the FDP after being a member of the Liberal Democratic party of Germany, a former 'bloc' organisation sanctioned by the east German Communist party. He even ran for local government, becoming elected deputy mayor for the tiny hamlet of Gross Wokern. But two years ago, Mr Kolmorgen, 42, left the party. 'I just gave up with the FDP. I pulled out of the party. I could not identify with it any more. It had no direction, no relevance for me,' he said. Now Mr Kolmorgen is not certain for which party he will vote in federal elections next month. The fact that this hard-working manager, who represents the fledgling Mittelstand, the small and medium-sized enterprises which formed the backbone of the FDP in western Germany, has turned his back on the party reveals a problem common to all the western parties in eastern Germany. They are having great trouble finding their natural constituencies. After German unification, the FDP had a big advantage over the other parties. It inherited two large 'bloc' parties: the Liberal Democratic party of Germany which had 120,000 members, and the National Democratic party of Germany which had a membership of 105,000. As there was with the other bloc parties, there was a massive exodus of members after 1990; there was no longer the political pressure to join a party. By then, the newly founded FDP in eastern Germany had about 130,000 members. Today, it has fewer than 31,000. 'The first difficulty is that we have no Mittelstand - no strong economic or entrepreneurial class to underpin the party,' said Mr Wulf Oehme, the FDP's manager in Berlin. About 40 per cent of its membership in the east consists of the Handwerk, or small crafts and trades; intellectuals and scientists make up about 30 per cent, the rest are pensioners and teachers. The second problem is that the FDP has no personalities. 'We had Hans-Dietrich Genscher (the former foreign minister). The easterners identified with him. They do not identify with Klaus Kinkel (the leader of the FDP and foreign minister).' Yet both Mr Oehme and Mr Kolmorgen believe these reasons do not fully explain the extraordinary demise of the FDP, which in the 1990 elections gained 11 per cent of the federal vote and more than 10 per cent in eastern Germany. But in the recent elections in Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, and Brandenburg, the party did not even gain the 5 per cent needed to enter the state parliaments. 'The party failed to establish a separate political identity, whether it was in coalition or not with governments in eastern Germany,' said Mr Oehme. 'Maybe we were always under the shadow of the Christian Democrats or the Social Democrats in the east. In any case, we failed to be different, and we failed to seek new allies.' More crucially for the FDP's political philosophy, Mr Oehme believed, east Germans simply did not identify with the party's liberal traditions and values. 'In fact, liberalism, and I suppose politics, means very little to them. They have other more important things to think about, like coping with unemployment or adapting to the tremendous changes brought about by unification. 'The east Germans do not want any more change. So when they voted for the CDU in Saxony or the SPD in Brandenburg, they opted for big majority governments based on strong personalities, not party policies. The easterners want certainty and they want leaders who will come down hard on law and order. They do not think about accountability,' said Mr Oehme. Belatedly, the FDP has tried to woo back the vote in eastern Germany. Instead of plastering the region with posters of Mr Kinkel, the FDP in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has insisted that it put its own local personalities on the election posters. But party activists admit these policies are unlikely to have much impact in time for the elections. 'At the end of the day, the economic development of eastern Germany will influence the emergence of politics based on policies rather than personalities. Then we might have a chance,' said Mr Oehme. Perhaps then it might woo back Mr Kolmorgen.</p>

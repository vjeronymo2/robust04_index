			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lafras Luitingh, founder of Executive </F> Outcomes security firm, by announcer Max du Preez on the  "Agenda" program -- live]    [Text] [Du Preez] I have with me Lafras Luitingh, one of  the founders of Executive Outcomes. Good evening, Mr. Luitingh.    [Luitingh] Good evening, Mr. du Preez.    [Du Preez] Dogs of War [preceding words in English] -- why  do  you romanticize war?    [Luitingh] I think that was a name given to us by the press,  and that is how we arrived at Dogs of War.    [Du Preez] But what is it? What I am trying to determine  what makes people like you move from one war to another? Does  it have to do with a type of personality? Is that what you do?  Are you addicted to war?    [Luitingh] I was trained in the South African Defense Force  [SADF], and I served in some or other state department, until  the closure of the CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau], after which I  found myself jobless. With my qualifications, relating to war  techniques, I tried to find work, but it was difficult until an  opportunity presented itself. We were first trained by the  South African Defense Force, then Executive Outcomes, Military  Intelligence [MI], and thereafter the Angolan army trained us.    [Du Preez] Tell us about Executive Outcomes. Who heads this  organization? Who belongs to it?    [Luitingh] Executive Outcomes was established in 1989 by  Eben  Barlow to train the SADF. This training, as I have said, was  for MI and several courses were offered to those people.    [Du Preez] Eben Barlow is himself a South African and a  former member of the Force?    [Luitingh] Eben Barlow is a former member of 32  Reconnaissance Wing, and he is also a former member of the  Force. Last year at Soyo, Executive Outcomes was offered a  contract to secure oil installations inside Soyo, and I was one  of the members hired by Executive Outcomes to do this work.  Thereafter, I became part of Executive Outcomes, and along with  Mr. (Nico Palim) of Executive Outcomes we made a proposal to the  Angolan Government to train their soldiers and restructure their  army.    [Du Preez] Who are the men who were recruited. Are these men  former CCB, Koevoet [former Namibian police counterinsurgency  unit], 32 Battalion forces?    [Luitingh] Yes, we recruited former CCB members, former  special force members, Koevoet members, 32 Battalion members,  paratroopers, and several other Defense Force division members  to assist us in training operations in certain areas.    [Du Preez] Excuse me, but I find it strange -- former  soldiers, people like you who have a proud record, as I have  heard, in the reconnaissance commando, people who have fought  against communism and who have a long history of this -- how did  it come about that when you became unemployed in the new army,  that you turned to this side? Wouldn't it have been more  predictable for you to align yourselves with the right-wing,  because I understand that there are people who have joined the  right-wing?    [Luitingh] That is possible. I don't know about this. The  reason we are in Angola....[pauses] As you will remember, UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] is  comprised of freedom fighters who fought for democracy within  Angola, and at that stage when we helped them we fought against  communism and for democracy in Angola. An election took place  in Angola, won by the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation  of Angola] and lost by UNITA. They are the democratically  elected government inside Angola, and they are recognized by,  among others, our government and the Americans. The UN declared  this election free and fair. We are now working with the  Angolans, still for the freedom of Angola.    [Du Preez] Don't you find it strange to first fight  alongside  a unit and then against it?    [Luitingh] For me, not at all. I did not enjoy working with  UNITA. I regarded them as a lot of crooks and liars. So I do  not feel strange. I can't say how others feel.    [Du Preez] Why do you say crooks and liars?    [Luitingh] Because I think Colonel Breytenbach summed it up  very well approximately two years ago, when he said they were  poor soldiers, that they were smuggling ivory and diamonds.  Jonas Savimbi murdered more of his own people -- more Angolans  that anyone else -- those who rebelled against him. He also,  among other things, during the time he lived in Luanda during  the elections, shot policemen and buried them in his garden. I  saw this happening. UNITA is a terrorist organization at this  stage and their leader is a criminal.    [Du Preez] Mr. Breytenbach says you are fighting for  communists against an old ally.    [Luitingh] Yes, I do not know what the reasons are for Mr.  Jan Breytenbach's statements. I don't think there are emotional  connections with UNITA. I think he probably has a double agenda  in this case.    [Du Preez] What motivates you to put your lives in danger in  Angola? Is it money?    [Luitingh] As I told you, we have to work to stay alive.  Angola is one of the places inside Africa where there is work  for people like us. In South Africa, at this stage, there are  10,000 soldiers deployed in kwaZulu. I believe this is a way of  life in Africa, and it is something we are good at.    [Du Preez] What is your relationship with the ANC? I  understand Col. Breytenbach also alleged that you are training  Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] hit  squads [preceding two words in English].    [Luitingh] I think this is romanticizing by Col.  Breytenbach.  We are not training anyone within the ANC. I do not have a  problem with that though. Personally, if the ANC or General  Constand Viljoen....[pauses] To work under any new  government....[pauses] If I should be asked to train anyone, I  will give that training as long as it is within the law.    [Du Preez] Excuse me, I want to try again: I did try hard to  telephone Col. Breytenbach and he was unreachable today, but he  also says the plan, this fighting strategy or whatever plan you  have there -- I know little of what you are doing in Angola --  is a stupid plan and a life-threatening plan, and he is trying  to persuade families of South Africans who have joined you, to  bring their people back. What do you say about this?    [Luitingh] I question Col. Breytenbach's motive behind this.  I also questions his methods -- trying to intimidate women and  children. It reminds me of the beginning of the century. If he  had any reason to be concerned about the people in Angola, then  he -- and I know him personally -- would have come to me to tell  me that our plan is stupid, that we will lose people, that we  shouldn't do it. He did not do this. I know that the plan he  is talking about is not one of our plans. The information he is  getting, I think, is being fed to him for certain objectives.    [Du Preez] What are you doing in Angola?    [Luitingh] At this stage we are busy with training. We are  involved in humanitarian work. We are also busy with community  projects, and we are acting as advisers to the MPLA.    [Du Preez] Did you ever come into direct conflict with  UNITA?    [Luitingh] There were several incidents in which UNITA  attacked our people. Yes, there were incidents of direct  conflict with UNITA.    [Du Preez] And the result?    [Luitingh] I don't believe that this is of interest right  now.    [Du Preez] Did you come off second best?    [Luitingh] No, definitely not. I think we are making a huge  difference inside Angola. If you can remember, approximately a  year back UNITA occupied approximately 80 percent of Angola, and  if we look at the map of Angola now, I think it I closer to  50-50. The Angolans are achieving tremendous victories. I don't  want to say this is as a result of us, but I want to believe  that we are playing an important role in helping the MPLA to  drive out the terrorist UNITA organization from Angola.    [Du Preez] Today we tried to invite the Defense Force to  come  here, but they would not. Why is it that MI, as I understand  it, and other elements of the Defense Force, and also apparently  Foreign Affairs, is unhappy about the work done by Executive  Outcomes in Angola?    [Luitingh] I think there are individuals inside the Defense  Force who are possibly jealous. I know there are certain  elements within the Defense Force who tried to get this  contract. There could also be an emotional connection between  members of the Defense Force and members of UNITA.    [Du Preez] People have been killed in Angola and there are  people missing.    [Luitingh] Yes.    [Du Preez] Why is it being kept secret?    [Luitingh] I just want to say that we are very sorry about  the people who have been killed or who are missing. That was  definitely not our plan when we went in. However, our contract  does say that people could possibly be killed. We try to  protect the families. We also try to protect individuals who are  possibly still alive. Concerning those missing -- we try to  protect them. We would like UNITA to declare publicly who these  people are, and then they could fall under the Geneva  Convention. If we announce places and names of people, then it  makes it easier for UNITA and certain people to use propaganda  against us.    [Du Preez] The fact that you are fighting as old South  African soldiers in Angola -- is this not in contravention of  the defense act?    [Luitingh] The defense act says that hired  soldiers....[pauses] Although they do not describe mercenaries  within the defense act....    [Du Preez, interrupting] Aren't you mercenaries?    [Luitingh] I would like to read from the Afrikaans language  dictionary the definition of the term mercenary, and then we can  discuss the issue, because I think there is a lot of  romanticizing about mercenaries: a soldier who is hired,  fighting only for the money and not for an ideal. If we look at  it this way, then I want to say that our work inside Angola  concerns the ideal of a free Angola, so I do not believe we can  be classified as mercenaries. It is true that we are being paid.    [Du Preez] And a good salary at that, I understand.    [Luitingh] Yes, that its correct. I want to add that I do  not  believe the SADF has an ideal for which they are fighting. I  think most of them are doing it for the money or because they  have no other choice. Maybe we should regard more than half of  the SADF as mercenaries.    [Du Preez] Are you trying to say there are no professional  soldiers in South Africa who believe in the democratization  process in the new South Africa?    [Luitingh] I'm sure there are professional soldiers who  believe that. I just doubt if all of them do.    [Du Preez] You are in a position where you still have close  contact with the security forces, especially the Defense Force.  What is your opinion of the morale in the Defense Force in South  Africa?    [Luitingh] I don't understand what you are saying.    [Du Preez] ?o you think there is still that old spirit of  being a team with a task to perform?    [Luitingh] For sure there is. The Defense Force is a very  strong organization where the morale still runs high. In the  years I have been in the Defense Force I experienced this,  qspecially in mid-level management.    [Du Preez] What about the quest for adventure? I'm now  referring to your promotion; again that is romanticizing. Is  there something like that spirit of adventure that also attracts  you? If I asked you to do office work for the same amount of  money you earn fighting in Angola, what would you choose?    [Luitingh] I think the answer is obvious. I would surely not  be able to sit in an office and do paperwork. It is not in my  nature and my character. I also believe none of the people  working for us would be able to do that type of work.    [Du Preez] When you see a corpse -- you must have seen many  corpses in your lifetime?    [Luitingh] I don't think that is repulsive enough to make me  prefer sitting in an office. I thin? my people experience more  of life than people who sit in an office all day. I think we  get the chance to experience and appreciate life.    [Du Preez] In which parts of Angola are you involved? Around  diamond and oil fields mostly?    [Luitingh] I don't think it's tactically very good to tell  you where we are involved. It might just make us more open to  attacks by....    [Du Preez, interrupting] We have also seen in the media....    [Luitingh, interrupting] But that is not all correct, and  I'm  also not going to tell you what is correct and what is not. I'm  sorry I can't answer that question.    [Du Preez] You have recently been in Angola, and I  understand  you are once again on your way back there?    [Luitingh] Yes.    [Du Preez] Could you give us an idea of what the situation  in  Angola is like on the ground -- the people, the government, the  civil administration, UNITA's strength?    [Luitingh] The problem in Angola was that the Russans  withdrew from Angola and left a big vacuum in all facets of  society. The Angolan Government is presently trying very hard  to reconstruct Angola. The society there is normal, just like  in some of our townships in South Africa. The people suffer  from hunger in Angola, especially in those areas under UNITA  control, because food distributed by the United Nations is used  by UNITA for its military ends. In Luanda itself, and in areas  where the government is in control, the local population is  relatively happy because the government is working hard to  create job opportunities and at least to feed every Angolan.  There are many foreign companies involved in development inside  Angola, and the free market system is flourishing, at least in  those areas I visited. The problem, of course, is that there is  a civil war going on, that UNITA wants to take Angola over  through a military victory, and that Savimbi wants to be a  dictator.    [Du Preez] Are there indications in your experience that  UNITA is still being supported by elements from South Africa?    [Luitingh] Yes, there are elements in South Africa that  support UNITA, but I cannot tell you who they are. I have  already tried to communicate this information to the relevant  people in South Africa, but my plan is -- as soon as the  elections are over -- to furnish this information to the new  government -- regardless of who that government is -- and to see  if it can tackle it effectively, because there are several South  Africans who are smuggling weapons to South Africa.    [Du Preez] From Angola to South Africa?    [Luitingh] From Angola -- from UNITA -- to South Africa. The  weapons are being smuggled for Inkatha, for right-wing elements.  The company involved is Trans-Namib Trading, being run by Mr.  Ben van Heerden, and I believe after this program we can see if  there is someone serious enough to stop that.    [Du Preez] It's a very dangerous allegation that you are  making. Have you approached the person concerned about this?  Is there anything else you have done regarding this  information, because arms smuggling to South Africa is one of  our biggest problems.    [Luitingh] I have evidence -- I will testify that he has  done  it.    [Du Preez] Will you be prepared to testify before the  Goldstone Commission?    [Luitingh] To tell you the truth, last year I approached the  Goldstone Commission and told them that they were very welcome  to look at any information I had. They were welcome to subject  us to investigations. They were welcome to investigate our  planes, our people. It is our company's policy not to allow any  criminal acts, and I have no problem with an investigation.    [Du Preez] How big is your force?    [Luitingh] Again I cannot tell you that, but the media says  in the region of 500 people.    [Du Preez] And that estimate is not very far off?    [Luitingh] They are close.    [Du Preez] Now these people -- as we have already said --  are  made up of former members of Koevoet, 32 Battalion, and  reconnaissance commandos. We ordinary South Africans know those  people as being hard soldiers and tenacious fighters. What is  to become of them? What is their future -- and that of those  who are still in the force -- in the new South Africa?    [Luitingh] Many of those people were lucky to get retirement  packages from the Police and the Defense Force. Unfortunately  such packages do not last a lifetime, and these people have to  look for work. The problem is that these people are not trained  for any other job, and that is a pity for the government not to  have taken the initiative to train these people in other  directions. MK members also receive packages, but they are also  being sent to the streets. Thy are also not being trained, and  I think there is going to be a real problem in South Africa if  those people do not get jobs. Unfortunately these people are  susceptible to criminal acts and are open to all radical  elements.    [Du Preez] So you are saying that an unemployed, trained  soldier spells trouble?    [Luitingh] I wouldn't say all of them, but I am saying that  they are indeed susceptible to radical groups.    [Du Preez] How do your people there in Angola feel about  South Africa's future and the coming election? What are they  going to do when they return?    [Luitingh] Most of them -- at least those that I spoke to --  are very positive about the new South Africa. We feel that if  the people can steer away from a civil war, then we can attain  many things in South Africa. I believe that within the new  South Africa a place can be made for these former soldiers, and  if there is place for them, I am convinced we can flourish,  especially in community projects.    [Du Preez] Tell me in conclusion, what are you and your men  going to when your mission in Angola has been completed? Where  are you going to? Look for another war?    [Luitingh] I hope our time in Angola will not end; we are  looking at the total development of Angola after the civil war.  Perhaps we can bring about economic progress there, not only for  Angola but also for South Africa, which would create many job  opportunities. South Africa and Angola could play a significant  role in the development of the subcontinent.</p>

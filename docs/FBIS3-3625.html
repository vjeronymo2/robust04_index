During last year's inspections here, Cheng Weigao instructed  Langfang city to build its development zone into a first-class  national development zone. This time, after hearing the report  on construction and development of the development zone made by  a leader of Langfang city, he inspected four Chinese-foreign  joint ventures on the spot, including the (Huari) furniture  corporation, a Chinese-Japanese joint venture. He was satisfied  with the construction of the development zone and praised its  good development. He encouraged Langfang city to continue to  carry forward the achievements, to guide the peasants of the  development zone to develop the tertiary industry, and to  increase investment on the basis of paying attention to  efficiency, to continuously attend to the construction of  infrastructural facilities, to ensure that overall, coordinate,  and reasonable arrangements are made, and to build the  development zone into a new-type.</p>

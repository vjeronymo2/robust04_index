			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Observer: Floored Arcane world, the financial futures business. The latest advert for the French exchange Matif depicts a helmet, accompanied by a truly mystifying slogan to the effect that 'protecting your assets is not as difficult as you may think . . . Before grabbing your helmet, give us a call'. Head suitably naked, Observer rang in search of a translation. Just what did this particular piece of headgear have to do with a French franc-denominated option or any other of the market's weird and wonderful wares? 'It is a medieval 'at,' a voice in the communications department explained patiently. Puzzled silence from London. 'You know what an 'elmet is? I don't know what your problem is.' Ah well.</p>

Thomas hit another three-point shot with 1:03 remaining.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a case of me trying to break open a big game," Thomas said. "It was  really the only shot I had. They had great defense. You have to give them  credit."  </P> <P> The defending champions, bidding to become only the third franchise to repeat  as NBA champions, need one victory to match the Lakers' record for consecutive  playoff wins set last year.  </P> <P> Thomas had 23 points and James Edwards scored 32 for Detroit.  </P> <P> Gerald Wilkins of the Knicks, held to one-of-13 shooting in the Pistons' 112-77  victory in the first game, scored 24 points. Charles Oakley had 22 and Patrick  Ewing added 20 for New York.  </P> <P> It was the fifth consecutive game the Pistons held the opposition under 100  points. Detroit has held playoff opponents under 100 in 20 of 22 games.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 9 (AFP) -- Finland and Sweden, both  traditionally neutral countries, signed up Monday [9 May] for  the Partnership for Peace programme of military cooperation  between NATO and the former Soviet bloc.    Both countries said they were particularly interested in  contributing to the peacekeeping and search-and-rescue function  of the Partnership, which was launched by the North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation in January.    Finnish Prime Minister Heikki Haavisto stressed that  Helsinki  was not abandoning its neutral stance. "Through participation  in Partnership activities, Finland is not seeking a new defence  solution. Finland pursues a policy of military nonalliance and  independent defence," he said.    Swedish Foreign Minister Baroness Margaretha af Ugglas said  the Partnership would promote "political stability through  cooperation and a gradual convergence of attitudes and  behaviour."    Both ministers stressed the role of the Partnership in  strengthening the peacekeeping abilities of the United Nations  and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).    Welcoming the two ministers, NATO deputy director-general  Sergio Balanzino said Finland and Sweden would also set an  example through their "longstanding tradition of democratic  control of their defence forces."    The Partnership for Peace is a flexible programme ranging  from the simple sharing of military training techniques to  participation in full-scale military manoeuvres and peacekeeping  exercises. But it stops short of offering full NATO membership  any time soon.    The programme also seeks to restore civilian democratic  control over the armed forces of the former communist  dictatorships.    Sweden and Finland, the first non-NATO members on the  Western  side of the old Iron Curtain, bring the total number of non-NATO  participants to 17.    The others, in order of joining, are Romania, Lithuania,  Poland, Estonia, Hungary, Ukraine, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia,  Albania, the Czech Republic, Moldova, Georgia, Slovenia and  Azerbaijan.    Russia is expected to join the Partnership soon, but is  still  quibbling over details.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Northern banks to offer own financial services The three UK banking subsidiaries of National Australia Bank - Yorkshire Bank, Clydesdale Bank and Northern Bank - are to become 'bancassurers', selling their own financial services policies through their branch networks from late next year. Their move marks a further sharpening of competition among high street financial institutions to sell life insurance and investment products to their retail banking customers. The UK's two largest building societies - Halifax and Nationwide - are scheduled to launch wholly-owned life subsidiaries next year. The products offered by the three banks will all be designed, processed and underwritten within National Australia Life, part of the parent organisation. But they will almost certainly be branded and marketed as products provided by each bank to its own customers. Final approval for the project was given recently and the group has begun recruiting for its customer service centre in Glasgow. At present, the three banks offer independent financial advice for life and investment products, but this is a small-scale and specialised service, involving only about 100 staff. The intention is to meet the financial needs of most of the banks' 3.5m customers with a relatively simple range of products. Independent advice will still be offered as a separate, niche service for those whose circumstances are more complex. Mr Ross Pinney, chief executive of National Australia Life, said he expected the banks to be able to meet the financial needs of a much higher proportion of their customers than at present. 'Many of our customers are not coming to us for financial advice, because they are not even aware that we offer life insurance products,' he said. The group should benefit not just via an extra stream of income coming through the branch networks, but also through keeping all the profit from manufacturing the policies as well as distributing them.</p>

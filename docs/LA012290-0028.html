			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Jones Gets Legion of Honor: Quincy Jones was awarded the French Legion of Honor  Sunday for his musical contribution as a trumpeter, composer, arranger and  record producer. In presenting the medal to Jones, Thierry de Beauce, secretary  of state for international cultural relations, called Jones "a man who  reconciles the rhythms of rock, jazz and bop."  </P> <P> Jones, 56, is well-known on both sides of the Atlantic. He first went to France  in 1953 at age 19 with Lionel Hampton's orchestra. His career since then  includes collaboration with some of America and France's greatest artists --  Aretha Franklin, George Benson, Jacques Brel, Michel Legrand, Miles Davis, Ray  Charles and Charles Aznavour. As a record producer, Jones was responsible for  two of the most successful albums of the 1980s -- Michael Jackson's "Thriller"  and "Bad." After six years of producing, Jones released his own album, "Back on  the Block," which has risen to 16th place on U.S. charts since its December  release. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

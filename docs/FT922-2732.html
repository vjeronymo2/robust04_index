			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Japanese MPs end long fight to let troops serve abroad JAPAN'S DIET yesterday ended a long legislative battle and passed a controversial bill to allow Japanese troops to serve in United Nations peacekeeping forces. The bill, which has caused deep divisions in Japan, authorises the first despatch of Japanese soldiers overseas since the second world war. Their first assignment is likely to be on the UN's peacekeeping mission in Cambodia. The bill was passed by 329 votes to 17 in the Diet's 512-seat lower house in spite of intense opposition by the Social Democratic and Communist parties. The social democrats boycotted the proceedings in a last-ditch effort to block the bill and tendered their resignations en masse. Mr Makoto Tanabe, Social Democratic party chairman, said the bill would leave a 'deep scar' on Japan. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, hailed the bill, saying Japan would be able to send personnel on UN missions. The bill's origins date back to the Gulf crisis, when the government mooted the idea of sending Japanese troops to serve in non-combat roles in the US-led coalition forces. But the proposals were dropped after arousing public protest, with many Japanese saying that sending troops abroad, even on UN missions, would infringe the country's pacifist constitution. Asian countries, notably China, also expressed concern about a possible revival of Japanese militarism. New proposals were eventually passed by the lower house last December. The bill authorises Japan to send up to 2,000 troops on UN missions. But they may only serve in non-combatant roles unless the Diet revises the legislation to allow for front-line duties. The ruling Liberal Democratic party tried to accommodate opposition parties' views by watering down the bill. But as parties jockeyed for position with an eye on elections to the upper house at the end of July, the opposition resorted to filibustering with a slow-voting technique called the ox-walk in which members edged towards the ballot box an inch at a time. A poll conducted at the weekend by TBS, a tele-vision station, showed 55 per cent against the bill and 32 per cent in favour, with the rest undecided. After all-night sessions, the bill passed the upper house and was returned to the lower house for the approval of amendments. Yesterday the Social Democratic party changed tack and all 137 of its members tendered their resignations to the Speaker. It was unclear last night whether these resignations would be accepted.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN DIGITAL RECOVERS FROM 1ST-QUARTER LOSS  </P> <P> Western Digital Corp. rebounded from a first-quarter loss, with earnings of  $8.6 million for the second quarter ended Dec. 31, though the profits were down  from the $12.7 million recorded for the corresponding period a year ago.  </P> <P> The Irvine-based personal computer components company reported revenue of  $264.9 million, the second-highest quarterly figure in the firm's history,  contrasted with $258.4 million in the second quarter last year.  </P> <P> The earnings figure included a one-time gain of $1.1 million from the purchase  of debentures and $1.1 million in tax benefits from the first-quarter loss.  </P> <P> The recovery from the first-quarter loss of $2.7 million exceeded analysts'  expectations and was largely attributed to the success of the company's  3.5-inch intelligent disk drives. The company said its communications products  operations also did well, but problems remained in the imaging sector, which  makes computer graphics products.  </P> <P> Roger W. Johnson, chairman and chief executive, said he was "pleased with the  direction, not pleased with the absolute level" of the company's earnings. He  also noted "very nice improvements" in the balance sheet, as inventories and  receivables declined even as revenues climbed.  </P> <P> Karen Payne, an analyst with Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer in Philadelphia,  said earnings were "a bit better than everybody expected," and lauded the  "impressive" performance of the disk drive products. She added, however, that  there are "still some problems to work through."  </P> <P> "The real problem is that they have five different product lines and they've  never been able to get them all firing at the same time," Payne said. She also  said that increased competition in the disk drive area might hurt profit  margins over the next year.  </P> <P> Mark Matheson of Cruttenden &amp; Co., a Newport Beach investment firm, said  the quarter "could have been a blockbuster" were it not for the problems with  the imaging business. Western Digital acknowledged that its microcomputer  products unit -- including the imaging, communications and systems logic  products -- was unprofitable, largely as a result of poor sales and low margins  in the imaging business.  </P> <P> Johnson said he hoped the microcomputer products division would be profitable  by year's end.  </P> <P> A company spokesman said the company expected to sustain the strong performance  in disk drives, with substantial increases in orders for the next several  quarters. Johnson also said the firm was succeeding in its effort to get  customers -- primarily personal computer manufacturers -- to buy groups of  products from Western Digital.  </P></p>

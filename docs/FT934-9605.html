			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Whitehall fights a war of words: A look at the Ministry of Defence's campaign to stave off cuts in its budget AIR CHIEF Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, chief of the air staff, is not a man given to dramatic public statements. So when he accuses the Treasury of running a 'disreputable' campaign to discredit the services, Westminster sits up and takes notice. Addressing the Air League on Monday, Sir Michael accused the Treasury of portraying the military as 'fat, inefficient and poorly organised' in order to lay the groundwork for swingeing defence cuts in the Budget. Sir Michael named no names, and he apologised yesterday - after pressure from the Ministry of Defence - for any embarrassment he may have caused ministers. But his outburst raises a series of questions about the role of the Treasury, the service chiefs and their political masters at the defence ministry in the Budget debate. Defence sources pointed the finger of blame squarely at Mr Michael Portillo, the steadfastly rightwing chief secretary to the Treasury, who has argued strongly for public spending restraint. Mr Portillo last night denied any involvement in Treasury leaks. But officials were pointing out that there was nothing unusual about this year's public spending round, which followed much the same course of leak and counter-leak as those of previous years. If battle was joined with greater verve than is usual, it was because the defence budget is one of the few big areas which could be cut to keep public spending within the agreed control total of Pounds 254bn. In the event, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, fought off demands for cuts of up to Pounds 1bn this year, and settled for a reduction in the defence budget of Pounds 1.3bn over three years. The agreement was preceded by a great deal of horsetrading, during which the Treasury drew journalists' attention to various military inefficiencies which could be exploited to yield savings. These ranged from the comic to the dramatic. One minister, for example, suggested that worthwhile savings could be achieved if the services gave up their separate facilities for making false teeth. The defence chiefs seem to have been most upset by suggestions that there were too many senior officers - particularly in the navy, said to have more than 40 admirals who never go to sea. But while the Treasury was quick to exploit some of these suggestions in its campaign for spending cuts, the defence chiefs are making a mistake in identifying Mr Portillo, or his civil servants, as sources. The story that most angered the service chiefs - the revelation that lower ranks had borne the brunt of reductions in staffing since 1970 - was based on freely available information published by the defence ministry. Much of the other material which upset the forces came from a cabinet minister from another department who has thought deeply about defence issues but has no contact with the Treasury. In short, there was no organised Treasury campaign to undermine the defence forces. But there was a behind-the-scenes campaign by the defence department to mobilise backbench Conservative opinion against the proposed cuts. That campaign, which culminated in a threatened rebellion by Tory MPs, was clearly assisted by a much-publicised visit by Sir Michael and the other defence chiefs to complain about the potential impact of cuts in spending.</p>

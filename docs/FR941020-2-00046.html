			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart J_Patient Test Management for Moderate or High Complexity Testing, or Both <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ASHI has revised its requirements to equal the CLIA requirements at &sect;&sect;493.1101 through 493.1111 on an overall basis. We have determined that ASHI's requirements are more stringent in that they require the laboratory to obtain written authorization within 30 days for verbal orders on all referral testing, whereas CLIA requires the laboratory to maintain documentation of efforts made to obtain written authorization within 30 days of the oral request. Also, the test requisition or its equivalent must include the date and time a specimen is collected, and the source of the specimen. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart K_Quality Control for Tests of Moderate or High Complexity, or Both <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The quality control (QC) requirements of ASHI have been evaluated against the high complexity requirements of the CLIA regulations, as ASHI has determined that it will treat all testing as high complexity. We have determined that ASHI's requirements, when taken as a whole, are equal to or more stringent than the CLIA requirements. The specific areas of QC that are more stringent are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Procedures are signed, approved and dated by the laboratory director annually; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Files for all internal and external quality control must be permanent; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Compliance with all Federal, State and local laws regarding employee health and safety; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Standards for parentage testing; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Standards specifically addressing nucleic acid analysis (applicable to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) testing); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Standards specific for flow cytometry (applicable to MHC testing and lymphocyte phenotyping as applied to transplants). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart M_Personnel for Moderate and High Complexity Testing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have determined that ASHI's personnel requirements, when taken as a whole, are equal to or more stringent than the CLIA requirements. ASHI has adopted the director, technical supervisor and clinical consultant requirements and will recognize all boards that are approved by HHS as means to meet these requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASHI requires that the laboratory director must be available on site commensurate with workload, which is more stringent than CLIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

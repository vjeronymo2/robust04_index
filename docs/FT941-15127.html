			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Insurers may be forced to accept new watchdog The government is drawing up plans to force life insurers to be regulated by the Personal Investment Authority, the new City watchdog due to come into being this year. The decision of three leading companies to oppose plans for the authority, which is intended to act as the self-regulatory organisation for the entire retail financial sector, has infuriated ministers. They have interpreted the move as an attempt to destabilise the proposed regime. Ministers are planning to close a loophole in existing legislation that life insurers could use to avoid being regulated by the PIA. They could opt to be directly regulated by the Securities and Investments Board, which would undermine the PIA's authority. If companies opt to be regulated by SIB, the government is expected to ask the board to subcontract the responsibility for regulation back to the PIA. If the life insurers continue to refuse to acknowledge the PIA's authority, ministers are prepared to bring forward legislation forcing companies to be regulated by the appropriate self-regulatory organisation. The creation of the PIA is central to the proposals put forward by Mr Andrew Large, SIB's chairman, to improve regulation. The proposals have been strongly backed by Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary. In a debate in the Commons last week, Mr Nelson warned that if the existing system failed to protect investors, 'the House will have to look at it again. I do not have a closed mind'. The latest exchanges about future regulation of the sector arose after a statement was issued by Standard Life, one of the UK's largest life insurance companies. It announced the withdrawal of its support from the plans for the PIA, on the basis that as only nine of the 19 directors would be active industry practitioners, the body would not be a truly self-regulatory organisation, and that statutory regulation was therefore preferable. Standard Life's decision is understood to have caused particular anger within government. According to a Whitehall official, ministers were surprised that Mr Norman Lessels, Standard Life's chairman, allowed his deputy managing director, Mr Jim Stretton, to resign from the PIA. Mr Lessels is also on SIB's board. Some officials believe that Mr Lessels' position on SIB's board could become untenable if Standard Life does not drop its opposition to the PIA.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Bombardier earnings up 33.7% in first quarter Rising deliveries of its 50-passenger regional jet and strong demand for snow-mobiles and watercraft brought a 33.7 per cent gain in first-quarter net profit for Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace and transport equipment group. Sales rose 27 per cent. Bombardier earned CDollars 52.4m (USDollars 37.9m), or 31 cents a share, against CDollars 39.2m or 25 cents a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1.17bn against CDollars 993m. The strong start to fiscal 1995 followed a 30 per cent profits gain in fiscal 1994 to CDollars 175.6m, or CDollars 1.12, from CDollars 132.8m, or 85 cents. The aerospace business, including Canadair, de Havilland, Short Brothers in Northern Ireland and Lear Jet in the US, now represents about half the total business. Bombardier is preparing a 70-seat version of the regional jet and a larger 70-seat commuter turboprop. Air Littoral of France has ordered two more regional jets, bringing firm orders to 71, with 29 delivered and 71 options. A major US order is expected shortly. Bombardier is increasing regional jet production rate to three a month and deliveries in 1996 will reach 46 aircraft. Including transport equipment, Bombardier's order book stands at around CDollars 9bn. A slow recovery is expected in the low-margin rail equipment sector this year, partly due to a settlement being reached last December of a dispute over specialised Channel Tunnel rail cars.</p>

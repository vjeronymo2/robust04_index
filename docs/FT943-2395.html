			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Germans raise economic hopes The German economy is growing without inflationary problems, according to separate reports published yesterday by the Bundesbank and the German economics ministry. The reports agree that the 2.8 per cent growth in gross domestic product in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier, was unexpectedly strong. They added that favourable orders, industrial production and housing construction point to a continuing upward trend. Citing favourable implications of Germany's moderate wage increases, the Bundesbank foresees an export-led recovery, but calls for continued vigilance on wages to keep inflation down, currently 3 per cent in western Germany and 3.4 per cent in the east. An August survey of 400 companies by the Ifo economic research institute was also upbeat. Companies surveyed expected a 2.75 per cent increase in production this year and 3.5 per cent in 1995, as well as strong growth in the investment goods sector. Although these assessments will help Chancellor Helmut Kohl's campaign for the October 16 elections, neither of the official reports had good news on the jobs front. Unemployment rose sharply after the west German economy fell into recession last year and despite recent growth and moderate wage claims, jobless totals have so far failed to drop.</p>

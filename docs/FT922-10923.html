			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Gun-runners target old Soviet borders: Financial Times reporters investigate a disturbing story of arms and the Isle of Man A SMALL company registered in the Isle of Man is at the centre of attempts by arms merchants to use the Baltic republics as conduits for illegal shipments of weapons from the former Soviet Union. Two consignments containing 40,000 Russian-made small arms with a potential market value of Dollars 4m were stopped recently in Estonia and Finland. Both of them, described by arms industry experts as 'large orders almost certainly bound for re-export', were addressed to Kennford Enterprises, an Isle of Man-registered non-resident company. The seizures have fuelled concerns that the break-up of the Soviet Union, with the lack of border controls being exploited both by hard-pressed arms producers and by soldiers selling their weapons, could lead to a flood of illegal arms finding their way to terrorist groups around the world, including the IRA. Customs officials said the guns seized in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, were 'probably not the first and not the last'. Estonia appealed to a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels last month for equipment and assistance to control its borders. Containers loaded with 14,982 Makarov automatic pistols were discovered on February 11 by Estonian customs in the port area of Tallinn. Shipment papers described the contents as 7,200 'sports and training pistols', bound for Kennford Enterprises in Finland. Estonia's state prosecutor is investigating the case. The guns came from a factory at Izhevsk, about 500 miles east of Moscow, which makes hunting guns and military pistols. The city is the centre of Russia's small-arms industry and a separate factory there makes the renowned Kalashnikov AK-47 rifle. Within days a second shipment of 25,000 similar pistols were seized by Finnish customs officers in Helsinki. The automatic pistols are standard issue for the armies of the former Warsaw Pact. Kennford Enterprises was incorporated in the Isle of Man in April, 1991. Its two shareholders and directors are listed as Artur Pukhov, of Tallinn, and his wife Lubov Pukhov, of Helsinki. The Financial Times has established, however, that these are merely forwarding addresses - the inhabitant of the Helsinki address expressed surprise that it was being used for this purpose by Kennford. The Pukhovs, both Russians, operate from Yaroslavl, north-east of Moscow. The company was set up by International Company Services, a Manx company formation business. Mr Philip Robinson of International Company Services said the request to form Kennford had come from a third party and not from the Pukhovs. He declined to identify the third party, but said his company received a lot of business from this source. Speaking from Yaroslavl, Mr Pukhov told the FT that the order he had handled was for sports guns but that the identity of the buyer was a 'commercial secret'. He said that the fact that the sports guns had been replaced by Makarovs was 'not my responsibility.' 'I have never seen the merchandise and never checked it,' Mr Pukhov said through an interpreter. He said Kennford Enterprises mainly sold oil and rare metals, including scandium which is bought by the pharmaceutical industry. Draft proposals for regulating the large number of non-resident companies in the Isle of Man are expected to go before the island's parliament next month. A separate seizure of arms and anti-tank weapons apparently destined for Armenian troops in Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan, highlighted the problem of Soviet troops based in the Baltic republics selling their weapons. Under UK law, British companies can obtain Department of Trade licences to import and export small arms of the kind seized in Estonia and Finland. The countries with which trade in these weapons is banned are South Africa, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Yugoslavia, and Argentina. Britain's Department of Trade and Industry said that the exports of arms from the former Soviet republics was a 'matter for those countries not us'. The UK Defence Ministry confirmed that it had been approached by the Estonians on the small arms issue and said that it was anxious to ensure that future trade in them was properly controlled.

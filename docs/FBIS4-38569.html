			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Serhiy Osyka, deputy minister of external </F> economic relations, by Volodymyr Skanya; place and date not  given: "The World Trade Organization Is the United Nations  Economic Organization" -- three first paragraphs are HOLOS  UKRAYINY introduction]    [Text] The phrase "the world is opening Ukraine for  itself," which is currently very popular, to my regret, is to a  great extent associated with the trips of our folklore groups  abroad and the participation of the Ukrainian servicemen in the  UN peacekeeping actions in Yugoslavia. However, very important  developments -- enabling Ukraine not only "to expose" itself to  the world but to occupy a prominent place in the international  community -- are often left unnoticed by Ukrainian society.    Recently, an event of international importance took place in  Marrakech, Morocco: Representatives of more than 140 states of  the world -- GATT members -- along with representatives of such  international organizations as the United Nations, the World  Bank and the IMF, signed an agreement stipulating the  establishment of the World Organization of Trade. In addition,  they signed over 20 economic pacts. Ukraine also participated  in this meeting, as a state which is going to become a GATT  member.    Ukrainian representative to GATT Serhiy Osyka, deputy  minister of external economic relations, who was a member of the  Ukrainian Government delegation, kindly agreed to fill the  information vacuum regarding this event.    [Osyka] What happened in Marrakech, is, in fact, the  legalization of a new global legal order in trade, tariffs,  customs, investment, and other sectors of international economic  relations, which was achieved by GATT members after almost 50  years of its existence. The World Organization of Trade is, as  I can put it, the United Nations Economic Organization.    Marrakech-94 enjoys similar international significance as  San-Francisco and Bretton Woods-44 when the United Nations and  the World Bank were established.    [Skanya] How closely is Ukraine "linked" with this  organization?    [Osyka] You know that participants in the GATT session  discussed and supported a Ukrainian application regarding its  membership within the GATT on 17 December 1993. Currently, a  memorandum -- regarding the foreign economic status of Ukraine  -- which is a key element in the process of joining the GATT, is  in the works. Its first version has already been drafted. In  general, this memorandum is not simply a document. It addresses  a series of urgent measures that must be implemented. It  includes an analysis of the genuine competitiveness of the  Ukrainian industrial and agricultural sectors; the bringing of  the Ukrainian standards into conformity with international norms  to simplify international trade and restore fair costs of the  Ukrainian goods; the drafting of the normative-legal and  administrative-organizational basis for the national export  control; and the bringing of the Ukrainian legislation into  conformity with the norms and principles of GATT, including the  adjustment of trade, customs, tarifsf, investment, taxation,  finance, banking, and other procedures with international  standards.    [Skanya] When can Ukraine actually become a full member of  the GATT and the World Trade Organization? What can this give  us?    [Osyka] As a rule, everything depends on the work of our  legislators; we should do this as quickly as possible. The  point is that 125 states -- accounting for more than 90 percent  of the global trading volume -- are members of the signed  agreements and conventions. Meanwhile, 21 states -- including  Russia and Belarus -- are waiting to join GATT and the World  Trade Organization. At the same time, only a small number of  states stay on the sidelines of GATT and the World Trade  Organization. The longer we are outsiders, the more difficult  it will be for us to build normal economic relations with the  world.    As a rule, cooperation can be developed through direct  agreements between the states, but this process is so  complicated and time-consuming that it cannot satisfy us. I can  cite an example: Over the years of its independence, Ukraine  managed to obtain a most-favored-nation trade status with only  three dozen states. When it becomes a member of GATT and the  World Trade Organization, this issue could be resolved  simultaneously with all GATT members.    Moreover, according to experts' estimates, we expect that  Russia will receive a most-favored-nation trade status by the  end of this year. If we do not manage to join the World Trade  Organization together with Russia, our economic relations will  be build on a basis that could be unfavorable to us. On the  contrary, membership in this organization will lift a great  number of problems in Russian-Ukrainian tariffs, trade, customs,  investment, and other relations, what will enable us to  establish a free trade zone and customs unions. All these  processes will be based on general standards that have been  tested internationally. Again, we should not have to reinvent  the wheel.    In addition, this will enable us to establish a mechanism  for  economic integration with the key trading partners in the West  -- the member-states of the former Council for Mutual Economic  Assistance (Poland, Hungary, Czekhia, Slovakia....) -- which  became GATT members in the 1970's.    [Skanya] In a word, is the process of joining GATT and the  World Trade Organization a key step in our economic policy?    [Osyka] Yes, and not only from an economic viewpoint. The  political importance of this step is obvious. The international  community meets us halfway and intends to help us. In addition,  the United States is ready to provide us with the technical  documentation which we should submit to join GATT and the World  Trade Organization. This documentation includes not only  consultations and advice by U.S. experts, but also financial  substantiation for bringing the Ukrainian legislation in  agreement with the GATT principles and norms and the  establishment of a national system of export control. We are  already working on this project.</p>

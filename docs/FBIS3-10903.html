			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Fruit Exporters Association President Ronald Bown  and Fruits Producers Federation President Ricardo Ariztia have  expressed satisfaction over the decision handed down on 24  February by the Philadelphia Appellate Court rejecting the  jurisdiction immunity requested by the U.S. Government in the  case of the "poisoned grapes" case. They said the only concrete  possibility now is to continue the trial "come what may."    The two executives discard the possibility of reaching  agreement with the Clinton administration. During recent  negotiations with the Chilean Foreign Ministry, the U.S.  Administration offered grants and general benefits that do not  compensate the damage suffered by that sector. They noted they  have not accepted this solution.    Ariztia said the judicial process involves about 2,200  producers and 108 export companies. He added that the private  sector has invested more than $3 million in the legal process  and that enough resources are left to carry on for at least one  more year. Bown said the private fruit producers and exporters  have demanded an indemnity of $212 million, while some shipping  lines like the Sudamericana and importers in the United States  want $230 million.

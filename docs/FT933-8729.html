			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian sugar crop damaged THE WORST drought in more than 50 years in Brazil's northeast has brought heavy losses to the region's sugar cane crop and industry officials predict declines of up to 45 per cent, Reuter reports from Maceio. The northeast accounts for most of the country's sugar exports and many officials said it would not be able to fulfil export quotas. Mr Jose Carlos Maranhao, commercial director at the Santo Antonio sugar refinery in Maceio, the capital of Alagoas, said the state's 1993-94 cane crop would fall 33 per cent to 14m tonnes. Pernambuco, the regions' other sugar state, has also been affected.</p>

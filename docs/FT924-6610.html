			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Storehouse returns to black STRONG SALES growth and higher gross margins returned Storehouse to profit in the 28 weeks to October 10. The slimmed-down group, which includes the BhS and Mothercare chains, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.1m, a Pounds 17m turnround from the Pounds 13.9m loss in the previous first half. Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman, said: 'We remain confident that our underlying trading performance will show a significant improvement for the year as a whole'. The profit news surprised the stock market, which had been expecting a break-even position, and pushed the shares higher. They settled back to show a 1p gain on the day at 186p. The share price has risen from a low of 85p last December. Mr David Dworkin, chief executive, said Storehouse had been transformed from a financial holding company to a focused retailer. Trading conditions were still tough, but Storehouse could now achieve 'real and consistent growth.' Group sales rose from Pounds 573m to Pounds 617m. Sales in the two main chains rose by 10 per cent on a comparable store basis, without any help from price increases. BhS made an operating profit of Pounds 10.5m, against a Pounds 7m loss previously, while Mothercare turned a Pounds 2.9m deficit into Pounds 1.7m profit. The results were held back by losses of Pounds 7.8m from Richards, Habitat and Blazer. The first two chains have since been sold and the disposal of Blazer is planned. Associate income fell to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 2.6m) due to the timing of sales in the property joint venture. Mr Dworkin said the associate contribution for the year should match last time's Pounds 4.9m. Interest took Pounds 3.1m, against a Pounds 600,000 gain previously. But the group is due to receive cash totalling Pounds 100m from the Richards and Habitat disposals, which should give it net cash by the year end. At the half-year stage net debt stood at Pounds 80.5m (Pounds 82m), although this is a seasonal peak for borrowings in the run up to Christmas. There was a net charge below the line of Pounds 20.4m relating to the disposals, and after a maintained interim dividend of 2.5p, there was a net loss of Pounds 27m. Earnings per share were 0.5p (2.3p deficit). COMMENT The Storehouse recovery is well and truly underway. There is now a momentum to sales which should carry on even as BhS comes up against tougher comparisons. Margin improvements may slow as the emphasis on value-for-money increases, though the reduction in mark downs is encouraging. Much of the immediate recovery is in the share price. With forecasts of Pounds 40m pre-tax for the current year (against Pounds 15.8m) and perhaps Pounds 65m next, the prospective p/e is up with events at about 28, falling to 17. But the longer term potential is clear in the poor job BhS is still doing in many departments, while Mothercare is two years behind BhS in its revitalisation.</p>

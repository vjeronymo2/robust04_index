			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Coca-Cola Amatil advances Coca-Cola Amatil, the Australia-based soft drinks company which is controlled by Coca-Cola of the US but is also listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, yesterday reported a 45 per cent rise in profits after tax but before abnormals, to ADollars 95.4m (USDollars 68.5m), writes Nikki Tait. In the previous year, it made ADollars 65.9m. Revenues were slightly lower, due to disposals, at ADollars 1.99bn against ADollars 2.17bn and operating profits virtually flat, at ADollars 198.4m. However, the after-tax figure was helped by lower interest charges, and the company also benefited from a ADollars 234.5m extraordinary surplus following the sale of its snack food operations to United Biscuits. Bottom-line profits, therefore, stood at ADollars 329.9m compared with ADollars 65.9m a year ago.</p>

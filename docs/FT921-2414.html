			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (52): Medical company moves to an open system - User view MEDICAL pathology company JS Pathology had to find a system which could deal with large volumes of data storage when the time came to move from a proprietary system to an open system,* writes Claire Gooding. Its existing Wang system ran a US-developed package, specially developed for its business. Now its choice of a relational database has enabled it to cope with its existing workload, and even consider broadening its services. JS Pathology carries out tests for hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and other organisations such as insurance companies, dealing with 2,000 requests daily, around half a million annually. This workload put performance considerations high on the list of requirements for the system. While the company wanted to re-create the specialised functions of its existing system, information technology manager David Taylor was also looking for integrated accounting and other applications, all based around a database. 'We wanted to move from proprietary to open systems, and also replace third generation languages, such as Basic, with a fourth generation language (4GL) which would serve us into the 1990s,' he explains. The selection of hardware was based on looking at all the options available under Unix, and the main Unix database suppliers, Oracle, Ingres, and Informix. Cost and performance considerations won the business for Informix, in a contract worth in total (including hardware) around Pounds 750,000. JS Pathology dealt direct with Informix, and also used its training services for its development staff. JS Pathology has done all its own development, with an in-house staff of eight development staff. Around 120 people use the resulting applications, with only the development staff having direct access to the database. 'We didn't want to give users access. If there was a genuine requirement, we add a new applications. 'We don't plan to give users access through the SQL language, though we might develop smaller sub-systems. We want users to get on with their jobs, not worry about how to to use SQL.' He sees clear business benefits from his choice of a relational database - 'we have widened the scope of products we can offer, and as well as developing a better service to our users, we can serve our clients better. 'We've always managed to cope, but a lot of applications which were cumbersome are now a lot easier. 'The choice of a Unix system makes communications a lot easier, and means we have a wide choice if we want to expand the network. He adds: 'There are great benefits in the relational approach to storing information: for instance, we can use SQL for ad hoc queries for management, and as a development tool to produce prototype applications.' *See buzzwords, page two.</p>

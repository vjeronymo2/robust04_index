			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Attitudes harden in Gaza: Conditions worsening in the occupied territories DR MAHMOUD ZAHAR, a prominent supporter of the Islamic fundamentalist movement in the Gaza Strip, shed few tears last week over the fate of a 15-year-old Israeli schoolgirl stabbed to death in a Tel Aviv suburb a few days before by a young unemployed Palestinian. In fact, he was indignant. Why was the world so concerned about the killing of one Israeli girl when, for years, countless Palestinian children had been killed by Israelis occupying their land, he asked. 'We do not advocate killing children, but this is a war.' As Israelis celebrate the 25th anniversary of their victory in the Six-Day War of June 1967, there is ample evidence of the iron fist which the Israeli army deploys to keep order in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem - and of the bitter resistance to it. In the Jabalya refugee camp in Gaza, the sandy alleyways between the squalid dwellings are scorched black by burning roadblocks thrown up almost daily by rioting youths. A watchtower reminiscent of a prison camp and surrounded by high fencing was erected recently to help the troops keep a lid on the unrest. 'The level of frustration on the ground has substantially increased,' said a foreign aid worker with several years of experience in Gaza. 'The economic situation has got worse and worse. This is all contributing to a growing sense of helplessness and frustration.' People in Gaza talk about a watershed in the tiny, overcrowded territory after the Gulf war early last year. They say army policy became tougher against a population that had sided with Iraq against the US and its allies, including Israel. The authorities imposed much tougher conditions on Gazans working in Israel, reducing numbers and weakening the main prop of the impoverished Gazan economy. The population of Gaza has almost doubled since 1967 to 750,000, of whom 550,000 are refugees registered with UNRWA, the UN's Palestinian refugee welfare organisation. It is projected to double again in 20 years. The workforce totals about 120,000. Until the Gulf war, almost half depended on jobs in Israel - now their number is below 50,000 and may be as low as 30,000. Given unemployment of 30-40 per cent, this has knocked a hole in Gaza's income and is set to worsen. The mass unrest which dominated the first three years of the intifada, the uprising against Israeli rule which erupted in 1987, faded to some extent - but three other deadly trends have developed. First, the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas, a newly powerful force in the strip, adopted the use of arms against the occupation. Like the Palestine Liberation Organisation which it rivals, Hamas had eschewed the use of guns, chiefly for fear of provoking an even tougher response from the Israelis and losing the support of international public opinion. Now its fighters frequently ambush troops and it backs attacks on individual Israelis. 'Did public opinion liberate our land? Did public opinion restore out rights?' asks Dr Zahar rhetorically. Second, the army stepped up its use of undercover squads, which have shot dead some 40 Palestinians in the past year. Third, there was intensification of a trend of brutal killings by Palestinians of compatriots accused of collaboration with Israel. For the PLO, this has been a testing time. The Madrid peace conference of last October, where Palestinians put their case with unprecedented force, won considerable support in Gaza, home of Dr Haidar Abdel Shafi, head of the Palestinian delegation. Since then, though, the slow pace of the negotiations has put pressure on the PLO to show results or lose further support to Hamas, which rejects the peace process. Mr Awad Mabhouh, a political activist and resident of Jabalya, says most Gazans realised the PLO had little choice but to join the peace talks and they supported them. But they also applaud the gunmen of Hamas for keeping pressure on Israel. He still believes that a Palestinian state will be created. A key question in Gaza, where the vast majority of refugees came in 1948 from within what is now Israel, is whether that state should be limited to the West Bank and Gaza, as the PLO concedes, or include all the territory between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River, as Hamas says. Mr Mabhouh says his aged father, still holding the key to his house (long since destroyed) near the Israeli city of Ashqelon, would never give up the claim to return. But the son is more pragmatic: 'If the PLO says we should settle for compensation, we will accept it instead of going back.'</p>

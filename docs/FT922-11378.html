			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Books: Lord Byron's unpretty Polly LORD BYRON'S DOCTOR by Paul West Serpent's Tail Pounds 9.99, 277 pages THE BUTCHER'S BOY by Patrick McCabe Picador Pounds 14.99, 215 pages INHERITANCE by David Pryce-Jones Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 14.99, 252 pages Fiction BYRONIC memoirs are becoming a new literary genre. Lord Byron's Doctor first appeared in the US in 1989, the same year that Robert Nye's Memoirs of Lord Byron came out here. Mab's Daughters, by the Shelleyean academic Judith Chernaik, added the female points of view, with imagined extracts from the diaries of four of the women in Shelley's life, one of whom was Byron's mistress. The odd thing is that these imaginative monologues, taking off from the same sparse facts, do not contradict each other, but weigh in with accumulative effect. They can even be read alongside straightforward biographies, although the 'reconstructions' are so lively and accomplished that conventional biography is in danger of seeming tame. Nye's Byron does not even mention the despised Doctor Polidori, while Chernaik's women find him a pathetic figure of fun, a marginal character. Paul West lets him address us from centre stage. Son of an Italian father and an English mother, educated at Ampleforth and Edinburgh, Polidori was a prurient, conceited 20-year-old with literary ambitions when Byron took him abroad in 1816 as physician-companion. The poet quickly tired of his 'Polly'. When they met the Shelley household on Lake Geneva their outings were frequently punctuated by Byron's exclamation, 'Thank God Polidori is not here.' Opium, sex and social climbing were the young doctor's main interests. His detailed accounts of Lord Byron's member ('pallid warts on the scrotum') and Lord Guilford's bowels, among other medical curiosities, are not for the squeamish. And yet, such is the power of Paul West's achievement, one starts to feel sympathy for the derided outsider, so far out of his depth. So great is his self obsession that information about his companions is incidental. Byron's publisher, John Murray, promised him Pounds 500 for a diary of his travels with Byron, but on receiving the document asked: 'You did go with Lord Byron, did you not? I do not find him here.' Paul West's Polidori has the same shortcoming, and yet holds our interest as a convincing and disturbing portrait of one of history's losers. The Butcher's Boy features an even more obscure loser. Francie Brady, orphan, soft in the head, has killed Mrs Nugent for reasons known only to himself, and the reader is plunged into his wandering mind. Punctuation is minimal and quotation marks omitted to give greater play to the grisly events recorded. The misery and deprivation of working class life in rural Ireland have never been so brutally evoked: steaming dung heaps, the whine of the bacon slicer, and a tractor 'farting off home to the mountains with a trailer of muck.' Francie, it turns out, is a 'lifer' recalling his past. 'No more hanging? I says. For fuck's sake] What's this country coming to?' This is the third novel by Patrick McCabe (born County Monaghan, 1955), and the strongest to come out of Ireland in many a year. It was a relief to turn to the sunny Italian hills of Inheritance, and the imposing old villa owned by the wealthy widow Dina. Italo Calvino, Iris Origo, the young Bruce Chatwin and other fashionable expatriates mingle with the fictional cast. The textures and colours of the villa, its furnishings and garden, the details of dress, are so enjoyably described that sometimes I felt I was looking at a back number of Harper's. But, even better, there is a very clever story, told as if piecing together various verbatim accounts of events in retrospect, which adds to the mystery. The novel opens with a visit to Assisi in which the elderly Dina has a heart attack and a vision of her late husband, Andrew. As she recovers, Andrew takes to interrupting her sessions with the BBC World Service to convey urgent mystical messages. Dina dedicates herself and her considerable wealth to promoting the resulting religious movement, under the slogan: 'Unite the Impossible'. In no time, clergymen are squabbling over the inheritance. When her grown children realise what is going on, it is far too late. Pryce-Jones gives us a rich combination: a well evoked foreign location, a good story told with dry humour, and the satisfaction of reading about the follies of the rich.</p>

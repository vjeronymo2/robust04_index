			<p>BFN     [Text] Marrakesh, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The United States  will continue to support China's efforts to become a member of  the World Trade Organization (WTO), U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor said here today.    Kantor was speaking after discussions of Sino-U.S. relations  and China's re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT) with Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Gu Yongjiang.    Gu, who is heading a delegation to GATT's ministerial  meeting  here, expressed the hope that the negotiation process would be  sped up for China to re-enter GATT and become a founding member  of the WTO.    He reaffirmed China's principles in the negotiations, which  are to seek a balance between rights and duties and China's  status as a developing country.    Kantor said that the development of Sino-U.S. relations was  "beneficial not only to the two countries, but also to the whole  world."    He also noted that the two sides should continue  consultations to solve the existing problems in the negotiations.    The two sides have agreed in principle to start a new round  of bilateral talks in Washington next month on China's re-entry  into GATT.    The ministerial meeting, which started in the Moroccan city  Tuesday to sign the Uruguay round trade accords reached last  December under GATT, will end Friday.</p>

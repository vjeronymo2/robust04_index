			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: NSW float of GIO meets heavy response THE privatisation of GIO Australia, the New South Wales government's financial services arm, closed yesterday with more than ADollars 1bn (USDollars 746m) in over-subscriptions. More than 128,000 applicants placed orders worth ADollars 2.22bn for the ADollars 1.2bn offering, making the share issue one of the most keenly sought after in the country's history. A NSW government spokesman said yesterday more than 70 per cent of successful subscribers would be allocated all shares sought, but applications for large tranches would be scaled back. Share certificates and refund cheques would be sent out within two weeks. The Victorian government has approved the proposed sale of its State Insurance Office to the GIO for about ADollars 300m. Amcor, the diversified Melbourne-based paper group, plans to invest about ADollars 26m in new corrugated box facilities in Western Australia and Malaysia. Mr Garry Ringwood, managing director of Amcor Fibre Packaging, said yesterday a ADollars 15m plant would be built at Perth, replacing two existing operations in the city, and two further plants would be built at Penang and Johore Bahru in Malaysia at a cost of ADollars 11m.</p>

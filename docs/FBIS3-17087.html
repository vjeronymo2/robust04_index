			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Moscow (DDP/ADN) -- There are no differences of  opinion in German-Russian relations, the foreign ministers of  the two countries, Klaus Kinkel and Andrey Kozyrev, said in  Moscow today following talks. Germany and Russia shared the  same positions on the main political events of the moment, they  stressed.    During a joint news conference, Kinkel reaffirmed that  Germany "will support with all its power the signing of a  long-overdue cooperation agreement between the European Union  and Russia." Germany would have ample scope for this when it  assumed the EU Presidency on 1 July. He said Russia remained a  reliable partner, both multilaterally and bilaterally.    Kinkel gave the Russian Minister of Culture Yevgeniy Sidorov  a personal message from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl regarding  the return of cultural items.    Kinkel and Kozyrev said they also discussed preparations for  the planned visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Germany  in May. Kinkel said he had gained the impression during his stay  that Yeltsin was in full control of the situation in Russia.    The ministers said their meeting also covered international  issues such as the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  Middle East. Kinkel praised Russia's involvement in securing a  compromise between the warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Netherlands UN Battalion Will Rush to </F> Srebrenica"; as released by The Hague ANP Database]    [Text] Brela, 24 Feb (ANP) -- The Netherlands UN battalion  that is currently settling into the Croatian port of Split will  endeavor to move into the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica sooner  than expected. The "Dutchbat" has been assigned this task by UN  Commander General Rose.    Originally, the battalion's first 300 infantrymen were due  to  go to Srebrenica on 6 March at the earliest. Now an attempt is  being made to make this happen as soon as Tuesday [1 March],  despite the transport problems with which Dutchbat is still  fighting to come to terms. In his instructions for the  Netherlands battalion, General Rose says that the operation must  be carried out "as quickly as possible."    According to Lieutenant-Colonel W. van Dullemen, by issuing  these orders, the UN general is assigning the Netherlands  battalion with an extremely difficult task. Most of the  infantrymen arrived in Split on Wednesday, and the plan was that  they were supposed to remain there for one more week. Now, the  300-man unit will have to leave on Saturday and head for the  Netherlands supply center in Lukavac, from where it will  continue on to Srebrenica.    The United Nations wants Dutchbat to enter the Muslim  enclave  faster than originally planned in an attempt to make the most of  the relatively flexible attitude of the Serbs at the moment.  That attitude could change if the United Nations soon attempts  to re-open the airfield at Tuzla for humanitarian aid. UN Envoy  Akashi has named 7 March as the target date by which Tuzla must  be open once again.    Previously, the United Nations and NATO had not ruled out  the  possibility of using force, if necessary, to re-open Tuzla  airfield. However, General Polle, the coordinator of the  Netherlands operations, does not anticipate any armed action  being necessary, despite the major objections that the Serbs  have to the re-opening of Tuzla. According to Polle, the  question will be solved through negotiations.    Polle views the call to action by his UN colleague, General  Rose, more as an attempt by the British general to consolidate  the presence of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] peacekeeping  forces throughout the whole of eastern Bosnia. UN troops have  become somewhat "thinner" on the ground recently following the  transfer to Sarajevo of a company of Scandinavian soldiers. The  Norwegian battalion is being deployed mainly around Tuzla. The  United Nations wants to prevent the Serbian forces from hitting  upon the idea of exploiting the gap that has been created as a  result.</p>

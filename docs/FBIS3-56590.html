Nesterushkin termed the action  by Latvian officials as sufficient. During the talks  Nesterushkin expressed hope that Latvian authorities will not  allow a recurrence of such situations.    Answering a previous request by the Latvian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs to explain the Russian presidential press  secretary's statement on this incident, Nesterushkin said that  the statement's aim was to stress the danger of the situation.  The sharp tone of the statement was related to the fact that  all the circumstances of the matter and the stance of the  official Latvian authorities on this issue were not yet known at  the time it was made.</p>

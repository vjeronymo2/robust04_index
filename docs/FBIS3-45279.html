			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Smith and M. Y. Sung] </F>   [Text] The government has turned up the heat on Hong  Kong's lawmakers to keep the new airport project afloat despite  renewed threats from China that unilateral action would threaten  future negotiations on the project.    Legislators reserved a final decision on the airport funding  crisis yesterday, prompting the government to push ahead with  its own decision this weekend. The government also refused to  reveal its long-term contingency plan for airport financing  despite growing fears that more taxpayers' money would be  injected into the project if China called off future talks.    The government will make a final decision this weekend on  funding options, but has indicated it favours the injection of  an additional $1.6 billion to pay for urgent construction  projects.    Legislators and the Airport Consultative Committee (ACC)  were  presented with two options yesterday to keep the airport on  schedule pending an agreement with China on the financing  arrangements.    Although Hong Kong's main political parties reserved their  final decision, the government will narrow down the choice this  weekend. The options include an extra $377 million in funding to  keep the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) operating during  1994-95, or the injection of an additional $1.6 billion to pay  for urgent design and construction work.    Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin warned that  the  injection of additional funding without China's approval would  threaten future airport negotiations. "Unilateral action will do  no good to the settlement of the financial arrangements," he  said.    Governor Chris Patten rejected China's suggestion that the  British side simply put more equity into the associated railway  project. He said this would only be "bite-size" relief, and  that the only cost-effective option was to reach agreement on  the overall financing strategy.    Treasury Secretary Donald Tsang said many legislators  appeared to favour going it alone on the $1.6 billion additional  funding but admitted there were "mixed" reactions from ACC  members. Tsang said the government would monitor the response  from legislators and the public before making a decision at the  weekend. "I hope that over the weekend we will come to a  recommendation that will be put to the Finance Committee," Tsang  said. "At present the proposal may not be the ideal scenario  but we have to take the feeling of the Hong Kong people into  account."    Tsang said the government had not decided whether to brief  China on the proposal before it was put to the Legislative  Council. While many legislators appeared to favour the  government's preferred alternative, only a handful indicated  they would support either option.    The major parties, the United Democrats, the Liberal Party  and Meeting Point, said they would consult parts members before  making a decision. Tsang refused to be drawn on government  contingency plans should China call off further talks on the  airport. Tsang stressed that the first priority was to reach  agreement with China through the Airport Committee.    Four independent legislators, Jimmy McGregor Emily Lau,  Vincent Cheng and Eric Li supported the injection of $1.6  billion to keep major contracts on line.    Liberal Party legislator Howard Young and pro-China  legislator Tam Yiu-chung said they preferred the less extreme  option of keeping the PAA operating.</p>

Politburo member Maria de los Angeles Garcia stressed that,  in addition to their continuous efforts to find solutions to the  nation's other problems, ANIR members should look upon  preserving equipment, machinery, tools, and other resources --  many of which are not being used because of the lack of spare  parts -- as a challenge. As regards ANIR's participation in the  sugar harvest, the plenum agreed on the need to expedite the  recyling and production of spare parts needed to operate  combines, compressors, and boilers at the sugar mills, as well  as to use animal-powered equipment more efficiently.</p>

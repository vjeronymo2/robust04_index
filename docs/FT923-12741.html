			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Pilkington shares drop 11p on fears of gloomy statement SHARES IN Pilkington, the glass group, fell 11p to 96p yesterday, following a 6p fall on Wednesday, as stockbrokers anticipated a gloomy statement from Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, at next week's annual meeting. One said: 'We are looking for a grim statement, life is extremely tough for Pilkington.' The group cut its dividend in June when it reported profits of Pounds 77m for the year to end-March, after exceptional costs of Pounds 37m, down from Pounds 151.6m the previous year. Even so the company had to draw on reserves to pay the dividend. The shares have not been this low since the end of 1985, before BTR, the industrial company, bid for the group in 1986 at a price equivalent to 180.6p. Pilkington's shares have fallen from a peak this year of 164p in May when the stock market was enthusiastic about prospects for economic recovery after the Conservative election victory in April. A number of analysts have downgraded forecasts for the company's current-year results. Yesterday Kleinwort Benson was reported to have cut its forecast of pre-tax profits for the year to March 1993 to Pounds 50m. Other brokers said this forecast had not been sanctioned by the company. Other estimates are in the Pounds 60m-Pounds 70m range. When the company reported annual profits in June, Sir Antony said he could not see any sign of an end to the recession. Pilkington's main customers are the building and automotive industries, both badly hit in the recession.</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: A taste of cold steel Metal fatigue was evident at British Steel yesterday. The strain showed not so much in the interim figures, which were badly affected by reorganisation and redundancy costs, but in the management's repeated complaint about the state of the European steel market. Cut-price supplies from eastern Europe and over-capacity in the EC have further weakened prices in the last few months. These supply problems are now being exacerbated by the downturn in Germany, notably in car manufacturing, and another round of destocking. British Steel and private sector steelmakers in Germany may be looking to the EC to stop subsidies to inefficient state-owned EC manufacturers. However, ministers are likely to prefer to act against the soft target of eastern European imports than to address the politically sensitive problem of rationalising the EC's steel industry. Such import restrictions will at best buy companies a little time. British Steel, which was expected to be one of the big beneficiaries of devaluation, has already seen much of that gain eroded by weak markets. Given such a tough outlook, the company is fortunate to have a strong balance sheet. Cash will continue to flow out of the company in the second half of the year as redundancy costs continue, but net borrowings should stabilise at a manageable Pounds 300m next year. While it is in better shape than many continental competitors, political uncertainty makes the shares hard to value. In the unlikely event that the EC acts to cut capacity, British Steel could find itself well placed. But if the haemorrhaging continues, the company has no nanny state to protect it.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Creditors set for Maxwell group payout Creditors of Maxwell Communication Corporation are expected to receive a first payout from the company in March this year, says a report just circulated by the administrators. Mr Mark Homan, Mr Colin Bird, Mr Alan Jamieson and Mr Jonathan Phillips, the joint administrators to MCC from accountants Price Waterhouse, said they expected a 'substantial' distribution by next month and another during the second quarter of the year. They placed the total amount to be distributed as being in the range of 28p to 43p in the pound, plus up to a further 8p if a series of litigation claims were successful. This represents an increase in estimated realisations from the previous range of 23p to 40p, reflecting greater proceeds from sales of MCC's US businesses than initially expected. The figure for realisations from litigation has fallen from 9p in previous reports. It includes potential legal actions against professional advisers to MCC and against insurers, and over disputes covering Dollars 137m in shares in Berlitz, the language school and publishing company, and Dollars 140m paid to five banks in the three months before the company entered administration. The report estimates that total assets available for distribution to unsecured creditors are in the range of Dollars 1.03bn (Pounds 680m) to Dollars 1.35bn, and the value of unsecured claims is in the range of Dollars 3.17bn to Dollars 3.62bn. It says legal actions have begun for claims on 14 insurance policies taken out by MCC through the brokers Willis Corroon, as well as against insurers who have not paid up on a personal accident policy taken out on the life of Robert Maxwell. The creditors' report suggests the administrators are still seriously considering suing the principal advisers to MCC, 'in particular' Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the auditor. It says the administrators have interviewed audit staff and examined papers in the UK and US. The report says a decision will be taken this month on whether to begin legal action in connection with transactions involving the disposal of property to companies which transferred the assets to Liechtenstein trusts or private Maxwell companies. The administrators are also considering actions in connection with the sale of a subsidiary of the publisher Macmillan in December 1988, from which Dollars 119m was transferred to private Maxwell companies. Total professional fees paid so far are Dollars 65m, which Mr Homan said should be seen in the context of the total realisations in MCC achieved so far and likely in the future.</p>

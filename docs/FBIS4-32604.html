			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Banja Luka, June 27 (TANJUG) -- The offensive of  Moslem troops loyal to hardliner Alija Izetbegovic against the  rebel Moslem autonomous province of western Bosnia is designed  to stifle all life in the province and liquidate its leadership,  says province President Fikret Abdic.    Abdic, Izetbegovic's moderate rival, told the local radio  Velika Kladusa that he would organise a nation-wide resistance  front against Izetbegovic's loyalists. He accused the Moslem  regime in Sarajevo of a determination to crush the struggle of  the army and people of western Bosnia for autonomy, which he  said enjoyed the support of Moslems in the diaspora.    For months past, the army loyal to Izetbegovic has been  trying to subdue the province, which was proclaimed by Abdic's  supporters last September in opposition to the war-mongering  policy of the regime in Sarajevo. The provincial leadership has  signed separate peace accords with Bosnian Serbs and Croats,  pursuing free trade with them even at the height of Moslem-Serb  and Moslem-Croat fighting elsewhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

The league should seize the  opportunity to further emancipate the mind. The league should  also accelerate reform and opening up and develop the market  economy in both cities and the countryside. This was stressed  repeatedly by Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party  committee, during his recent inspection tour of Jirem League.    From 25 to 28 January, Wang Qun, secretary of the regional  party committee, and Zhou Weide, vice chairman of the region,  led comrades in charge of the pertinent departments and bureaus  under the regional party committee and the government to conduct  a four-day inspection of Jirem League. Wang Qun and his  entourage expressed sympathy and solicitude for the  disaster-afflicted people in Qiandemen Sumu in Jarud Banner.  They also convened a forum with the participation of comrades  in charge of industrial and commercial enterprises, township and  town enterprises, and monetary units, and listened to the work  reports of party committees of Jirem League and Tongliao City.  Wang Qun and some other leading comrades fully affirmed and  highly appraised the achievements scored by Jirem League despite  the natural calamities to its agriculture and animal husbandry  and despite the numerous problems facing the urban economy.    Wang Qun stressed that from now on attention should be paid  to the following five aspects. First, in the light of existing  difficulties and problems, the league should enhance morale  instead of feeling discouraged and should approach the situation  in a correct and all-around manner. As a big agricultural  league, Jirem League is furnished with good conditions in  various fields and is provided with the foundation for continued  development. As a small industrial league, Jirem League should  depend on development, transformation, and exploitation to  resolve industrial problems. The league should depend on  increasing revenues and reducing expenditures and on accelerated  development, which is most essential, to alleviate its fund  shortage. The league is vast in territory, rich in natural  resources, but small in population. Provided with good  opportunity, topographical advantages, and support of the  people, the league has great potential in becoming prosperous.  Agricultural areas should develop the breeding, the pastoral  areas should develop the feed growing, and the entire economy  should be oriented to the combination of agriculture, industry,  commerce, and trade in order to exploit latent advantages.  Second, all levels of party committees and governments and all  functional departments should concentrate energies on reform,  economic development, and national unity, which is the key of  the present work, in order to ensure the smooth progress of all  the work of this year. This year, the league should concentrate  on resolving major contradictions and carrying out reforms in  rural and urban areas to accelerate development. Reform cannot  remain in words and in slogans, but should be carried out in a  resolute, practical, and painstaking manner until practical  results are achieved. It should strive to improve the economic  efficiency of rural and pastoral areas and pay attention to key  projects, rather than undertaking "minor scattered projects."  Third, to resolve monetary and financial problems, the league  should depend on boosting the economy. The policies set forth  by the state should be studies and applied well, and tax work  should be stressed. Support should be given to the development  of the tertiary industry, township enterprises, and individual  and private sectors of the economy. Jirem League is not a place  where "the mountains and the rivers end" but is a place "filled  with dense willow tress and bright flowers." It should  accelerate reform and depend on its own efforts to develop the  economy. Financial, planning, and tax departments, as well as  banks, should closely cooperate with one another to halt  deficits. The league should be good at making and accumulating  money. It should run mobile corporations that are opened to the  outside world and are oriented to science and technology. It  should also run the economic entities that are linked with  peasant households. Because such economic entities are linked  with both leading enterprises and numerous households, the  government should provide them with preferential policies and  conditions, as well as sufficient land. Cadres in their prime  should be sent to the first lines to grasp reform and  development in an effort to build up capable and high-efficient  leading bodies at all levels. Fourth, the league should  strengthen the forces of tax, banking, industrial and  commercial, financial, and political and legal departments, as  well as corporations and enterprises. As for fund shortage, in  addition to obtaining more funds from the regional authorities,  the league should depend primarily on the market economic law to  control the funds. In the right order of importance and  urgency, by aiming at ensuring key projects, we should spend  more limited funds on the enterprises that are the best in terms  of economic returns. The funds should be distributed in line  with new ideas and new methods. By adhering to the combination  of cropping, breeding, and processing and the combination of  trade, industry, and agriculture (animal husbandry), the league  should engage in developing large-scale market, major  commodities, and large-scale circulation. The leading  enterprises should make great efforts to continuously improve  their level. The league should set its sights high to build  itself into the modernized agricultural and livestock product  base of northeast China. Fifth, the league should strengthen  party leadership, persist in the principle of taking a  two-handed approach and being tough with both hands, strengthen  ideological and political work, manage social order in a  comprehensive manner, and create a good political and social  environment for reform and development.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Banks force Betacom to plan rights for up to Pounds 3m BETACOM, the loss-making telephone and answering machine supplier, is planning a Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m rights issue following pressure from its bankers who are refusing to provide further capital without a strengthening of the equity base. The company, which also announced reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 515,000 (Pounds 2.44m) after exceptionals for the 1991 year, is likely to launch the cash call before the end of June. Mr Roger Rowland, who took over as non-executive chairman last year following the resignation of founder Mr Dennis Baylin, said the rights issue was crucial to the company's long-term survival. The share of associates moved from a Pounds 67,000 deficit to a profit of Pounds 144,000. The UK division continued to suffer from what Mr Rowland called 'high street deal-making . . . We had no option but to knock prices down,' he said. However, losses had been reduced and margins protected through cost-cutting, he said. Turnover in the UK dropped by Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 11.2m. Including overseas operations sales increased from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 19.3m. Interest charges were marginally lower at Pounds 480,000 (Pounds 489,000), while debt was about Pounds 3m just after the year-end, Mr Rowland said. Losses per share were reduced from 7.05p to 1.16p.</p>

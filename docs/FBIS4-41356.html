			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Kuchma, Ukrainian people's deputy and </F> presidential candidate: "Ukraine As I See It"]    [Text] I am often asked: What is my vision of Ukraine?    I will answer laconically: I see Ukraine as an independent  and prosperous state ruled by law and order, by decency and  professionalism.    Only such societies are viable, in which human dignity is  the  highest criterion. The level of civilization in such societies  is determined by their attitude toward their own history,  regardless of how tragic that history may be.    We will not be given another version of history. The most  grave sin is to mock the memory of past generations for the sake  of a momentary political gain.    The biblical story of Ham, who was damned for his disrespect  for his father in a moment of weakness, can be applied at any  time. The same refers to the simultaneously blessed Japhet and  Shem, who "turned their faces so that they would not see their  father's nakedness."    My concern for Ukraine is not a concern for antiquated  things, Cossack's breeches, and parochialism; it is a problem of  making fresh gains -- from declared "independenceness"  [nezalezhnitsvo] to economic self-sufficiency which is a  prerequisite for safeguarding our real sovereignty. To  accomplish this task, I formulate my program according to the  principle paraphrased in John Kennedy's well-known statement:  "Ask not what Ukraine can do for you; ask what you can do for  Ukraine."    I know that -- owing to some "knights of the pen," who  "neatly" extracted one convenient phrase out of context -- I am  being portrayed as an unsuccessful prime minister who, so to  say, has been trying to clarify for a long time exactly what  type of society we shall build. In the end, he resigned without  having grasped anything. Nothing could be further from the  truth!    It was not up to the prime minister, but up to the Supreme  Council to determine the model of society we wish to build. The  president had to say his meaningful word, too. The prime  minister, as chief executive, had to be only informed of the  general doctrine. The law is the law -- the activity of every  branch has to be performed within the limits of their plenary  powers.    Every epoch -- especially an interim one -- should have its  philosophical concept and principles. Without these principles,  government activities transform themselves into a daily routine  of "trial and error." Furthermore, the people can become a  nation only if they are united by a common idea, if they are  assured of their historical destiny. This should have been  determined immediately and without delay.    The traditions of our society and the conclusions of our  leading sociologists should have also been taken into account.  Our sociologists conclude that our people, as a whole, are  deprived of national consciousness. They have no clear social  direction for the future. Their new ideal, a strategic goal, is  proposed primarily by making comparisons with other, more  prosperous countries. Unfortunately, this is not done on the  basis of their own historical experience. Ukraine, yet again in  its tragic history, has come to a crossroads.    That national ideal, which was proposed on 1 December 1991,  exhausted itself the very next day. Still, it was formulated  precisely: independence and separation from Moscow.    What next?    What form of government should we adopt: presidential or  parliamentary? What state: unitarian or federal? What final  form of social, political, and economic system is desired by  Ukraine? What role in the production process has to be granted  to private business, the state, and corporate entities? Which  model of social protection and market regulations is more  attractive? Will Ukraine maintain (and if the answer is "yes,"  then by what means) its orientation toward socialist values  (which have become an everyday reality in the majority of EC  countries), or, on the contrary, will it gravitate toward the  system of capitalist competition, of which the United States is  a model?    These questions cannot be avoided.    All these options were endlessly and fruitlessly argued. In  the end, a state of uncertainty prevailed. At best, this  uncertainty bears witness to intellectual weakness and  professional incompetence of the ruling elite. At worst, it was  the consequence of direct sabotage on the part of certain forces  seeking to fish in murky waters.    Some high officials of the ruling elite tried to compensate  for their lack of constructive ideas by forcing conflicts  concerning problems arising between former USSR countries over  territorial and military issues. It was the time when the  imperial itching had just started to develop in our neighbor  country. For some time, external factors drew public opinion  away from internal problems, but it has only reaped dubious  dividends. This was not a "horse" on which we could ride into  the world community.    Valuable time was being lost, while our young Ukrainian  statehood was sucked more and more into the whirlpool of  economic crisis imported, to a great extent, from the  "Gaydarized" [pun on Russia's former prime minister name] Russia  by Ukrainian supporters of the IMF model. The content and  direction of the IMF model is intended to bring the  technologically backward countries of the former USSR into the  global market after the devastation of all their enterprises and  branches capable of competition with Western firms. Regions of  the former USSR were to produce only those commodities which  were disadvantageous for the West (due to their lack of profit  potential or lack of raw materials) or undesirable due to  environmental reasons. Ukraine was to assume the role of  Europe's backyard.    The former Soviet nomenklatura, which had come into power  in the newly created republics along with "businessmen" of the  shadow economy, supported this model joyously, seeing an  opportunity to "grabatize" statehood and share it with  foreigners. Millions of working people were facing, after the  abolishment of collective exploitation by the CPSU nomenklatura,  the "bright" prospect of working for the new masters of  appropriated enterprises. The ruling elite of the newly created  states were to protect the newly born capitalism by means of  severe restrictive measures until nouveau riches would be so  efficient as to pay decent wages for their employees. However,  how long would it take for our "wild capitalism" to assume a  "humane face?!"    The model of forced liberalization, which was thrust on us  by  the West, ignored the fact that mass bankruptcies can trigger a  social explosion. Now, workers are facing only one alternative  -- to become either nationalist extremists or leftist radicals.  This is already a dangerous thing. Today's society is showing  signs of hysteria on the one hand, and decline, apathy, and even  doom -- on the other.    Does one need any other evidence of a catastrophic situation  of our society in addition to widely known facts testifying to  the polarization of wealth and misery? If so, then let us take  a look around: A blind desire to get rich and the bustling  activity of mainly professionally incompetent people, who  attempt to rule the state and build the market, are introducing  chaos and profanity into society. Variations of this profanity  could be heard in the arias of "the Varangian guest" on the  attractiveness of an absolutely free society, in which the state  assumes only the role of a "night watchman." It is high time to  start living by our own wits, because overseas "well-wishers"  take care of their own interests first.    Ukraine has to rely more on its own resources, proceeding  from the fact that one year (and, all the more, 11 months when I  was prime minister) is not enough time for a minimal  stabilization period.    To put an end to general disintegration and pilfering, we  should realize the following (and this is supported by the  experience of those countries which have overcome their low  level of social differentiation and specialization): The state  will be forced to use stringent measures for securing law and  order, as well as legal sanctions against those violating the  "rules of the game" established by the state in the realm of  business, the pilfering of national wealth, and neglecting the  norms of social life.    Let us not forget that habitual, moral, and legal regulators  in force in developed Western countries were attained over the  course of many centuries.    Thus, the minimum program for Ukraine consists of the  implementation of a "social state" doctrine oriented toward  overcoming social erosion and the structural ambiguity of  society. The emphasis is being placed here on safeguarding equal  rights for all sectors of the economy -- private, cooperative,  state, and corporate -- along with guarantees for the essential  needs of citizens in the sphere of health care, education, and  pensions.    The building of the "social market economy" is a program of  the utmost importance for Ukraine, which will be carried out  simultaneously with the view for a more stable period, following  the creation of conditions for efficient economic activities of  the people who have already acquired necessary commercial,  professional, and other habits after the narcosis of  totalitarianism.    Thus, the key issue today is not that of a social ideal, but  of a concrete model for social relations during the  stabilization period. Taking into account the fact that a split  with society along the "socialism-capitalism" line again looms,  the issue should be shifted from the "either-or" opposition to  the personal level. People who adhere to some principle or  another should have the freedom of choice within the borders of  one state, just as it is in China (one state, but two social  systems) or, for instance, in Israel (private sector, but also  collective farms -- kibbutzzim).    We should make our way into a new system of coordinates: We  have lived, and we will continue to live, in the immediate  future under the circumstances of a multisystem society with  private (domestic as well as foreign) and other (state,  corporate, and cooperative) sectors on the principles of equal  rights for all forms of property. The interests of these systems  will be defended by political parties which, in the end, will  find their social basis. A democratic state, oriented toward  the social protection of its citizens, will assume the role of a  director in the competition of social groups; it will be also  authorized to soften the ruthlessness and anarchy of the market  in the period of initial capital accumulation.    In the private sector, where the efficiency of labor is  higher (as well as the exploitation of hired workers), wages  will be higher, as well. At state enterprises, work will be  easier and the level of social protection will be higher, but  wages -- lower. This does not represent any discrimination,  because even in the most democratic societies people are born  with equal rights, but with different possibilities, talents,  and capabilities of intensive work. One thing must be  guaranteed -- the man should have the right to choose, while the  state has to safeguard this right in all its aspects.    Such an idea of Ukraine's own way can be productive during  an  interim, stabilization period, when the idea of socialism has  already lost its former charm, whereas the idea of capitalism  still looms. However, one should take pains to prevent this  idea from assuming a grotesque "all-Ukrainian" form, which would  evoke a negative reaction on the part of other ethnic groups in  our state and discredit the Ukrainian idea in general.    We should get rid of that peculiar complex of isolationism  and mistaken treatment of independence, which were born by the  long period when our national pride was hurt. We should get rid  of that "independenceness" which continues to fence us off from  the world with a wall of parochial egoism and spiritual  outmodedness. It is necessary to make way for a qualitatively  new level of consciousness of a statesman advocating  independence -- this man should not be afraid of  self-realization in the processes of global and regional  integration in the sphere of business, social activity, and  culture.    Only the implementation of the slogan "Ukraine without  hirelings is a Ukraine of proprietors" can, in the end,  safeguard decency and order in the privatization process, and  henceforth -- trust in the forces of our people and the might of  our state. It has already become proverbial that the foundation  of any state is, in the first place, the so-called middle class.    These circumstances will not be created by themselves,  whereas the inactivity of the state, incapable of choosing its  own course, as we all see, leads to social chaos. The signs of  a catastrophic situation of the Ukrainian economy are increasing  in number; this jeopardizes the political gains of independence  and the very possibility of advancing toward a civilized  society. The situation of a "wild market," in which, owing to  financial machinations, "fat cats" are making their fortunes, is  a challenge for the worker who attaches the improvement of  living to honest and competent work as well as to the desire to  live in a society guided by human values.    Ukraine can be led out of the crisis only by millions of  farmers, workers of industry, health care, science, education,  and culture, as well as by civilized entrepreneurs whose honest  work should have been morally and materially stimulated by the  state long ago. For the time being, the reforms have not  activated this principal source of national revival; they did  not produce a stimuli for investments in the development of  production as well as in undertaking activities in industry;  they did not persuade common people to work honestly and with  full commitment.    This is why I do not have the least doubt that wide segments  of the population will support the slogan of "law and order."  Moreover, to clamber out of the abyss of Mafia-like anarchy, the  people will demand the introduction of firmer forms of state  life with a high level of personalized responsibility at all  levels of power.    Such is the demand of the interim period.    Without safeguarding these circumstances, there will be no  civilized Ukraine. This has been, and remains, my stance.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Smetanin: "Ukrainian Rocket Troops Want </F> Transfers to Russia"]    [Text] Prompted by the agreement on scrapping Ukrainian  nuclear weapons signed by the three presidents [of Ukraine,  Russia, and the United States], foreign media -- Russian among  them -- have launched another spiral of speculations on this  issue. In particular, the "Radio-ROX" station and IZVESTIYA  reported that several dozen officers from a rocket division  stationed in the town of Pervomaysk, concerned about their fate,  allegedly applied for transfers to the Russian rocket forces.    Although our Russian colleagues could not be rebuked for  being incorrect, the timing of their report deserves closer  attention. What they tried to pitch as a sensation is actually a  commonplace event in the Army's everyday life. We should rather  listen to the opinion of a man who knows everything about this  problem and who heard nothing about the dozens of reports. Here  is what Lieutenant General Aleksey Kryzhko, head of the  Administration Center of the Ukrainian Nuclear Forces, told us.    Facts reported by the radio station and newspaper are in  fact  part of the implementation of agreements reached by the  Ukrainian and Russian Defense Ministries back in 1992.  According those agreements, we are to facilitate in all  possible ways the movement of servicemen from Strategic Rocket  Forces -- both to Ukraine and from Ukraine. This is a natural  process caused by many reasons which are different in each  individual case. We cannot stand in the way of people's wishes.  Last year, more than 300 servicemen came to Ukraine from  Russia, and there were at least as many that we peacefully sent  to our neighbors.    Let me repeat that all these actions are agreed-upon by  personnel departments of our ministries and raise no particular  concerns on the part of either side. Your wrote that some 50  rocket servicemen suddenly applied for a transfer. I would have  known about this in the first place, and IZVESTIYA should have  turned directly to the primary source of information. As it is,  they offered only part of the truth, making a "sensation" out of  it.    It was hard not to agree with Aleksey Kryzhko that any kind  of information is more valuable when obtained from competent  officials. But one more thing is also clear -- if our state is  not capable of ensuring decent standards for officers of the  43th Rocket Army, which is destined to cease its existence, we  will definitely have to grapple with the problem of who is  supposed to take the rockets off combat readiness, drain the  fuel, dismantle main components, perform a partial  neutralization of the rockets, send them for recycling... The  information disseminated by IZVESTIYA and "Radio-ROX" about  officers starting to write reports requesting transfers should  give our leadership a lot of food for thought. If we do not  immediately address this problem -- after all, it is always the  best people who leave -- will we be able to fulfill obligations  assumed under agreements and destroy nuclear weapons without  damaging society and the environment. However, this is a topic  for a separate discussion, and we will definitely return to it.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / New Nigerian election date set NIGERIA'S military government will hold new presidential elections on August 14, but only one party is prepared to take part. The decision comes four days after President Ibrahim Babangida withdrew his offer to the parties to form an unelected interim government when he hands over power on August 27. Last week's mass protests in Lagos and other mainly Yoruba cities showed such hostility to any new elections that campaigning or polling in the south-west of Nigeria could be impractical. The Social Democratic party (SDP) last week declared a boycott of fresh polls under President Babangida, saying they would have no credibility. The SDP's candidate, Mr Moshood Abiola, had a clear lead in the elections in June when the government suspended the release of the results. The National Republican Convention (NRC) said last night the party was ready for elections and would decide on Wednesday how to choose their candidate. According to the SDP and the protesters who turned out in Lagos and other parts of the south-west last week, there is no need for a re-run. Most voters, politicians and official foreign observers judged the June 12 polls to be well-run and relatively fair. The government annulled the polls because, it alleged, one or both of the candidates had made 'negative use of money' during the campaigning and had personal or business interests at odds with the office of head of state. The government secretly organised a series of lawsuits after the elections so the army could keep power, a top official with the organisation that filed the suits said yesterday, AP reports. Mr Abimola Davis of the Association for Better Nigeria said the annulment of the elections was 'an organised confusion by just a few of us to prolong the lifespan of the present military administration'. The association filed lawsuits claiming the two candidates seeking the presidency were corrupt and the president should remain in power. Mr Davis signed each of the suits.</p>

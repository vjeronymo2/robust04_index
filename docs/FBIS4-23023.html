An attempt is made to investigate the accumulation of  secondary lipid peroxidation products in liposomal and  liposomal-bacterial suspensions and to study their effect on the  growth of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture. To this  end, liposomes are prepared from egg phosphatidyl-choline (by  BIOS, Novosibirsk) and cholesterol (by Sigma, U.S.) in a 7:5  molar ratio and a 25 mg/ml lipid concentration in a 0l.15 M NaCl  solution with subsequent ultrasonic treatment at 22 kHz. The  Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2134 strain is used as the  test culture. The dynamics of malonic dialdehyde accumulation in  liposomal suspensions with various pH values, the malonic  dialdehyde accumulation dynamics in the liposomal-bacterial  suspension containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells  with various pH values, and the dependence of the  Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell growth on the level of  lipid peroxidation product accumulation in the liposome  suspension are plotted. The findings demonstrate that during 24  h of liposome incubation at a 37C temperature, lipid  peroxidation products are accumulated in the suspension while  the accumulation dynamics in the liposomal suspension differ  from their accumulation rate in the liposomal-bacterial  suspension whereby the process intensity depends on the medium  acidity. The lipid peroxidation products display a bactericide  effect whose manifestation depends on the extent of lipid  peroxidation product accumulation, liposome concentration, and  exposure duration.

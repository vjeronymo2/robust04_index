			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Japanese trading firm  Marubeni Corp. said Thursday [7 April] it has tied up with a  Chinese enterprise to sell personal computers and other  electronics equipment in China.    Under the agreement, Marubeni and China's Legend computer  group will jointly develop, produce, market and service personal  computers, communications equipment and medical analysis  systems, Marubeni said. The two companies initially will sell  computer hardware and software made by Apple Computer Inc. of  the United States, beginning this autumn, it said.    The company said the burgeoning Chinese personal computer  market, which saw sales of 300,000 units last year, is likely to  experience an annual growth of more than 20 percent through 2000.    Legend, backed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, annually  sells 20 billion yen worth of personal computers, it said.    International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and other U.S.  computer makers are already competing for a larger share of the  Chinese market.</p>

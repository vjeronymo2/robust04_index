			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARINOVICH GOES FROM A COLT TO A TROJAN HORSE;  </P> <P> QUARTERBACK: THERE WERE A LOT OF DOUBTERS WHEN THE SEASON STARTED, BUT NEARLY  EVERYBODY BELIEVES IN HIS TALENT NOW.  </P> <P> For just a moment, between the waves of reporters coming at him to ask  questions, the tall red-haired player with the cocksure smile looked around and  studied all that had become his domain.  </P> <P> It was only a messy locker room, strewn with everything from shoes and socks to  supporters, both the elastic and human kind.  </P> <P> But to the young man named Marinovich, age 20 going on 45, it was everything  that boyhood dreams are made of. All around him, fellow USC football players,  most of them older and most of them doubters when he first came on the scene,  sang his praises. Reporters not only asked him about him; they asked them about  him.  </P> <P> The phrase "born leader" came from one of his receivers, junior Frank Griffin.  </P> <P> Another receiver, senior John Jackson, called him "my right-hand man, even if  he is left-handed."  </P> <P> Yet another, the team's leader in spirit and machismo, senior All-American Tim  Ryan, a defensive tackle, called him "precocious" and added that he "has become  a great player and a great friend of mine."  </P> <P> So it was at the Rose Bowl Monday for Todd Marinovich, the freshman quarterback  from Capistrano Valley. In one of the toughest situations in sport, the  pressure of the closing minutes of a tied Rose Bowl game, Marinovich had  delivered.  </P> <P> He had taken his Trojans on a late drive, had set up the winning touchdown with  a key third-down pass to his buddy, Jackson, and had called the winning  touchdown play, an off-tackle blast by Ricky Ervins, like he was Bobby Layne  with a full-week's growth of beard.  </P> <P> "Todd said we'd run 86 off right tackle," Ervins said. "He said it would work,  that it would go all the way. I said, 'Oh, really.' He said it would go. Next  thing, I just walked into the end zone." Marinovich's version was similar, yet  more understated.  </P> <P> "I just told the linemen to stay on their blocks a bit longer on this one, that  it'd go," he said.  </P> <P> And said like a true veteran, a guy with 20 games or so under his belt. He  didn't spit on the floor when he said it, but he could have.  </P> <P> So much has happened to Marinovich since Pat O'Hara went down with a knee  injury scant days before USC was to open against Illinois; since he fairly well  stunk out the joint against the Fighting Illini and had his older, grizzled  teammates beseeching the heavens for an alternative to this local kid with  mouth to match press clippings.  </P> <P> Just six months after his 20th birthday, he had completed 197 passes for 2,400  yards and 16 touchdowns, had led the Trojans to an 8-2-1 record, a Pac-10 title  and had led his team into the Rose Bowl. The doubters were now believers.  </P> <P> And after passing for 178 yards, rushing for 35 more and engineering the late  75-yard scoring drive that ended Bo Schembechler's career with a boo,  Marinovich had truly come of age. The colt had become a real Trojan horse.  </P> <P> "I couldn't ask for anything more from him," said Jackson, who caught five  passes for 56 yards, ended the season with 62 and established a Pac-10 record  with a reception in his 37th consecutive game Monday. "As a receiver, your MVP  has to be the quarterback. When he took over at the beginning of the year, we  were all worried. But he worked with me, we kept at it, and I can say now that  Todd has had more to do than anybody with my career blossoming like it has."  </P> <P> Perhaps the game's key connection was Marinovich to Jackson with just over two  minutes left. It was third down and five at Michigan's 44, and this drive was  going to be it for the Trojans. Do or be tied. Marinovich went back, found  Jackson in the middle of the field, and USC was suddenly looking very rosy at  the Wolverine 24. Four plays later, it was 17-10.  </P> <P> "I'm supposed to be reading on that play, looking over everybody," Marinovich  said. "But the truth is, I just looked at John, watched him all the way. And  there he was."  </P> <P> To Jackson, it was equally simple.  </P> <P> "Surprisingly, that was the only time all day that we called that play," he  said. "I noticed their linebackers weren't getting back far enough, and they  didn't on that play, so I just curled into a spot and the ball was there, just  like it always is."  </P> <P> Jackson wasn't surprised. A story about the first Marinovich-to-Jackson  connection explained why.  </P> <P> "He doesn't like me to tell this, but he said it's OK today, and we still kid  about it a lot," Jackson said, recalling a scenario with Marinovich that goes  back to 1985.  </P> <P> "I was a senior at Bishop Amat High School," Jackson said. "He was at Mater  Dei, before he transferred to Capistrano Valley. Even back then, when he was  really just a kid, he was the whole show. Our whole defense was geared for him.  They sent four guys out for passes on every play.  </P> <P> "Well, this night, I catch three touchdown passes and we win, 28-8. But the  thing I remembered more than anything else is that I played defense, too, back  then and I made a pick (interception) against him. I think that was an omen.  That was 60-some receptions ago, the start of a real good hookup."  </P> <P> Near the end of Jackson's story, Marinovich walked past, smiled and said, "He  was just lucky that night."  </P> <P> Then he swaggered off into the night, looking part Ken Stabler and part Clint  Eastwood.  </P> <P> Jackson watched him leave, sighed, and said, "I wish I had a couple of years of  eligibility left."  </P></p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / BP dividend uncovered after fall of 80% in first quarter: Investors relieved as 4.2p payout maintained - Shares down 2p BRITISH PETROLEUM disappointed the stock market yesterday with an 80 per cent decline in its first-quarter profit which is not sufficient to cover the company's dividend payment. However, the board decided to keep the dividend unchanged at 4.2p a share, much to the relief of investors who were concerned that BP might be forced to cut its payout. The company reported a drop in its replacement cost profit, which strips out the effects of stock gains and losses, to Pounds 95m from Pounds 521m in the same period last year. Stockholding losses of Pounds 156m led to the company's first ever reported quarterly loss of Pounds 61m compared with a profit of Pounds 10m in the 1991 quarter. 'Clearly the situation is not a rosy one,' Mr David Simon, deputy chairman said. 'We are encouraged by a stronger crude price and steady demand, but there has been no obvious firming in margins.' For this reason, he said the financial outlook remains 'muted'. Initially, the stock market marked BP's shares 10p higher in relief that the company had not trimmed its dividend, but later shares slipped off to close 2p down on the day at 260p. Industry analysts expressed surprise at the Pounds 544m cash drain during the period which compared with a cash outflow of Pounds 116m in the same quarter last year. Mr Simon pointed out that the company had cut capital expenditure by 15 per cent this year to trim costs and reduce debt. He said BP had signalled to its operating divisions that they must make a similar cut in budgets for next year. In spite of efforts to keep the debt under control, the company's debt-to-equity ratio rose to 85 per cent during the quarter from a previous level of 78 per cent. It is expected to remain at this level for most of the year. 'We have made a judgment that we are at the turning point in the recessionary cycle and any change to our dividend policy would be premature,' Mr Simon said. BP's exploration and production division reported a slight drop in profits to Pounds 426m from Pounds 483m which was better than expected given the fall in crude prices and exploration cutbacks. But the weak refining market led to a sharp downturn in profits from this division to Pounds 79m from Pounds 385m. The profit level was boosted by divestment profits from the disposal of assets in west Africa and Ireland. Chemicals were also hard hit by the recession and showed a loss of Pounds 25m compared with a profit of Pounds 54m in the same period last year. The group reported a loss per share of 1.1 pence compared with a profit of 0.2p last year. Oil production remained steady at 1.5m barrels a day although Mr Simon said this will drop in the second quarter when North Sea fields are closed for maintenance. Lex, Page 18</p>

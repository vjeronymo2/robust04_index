Parfenov, Joint Institute of Nuclear </F> Research, Dubna; UDC 621.374.387]    [Abstract] An input register module in the FASTBUS standard  has been developed for recording coordinates in a multichannel  hodoscope and their subsequent transfer into a buffer memory,  this 2x32-bit F65588 device being much faster and ``deeper''  than the existing F6585 4-bit shift register. The module built  with K500 series microcircuits includes two differential  receivers, two input registers, and two sequentially operating  memories. The first register stores the leading edge of clock  signal pulses and then transfers it to the W[.sub]e[/]memory,  whereupon the second register stores the trailing edge of clock  signal pulses and then transfers it to the C[.sub]s[/]  memory. In this way the recording speed is doubled and the  resolving time is halved. Both memories operate in the mode of  data storing with the W[.sub]e[/] and C[.sub]s[/]  recording signals put in the constant resolving state by means  of a reset signal coming from the front panel. Addressation is  done in Gray codes by two corresponding binary counters, with  subsequent recoding by means of exclusive OR logic  and with a register on the output side which eliminates the  possibility of data being sent to the wrong address during a  change of address. A trigger signal indicates when an event  takes place. The module includes also two delay counters, a  remarkable feature thus being the possibility of presetting the  time delay between that trigger signal and the beginning of data  recording. In this way data can be recorded both before and  after the trigger signal, which makes it possible to also record  the ``history'' preceding an event. Readout of data from the  FASTBUS trunk is effected by means of a 2x4 decoder with one  input and four outputs, both memories having been partitioned  into two segments each and a CSRO register generating an FB  reset signal which is then combined in the OR mode with the  reset signal from the front panel. Multiplexing of output  signals is done by combining the respective memory outputs in  the inclusive OR mode and by using the control inputs  of the C[.sub]s[/] memory, to which resolving signals are  sent by the decoder. The author thanks A.G. Litvinenko for  helpful discussions and for evaluating the necessary parameters,  also V.I. Maksimenkova and D.P. Mikhalev for assisting in  assembly and adjustments of the module. Figures 2; references 2.</p>

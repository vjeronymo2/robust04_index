			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / People: The catalyst for new year resolutions at Hoechst - Jurgen Dormann is bringing about radical changes at the world's biggest chemicals group According to German corporate tradition, Jurgen Dormann had one crucial qualification for his elevation last May to chairmanship of Hoechst: more than 30 years' unbroken, faithful service. By another traditional measure, he is not qualified at all: he is not a chemist. But the 54-year-old former finance director - the first non-technical man to run the show - shows no signs of suffering any deficiencies as a result. Dormann himself suggests that it is partly because he has been around so long that the most radical shake-out yet seen in Germany's much-restructured chemicals sector has so far been the success it has. Hoechst's staff do not see him as an 'occupying force', he says, and he is thus accorded more accolades than resistance. His colleagues, meanwhile, laud him for not succumbing to the paralysing conservatism and aversion to risk which routinely characterise many long-serving German managers. 'Paranoia is a thing of the past,' says one. So, too, is the old hierarchical muddle which used to typify the structure of the world's biggest chemicals group and fourth biggest pharmaceuticals company. On January 1, everything will be turned inside out - officially. The number of operating divisions will be cut from 15 to seven. Clearly separate stand-alone operations will be run as such. Responsibility, exercised centrally for decades, will be distributed. Rewards will be commensurate with performance. The management board will give up a seat to its first foreigner, an American. Questions from the public and press will be answered. And concerns from the population about the chemicals and drugs industries - particularly in Germany - will be addressed in an accessible fashion. Dormann, a skinny, nervous-looking Hessian, has earned much popular credit for instituting all this change. But the reality appears to be that he is what is known in other business cultures as an enabler. His assumption of power in the wake of the unlamented Wolfgang Hilger, a dour man with little appreciation of the merits of communication, has simply released reserves of talent which had been bottled up. Dormann scoffs at any suggestion that outside business consultants have had a hand in his scheme. All the changes and new ideas came from an eight-man team of senior managers called together four weeks before he took control and set seriously to work on the day he moved offices in May. Their proposals were ready by the end of September and approved by the board in early October. All were promoted, and several put in charge of the projects they proposed - a tactic which seems to appeal to Dormann's sense of humour. 'They have to live up to their ideas . . .I told them at the beginning I was not asking them to come in, prepare an analysis and then go off again like other consultants.' Further down the line, he admits, 'it's hard to convince people that they have to get more business- and market- oriented, that they have a bottom-line responsibility, and that they will be paid based on the goals we agree on.' But he insists there has been little resistance to change. Indeed, the works and middle management appear to be suffused with a sense of relief - if not excitement - that the old order has been swept away so comprehensively. 'Even though there are a lot of familiar faces still in the top management, there is a feeling that they have seriously changed their way of looking at and doing things,' says one senior manager. Part of the relief stems from a conviction that it is now inconceivable that the management is capable of repeating the blunders accompanying last year's series of accidents at the group's main site near Frankfurt, when Hoechst's response - dismissiveness, followed by panic  - showed it as disorganised, defensive and arrogant. Dormann is none of these. An industrialist with political skills, he can be engagingly informal but visibly weighs his words before speaking. 'We are not hiding any longer,' he says. 'The main message is that we want to manage our activities based on long-term goals and vision.' Much of the propaganda drive is addressed to German environmental concerns, he acknowledges. It is one of the few areas in which he is prepared to say that domestic issues play a strong part in strategic thinking. Perhaps this is not surprising, given that the company has built its last large-scale chemicals plant in Germany. There is more than enough capacity; the issue is one of managing a reduction in size. Dormann is not afraid to move capacity and even headquarters functions out of the country. The fibres division, one of four core business areas he has identified, is now being run from the US with an American in charge. 'It's not a question of passports or nationalities; it's a question of competence, markets, technology and creativity,' he says. For example, the logical sites for manufacturing chemicals for use in the electronics industry are in Japan rather than Germany, he says. Top priority is now overseas growth: in north America, eastern Europe - above all, in Asia. Just returned from a visit to China, Dormann knew 'that 1.2bn people live there. But seeing it makes the difference. My God, what a lot of tasks we face. We are negotiating four or five joint ventures in the industrial gas business. We might be a little late, but China is such a huge market.' In the US, he would like to add maybe two or three mid-sized pharmaceuticals acquisitions to the existing north American drugs operations - recently bolstered by a minority stake in Copley Pharmaceutical, which specialises in generic products. Since Hoechst took the stake, Copley has been hit by a series of problems including the recall of faulty products. Perhaps surprisingly, Dormann admits that he is not altogether clear what has happened. But then it may be the sort of admission which an 'enabling' executive chairman must be prepared to make, especially in the early stages, if he is properly committed to delegation. 'It's our job here to see the links (between our companies). We try to involve our divisional people in strategy discussion but not in the details of cost-cutting,' he says. The new corporate formation will, he hopes, act as an early warning system. But the changes go far deeper than structure, he says. 'We have changed the mood.'</p>

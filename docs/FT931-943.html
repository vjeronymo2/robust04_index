			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Administration set to press ahead with big cuts in defence spending THE Clinton administration is sticking to its plans to cut defence spending, despite the increased instability in Russia. Mr Les Aspin, the US secretary of defence, who will present a detailed defence budget today, says he cannot wait for everything to settle down, but argues that reduced military spending is still prudent because the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact is permanent. 'These Humpty Dumpties are not going to get put back together again,' he said this week in a speech to the National War College in Washington. President Bill Clinton has already outlined an approximate path for the defence budget that would take spending down to Dollars 264bn in fiscal 1994, around Dollars 12bn less than the Bush administration had planned, with further steady cuts to Dollars 248.4bn in 1997 before a rise to Dollars 254.2bn in 1998. But Mr Clinton also warned that the Bush budget may have understated the costs of the troops and equipment included in its defence planning, while overstating the savings to be achieved from a review of defence management structures. Even the savings contained in the Bush budget, therefore, may prove hard to achieve, let alone the additional savings proposed by Mr Clinton. Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, has warned that he may rebel against the administration's budget plans if he sees a danger to the US military forces. Mr Aspin has been further hampered in his efforts to balance this equation by his recent heart illness, which led to an operation to implant a pacemaker last week. He said the budget was only a first step towards addressing the new threats of regional conflict and nuclear terrorism, as well as dangers further removed from traditional defence planning such as the possible reversal of reform in the former Soviet Union and the economic weakening of the US. Mr Aspin promised a 'really bottom-up review of defence budgets of the future' as soon as this year's budget exercise was completed.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRABUCO CANYON;  </P> <P> DISCUSSION DELAYED ON TRABUCO CANYON PLANS  </P> <P> A meeting to announce the county's recommendation for development of 6,300  acres in the Trabuco Canyon area east of Mission Viejo has been postponed until  Aug. 16.  </P> <P> County officials had planned to meet with area residents at the Trabuco Canyon  fire station Wednesday to discuss their preference for growth in the rugged and  undeveloped area that sits on the edge of Cleveland National Forest. But delays  in firming up that recommendation forced a one-week postponement, said Lynn  Dosherry, chief of the county's land-planning section.  </P> <P> There are 30 development projects in varying stages of planning and approval  that could result in 4,833 new housing units being built in the  Foothill-Trabuco area. Four options for growth are under consideration by  county planners, who indicate that their recommendation may be a hybrid of the  various alternatives.  </P> <P> Residents and environmentalists contend that only a limited number of new,  single-family homes on large lots should be allowed to minimize the impact on  the life style of about 300 homeowners in the area ,as well as on the wildlife  and several thousand oak trees.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors ultimately must adopt a Foothill-Trabuco Specific  Plan, an action that is not likely until late September.  </P></p>

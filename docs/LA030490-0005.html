			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WINTER PALETTE  </P> <P> Regarding "A Winter Palette," by Robert Smaus (Jan. 14), Clarification please:  This is an interesting, well-illustrated article.  </P> <P> But the first sentence on Page 24 says, "then re-roots them in empty pots."  </P> <P> Do these rosettes send out roots in pots with no soil, and are then potted in  the described soil mix?  </P> <P> BOB SCHWEIGHARDT  </P> <P> Escondido  </P> <P> Believe it or not, that is exactly what the Walkers do -- they put the rosettes  in empty pots so the roots have a chance to sprout without the danger of  rotting, which might be caused by moisture in a soil medium. After the roots  are an inch or so long, they put the cuttings in more-conventional, soil-filled  pots.  </P> <P> </P></p>

He said this at the enlarged meeting of the Georgian  Cabinet of Ministers on Wednesday.    According to Shevardnadze, Georgia has overcome its  political  and economic isolation. Namely, it has recently signed a  Russian-Georgian treaty and economic agreements.    On the way out of the crisis, the Georgian leader pointed  out  that the economic processes, including the transition to a  market economy, must be controlled by the state.    Shevardnadze pointed out that this primarily meant control  over wages and prices which must be in mutual conformity.  Taking into consideration the sharp decrease in the Georgian  national currency's (coupons) exchange rate he said that another  currency might be introduced in the republic and be in parallel  use with Georgian coupons. This currency could be rubles or  dollars. However, Shevardnadze emphasized that the coupons must  be made competitive to the foreign currency.</p>

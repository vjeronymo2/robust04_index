			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator of REA has determined that this final rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The program described by this final rule is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under No. 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, Rural Telephone Bank Loans. This catalog is available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR part 1753, Telecommunications System Construction Policies and Procedures, contains guidelines for the preparation of Software License Agreements subject to approval by REA. Efforts to conclude satisfactory license agreements with individual equipment suppliers have been time consuming and in certain cases REA has been unable to reach an agreement that is acceptable to REA and the equipment suppliers. This agreement will permit all REA financed purchases of central office equipment and the suppliers to utilize a common uniform Software License Agreement. The agreement will be an Addendum to all REA financed central office equipment contracts and eliminates the present practice of using individual license agreements negotiated with separate equipment suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> REA amends 7 CFR part 1753, by revising subpart A, &sect;1753.7, paragraph (f)(4), and subpart E, &sect;1753.38, paragraph (a)(2)(i)(J), to indicate that the software license agreement prepared by REA will be an addendum to the central office equipment contract, and to amend &sect;1753.38, paragraph (c), by revising the software license agreement. Additionally, it removes &sect;1753.38, paragraph (a)(2)(iii), which instructs the borrower to review the proposed software licensing agreement and obtain REA approval, if required. This final rule eliminates the need for instructions since the software agreement has been prepared by REA and approved by the Administrator prior to presentation to suppliers. It is also amended by adding a form to &sect;1755.93.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public comments were received from Alcatel Network Systems, Inc., AT&amp;T Network Systems, Commonwealth Telephone Company, Hastad Engineering Co., Mitel Public Switching, Northern Telecom Inc., Redcom Laboratories, Inc., and Seimens Stromberg-Carlson. The comments, recommendations and responses are summarized as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter felt REA should have one universal software license for all software controlled devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The use of a universal software license has been considered by REA but is not viable at this time because of the large difference in types of equipment and the requirements of various REA contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that their switch uses firmware, which is hardware based and sold with the product, rather than software, therefore, they are not required to have a software agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REA does not require an executed software license agreement. If the vendor requires an executed software/firmware license agreement, then the only one acceptable to REA is the REA prepared Software License Agreement (Addendum 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter feels that it is in the best interest of the Licensor and the REA Borrowers to use its existing standard form Software License, or failing that, to use the currently approved REA Negotiated License instead of the REA prepared Software License Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / German economists call for interest rate cut Germany's respected Ifo economics institute yesterday added its voice to a growing chorus calling for the Bundesbank to help push the economy out of recession with lower interest rates. But the bank appeared determined not to move until it had a clearer picture of inflationary prospects. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said on Thursday night that monetary policy had been put on 'hold' until policy-makers had more information. 'We will wait until we can see how things develop,' he said after a routine council meeting at which the short-term discount and lombard rates were left unchanged at 5.75 per cent and 6.75 per cent respectively. The Munich-based Ifo recommended a reduction in money market rates to about 3 or 4 per cent by the end of this year. Experience showed that reduced short-term rates did not result in higher long-term rates. As Mr Tietmeyer stressed at his Thursday meeting with journalists, more than two-thirds of all private investment in Germany is financed with long-term borrowings. The central bank traditionally focuses most of its attention on this end of the money market. The call from Ifo followed earlier accusations from the DIW institute in Berlin that the Bundesbank's go-slow policy was prolonging the recession. The discount and lombard rates were last cut on October 22. More information on inflationary trends - notably the latest consumer price figures and end-of-year money supply figures - will be available for consideration at the bank's next council meeting on January 20. The bank yesterday confirmed earlier estimates which showed the M3 measure of money supply growing at an annualised rate of 7.2 per cent in November, well above the upper limit of last year's target range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent. Inflation is also expected to be pushed up this month by new duties on fuel and higher charges for services. The bank, which last month tightened its M3 target range to 4 to 6 per cent, has already warned that it expects money supply figures early this year to be distorted by a 'monetary over-hang' from last year.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Suharto puts Miyazawa on the spot PRESIDENT Suharto of Indonesia yesterday placed Japan in an embarrassing position when he reiterated his desire to attend the meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Tokyo in July. Relations between the two countries are close, with Indonesia being the largest recipient of Japanese aid, but the request would require consensus approval by the G7, which would be unlikely. Mr Suharto is chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), which groups more than 100, mostly developing, nations. He has called for a restructuring of debt for the poorest countries and greater access to the markets of developed nations. After meeting Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister in Jakarta as part of a four-nation tour of South-East Asia, a Japanese spokesman said Japan would consult its G7 partners. 'It is not an easy thing to try to achieve consensus among the G7,' he warned. Diplomats say the Indonesian government regards the attendance, even if in the margins, of President Boris Yeltsin of Russia at a G7 summit last year as setting a precedent to allow non-member countries to participate. But a G7 diplomat yesterday noted 'Russia was an immediate and very pressing issue, while ordinarily the G7 would not discuss north-south matters. It is not what the G7 does. It's not the way aid is administered.' Indonesia may, however, take the issue as a test of Mr Miyazawa's foreign policy initiative of promoting regional co-operation. As chairman of NAM, Indonesia does have some leverage over Japan. Both countries agree on the need to restructure the United Nations and expand the Security Council. Diplomats say that Japan is keen to become a permanent member of an expanded Security Council but would need the votes of non-aligned member countries to secure a seat.</p>

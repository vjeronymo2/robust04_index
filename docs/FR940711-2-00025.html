Should additional categories, merged categories or part categories be added to the bilateral agreement or become subject to import quotas, the entire category(s) or part category(s) shall be included in the coverage of this arrangement on an agreed effective date. Goods exported during the period July 15, 1994 through August 15, 1994 shall not be denied entry for lack of a visa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A visa must accompany each commercial shipment of the aforementioned textile products. A circular stamped marking in blue ink will appear on the front of the original export license/commercial invoice or successor document. The license will be printed on a purple guilloche pattern background. The original visa shall not be stamped on duplicate copies of the invoice. The original invoice with the original visa stamp will be required to enter the shipment into the United States. Duplicates of the invoice and/or visa may not be used for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each visa stamp shall include the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The visa number. The visa number shall be in the standard nine digit letter format, beginning with one numerical digit for the last digit of the year of export, followed by the two character alpha country code specified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)(the code for China is ``CN''), and a six digit numerical serial number identifying the shipment; e.g., 4CN123456. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

The correct category(s), merged category(s), part category(s), quantity(s) and unit(s) of quantity in the shipment as set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Correlation and in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS or successor documents) shall be reported in the spaces provided within the visa stamp (e.g., ``Cat. 340&hyph;510 DOZ''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quantities must be stated in whole numbers. Decimals or fractions will not be accepted. Merged category quota merchandise may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category visa or the correct category visa corresponding to the actual shipment (e.g., Categories 347/348 may be visaed as 347/348 or if the shipment consists solely of 347 merchandise, the shipment may be visaed as ``Cat. 347,'' but not as ``Cat. 348''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Customs shall not permit entry if the shipment does not have a visa, or if the visa number, date of issuance, signature, category, quantity or units of quantity are missing, incorrect or illegible, or have been crossed out or altered in any way. If the quantity indicated on the visa is less than that of the shipment, entry shall not be permitted. If the quantity indicated on the visa is more than that of the shipment, entry shall be permitted and only the amount entered shall be charged to any applicable quota. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the visa is not acceptable then a new visa must be obtained from the Government of the People's Republic of China, replacement visa issued by the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Washington, D.C., or a visa waiver may be issued by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements at the request of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Washington, D.C., and presented to the U.S. Customs Service before any portion of the shipment will be released. The waiver, if used, only waives the requirement to present a visa with the shipment. It does not waive the quota requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The replacement visa shall consist of a Textile Export Visa/Invoice form bearing an official Chinese Embassy embossed stamp on the front and include the standard information required on an export visa and the signature of an official authorized by the Government of the People's Republic of China to issue replacement visas. The signature must match one of two original signatures of authorized officials provided to the Government of the United States by the Government of the People's Republic of China. U.S. Customs shall not permit entry of the shipment if any of the information required on the replacement visa is missing, incorrect or illegible, or has been crossed out or altered in any way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If import quotas are in force, U.S. Customs Service shall charge only the actual quantity in the shipment to the correct category limit. If a shipment from the People's Republic of China has been allowed entry into the commerce of the United States with either an incorrect visa or no visa, and redelivery is requested but cannot be made, U.S. Customs shall charge the shipment to the correct category limit whether or not a replacement visa or visa waiver is provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The complete name and address of a company actually involved in the manufacturing process of the textile product covered by the visa shall be provided on the textile visa document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Merchandise imported for the personal use of the importer and not for resale, regardless of value, and properly marked commercial sample shipments valued at U.S.$250 or less, do not require a visa for entry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The visa stamp remains unchanged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The actions taken concerning the Government of the People's Republic of China with respect to imports of textiles and textile products in the foregoing categories have been determined by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States.

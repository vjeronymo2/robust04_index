			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Excessive stocks keep wool market in doldrums THE WORLD wool market has deteriorated rapidly in the past three months, according to the latest report from the International Wool Textile Organisation. A forecast fall in supplies has not been as significant as expected, mainly because of large stocks carried over in Argentina and a higher than expected clip in Australia. On the demand side economic problems have kept western European purchases down, while Japan has 'excessively large' stocks of yarns, fabrics and completed garments. The former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, which played an important role in expanding wool demand during the 1980s, have stayed away from the market, while Chinese buying has not been as strong as in 1991-92. Last week the Australian wool indicator price fell by 22 cents to 459 cents a kilogram. The Australian Council of Wool Exporters said on Monday that prices would remain under pressure and reported the largest offering of the season so far - 146,594 bales. The New Zealand Wool Board has advised its farmers not to send wool to auction while prices are so low. The IWTO has revised upwards its estimate for the 1992-93 clip by 3,000 tonnes and for the 1991-92 carry-over stocks by 34,000 tonnes. Total availability of wool (production plus carry-over stocks) is now put at 2.3m tonnes for 1992-93, up from a November estimate of 2.26m. While this is well below the 2.45m tonnes of 1991-92, it is still well ahead of the 1986-91 average of 2.04m tonnes. Since November the IWTO has reduced its clip estimates for New Zealand, South Africa, Lesotho and Namibia, but has raised the Australian estimate from 549,000 tonnes to 557,000 tonnes.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GERMAN BANKER WARNS OF RATES  </P> <P> The head of West Germany's powerful central bank said today that German  economic unification need not lead to a surge in interest rates.  </P> <P> But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, speaking on the eve of international  monetary talks, gave a clear warning to Bonn politicians that rate fears will  subside only if East and West German marks were swapped at a rate that makes  economic sense.  </P> <P> "If we set a solid and economically sensible framework for this unification  process which does not endanger price stability in West Germany, the fears of a  further rise in interest rates are unfounded," Poehl told journalists.  </P> <P> Poehl's remarks after Franco-German economic talks appeared calculated to calm  nervous financial markets ahead of Saturday's meeting here of the Group of  Seven industrial nations -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France,  Britain, Italy and Canada.  </P></p>

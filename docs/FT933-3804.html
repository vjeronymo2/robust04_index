			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: FDA move knocks SmithKline MORE bad news hit SmithKline Beecham shares yesterday when the drugs group failed to obtain US approval for a mild version of Tagamet, its anti-ulcer drug. The Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group had applied to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell a diluted form of the treatment without prescription as an antidote to heartburn. However, at a meeting late on Thursday, the FDA came back with a series of questions that had to be dealt with before approval could be given. A favourable decision could have added between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m a year to the company's earnings. It would also have countered the effect of Tagamet coming off patent in the US next May. In the event, the decision added to news that SmithKline Units might be withdrawn from the FT-A Actuaries indices if new rules are imposed by the Stock Exchange. The shares fell 12 to 417p yesterday with some dealers talking of switching into Glaxo. Glaxo shares continued strong following Thursday's surprise dividend hike. There was heavy buying in the US late on Thursday and further buying in London yesterday which saw the shares rise 12 to 640p.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Dutch, Belgian rate cuts dominate trading SMALL interest rate cuts in the Netherlands and Belgium dominated trading in European government bonds yesterday, leading to a late rally in most European markets yesterday. ALTHOUGH Germany was closed for a holiday, the impact fed through into the German bond market, as speculation mounted that a German interest rate cut may follow shortly. The German bund future on the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange rose  1/4 point to close at 91.26. Dealers said the reaction was exaggerated because of thin volume due to the holiday. THE 10 basis-point cut in the Dutch special advances rate to 8.70 per cent yesterday pushed Dutch rates below German rates once again. The special advances rate is comparable to the German repo rate, currently 8.75 per cent, which added to expectations that the repo rate is set to fall. The Belgian central bank again moved in tandem with the Dutch, cutting its overnight rate by five basis points. 'Although German interest rates are on the way down, (yesterday's rate cuts are) a flimsy reason to conclude that there will be a imminent German rate cut,' said Mr Klaus Baader, an economist at UBS Phillips and Drew. 'The two currencies (guilder and Belgian franc) move in tandem, and (the central banks) have clearly reacted to the strength of the currencies.' NEWS of the Dutch and Belgian rate cuts prompted renewed buying interest in the gilts market, even from some foreign accounts which had disappeared following sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September. A 0.1 per cent increase in retail sales for October helped improve the tone in the gilts market. After a quiet day's trading, the market suddenly put on a spurt at the end of the day, bouncing a full point. US Treasury prices firmed across the maturity range yesterday after the Federal Reserve chose to add permanently to reserves. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 101 13/32 , yielding 7.501 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  5/32 , at 99 15/32 , for a yield of 4.520 per cent. Trading was subdued throughout the morning. News that the US trade gap narrowed in September, from Dollars 9bn in the previous month to Dollars 8.3bn was in line with market expectations. Prices gained ground in the afternoon after the Fed bought coupons outright, pushing prices higher as dealers covered short positions and retail investors upped their demand. The market was also helped by the announcement that the Treasury would sell Dollars 15bn in two-year notes and Dollars 10.75bn in five-year notes next week, in line with market expectations.</p>

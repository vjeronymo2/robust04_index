			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LEGION FATE OF WOODLAND HILLS WEST LEFT IN THE DARK BY SUSPENDED GAME  </P> <P> It's possible that Ryan McGuire of Woodland Hills West will have better days  than the one he had Monday in the American Legion California State baseball  championships.  </P> <P> Possible, but not likely.  </P> <P> McGuire hit two home runs, including a grand slam, and drove in eight runs on  four hits against Napa in a game to determine a berth in the Western Regional  playoffs.  </P> <P> And yet when McGuire awoke this morning, he and his teammates were frozen in  limbo, as the busy slugfest against Napa was called after seven innings on  account of darkness with Woodland Hills West leading, 18-12. The game is to be  resumed this morning at 8.  </P> <P> "It's cool and all," McGuire, 17, said of his day at the plate. "But I would  have rather K'd (struck out) every time if we could have won the game."  </P> <P> Should Woodland Hills win, it will play Fullerton in the tournament title game  later today. Should Woodland Hills lose, its tournament stay will be over.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, West rallied in the final three innings to pull out a 9-7  victory over San Leandro to advance to the game against Napa.  </P> <P> With his team trailing, 5-1, in the seventh, third baseman Del Marine smashed a  grand slam to left-center field to tie the game. Bobby Kim and Carl McFadden  added run-scoring hits to give Woodland Hills a 7-5 lead it would never  relinquish.  </P> <P> The winner of this morning's resumed game will automatically clinch a spot in  the Western Regionals next week as the top two finishers earn berths.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RIGHT TACK;  </P> <P> FROM THE AMBIVALENT TO THE AMBITIOUS, YOUTHS TAKE TO THE LAKE FOR RACES AT THE  WESTLAKE YACHT CLUB  </P> <P> Chip Werner, a 9-year-old former landlubber with a week of sailing lessons  behind him, was about to take part in the first regatta of his life last Sunday  afternoon. If he was nervous, it didn't show when he casually approached no  less an authority figure than the rear commodore of the Westlake Yacht Club and  inquired, "After the race, then are we allowed to just sail around?"  </P> <P> To Werner, the elaborate ritual of racing regattas was standing in the way of  further fun on the lake. There were those colored flags that he was supposed to  decipher. And lots of blasts from an air horn that signaled something. And  markers on the water that had to be followed. All he wanted to do was jump into  his 8-foot sabot and run with the wind.  </P> <P> "That's what I really like," he said.  </P> <P> The Westlake Yacht Club is also hoping that once Chip begins to understand the  rituals, he'll like racing enough to make it a lifelong sport, perhaps even  reaching the heights achieved by one of its former junior members, Allison  Jolly. Jolly, along with crew Lynne Jewell, won a sailing gold medal in last  year's Olympic Games.  </P> <P> Chip was the youngest sailor -- the oldest among the 14 competitors was 15 --  in Sunday's Bill Vrooman Memorial Regatta, which got the same treatment from  club members as the big regattas that draw some of the best sailors in the  country to the 150-acre man-made lake. Chip would be racing in the B class  against sailors who had more experience but still had never won a regatta. Once  a sailor wins in B, he must move up to the A class.  </P> <P> Standing on the dock in front of the club, Chip felt a sudden breeze ripple  across the water, starching the sail on the sabot. Almost every day at this  time, the ocean wind funnels down the Conejo grade and turns Westlake into a  sailor's paradise.  </P> <P> Ron Hine, the rear commodore who runs the regattas, also noticed the wind  making its daily appearance. He was talking to Chip's parents when he saw a  young sailor on the lake take advantage of a gust. Sailing a nimble C-13, the  boy extended his body over the port side in a maneuver known as "hiking out,"  and the boat sped across the lake, its sail nearly touching the water on the  starboard side.  </P> <P> Hine pointed to the boy and said, "That'll be Chip in a couple of years."  </P> <P> The air horn sounded and Chip looked up at the observation tower where a white  flag was being hoisted. An A-class heat would start in precisely 10 minutes,  the Bs five minutes after that. All the young sailors started to prepare their  boats, mindful of the red-and-yellow flag on the tower that told them to wear  their life jackets.  </P> <P> Each class would race on specially marked courses that wouldn't be made known  until the race committee announced it by hanging a number from the tower. The  sailors would have to read a chart of the lake in their boat and figure out the  right course, which wasn't easy for inexperienced navigators. The circular  course took the sailors to an island about a quarter-mile away and back to a  dam before winding up at the finish line in front of the club.  </P> <P> Sailing races, even within the intimate confines of a lake, don't generate the  same kind of hysteria as, say, a football game. Mostly, parents and other  observers sat under green umbrellas on the deck during the races and enjoyed  the scenery, occasionally scanning the lake for signs of junior's progress.  </P> <P> Hine was kept busier than all but the sailors while the races went on. As rear  commodore, his white flag flies third from left on the mast that rises above  the deck. It's his responsibility to deal with problems. When another club  member noticed a sailboat tied to a marker in the middle of the race course,  Hine started the 6-volt battery in his trusty 15-foot Electra, the Rot 'n Don,  and went to investigate.  </P> <P> The Electra rolled over the water at about 3 to 4 knots and Hine, a retired  banker who lives on the lake, popped a Beach Boys tape into his stereo system.  "Never a wake and no noise," he said about his boat, which was custom-built for  him and his wife Dot. "You don't have to have a 50-foot yacht to have fun."  </P> <P> Hine steered to the sailboat and saw two teen-age girls sunbathing inside.  "These marks are private," he told them in a friendly way. "We have a race  going on and would appreciate it if you would cast off." The girls obliged and  Hine headed back to the dock. Passing a sabot, he saw two small girls having  trouble making headway.  </P> <P> "Let the sail out," Hine instructed them, "then pull the rudder back to you."  When the boat was under control, he said, "Now you're sailing!"  </P> <P> Hine relaxed under the Electra's canopy and set a course to the island to check  the progress of the race. Despite the wind, the tiny sailboats were tacking  slowly across the lake and Hine was able to putter up next to the leaders in  the A class, Ryan Coyle, 14, and Brian Foster, 12. Each sailor was trimming his  sails like an old salt. At the end of the race, Coyle and Foster were bow and  bow until Foster's sabot edged ahead to win by a half-boat length.  </P> <P> "Ryan is a real comer," Hine said, "and Brian is a natural. He can feel a  change of wind on his cheek."  </P> <P> Foster's communion with the wind is no accident. When he was 2, "I got  interested watching flags blow in the wind," he said. At 4, he was building his  own kites. Four years ago, his mother, whose parents live at the lake, gave him  sailing lessons at the club. "He kind of goes with the wind," said Karen Foster  Caruso, who lives in Newbury Park.  </P> <P> While Brian went off to practice rigging a C-13 and wait for the next heat, the  B class finished its race, and Chip Werner was first across the finish line.  Happy to see him do well was his stepfather, Frank Marshall of Agoura, a  lifelong sailor who would "rather have Chip out here sailing than hanging  around video arcades."  </P> <P> But Chip's win didn't count. In the tower, race committee chairman Don Anderson  disqualified the B class for sailing on the wrong side of a marker. The  youngsters could protest, "But we have a saying at the club: The protest  committee meets at midnight and you have to be present," said Anderson, who was  wearing a T-shirt that read: "Sailing -- the fine art of getting soaked and  becoming sick whilst slowly going nowhere at great expense."  </P> <P> Anderson excused himself and got ready for the next heat. When Lois  Littlefield, who was in charge of the official clock, counted down to zero and  blasted the air horn, Anderson hoisted the white flag. But neither Chip Werner  nor Brian Foster fared well. When the regatta finally ended, Coyle won the A  class and Eric Steelberg took the B. Afterward, the young sailors snacked on  cake in the clubhouse, and Chip was finally able to get out on the lake by  himself.  </P></p>

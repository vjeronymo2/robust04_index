			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NEW YORK RACING SLIPPING, ITS BIAS SHOWING  </P> <P> Even after Sunday Silence won the Breeders' Cup Classic, defeating Easy Goer  for the third time in four meetings, trainer Charlie Whittingham wasn't  convinced his colt would be named the horse of the year for 1989. "He'll have a  chance," Whittingham said. "But the New York writers are difficult, and the  ones in New Jersey are no bargain. Time will tell."  </P> <P> This has been a recurring theme of the rivalry between the two colts, with  Sunday Silence's loyalists insisting that he never has received proper respect  because of his California origins. Whittingham grumbled that New Yorkers would  hail any Easy Goer victory as a brilliant achievement and dismiss any Sunday  Silence victory as a fluke. Indeed, Steve Crist wrote in The New York Times  that Easy Goer would establish himself as the horse of the decade if he won the  Classic. When Sunday Silence scored his brilliant, decisive victory, he  received no such anointment.  </P> <P> The Easy Goer-Sunday Silence rivalry not only exposed a lot of Eastern  provincialism, but it also reflected the declining condition of New York racing  in general. Like the post-Copernican clerics, New Yorkers are learning that  they no longer dwell at the center of the universe, but many of them still are  decrying this truth as heresy.  </P> <P> Until the late 1970s, New York was the site of most of America's definitive  championship races. The winner of the Woodward Stakes was named the horse of  the year 12 times in a 20-year span. But in the 1980s, the whole face of U.S.  racing has changed.  </P> <P> The Breeders' Cup has robbed many of the year-end New York stakes of their  traditional importance. California offers more purse money than New York and  its major stakes are drawing fields at least as strong as their counterparts in  the East. Tracks around the country have created new big-money stakes as  box-office attractions. And in most cases the New York Racing Association has  not made noticeable efforts to counter this increased competition.  </P> <P> Consider the cases of the 105-year-old Suburban Handicap and the 2-year-old  Pimlico Special. Both races attempt to attract older male horses at roughly the  same distance at roughly the same time of the year. But Pimlico aggressively  promoted its new attraction, offered a $700,000 purse and attempted to lure top  horses from all over the country. In its first two years, the Special has drawn  fields as strong as any race in America but the Breeders' Cup Classic.  </P> <P> By contrast, the New York Racing Association puts up $350,000 for the Suburban  and lets it rest on its reputation. This year not a single out-of-town horse  shipped to New York for the race, which was won by Dancing Spree -- his only  non-sprint victory of the year. In 1988 the Suburban drew a field of four; in  1987 a weak field of five. It bears no resemblance to the race that used to be  a showcase for great champions like Kelso, Damascus and Dr. Fager.  </P> <P> What has happened to the Suburban has happened to race after race on the New  York stakes calendar. Even the ones with Grade I status and noble histories are  drawing small, uncompetitive fields. It is easy for a good horse to win them.  As a result, New York has been regularly producing horses who roar through  these famous races and look so dominant that the local media hail them as  superstars.  </P> <P> Devil's Bag was lauded as a potential horse of the decade as a 2-year-old in  New York in 1983, but flopped out of town the next spring. Ogygian (remember  him?) was hailed as a budding superhorse in 1986. And in 1987, New Yorkers  denigrated Alysheba, who never ducked a challenge, and insisted that the best  horse in America was Java Gold, who never left New York but looked so  impressive beating a five-horse field in the Marlboro Cup.  </P> <P> Easy Goer is a great racehorse but he is also the epitome of this New York  syndrome. His record in graded stakes in New York is a perfect nine for nine.  In graded stakes outside New York he is zero for four. But what was most  telling about New York racing, and about the Eastern media bias that  Whittingham decries, was the period between the Belmont Stakes and the  Breeders' Cup.  </P> <P> Easy Goer's Belmont victory had been a smashing one, but he still was one for  three against Sunday Silence and had much to prove. But when he beat the  undistinguished Its Acedemic in the Woodward Stakes at Belmont, he was hailed  as if the race were still a definitive championship event. When he crossed the  finish line ahead of Forever Silver in the Whitney Stakes at Saratoga, track  announcer Marshall Cassidy hailed "New York's horse of the year, Easy Goer."  </P> <P> It may be important to keep a sense of perspective about New York stakes races  next season, for Easy Goer might never again race anywhere but Belmont Park --  the site of the 1990 Breeders' Cup. Trainer Shug McGaughey said his colt's  first objective will be Belmont Park's archaic Handicap Triple Crown series,  which includes the Suburban Handicap. It already is a safe bet he will win it  against a weak field, and that the Eastern media will hail him as a superhorse  for doing so.  </P></p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Sales of machine tools recover The UK machine tool market is emerging from three years of recession, figures from the Central Statistical Office indicated yesterday. They showed a 13.6 per cent rise in domestic sales in the three months to November compared with the three previous months. The figures were based on 1990 constant prices, seasonally adjusted. Export sales fell 24.3 per cent, underlining the severity of the recession in important continental export markets such as Germany. The fall in exports left total sales for the UK industry down 3.3 per cent from the previous three months and 11.6 per cent lower than a year before. The UK machine tool industry has been one of the worst hit by the clampdown on capital spending by the country's industry since 1991. Evidence of a recovery has broad implications that go beyond the machine tool industry. One supplier of press-working equipment, Swiss-owned Bruderer UK, said this week that turnover was running 80 per cent up on 1992. Other builders of machine tools are known to be busier than at any time in the past three years. At current prices, total sales averaged Pounds 74.5m a month in the three months to November, down 0.7 per cent on the same period a year before. That drop was caused by a fall of 17.1 per cent in export sales, partially offset by a rise of 5.8 per cent in domestic sales. The Machine Tool Technologies Association said total exports fell 12.5 per cent to Pounds 147.1m in the first half of last year. Exports to the US, the biggest single market for UK machine tools, rose nearly 20 per cent while sales to Germany, the second-largest market, sank by 45 per cent. China, which ranked as only the 22nd-biggest market for the UK's machine tools in the first half of 1992, leapt into third place a year later, with a 512 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 12.1m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 23 Jun (MTI) -- "The visit achieved our  goals, this is as much as could be desired," Hungarian President  Arpad Goncz said on Thursday, summing up the results of his  three-day unofficial visit to the United States with Slovak  President Michal Kovac.    The Hungarian president said the entire visit was  characterized by a pleasant atmosphere, and can unequivocally be  termed as useful for both Hungary and Slovakia.    The two presidents received honours from the New York-based  Institute for East-West Studies, in recognition of their  activity for international reconciliation.    "Thanks to splendid organization by the host institute, we  had an opportunity both in Washington and in New York to meet  with the political elite that shapes public opinion and  participates in decision-making," Goncz said.    "The discussions created an opportunity for me to set forth  issues through which I was able to clarify the recurring  misunderstandings, including the one whereby Hungary, through  its minority policy, is a trouble-maker and danger factor in  Central Europe," the President said.    U.S. President Bill Clinton received the Hungarian and  Slovak  Presidents at the White House.    On Thursday, Goncz and Kovac held a lecture in the morning,  and attended an informal discussion at the Foreign Relations  Council. The topics of the meeting were the more general Central  European issues.    The Hungarian president will conclude his vist to the United  States and leave New York for Budapest on Thursday evening.</p>

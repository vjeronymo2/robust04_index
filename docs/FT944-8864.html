			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japanese trading houses forecast profits growth - Trading companies Japan's five biggest trading companies, which provide a diversified measure of the health of the economy at large, yesterday forecast their first profits rises in four years. Trading house earnings, sensitive to domestic and foreign demand for goods and services and to changes in world commodity prices, were down or flat in the first half of the year, according to financial results released yesterday. However, the traders, at the heart of Japan's vast keiretsu corporate families, forecast that recurring profits - before tax and extraordinary items - in the full year to next March would, on average, rise 3.5 per cent. They will be helped by the slow recovery of the Japanese economy and a reduction in the debts built up to finance takeovers and diversifications in the 1980s. Yet the revival will be constrained by the strength of the yen, the main reason why full-year sales are expected to fall by an average of 3 per cent. All of the top five expect a rise in full-year recurring profits, except for Marubeni, which nevertheless expects a rise at the net level. This implies that the second half will show a significant improvement on the first half, when three out of the five reported a fall in recurring profits by comparison with the first six months of last year. Mitsubishi, the strongest of the group, and Itochu, reported only marginal profits increases. First-half sales declined by an average of 2.5 per cent across the sector, except at Marubeni. It managed a 1 per cent sales increase, helped by exports of industrial plant - worth around 30 per cent of gross profits - to other Asian countries. Sumitomo also stood out from the pack for its 16 per cent rise in operating profit in the first half, forecast to rise to 42 per cent for the year. It has a higher exposure to metal trading than the others and so has benefited from the strong rise in copper prices during the period, although sharp cuts in head office costs also helped. Sumitomo and and Marubeni have their respective specialities, machinery and metals, to thank for the fact that they were the only traders to manage a rise in export sales in the first six months. The rest saw the yen value of the their foreign sales eroded by the continuing rise in the Japanese currency, by 6 per cent against the dollar over the period. Domestic demand for foreign consumer goods started to climb sharply in the spring, but the overall domestic economy was still sluggish enough to produce a decline in total sales for most traders' import businesses. International trade in cars and steel was generally weaker, while food imports rose, said Mr Kazuhiko Usami, managing director of the Japan Foreign Trade Council, the trading houses' association. Marubeni was worst hit, with an 18.9 per cent decline in imports. Trading companies' profits improvement is expected to lag Japan's general economic recovery because they continue to be burdened by write-offs on ill-judged experiments with financial engineering in the 1980s. The sector's extraordinary losses on the disposal of so-called tokkin, in-house investment trusts, fell on average and are expected to continue to decline. At the same time, some of them are still paying start-up costs on diversifications outside their core trading businesses, like Mitsubishi in satellite communications and Sumitomo in cable television.  -----------------------------------------------------------------               INTERIM RESULTS TO SEPTEMBER 1994 (YBN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------                                Sales         Recurring       Net                                                 profit*   profit  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Marubeni  1994                        6,806.5            15.587     5.308  1993                        6,740.5            20.625     7.032  Forecast, year             15,000.0            38.000    13.000 Mitsui                             -                 -         -  1994                        7,495.3            21.691     8.778  1993                        7,657.0            23.535     8.377  Forecast, year             15,000.0            48.500    21.500 Mitsubishi  1994                        6,635.8            27.833     8.337  1993                        6,918.4            27.626     8.035  Forecast, year             13,000.0            55.000    15.000 Itochu  1994                        7,729.5            18.629     4.524  1993                        7,879.4            18.507     3.721  Forecast, year             15,500.0            36.000     9.000 Sumitomo  1994                        7,218.7            17.010     7.444  1993                        7,553.1            18.013     9.111  Forecast, year             15,000.0            36.000    15.000  ----------------------------------------------------------------- *Before extraordinary items and tax  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

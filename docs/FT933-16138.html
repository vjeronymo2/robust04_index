			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Caricom summit to discuss Nafta relief LEADERS of the 13-nation Caribbean Community begin their annual summit today seeking ways to cushion the region's small, open and fragile economies and to limit the dislocation caused by changes in the global economy. High on the summit's agenda will be the potentially damaging impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Despite delays in the path of the agreement's implementation, the Caricom countries are pressing ahead with plans to protect their preferential markets in the US and Canada, particularly from Mexican products. Caricom and Central American states are pinning many hopes on draft legislation being proposed by Mr Sam Gibbons, a Florida congressman who is chairman of the trade subcommittee of the House ways and means committee. It asks that regional exports to the US which are not now given preferential access should be treated favourably for the first three years of Nafta. The 24 countries in central America and the Caribbean benefiting from Washington's Caribbean Basin Initiative for the past nine years have suffered a collective trade deficit with the US, and they have argued that they could do better if several products, now denied, could be given preferential treatment under the 'Nafta parity bill'. These include textile and apparel, footwear and other leather goods and petroleum products. During the three years the CBI countries would have the opportunity of negotiating their future trade relationship with the Nafta signatories, with options of seeking membership either as individual states or as a group such as the Central American Common Market or Caricom. They would also have a safety net in that they could return to the status quo under the CBI. The Caricom leaders will also deal with the controversy over access for bananas to the European market, particularly the continuing efforts by Latin American producers to have the the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rule on the propriety of the EC's new import regime, implemented last week, which favours fruit from traditional sources, including the Caribbean, while limiting access to cheaper Latin American fruit. Since it was created 20 years ago, Caricom has struggled, with limited success, to realise the integration of the region's economies, leading eventually to the creation of a common market. Several delegates to the summit have suggested that unless the deliberations conclude at the weekend with clear indications of how Caricom intends to deal with these and other problems, public credibility in the achievement of a common market for its 6m people will fall even lower.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KATELLA'S REED STANDS STRONG, COMES BACK TO BEAT ESTANCIA  </P> <P> Katella High School's coach Larry Anderson is glad he stayed with his new  quarterback, Chris Reed, even though Katella trailed Estancia early during  Friday night's game against Estancia.  </P> <P> Reed rallied the Knights, picking apart the Eagle secondary by completing 16 of  28 passes for 248 yards and two touchdowns to lead Katella to a 28-14 victory  at Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> Reed found Art Vance for a 67-yard completion that tied the game at 7-7 with  4:11 left in the first half. Reed sealed Katella's first victory of the year  with a 12-yarder to Vance in the left corner of the end zone to make it 28-14  with 2:42 to play.  </P> <P> "If he gets the protection, Reed is one of the best passing quarterbacks in the  county," Anderson said, "but last week, Orange had great pass pressure and kept  Reed on his back."

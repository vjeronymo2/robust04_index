			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Drug reforms cause split THE DRUGS industry and the medical world split yesterday over reforms in drug-prescribing set out by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, after the Autumn Statement. The number of drugs from which doctors can choose is to be cut, with cheaper treatments being given priority. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry attacked the changes as limiting doctors' choice in treating patients. Dr John Griffin, director of the association, said: 'Cheapest medicines are not necessarily the best medicines.' But the move received qualified approval from the British Medical Association. It said: 'This is the least unpalatable way of getting drug prices down.' Ten categories of drugs are affected, including oral contraceptives, allergy drugs and some skin treatments. Most of the manufacturers concerned are non-UK companies. Swiss-owned Ciba-Geigy has 13 per cent of the market for anti-rheumatic skin treatments with Emulgel. Two other Ciba-Geigy products take 2 per cent of the Pounds 5.4m anaemia market. Germany's Schering has 40 per cent of the Pounds 54m UK market for oral contraceptives. ICI Pharmaceuticals and Wellcome said that they did not make drugs in any of the 10 categories. Glaxo, the world's biggest drug company, might lose revenue from a hayfever treatment and some steroid skin creams, but the loss would be small compared with total revenues. Many of the drugs in the categories listed are also available without a prescription. Boots, Britain's biggest seller of over-the-counter drugs, said that some patients might be encouraged to buy from pharmacies rather than go to their doctors. The proposals extend a scheme introduced in 1985 which now lists 154 approved products in seven categories, including laxatives and cough and cold remedies. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said that since the 1985 scheme was introduced no research work had been conducted in these areas in the UK. It said past experience had shown that introducing limited lists reduces investment by industry into new treatments.</p>

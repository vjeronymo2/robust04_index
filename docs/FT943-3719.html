			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Mercury charges for 'free' mobile phone calls Mercury One-2-One, the mobile-telephone company that markets itself on its offer of free local calls, has been charging customers for calls made in 'free' periods. Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, said it had received nearly 50 complaints from One-2-One customers who were aggrieved at charges for local calls made in the evenings and at weekends when they are supposed to be free. 'This is a significant number of complaints about a single issue, and we are looking into it,' Oftel said. The complaints concern One-2-One's incorrect billing and the company's failure to guarantee compensation to users affected by it. Mercury One-2-One said there was a 'problem' of incorrect charges for a 'minute proportion' of calls made in free periods. It said the charges were caused by the 'vagaries of a radio-based system' when relating to the standard call zones of British Telecommunications. The company normally reimburses customers only when they complain for the first time. 'We explain to them why this happens, and that in some cases they also gain from the vagaries,' it said. It added that it had no plans to change its policy of not reimbursing customers for subsequent complaints. Mercury One-2-One, which was launched a year ago, covers a large part of the south-east. The company trades heavily on lower prices as compensation for narrower geographical coverage than the rival cellular networks operated by Vodafone, Cellnet and Orange. It has about 130,000 subscribers out of a UK cellular market of about 2.7m. BT, the target of much of One-2-One's promotion, has begun attacking One-2-One claims to be price-competitive with the fixed network. Last week it dismissed as 'nonsense' claims that One-2-One's latest tariff package for daytime business users calling from a single 'cell' worked out cheaper than BT, once fixed rental and handset costs were taken into account. However, One-2-One appears to be significantly more successful than Orange, which was launched in April. According to the FT's Mobile Communications newsletter, One-2-One signed up 17,500 net new subscribers in August, compared with only 6,000 for Orange, which has wider coverage. Orange disputed the figures, but declined yesterday to release any of its own. The number of mobile-phone subscribers is growing at an annual rate of about 50 per cent and the two new operators are creating competition in the market. However, they are anxious to avoid an all-out price war, which would erode margins.</p>

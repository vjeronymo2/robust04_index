			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: German commercial banks in EC protest THE German Banking Federation, representing the commercial banking sector, yesterday agreed to make a formal complaint to Brussels about new rules allowing Germany's powerful state banks to register a big increase in their asset base. The big private sector banks, including Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank, are furious at the new ruling which allows the state banks to include the assets of their housing finance subsidiaries in their working capital base, and thus greatly extend their lending activities. Mr Eberhard Martini, president of the banking federation, said a letter would be sent to the European Commission immediately after yesterday's annual meeting, asking whether the new rules conformed to EC guidelines on capital adequacy. The main target of the banks is the Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) which has succeeded in extending its working capital by DM4bn as a result of consolidating the assets of WFA, the housing finance institution for North Rhine-Westphalia. Mr Martini said that the new ruling, made by the Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das Kreditwesen, the supervisory body for the banking sector, gave the public sector banks a significant competitive advantage over private sector banks.</p>

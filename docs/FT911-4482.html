			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Ceramics find their bearings A TOUGH, lightweight ceramic material is now being made into bearings for a range of industrial sectors. Developed by SNR Roulements, in Annecy, France, the bearings are made of silicon nitride, which is chemically very stable. Other properties of the material are that it is extremely hard and therefore lasts much longer than traditional steel bearings. SNR has two bearings for various applications: hybrid bearings - ceramic balls held in place by steel rings - to give the speed needed in precision machine tools; and ceramic bearings for use in nuclear physics and the petrochemical industry where there are strong chemicals.

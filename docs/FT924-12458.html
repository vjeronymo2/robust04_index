			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Kaiser Aluminum tumbles to Dollars 3.9m KAISER Aluminum, the US mining company suffering from low prices for most of its products, yesterday reported a sharp decline in earnings for the third quarter. The company unveiled net income of Dollars 3.9m, or 6 cents a share, for the quarter, down from Dollars 23.1m, or 41 cents, last time. Sales were Dollars 458.5m, compared with Dollars 509.7m a year ago. For the first nine months of the year, Kaiser's earnings were Dollars 24.3m, or 42 cents, down from Dollars 81.3m, or Dollars 1.56, last year. Nine-month sales were Dollars 1.4bn, compared with Dollars 1.53bn last year. 'Third-quarter results reflect lower realised prices for the company's alumina, primary aluminium and fabricated aluminium products,' the company said. It added that lower prices reflected softened demand, combined with a cyclical worldwide over-supply of aluminium. Kaiser shipped 164,700 tonnes of primary and fabricated aluminium in the third quarter, and 518,500 tonnes in the first nine months, compared with 167,000 tonnes and 492,200 tonnes, respectively, in the same 1991 periods. Primary aluminium accounted for about 48 per cent of Kaiser's third-quarter shipments, against 52 per cent in the third quarter of 1991. Alumina shipments totalled 469,000 tonnes in the third quarter, down from 511,300 tonnes in 1991. Phelps Dodge, the world's second-largest copper producer, reported third-quarter earnings above analysts' expectations. Net income jumped to Dollars 119.9m, or Dollars 1.70 per share, an increase of 83 per cent over third-quarter 1991 earnings of Dollars 64.7m, or 93 cents. For the first nine months, the US group recorded net income of Dollars 240.9m, or Dollars 3.42 per share, up from Dollars 197.7m, or Dollars 2.85 per share, last year. Sales were Dollars 672.1m in the third quarter, and Dollars 1.9bn for the first nine months, compared with Dollars 617.6m and Dollars 1.8bn, respectively, for the same periods a year ago. Cash-flow from operating activities reached Dollars 288.5m in the first nine months of 1992. Third-quarter results include income of Dollars 36.4m, or 52 cents a share, from the sale of 20 per cent of the company's interest in a Chilean copper mine to Sumitomo of Japan. Phelps Dodge Mining Company reported third-quarter operating earnings of Dollars 113.6m, compared with Dollars 87.3m a year ago, reflecting a higher average copper price and lower production costs.</p>

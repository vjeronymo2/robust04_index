			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Faint signs of life Britain's Labour party is showing faint signs of recovery from the torpor into which it sank last April. Its leader, Mr John Smith, has begun to find his feet. He is performing better in parliament. He is also, in his own way, stage-managing the half-modernisation of his party, to the extent that his cautious nature permits. Although not good enough, the process is significant. For the past two weeks Mr Smith has managed to excoriate Mr John Major so effectively that on Tuesday the prime minister took up the traditional whine of the contemporary politician in trouble. The Labour leader, Mr Major bleated, is indulging in 'sound-bite' politics. Titch. Some of Mr Smith's remarks about how unemployment has risen under the Tories have turned up on the radio and television news. Voters might have overheard. The extent to which the electorate is taking any notice at all of politicians who have so signally failed them is questionable. None of the parties has an attentive audience right now. Backstage, however, some of what Labour's conservative critics have been asking for is being taken seriously. This should be acknowledged. What might pass, in a poor year with the lights out, for a 'new' Labour party is being constructed. Mr Smith set the tone in a speech in Bournemouth on February 7. Labour's goal, he said then, 'must be about the advancement of individual people'. This could only be fully achieved, he added, 'in the context of a strong and supportive society'. Oops. Wait a minute. What did he mean by 'strong and supportive society'? Not state ownership, or excessively high taxation, or 'government simply for its own sake'. But, believe you me, untold shelf-miles of regulations. 'In the modern world, you simply cannot leave everything to the market any more than you can leave everything to the state,' said Mr Smith. Coming from a Tory moderate, such a remark might sound unexceptionable. Coming from a leader of the left wing, it arouses suspicions. Labour is the creature of the trade unions that founded it. In whose interests would regulations be drafted? Mr Smith needs to spread the belief that the answer is us, as citizens and consumers. He needs to be convincing. That is why he moved on Wednesday to weaken the hold of the unions over the party organisation. They commanded 40 per cent of the votes in the electoral college that chose him last July. He now favours excluding them from future party leadership contests. He would also have unions excluded from the process of selecting parliamentary candidates, although on this he offered a sop - a future register of union members who support Labour - to soothe any wounded feelings. Then he blew it. The trade union bloc vote at Labour's annual conference provides annual sound-bites that confirm that the unions run the party. The bloc will command a mere 70 per cent of the votes this year, down from 90 per cent. Mr Smith now supports a gradual reduction of the union presence to 50 per cent, as the number of individual members increases. As he said this week, that is not a divorce; he never wanted a divorce. Yet the suspicion that Labour is the tool of a powerful vested interest will persist until there is an arm's-length relationship with the unions. They should live separately, as do the Democrats and the AFL-CIO in the US. The unions can always send a cheque through what will soon be the privatised mail. Mr Smith is also being too cautious about the removal of clause 4 - the one interpreted as threatening the old-fashioned nationalisation of industries - from the party's constitution. He regards this as of little concern to the average voter. True, but it is no use deploying the words 'new' and 'renewal' 25 times in a 37-minute speech, as he did at Bournemouth, if there is to be no symbolic deconstruction of Labour's socialist past. There are also significant noises coming from other Labour spokesmen. The twin slogan - individual and community - is being deployed to some effect. As I suggested on Tuesday, Mr Tony Blair has the Tories rattled with his attacks on their record on crime. Mr Gordon Brown is two speeches on in a series in which he will seek to convince us that Labour's 'new economics' is a serious alternative to the government's non-strategy. Mr Brown has not yet found the magic formula. His 'investment in people' and 'partnership' between industry and government sound Clinton-esque. He is calling for more competition for the privatised utilities. He might evolve into a credible trust-buster if he stops being over-enthusiastic about regulation and stops over-stressing the cross-directorships between Tory MPs, ex-ministers, and the new companies. In the delicate art of attacking the Tories on their right flank Mr Blair is the master, Mr Brown the apprentice. Mr Smith's unique selling point may be his passion for constitutional reform. Britain is 'one of the most centralised states in Europe', he pointed out in his acceptance speech. 'I want . . . a future that puts power back in the hands of our citizens,' he said in Bournemouth. He will be more specific at a meeting of Charter 88 on Monday, although he will be coy about proportional representation. He will doubtless speak of his belief in regional government, devolution to the Celtic nations, a bill of rights and a freedom of information bill. In his view, the latter would include consumer rights and corporate information. The Labour leader is an admirer of the German federal constitution, and a true believer in decentralisation - unlike his predecessor, who never bought devolution, and quite unlike Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's former deputy leader, who gagged on the bill of rights. When he packages all this as a new 'open society' Mr Smith may be able to command greater verisimilitude than does Mr Major with his carefully controlled Citizen's Charter. This emphasis on constitutional change is music to my ears, but it is hardly pop. It would be a treat to say that Mr Smith is bringing British political debate back to life. Alas, it is far too early to draw any such happy conclusion. We are still saddled with an ineffably weak government that appears likely to complete its term, and an opposition that seems insufficiently aware of how radically it must change if it is to win next time.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: RTZ puts mining on par with air and water RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, was in good shape to benefit from signs of improvement in the economic outlook, Sir Derek Birkin, chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday.

This year the group faced a series of questions about exploration in Norway and Finland, home of the Sami people, as well as questions on South Africa, Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cuba. Sir Derek said the emerging economic consensus was that mainland Europe and Japan were set to follow the US and UK out of recession. The former countries were more important markets for RTZ, and recovery should lead to an improved trading environment. Metal prices remained volatile, but most appeared to have stemmed their decline. In the first quarter, the Economist index of non-ferrous metals prices was about 8 per cent up on its average in the second half of last year and only 2 per cent below the average in the first half. Earnings last year had proved resilient against a background of dismally low prices, he said, although this was to some extent mitigated by exchange rate factors.

The group had also achieved its target of about Pounds 900m from the completion of the disposal of its remaining industrial products following last year's sale of most of Pillar.</p>

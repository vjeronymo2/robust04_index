The Umlazi sub-region of the ANC planned  a march at 10am to protest against the blockade of its rally at  the King Zwelithini Stadium in the township at the weekend.    Thousands of Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporters occupied  the stadium on Sunday, preventing ANC supporters from entering  to hold a rally. At least five people died in violence  apparently linked to the confrontation.    Meanwhile, Umlazi's usually busy main roads were quiet on  Tuesday morning with almost no vehicle movement in the area.    District kwaZulu police commissioner Brig Alwyn Burger  described the township as "tense and almost lifeless". He  reported several barricades on main roads and alleged there had  been intimidation. "People feel threatened and they're staying  at home."    But, Umlazi's ANC Secretary Thami Ndlela denied allegations  of intimidation against his organisation. "It's not the policy  of the ANC," he said. He added that the overwhelming majority of  Umlazi's residents supported Tuesday's protest.    "We're expecting tens of thousands at our march. They are  not  only ANC supporters but people like church and businessmen who  are very concerned at Sunday's events." He said a memorandum  would be delivered to the local magistrate, demanding free  political activity and noting the IFP's alleged contravention of  the Electoral Act.    "We're also calling for the rapid deployment of the national  peace keeping force here to replace the kwaZulu Police and  Internal Stability Unit," Mr Ndlela said.    "We believe these forces are partial and they demonstrated  this by not acting to remove the people from the stadium at the  weekend."</p>

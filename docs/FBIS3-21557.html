			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Rene Galy-Dejean, chairman of the National </F> Assembly's Defense Commission and Rally for the Republic deputy  in Paris: "Mr. Mitterrand's Trap" -- first paragraph is LE MONDE  introduction]    [Text] After the ministerial meeting in the Elysee  [presidential office] on Wednesday 15 February to discuss the  Defense White Paper, Rene Galy-Dejean, author of two  parliamentary reports on nuclear testing and the armaments  industry, accused Francois Mitterrand of setting a trap for the  majority concerning the M5 strategic missile.    One of the particularly tough problems in the military  planning law is to be found in the fate reserved for the future  M5 missile. Between 2005 and 2010, this missile could replace  the M45, which is currently under development for the new  generation of submarines. The M45 will carry the latest nuclear  warhead, the TN75. Thus renovated, the French strategic ocean  force will comprise, by unanimous opinion, a tool for deterrence  whose reliability can be guaranteed for the next 10 years.    In this context, what question should the politicians in  charge be asking? In my opinion, the immediate development of  the M5 is the most serious mistake that could be made in the  drafting of the planning law. Not only would it be a mistake in  technological terms, but also in budgetary, strategic, and  therefore political terms.    Technologically, the gain in performance attributed to the  future missile -- and the gain which is likely to be achieved --  concerns range, accuracy, payload, and stealth. So far,  however, this improved missile is felt to go hand in hand with a  new warhead, the TN100, which is already in the design stage at  the Atomic Energy Commission. This load will yield enhanced  performance in terms of penetration and accuracy.    Is all this so very urgent? This does, it is true, represent  decisive progress, but in only one area: The enhanced range  "gives water" to submarines, i.e., it allows them to patrol in  warm waters and to increase their potential and safety.  However, as for the rest, there are a great many contradictions  and uncertainties in the process!  <H5>  Contradiction </H5>   We are increasing the surface of the targeted objective,  while at the same time a consensus is emerging for moving away  from a "city-oriented" doctrine of deterrence toward a doctrine  based on the destruction of forces, in other words one that is  more "targeted" and sophisticated. We are increasing the volume  and payload of the missile's warhead, while every indicator  points to a constant move toward nuclear warheads which are  smaller in volume and weight, but which have equal strength.  This is even one of France's specialties. Moreover, we are  implementing a new armaments system based on the TN100 -- a  warhead that is innovative in terms of design and operation --  at a time when we are suspending nuclear tests and when, as a  result, we are banning the validation of its design and  development, and therefore the verification of the sought-after  results.    To get around this contradiction, it is said that the  current  TN75 warhead, which will soon be in service, can be improved and  adapted to the new M5 missile. This weakens the rhetoric and  the deterrence. We find ourselves involved in an approach based  on opportunity and not efficiency. Such opportunism has  characterized the M5 missile since its birth and places a  terrible financial burden on the defense budget and planning law.    It is estimated that the M5 missile alone, without its  nuclear warhead, will cost around 65 billion francs. Its launch  was announced to the Aerospatiale group in January 1992 -- two  months before the last legislative elections -- in a letter from  the defense minister (Pierre Joxe). This baptism may appear  blighted with some suspicion of electioneering, even if I do not  ignore the problematically low order load of Aerospatiale's  "strategic missiles" division.    Yet, was the military staff in favor of this? Was a decision  made in the Defense Council?    At the same time, the Defense Ministry published a  "reference  document" on planning, the stand-in for the law that was not  discussed in Parliament. This "reference document" clearly  showed that merely pursuing the irreversible programmes already  under way would put too much pressure on the budget capacity in  the medium term. Of course, funding allocated to the M5 missile  in the 1993 budget was low, and it will be equally low in 1994.  However, what will become of the new planning law if program  authorizations have to be increased in the short term? We thus  deprive the law of any maneuvering room, unless one major  ongoing project is canceled. And who will take that risk?  <H5>  Deterrence Thwarted </H5>   Consequently, we are blocking the development of our  deterrence strategy. This development, which now enjoys broad  consensus within the Armed Forces and the majority, is imposed  by geopolitical upheavals.    We know the broad outlines of this consensus. Submarines are  an important -- if not key -- strategic element in our defense  apparatus, but the search for greater flexibility and improved  adaptation to the new context has led to the implementation of a  second airborne "component" fitted with the LRAS (long-range  air-to-surface) missile. This "component" would have strike  capacities for a second and final warning.    At the same time, the discussion of the implementation of  antimissile protection is necessary in our country. From now  on, Aerospatiale -- despite the defection of the British over  the LRAS -- is in a position to develop missiles capable of  stopping ballistic missiles at mid-altitude. In addition, the  company alone can equip France with a long-range air-to-surface  missile.    All this will be made financially impossible by the further  development of the M5 missile. This missile will destroy what  little flexibility a sustained budgetary effort could give to  the planning law.    It is here that we meet up with politics again. The trap  which the president of the republic has just set for the  government and its majority was laid out in a sentence spoken in  an interview given to AFP by Francois Mitterrand (LE MONDE of 11  January). He spoke of a "new missile which comprises a major  improvement, namely in terms of range, and which could also be  installed on the Albion platform."    So here is the M5 destroying the entire planning with all  its  might. Here is the compromised strategic development, the  second weakened nuclear "component," and the antiballistic  protection system postponed indefinitely. Here, lastly, is the  Albion platform put back in the saddle and the "sanctuarization"  of the reactivated territory.    Such a regression in our nuclear strategy is inconceivable.  Or perhaps we are to think that Mr. Mitterrand, who came to  power with a strong prejudice against deterrence, will leave his  post by depriving his successor of this powerful tool, after he  himself made use of it. The halting of nuclear testing and the  fate of the M5 make one wonder. My feeling is that it would be  desirable to stagger the implementation of the M5 in order to  give France some latitude in adapting its strategy and equipping  its forces for a new and dangerous world that is now emerging.</p>

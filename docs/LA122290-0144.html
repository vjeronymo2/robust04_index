CURBSIDE RECYCLING PLAN  </P> <P> A 3-year-old public relations agency known for its socially conscious campaigns  will take the lead in publicizing the city of Los Angeles' new curbside  recycling program, which will be the world's largest.  </P> <P> Westwood-based Laufer Associates has been awarded $1.6 million by the City  Council to explain the system to residents using direct-mail brochures, a  user's manual, print advertising, billboards, TV and radio spots, and such  reminders as refrigerator magnets, all of which will be phased-in neighborhood  by neighborhood by late next year or in early 1992.  </P> <P> Laufer will direct three other agencies to tailor its message for specific  groups: Foote, Cone &amp; Belding/Los Angeles, for advertising and direct mail;  Coronado Communications, which specializes in the Latino and Asian-Pacific  communities, and Lois Hill Hale &amp; Associates, which has experience in black  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Most materials will be multilingual, said Jessica Laufer, president of Laufer  Associates. Toll-free messages to explain the recycling and waste-reduction  effort will also be available in about 10 languages.  </P></p>

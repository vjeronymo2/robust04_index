(Centra Minnesota), 200 Yorkland Boulevard, North York, Ontario, Canada M2J 5C6, filed on Docket No. CP94&hyph;705&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act requesting authority to construct a new delivery tap and appurtenant facilities in order to directly supply an existing customer of Northern Minnesota Utilities (NMU), as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Centra Minnesota states NMU, an existing customer of Centra Minnesota, has requested Centra Minnesota to provide such service because it would be uneconomical for NMU to serve the customer from its distribution system. Centra Minnesota requests that the Commission issue an order granting such authority by August 21, 1994, so that the construction can take place over Labor Day weekend, September 3&hyph;5, 1994, at which time a major customer of NMU and/or Centra Minnesota Ontario, both of which are Centra Minnesota's customers, will shutdown for maintenance, and throughput on the Central Minnesota system will be at the low point for the year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, Centra Minnesota proposes to construct a high pressure service tap, 30 feet on 2-in pipeline, a two-inch valve and meter downstream from the pressure regulator station that will be install by NMU. Centra Minnesota advises that the proposed facilities will cost approximately $9,000 to construct and Centra Minnesota will be responsible for all costs involved. Centra Minnesota states that such facilities will be constructed within an existing right of way and will not result in an increase in the quality of gas that Centra Minnesota is authorized to transport on behalf of NMU. Centra Minnesota further states that no additional revenue will be generated by this service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before August 25, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulation Commission by Sections 3 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Centra Minnesota to appear or be represented at the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lois D.

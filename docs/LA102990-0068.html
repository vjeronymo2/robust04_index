			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS' GENEROUS ALLIANCE UNMATCHED IN CONGRESS;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN FUNDS: CRITICS SAY REPS. HOWARD L. BERMAN, MEL LEVINE AND HENRY A.  WAXMAN BUY INFLUENCE BY DIVIDING UP MONEY AMONG OTHER DEMOCRATS, ALTHOUGH IT IS  PERFECTLY LEGAL.  </P> <P> Between floor votes, committee sessions and meetings with constituents, Reps.  Henry A. Waxman, Howard L. Berman and Mel Levine recently huddled behind closed  doors in Waxman's spacious, high-ceilinged office to engage in a political  ritual unique on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> Working from handwritten prep sheets, the three Los Angeles-area Democrats  discussed how to jointly dispense about $50,000 of their own campaign funds to  other Democrats in Congress and Democratic challengers in competitive races  around the country.  </P> <P> Berman then called the lawmakers' shared campaign treasurer and instructed her  to issue $1,000 checks from each of their campaign committees to various  candidates, including fellow Reps. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), Louise M.  Slaughter (D-N.Y.) and Jim Jontz (D-Ind.). It is a practice well-honed by the  trio over the years.  </P> <P> Their cumulative generosity is unmatched in Congress, according to a  computer-assisted study of congressional campaign spending for 1989-90  conducted by The Times. In addition to congressional contests, Waxman, Berman  and Levine routinely provide hefty support in state legislative, gubernatorial  and local races as well as to various Democratic campaign organizations.  </P> <P> Despite its informality, this process is at the heart of one of the most  effective and unusual Democratic alliances on Capitol Hill, where proximity  generally breeds competition rather than cooperation.  </P> <P> It is also controversial. Critics contend that the practice amounts to  influence-buying within Congress, although it's perfectly legal.  </P> <P> "It buys something -- if not votes, then compromises and bills introduced or  bills not introduced, voice votes instead of recorded votes, actions not  taken," said Ellen S. Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive  Politics. "It has the same kind of corrosive impact on the system as direct  contributions from corporate PACs," or political action committees.  </P> <P> In the current election cycle, the trio distributed a total of $110,611 to  other candidates from their respective campaign committees, through the Oct. 15  campaign reporting deadline. Waxman gave an additional $85,000 from his own  political action committee.  </P> <P> Since the close of the reporting period, they have contributed at least another  $100,000. This includes $75,000 to California Democratic gubernatorial nominee  Dianne Feinstein, given after a federal district judge overturned state  contribution limits.  </P> <P> All told, they have given to a total of 50 congressional candidates, of which  18 have received contributions from all three.  </P> <P> Nationally, Berman ranks sixth among all members of Congress in contributing to  other candidates, Waxman is 11th and Levine is 12th, The Times found. In the  full 1987-88 election cycle, the three combined made 256 contributions totaling  $453,320.  </P> <P> Many other lawmakers make similar contributions. But what sets Waxman, Berman  and Levine apart is that they pool at least some of their giving to maximize  its electoral impact. Not incidentally, distributing the funds jointly also  multiplies the benefits of the giving in an institution where campaign money is  often the coin of the realm and members rarely forget who filled their coffers.  </P> <P> "This is the political equivalent of the sum being greater than the parts,"  said Rep. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.), a prolific fund-raiser himself. "They  are heard out of all proportion to their numbers because they represent real  political strengths."  </P> <P> That is not to say that dispersing campaign dollars is the sole key to the  clout wielded by Waxman, who represents the 24th Congressional District, Berman  of the 26th District, and Levine from the 27th District. Each is respected for  his legislative abilities and Waxman has been called the most effective liberal  in the House.  </P> <P> The three lawmakers insist they attach no strings to their contributions. But  they acknowledge that the money helps them pursue their legislative agendas.  </P> <P> "It clearly builds relationships with colleagues to help them in their  elections just as it builds relationships with colleagues to help them with  their legislative activities," Waxman said unabashedly. "And those  relationships are important because ultimately, to do anything around here, you  have to have coalitions and support."  </P> <P> Waxman, Berman and Levine are longtime friends and charter members of a  progressive political alliance based in Los Angeles' affluent Westside and  southern San Fernando Valley. They like to describe the operation -- which  includes state and city officeholders and political consultants -- as friends  who share political goals.  </P> <P> Others call it the Waxman-Berman machine.  </P> <P> Among the alliance's unofficial allies are fellow Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los  Angeles), state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), Assemblymen Burt  Margolin (D-Los Angeles) and Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), and City  Controller Rick Tuttle. Los Angeles political consultants Michael Berman,  Howard's brother, and Carl D'Agostino represent the alliance's savvy,  take-no-prisoners campaign arm.  </P> <P> The lawmakers have been raising large amounts for like-minded candidates since  their days in the California Assembly. Their ideological agenda is headed by  support for Israel, first and foremost, as well as environmental protection and  a woman's right to an abortion. Friends, fellow Californians and allies on  specific issues get special consideration.  </P> <P> The threesome and their associates are able to function, in effect, like a  self-contained political party because they have a loyal base of donors --  particularly among Jewish supporters -- and face little election threat  themselves. Waxman last had his own campaign headquarters when he first ran for  the Assembly in 1968; Berman when he first ran for Congress in 1982.  </P> <P> "It's assumed that they'll help other people," said Marc Nathanson, a longtime  fund-raiser for the three lawmakers and chief executive officer of Falcon  Holding Group Inc., a cable television company based in Westwood. "It goes  beyond their campaign."  </P> <P> In their efforts to help others as well as themselves, Waxman has raised  $413,009, and Berman has raised $452,919, during the current two-year  legislative cycle. Levine, who is eyeing a 1992 U.S. Senate bid and enjoys the  demands of fund raising more than the others, garnered $1,119,669, one of the  highest figures for a House member.  </P> <P> Beyond their shared base, Waxman, a congressional leader on health issues,  generates 20% of his money from health-related PACs; Berman, a former labor  lawyer, is a favorite of organized labor; and Levine, the scion of a wealthy  Beverly Hills developer and old California family, gets significant support  from family and personal friends.  </P> <P> Waxman also has his own PAC, which allows him to exceed the $1,000 maximum on  contributions from his own campaign committee and to give another $5,000 to  candidates he supports in primary and general elections. Such "leadership PACs"  help advance or solidify their organizer's House or Senate leadership  aspirations or can be used to pay the costs of an unannounced presidential bid.  </P> <P> At the same time that Waxman, Berman and Levine give unto others, they spend  relatively little directly on their own campaigns. Berman spent 17% of his  campaign committee funds on his own election activities, Waxman, 19%, and  Levine, 35%, The Times survey found.  </P> <P> "I don't see a line to be drawn between the political process and the  legislative process," Waxman said. "I think they're all one and part of the  same. Those people who are here in Washington, voting on bills, are elected  through the political process. And whether I get my legislation passed depends  on who's here."  </P> <P> Waxman, in fact, in 1978 helped pioneer the tactic of steering campaign dollars  to colleagues to advance one's goals within the House. As a two-term member, he  decided to challenge Rep. Richardson Preyer, a senior and respected Democrat  from South Carolina, for the vacant chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce  Committee's health and environment subcommittee.  </P> <P> Preyer's bid was hurt by his ownership of pharmaceutical stock, which he had  inherited, and his sympathy for the home-state tobacco industry. At the same  time, drawing on lessons learned as a state lawmaker in Sacramento, Waxman  dispensed $24,000 in campaign funds to fellow members of the subcommittee. Some  colleagues and observers criticized the contributions as a brazen bid to buy  votes. Nevertheless, he won the chairmanship in a stunning upset.  </P> <P> Since that time, Waxman has continued giving campaign money to subcommittee  allies as part of his effort to win a tougher clean-air law, expanded health  insurance and more money for AIDS treatment and research.  </P> <P> Panel members Gerry Sikorski (D-Minn.), Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Cardiss  Collins (D-Ill.) have been among the beneficiaries of Waxman, Berman and  Levine.  </P> <P> Waxman's assistance goes beyond such contributions. He said that when Collins  faced a primary challenge, he scheduled subcommittee hearings in her Chicago  district "to let people back there know what she's doing." He has also attended  fund-raisers there for her.  </P> <P> On occasion, the lawmakers individually or collectively hold fund-raisers or  ask major donors in Los Angeles to help gather money for another candidate.  Berman and Levine raised more than $75,000 for their House Foreign Affairs  Committee ally Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) during Reid's victorious Senate race in  1986.  </P> <P> "The strength of the machine is how much money they can raise for other  people," said a Democratic strategist with close ties to "the boys," as their  friends often call them. "And you can never track that."  </P> <P> Equally difficult to determine are the benefits that accrue from the  contributions. But congressional insiders and observers agree that such  assistance engenders goodwill.  </P> <P> "When something comes up that is no big deal to you one way or another, you're  going to be cognizant of your friends," said political scientist Norman  Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. "The people who  succeed in politics over the longer haul tend to be those who build their base  of friends."  </P> <P> Berman said that when he waged an uphill fight to win a coveted spot on the  House Budget Committee in 1989, "the fact that I was the kind of Democrat who  helped other Democrats was a help."  </P> <P> At the same time, he noted that he began his campaign a year early and  aggressively wooed members of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee,  which makes such appointments.  </P> <P> "It's part of a total picture," said Berman, a four-term lawmaker who has  played central roles on arms control and immigration issues, where  institutional power tends to reside.  </P> <P> Some of the recipients of the largess are in positions to be especially  helpful. Two examples are Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of an important  Appropriations subcommittee dealing with foreign operations, and Rep. Sidney R.  Yates (D-Ill.), who chairs the Appropriations subcommittee that plays a major  role in determining how much money the Santa Monica Mountains National  Recreation Area receives to buy parkland.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, critics of this process -- including Common Cause and other  groups that support campaign law reform -- maintain that it increases the need  for special-interest money, provides a way around contribution limits,  undermines party discipline and leaves colleagues feeling indebted.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-area lawmakers disagree.  </P> <P> Recipients of their campaign funds are less beholden to them than they would be  to corporate PACs, which would prefer to give to candidates directly, in any  case, the lawmakers maintain. And they portray themselves as filling a partisan  vacuum left by a Democratic Party unable to match big Republican donors.  </P> <P> "We never suggest that any response is appropriate," Levine said. "If you have  helped somebody, they are going to be more willing to listen to you. But I  don't think that buys you anything."  </P> <P> RECIPIENTS OF 1989-90 CAMPAIGN FUNDS  </P> <P> List of Democratic candidates and committees to which Reps. Henry A.

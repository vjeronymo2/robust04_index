			<p>BFN     [Text] The Senate has issued a statement deeply deploring  the sad events pitting brother against brother in Yemen. The  Senate, the statement said, regrets the high toll of casualties  and the scale of destruction caused to the infrastructure that  was built thanks to the sacrifices of the brotherly Yemeni  people as they marched toward unity, development, and  construction. The Senate called on the Yemeni brothers to let  wisdom and dialogue prevail and address the roots of their  disagreements to preserve the country's unity and spare the  lives of Yemenis so that they can pursue the process of unity  and construction and Yemen can continue to play its key pan-Arab  role.</p>

A corresponding agreement was  signed by Eduard Lintner (Christian Social Union), parliamentary  state secretary in the FRG Interior Ministry, and Estonian  Interior Minister Heike Arike in Bonn on 7 March. The foci of  joint police investigations are to be, among other things,  drug-related crimes, forged money, and the smuggling of people,  as well as money laundering, the smuggling of stolen cars, and  arms trade.    Lintner stressed the need for ever closer police cooperation  with the countries in East Europe and the successor states of  the Soviet Union. The FRG has categorized them in three  "rings," depending on their geographic location. After the  conclusion of agreements with Poland, the Czech Republic, the  Slovak Republic, Hungary, and Bulgaria, the treaty with Latvia  [as received] is the first one with a country of the second  "ring," to which, in addition to the Baltic states, Russia,  Belarus, and Ukraine are counted. Agreements are also planned  with the Central Asian, formerly Soviet, republics as the third  "ring," Lintner said. "Gratifying beginnings" already exist, in  particular with Uzbekistan, he noted.</p>

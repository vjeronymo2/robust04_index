			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> After two days of patrolling, the city's Fashion Police have dished out seven  citations to grubby taxi drivers.  </P> <P> Verboten clothing spotted by the Transportation Department's inspectors  included white socks, jeans, white pants, striped shirts and one pea-green  jacket.  </P> <P> City Councilman Joel Wachs, sponsor of the dress-code ordinance, joined in a  stake-out by the Bonaventure Hotel.  </P> <P> "What we have tried to do," he said, "is make sure that cab drivers are clean  and neat, and that they don't have objectionable odors."  </P> <P> It won't be easy. The city has 4,000 cabbies and 15 inspectors.  </P> <P> Hollywood fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell -- the man who develops a  much-publicized worst-dressed list -- welcomed the effort.  </P> <P> "I do feel socks should be worn," he said. "I don't think you should wear open  shoes in a cab. I don't think T-shirts should be worn."  </P> <P> Sounds like cabbies rank even lower than Cher on Blackwell's list.  </P> <P> Not so long ago, the campaign manager of L.A. County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner  proudly disclosed that he calls his boss the Silver Eagle -- because of "his  silver hair and steady eyes."  </P> <P> The state attorney general candidate nearly picked up a new nickname, Wrong-Way  Reiner.  </P> <P> Reiner recently boarded a jet at LAX to fly to Sacramento but, after taking his  seat, overheard a passenger remark that the flight would take 2 1/2 hours.  </P> <P> Reiner launched an immediate investigation.  </P> <P> He soon uncovered the fact that this plane was headed for Seattle.  </P> <P> The Silver Eagle flew the coop before the takeoff. But the Sacramento-bound  plane, which had been parked next door, was gone. So he caught a later flight.  </P> <P> An aide later told one reporter: "I think we've all made similar mistakes."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, gubernatorial candidate John K. Van de Kamp, in his appeal for  Latino votes, may not have been helped by a sign on Broadway that tried to link  him with the Cinco de Mayo celebration. It read: "Cinco de Maya."  </P> <P> Oy vey.  </P> <P> The defense in the alleged voice-theft case of singer Tom Waits gave a  mini-Louis Armstrong concert in federal court Tuesday, trying to show a  similarity between Waits' and Armstrong's voices.  </P> <P> Waits contends in a lawsuit that Frito-Lay Inc. imitated his voice in its corn  chip commercials.  </P> <P> When the defense announced it wanted to play Armstrong's version of "Hello  Dolly" after playing three other Armstrong recordings, Waits' attorney  objected.  </P> <P> U.S. Dist. Judge James Ideman overruled him, noting: "A little more Satchmo  can't hurt anybody."  </P> <P> It doesn't get much more exciting in L.A. than it was Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> McGruff, the canine star of the "take-a-bite-out-of-crime" ads for the National  Crime Prevention Council, was celebrating his 10th birthday at the L.A.  Convention Center.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Captain Hydro, the red-caped, blue-suited mascot of the Department  of Water and Power, was visiting City Hall to promote water conservation.  </P> <P> And, Billy and the Recyclones received a scroll from Supervisor Mike Antonovich  and crooned their waste-management hit, "Do the Recycle":  </P> <P> You do the bottle bop bop bop bop.  </P> <P>  You do the can can can.  </P> <P>  You do the bundle boogie.  </P> <P>  Do the recycle....  </P> <P>  A positive example of trashy lyrics.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LAny:  </P> <P> The speed limit in the Catalina Island city of Avalon is 20 m.p.h.  </P></p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Abacus advances to Pounds 4.24m Abacus Group, the electrical components distributor, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.24m in its first full-year results since floating in November 1993, and announced a push into Scandinavia. The 43 per cent increase on last year's Pounds 2.98m was struck on turnover of Pounds 37.5m, 21 per cent ahead from Pounds 30.9m. Allowing for the pre-flotation interest burden, profits before tax for the year to September 30 rose 24 per cent. Interest payable fell from Pounds 454,000 to Pounds 7,000. Mr Harry Westropp, chairman, said the group had achieved its immediate growth objectives with the opening of a Singapore office, two offices in Southampton and the addition of two franchises, ICT and Framatome Connectors. Dubilier, the passive components brand, and CTL Cables had both increased sales by some 80 per cent. Earnings per share came out at 9.7p (7.4p). The recommended final dividend is 2.88p, giving a total for the year of 4p (1.12p), compared with a notional 3.5p. The group acquired a 75 per cent stake in Promax, a Danish company which distributes Philips products in Denmark and Sweden, for Pounds 2.5m in October. Mr Westropp said expansion was also under way in Finland and Norway.</p>

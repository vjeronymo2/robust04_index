			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Arts: Einstein on the Beach VERY 1970s, very American, very long and very different: Einstein on the Beach is back on the road. This is the five-hour multi-media work which established the international reputations of Philip Glass and Robert Wilson after its premiere at the Avignon Festival in 1976. It was revived with modified lighting and choreography at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1984, and commercially recorded. It has now returned to Europe at the start of a world tour, beginning with four performances at the Frankfurt Opera House. There is still no sign of a British stage premiere. The best that can be said of Einstein on the Beach is that it is an original piece of theatre. Populist in appeal, polyglot in its sources and postmodern in its quaintly experimental conservatism, it has been described by its authors as an opera - but it is no such thing. There is no story or drama, and no solo singing (apart from one short, wordless offstage soprano). It is more a carefully-wrought collage of pantomimes, dream-associations, nonsense recitations and meditations - all variations on the theme of Einstein, father of the atom bomb. The work is divided into four acts, each framed by a 'knee-play' (which you or I would be content to call a mimed interlude or point of junction). Einstein is pictured as a boy observing a steam locomotive, as a young man compulsively writing scientific formulas, on honeymoon with his wife and as an isolated old man with the familiar shock of hair, gently playing his violin. Sometimes he is pictured simultaneously in more than one incarnation - but always in the same braces, white shirt and baggy trousers. There are surreal trial scenes which bring back the spectre of Galileo, and two fluently-patterned ballets - apparently meant to represent Einstein's 'unified field' theory of physical forces. Other images include clocks and watches, a spaceship and a nuclear cloud signifying the holocaust. Then, before the final 'knee-play', we are left with the sentimental picture of a couple declaring eternal love. The piece depends as much on Wilson's trademark language of movement and lighting as it does on Glass's music, which rates as little more than background accompaniment, lulling the listener into a kind of stupor. The principles of Glass's cell-like structures need no elucidation here: as with the banal Supermarket Text in Act 3 (like a needle stuck in the groove), they have a cumulative effect through repetition. The score, played by seven members of Glass's own ensemble using amplified sound, recalls 1970s rock in the louder synthesiser passages (echoes of King Crimson and the Yes Album), and includes some haunting motifs, such as a five-note sequence for electric organ. As the evening advances, the music becomes marginally less constricted: Einstein's violin is allowed a simple set of variations, and the saxophone is unexpectedly expressive in the industrial laboratory scene of Act 4, albeit against the background of a monotonous curdle. Wilson's clear-cut representational decor, heavily stylised in the comic-bizarre court scenes, is simple and attractive. The attention to detail and quality of timing among a large cast of dancers, actors and chorus-singers is impressive, especially in view of the unbroken time-span of the performance. The most engaging aspect of all is Lucinda Childs' elegant choreography, and her own brilliantly controlled acting and declamation. It is easy to see why Einstein appeals to a wide public: it does not require preparation, understanding or concentration. During the performance, you can slip out for a drink and a sandwich - the work actually encourages you to switch off for a while - and when you return, there is a good chance you will be watching the same sequence as when you left. The Frankfurt audience entered into the spirit of the piece, but seemed not quite bowled over at the end. Perhaps Einstein deserves to be seen in a less traditional theatre. Perhaps its authors should have allowed scope for improvisation or even audience participation. Perhaps it is already a little dated. Certainly some of the claims made at its 1984 revival - likening it to a Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk which 'defines the consciousness of an epoch'  -seem overblown. Einstein still has some novelty value, it may well be a seminal work for late 20th century American culture, but it offers limited scope for interpretation and smacks of pretentiousness. I found the time went by quickly enough, but I won't be rushing back for more.</p>

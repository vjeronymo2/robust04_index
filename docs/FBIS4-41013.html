			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriya Ochinyan report: "Urals Opposition Association. </F> Union of Workers and Peasants Intends To Restore Soviets"]    [Text] A Union of Workers, Peasants, and Working  Intelligentsia has been created in Yekaterinburg, the Russian  president's home town. The existence of such an organization in  the Urals, where all processes connected with economic change  proceed more painfully than anywhere else, could have a serious  influence on the political situation in the region. Yesterday's  sitting of the Coordination Council of this organization was  attended by a visitor from Moscow -- Oleg Shenin, chairman of  the UCP [Union of Communist Parties]-CPSU.    The Union has been joined by the local branches of the  Russian Communist Workers Party, the "Worker" association, the  "Russian Union" national-patriotic association, the  Agro-Industrial Complex trade union, and the teachers strike  committee. The communists hope they will soon be joined by  local members of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. While  the Union was created way back in early 1993, the question of  its official registration appeared to its leaders "untimely"  until recently. However, the opposition's success in the  December elections and the activization of the opposition forces  in Moscow urged the Urals' leftists to emerge from "hiding."  The arrival of Oleg Shenin seems also to be intended to  underline the importance of the coming registration of the Union  and its reliable connections with Moscow comrades.    Despite the fact that the Union is a rather mixed bag, its  members, the organizers are convinced, have common goals and  only "insignificant differences" on tactics. Their immediate  demands to the Federal Assembly and the government seem rather  traditional: modify the tax system, provide state protection for  commodity producers and a broader state protection system for  the working people, ensure timely payment of wages. The Union  conscientiously stresses economic demands -- they are more  readily understood by the ordinary voter. The organization's  only political task is to restore the soviets as "government of  the people." At the same time, the organizers state, their  Union is no opponent of reforms "with the exception of those  that infringe on the interests of the working people."    Entrepreneurs and bankers in the Urals have virtually  ignored  the consolidation of the communist and socialist forces. Maybe  this is explained by the local elite's rather firm confidence in  their power and their ability to prevent activization of the  leftists. At the same time, it is possible, by expertly  directing their consolidated forces, to bring pressure to bear  on the federal authorities and the rich Moscow commercial  structures which are increasingly infiltrating the industrial  Urals.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCIC agrees that it is imperative to properly train insurance agents regarding program changes. Adequate training will be provided prior to implementing program changes contained in the new Winter Coverage Endorsement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment stated that ``conservation compliance requirements are encouraging more intensive rotational systems. Producers throughout South Dakota are opting to use both Spring wheat and Winter wheat within their rotational systems. Unfortunately for many producers, they are unable to buy winter wheat coverage in a large portion of the state.'' The comment suggested that serious consideration be given to allowing insurance coverage for both wheats on a state wide basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement will be available in all South Dakota counties that currently have both fall and spring final planting dates. Research is being done by FCIC to determine if the Endorsement should be available in other counties. Expanded availability will depend on the outcome of this research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment submitted the following questions: If an insured chooses to destroy damaged acreage covered by the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement, can they destroy only damaged acres, or do they have to destroy all the remaining acres in the unit? Is spring wheat insurable on acres indemnified under Winter Wheat Option A? Will the insured qualify for a replant payment on those acres? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The insured may destroy only the damaged acres on the unit and qualify for coverage as long as at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the acreage in the unit does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage. Under Option A, an insured may choose to have the acreage appraised, destroy damaged winter wheat, or plant spring wheat on the acreage and insure it separately. If the insured chooses to accept an appraisal of the remaining potential, a replant payment is not allowed, even if the acreage is replanted to spring wheat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment recommended adding the following to the last sentence in paragraph 3 of the Winter Coverage Endorsement: ``*&blank;*&blank;* unless we agree in writing that it is practical to replant after the spring final planting date.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of paragraph 3 do not prevent a replant payment for acreage replanted after the spring final planting date. It is not necessary to extend coverage after the period covered by the Winter Coverage Endorsement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment stated that the word ``damage,'' used in the Winter Coverage Endorsement, can be interpreted to mean that a crop which has suffered one percent damage can either be replanted, carried to harvest or destroyed. The comment recommended that ``damage'' be qualified to mean damaged to the extent that the crop does not have the potential to produce the yield used to determine the production guarantee, will not be further cared for, will not be harvested or will be abandoned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Coverage under both Options A and B is limited to situations in which at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the acreage in the unit, whichever is less, is damaged to the extent that it does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage (see first paragraphs under Options A and B). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two comments indicated that since one of the choices the insured has under the Winter Coverage Option is to replant to spring wheat, the notice of damage should be required by the spring final planting date. The deadline for notice of loss under the current Fall-Winter Coverage Option is the spring final planting date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCIC agrees that notice of damage under the Endorsement should be provided by the spring final planting date. The provisions have been revised accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eight comments were received regarding coverage limitations under Option A of the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement. The comments stated that limiting coverage for damaged wheat to 30 percent of the production guarantee, after the time period covered by the Endorsement, is inappropriate. A crop carried on after the winter coverage period would have a potential much greater than 30 percent of the production guarantee. Two of the comments recommended allowing coverage to remain at the full production guarantee when the insured continues to care for the crop. One comment recommended allowing coverage to remain in place at the actual crop potential. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Option A limited coverage to 30 percent of the production guarantee even if the insured elected to carry the damaged wheat to harvest. FCIC has revised Option A to allow coverage to continue based on the full guarantee if the production potential on the spring final planting date is such that growers in the area continue to maintain the crop. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The author of one comment submitted the following questions: Under Option A of the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement, is 70 percent of the production guarantee levied against total production on damaged acres only? What if there is winter damage and the insurer was not informed until after harvest? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Option A clearly indicates that the amount of production to count will not be less than 70 percent of the production guarantee for the damaged acreage. If notice of damage is not given in accordance with policy provisions, and such lack of notice interferes with determination of covered damage, a claim may not be payable for the unit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment outlined concerns that the coverage under Option A will not be sufficient to cover production costs incurred before the crop must be destroyed. The comment also inquired about the actual premium costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Option A of the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement is designed as a lower cost alternative to the full coverage of Option B. Although full production costs may not be covered, there is a significant increase in coverage over the base policy which does not provide protection unless the crop is replanted. Rate determinations cannot be made until the Endorsement provisions are finalized. The premium rates for Option A will reflect the coverage provided by regulations published in this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment recommended adding language to the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement that would state that when damaged winter wheat is replanted to spring wheat, the spring wheat will have the winter wheat guarantee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCIC agrees that clarification is needed and has revised the language accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

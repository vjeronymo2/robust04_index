			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Long gilts fall sharply while short end rises strongly THE STRUCTURE of UK interest rates shifted markedly yesterday as the financial markets absorbed the impact of the political crisis that has sprung from the country's worsening economic position. Long-dated gilts fell sharply, with losses of as much as one and a half points on some issues. Last Friday's one point cut in interest rates - which at the time gave a lift to gilts across the maturity spectrum - was seen more as a panic reaction from a government getting into political trouble. Yesterday's cabinet decision to delay most of its planned coal mine closures also unnerved the market. With no long-term economic strategy in place, such measures left the market fearing that the government was being buffeted from one decision to the next, with potentially serious consequences for gilts. At the other end of the yield curve, short-dated gilts gained strongly on the day on the hope of further interest rate cuts. Industrialists and commentators in the City have argued that a one-point base rate cut is insufficient to get the economy moving, putting pressure on the government for more drastic action. As a result, the sterling yield curve steepened sharply. The yield on 20-year bonds jumped from just over 9 per cent at the end of last week to 9.2 per cent yesterday, while two-year paper dropped from 7.1 per cent to under 7 per cent. This left the curve some 35 basis points steeper between the two and 20-year maturities, with around 225 basis points difference in yield between them. At the same time, the yield spread over German bonds, which had tightened in recent days, began to open up. By the end of yesterday it stood at 154 basis points, compared with 145 at the end of last week, according to Mr Chris Anthony of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. OTHER European markets performed well yesterday, led by Germany. Shorter-dated bunds did well during the morning as traders looked forward to today's repurchase agreement - or repo - tender from the Bundesbank. Despite the lack of any positive signs after last week's Bundesbank council meeting, the market began the week positively in the hope that the central bank will either reduce its fixed rate repo or switch back to a variable rate system, possibly signalling cuts ahead. However, prices fell back and by the end of the day the yield on 10-year bonds had settled just above 7.3 per cent. IN FRANCE, a decline in short rates helped push longer-dated bonds forward by more than a quarter of a point. Call rates fell by a quarter of a point to under 11 per cent, while three-month money dropped by more than half a point to below 10.5 per cent. However, against the background of gains in the bund market, the spread between German and French government bonds remained at over 100 basis points. SPANISH bonds rallied strongly on the news that local accounting regulations are to be relaxed so that banks do not need to reflect the full impact of losses on bond holdings in their accounts immediately. In the hope that this could forestall any sell-off of bonds from the banks, the ten-year benchmark jumped more than a point and a half, pushing the yield down to 12.88 per cent. US Treasury prices drifted lower across the board yesterday on supply worries and continued concern about the implications for the market of a Democratic victory in the presidential election. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  15/16 at 96 7/32 , yielding 7.564 per cent. The two-year note was also notably weaker, down  1/4 at 99 3/4 , to yield 4.117 per cent. At the opening, prices extended last Friday's losses which had been incurred in the wake of reports that Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, had said he would consider more expansive fiscal measures to boost the economy if he were elected in November. Treasury investors are worried that big increases in government spending could widen the deficit, push up interest rates and fuel inflationary pressures.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mario Monti: "Constraints and Necessities"] </F>   [Text] "Disciplined and strict economic liberalism." These  are the words -- kindly taken from the "memorandum for the new  government" published here on 8 May -- that the prime minister  chose to describe his government's economic policy line in his  program speech to parliament.    It was not an obvious choice. The election platforms of some  of the parties of the majority raised a fundamental question.  Will the new majority's social base and political  representatives, I wonder, be able to display impatience with  state control, with rigidity, and with unproductive situations  without, however, being taken over by impatience with the  discipline of the state budget and with the rules that must  govern the market?    Of course, this question remains. It will be answered by  actual conduct, not by policy statements. But by espousing the  concept of "disciplined and strict economic liberalism," the  prime minister accepts that it is on the basis of this  criterion, and no others, that his government's economic policy  must be judged.    A negligent laissez-faire attitude to the rules that must  govern the market, or a correct market economy accompanied by an  unbalanced public finance situation are as much to be rejected  as the state control that it is intended to combat.    A government that espouses this aim and that accepts being  judged on the basis of this aim is accepting an even clearer and  stricter constraint, I think, than if it had submitted a program  full of figures.    Of course, the time for figures and specific measures will  come soon. For the time being, the bare guidelines of the  program permit us to hope that the anxieties expressed in our  "memorandum" will be kept well in mind.    The aim for the "first 100 days" is indeed to boost the  economy -- but less to the detriment of the state budget than  was expected. Of the seven measures announced for the first 100  days, six are, appropriately, directed toward enhancing the  flexibility of the markets; and only one places a burden, at  least in the immediate term, on the budget (tax relief for firms  creating new jobs). Further tax incentives seem to have been  postponed for a later stage. It was correct to say:  "Intervention in support of the economy...will only really be  such if they are compatible with the reform of the public  finance situation."    Still with regard to public finance, the idea has been  accepted -- indeed, how could it not? -- that, despite the work  begun by the Amato and Ciampi governments, the legacy inherited  is a very onerous one. But if it is so, how could a policy to  boost the economy be based on placing a further burden on the  budget?    As for the government's position on Economic and Monetary  Union [EMU] -- another fear in recent weeks -- the following  wise statement was made: "A careful examination of the  Maastricht Treaty must not delay the implementation of the  unification program."    Public finance reform and European Union. If we connect  these two matters --the prime minister did not do so, but  perhaps his program speech was not the right place for this --  we must consider two necessities.    First, the need for Italy not to evade the monitoring  procedure connected with the next installment of the Community  loan -- a useful and visible stimulus to the correction of the  state budget for 1994, though from a currency viewpoint the loan  will certainly be less necessary than was estimated at the  beginning of 1993.    Second, the need in a few months' time -- once a stringent  finance bill for 1995 has been introduced -- for new lira  exchange rates within the EMS [European Monetary System]. With  fluctuation bands as broad as those currently permitted for all  countries (15 percent either way), the decision should not  impose impossible constraints and should at the same time enable  Italy not to be excluded a priori from the EMU if it were to  materialize in 1997. Indeed, according to the Maastricht  Treaty, it will be necessary to observe the normal fluctuation  bands during the previous two years, that is, 1995 and 1996.</p>

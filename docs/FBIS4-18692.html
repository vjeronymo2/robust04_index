			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Referring to the latest developments in the issue  of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM],  government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the Greek  Government has shown signs of being flexible and conciliatory  but cannot deviate from its basic stated positions. He added  that the Greek measures will be lifted if and when the Skopjean  Government gives tangible proof of the goodwill signs to which  repeated references have been made.    The spokesman described the European Commission's decision  yesterday [to refer Greece to the European Court of Justice] as  inappropriate and contradictory and said he hopes the Commission  will finally change its view. He said: If this does not  happen, we will have the chance to present our strong judicial  arguments in court.    The spokesman noted that the European Commission should have  considered the UN secretary general's recent report to the  Security Council, which notes that the continuing dispute  between Greece and Skopje causes international tension and  endangers peace in the region. Venizelos said U.S. Special  Presidential Envoy Ambassador Matthew Nimetz's initiative  remains open and that Greek Ambassador in Washington Khristos  Zakharakis will meet UN mediator Cyrus Vance. The spokesman  stressed that yesterday's decision violates the rule of communal  solidarity.    Commenting on yesterday's developments in the Skopje issue,  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and New Democracy Chairman  Miltiadhis Evert stressed that the national front must remain  united. Papoulias and Evert met at noon today at Evert's  request.    Afterward Papoulias appeared pessimistic about developments  in the national issue but stressed that during Zakharakis'  meeting with Vance in New York on 11 April, the Greek side would  mainly be concerned with breaking the deadlock. He added that  the Greek people stand firm in the battle that Greece is waging  following recent developments.    Asked about Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras'  request that the government take additional measures against  Skopje, Papoulias indirectly rejected Samaras' proposals, saying  the government is now preparing for the new phase that has been  created.    Asked about the differences between the new Vance plan and  what was agreed in the United Nations during the New Democracy's  term, Papoulias said the difference lies in the separation of  the name issue from the confidence-building measures, adding  that the international mediator's views coincide with the Greek  views.

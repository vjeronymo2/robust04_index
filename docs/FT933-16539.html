			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard advances The recent weakness in Standard Chartered, prompted by stories that Lloyds Bank may well be considering the sale of its near 5 per cent stake in the bank, was reversed after James Capel, the leading UK agency broker was said to have upgraded its earnings forecasts. Cazenove, Standard's broker, was said to have been a strong supporter of Standard shares, with dealers taking the view that Cazenove had also increased its earnings estimates for the bank. Turnover in Standard, however, was an unspectacular 865,000 shares. Barclays continued to attract support on the back of the improving market for land and property in the south-east, highlighted in the recent joint survey by Flemings and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, and moved up 4 more to 487p. Talk in the market continued to suggest that news of the appointment of a new chief executive is imminent. The Kuwait Investment Office was thought to have sold its 12.34 per cent stake in Bradstock Group, the insurance broker,via a bought deal. The KIO's stake of around 6.5m shares were sold at 127p to one of the leading broking houses, who sold the stock on at 128 1/2 p a share. Bradstock shares closed unchanged at 141p. HSBC gave up an early 3p gain to end a busy session a net 5 off at 662p following what was said to have been aggressive selling by Swiss Bank Corporation. Turnover in HSBC was 2.5m shares. Higher half-year losses and a profits warnings sent Eurocamp tumbling, the shares shedding 28 to 203p. Leisure analysts were told by the company that one-off factors had been largely responsible for the poor showing and that fundamentally the group remained sound. However, some specialists expressed fears that increasing competition in the continental camping business might be a more pertinent reason for the decline and posed a longer-term threat to the company's profitability. Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare Govett said the market was undecided as to whether Eurocamp's current problems were transitory or not. 'Only time will tell,' he said. 'In the meantime, the yield will support the shares but they carry a fairly large risk.' Airtours closed a penny up at 341p. Southern Electricity surged into the lead in the current spate of dividend payouts from the 'recs', with a hefty increase of 17.6 per cent. Southern said its total dividend was 19.6p per share for the year to end March compared with analysts' expectations which ranged from 18.7p to 19.1p, and last time's 16.7p. Profits rose to Pounds 187.3m against Pounds 166.3m previously. The shares put on 10 to 482p. The remainder of the scrip issue was thought to have been placed in Redland as two large lumps of 4.2m went through the market to take the day's turnover to 10m. The shares jumped 7 to 483p as selected building materials stocks responded positively to the German interest rate cut. Among which, RMC Group gained 12 to 748p. City presentations by Tarmac were generally well received, according to analysts, although the shares declined 3 to 137p as worries persisted over debt levels and some thoughts that they were fully valued. A big seller in Spring Ram sparked renewed fears over the group's trading and the shares dropped 6 to 44p. Results from BPB contained few surprises and the shares drifted down a penny to 223p. There was yet another cash call in the stirring property sector as Asda Property launched a 2-for-5 issue to raise Pounds 16.3m. The shares fell 3 to 86p, 11p below the 75p rights price. Guinness shares continued their good run, although drinks analysts continued to talk down any impact from the Japanese duty reductions. The shares gained 5 to 476p. Vaux benefited from optimism in the hotel market and added 5 to 235p. A rumoured downgrade in Storehouse, said by dealers to be from James Capel, saw the shares drop back 6 to 206p. A positive statement and results from Tie Rack helped it to move ahead 3 to 130p. There was some reported switching out of Kingfisher, off 5 at 599p, and into WH Smith, ahead 8 1/2 at 441p. Hopes of a settlement between Eurotunnel and the construction contractors boosted shares in the channel tunnel operator. They added 7 to 413p. Bargain hunters in Tiphook helped the shares recover from recent falls to end 7 better at 329p. Strong two-way business was seen in international conglomerate Hanson, following Wednesday's announcement that it is to buy Quantum Chemical of the US in a Dollars 3.2bn deal. Turnover for the day was just over 22m as the shares followed the market lower, closing 1 1/2 down at 225p. Standard &amp; Poors, the US credit rating agency, said it had affirmed its A+ rating on Hanson Overseas BV and an A-1+ rating on Hanson Finance UK in the wake of the agreed bid. Several stocks in the motor sector with substantial German interests were boosted by the news of the reduction in interest rates. These included Lucas Industries 4 better at 140p, with sentiment boosted by further reflection on Wednesday's announcement that the company is to supply its electronic diesel fuel injection system to Mercedes Benz.

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Relief at BP results THERE WAS widespread relief around the market with BP's first-quarter trading figures, which narrowly avoided showing what would have been the first quarterly loss on record. The group disclosed net income of Pounds 10m compared with the Pounds 344m for the same period last year. A loss for the period had been expected, with some of the more pessimistic analysts going for a shortfall of as much as Pounds 70m. Specialists highighted the good performance of the group's downstream business. Mr Nick Clayton at Smith New Court said: 'It augurs well for Shell's results, due next week.' Mr John Toalster at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull remained cautious on BP, pointing out that, on a historic cost basis, the dividend would still be uncovered. The shares edged up 3 to 346p on turnover of 6.3m. Also circulating in the market was a suggestion, triggered by a report in the Spanish press, that BP might be about to buy a big stake in Petromed, the Spanish refiner. BP said it holds an option to buy 8 to 15 per cent of Petromed which remains valid until the end of this year. Automotive troubles Several automotive issues were unsettled by the combined effects of two more cash-raising calls, a securities house downgrading of the sector and cautious views on trading prospects from leading component manufacturers. GKN fell after Smith New Court cut its estimate of current year profits to Pounds 100m from Pounds 120m. The investment house pointed out that at the new level the automotive group would have to dip into reserves to maintain the dividend rate. Smith also lowered profits expectations for Laird Group, BBA Group and T &amp; N. GKN chairman Mr David Lees later informed the annual meeting that profits in the first half will fall 'well below' those of the second half of last year. The news thwarted any recovery in shares of GKN, which closed 8 down at 349p. The second rights issue within a week by an automotive company came from BBA Group. Shareholders are being asked to put up Pounds 79.1m in order to reduce gearing. The chairman said non-automotive businesses constituted 64 per cent of operating profits last year, and it is intended to maintain the dividend rate this year. The shares still dipped 12 to 127p. T &amp; N shrugged off initial easiness brought on by the Smith New Court downgrade after the chairman told the annual meeting yesterday he was confident that 'our continuing commitment will yield substantial benefit once demand improves'. The shares eventually settled 4 up at 160p. Motor distributor Pendragon called for cash of Pounds 11m to repay borrowings and fund development plans, news which left the stock 3 easier at 145p, after touching 140p. BTR slips back BTR suffered a delayed reaction to a cautious annual meeting statement. The shares were only modestly held back initially but dropped sharply in the afternoon session. Marketmakers believed that some analysts would cut their forecasts for the company today. Sir Owen Green, BTR's chairman, said: 'The unsatisfactory trading levels that we experienced during the second half of last year have persisted in most areas of our world. As a consequence, the results for the first four months of this year have fallen short of those for the comparable 1990 period.' Traders said a single persistent seller did most of the damage and recalled BTR's downbeat annual meeting statement a year ago, which presaged a period of share underperformance. One analyst added that the company's suggestions after yesterday's meeting that it had ruled out wholesale disposals of business might have disappointed some investors. BTR fell to 396p before ending at 401p for a net decline of 5. Turnover was a busy 4.4m. SmithKline Beecham continued to slide on profit-taking that followed Wednesday's first-quarter figures. Traders said much of the selling came from New York, where investors preferred Glaxo. SmithKline lost 9 to 800p and Glaxo climbed 16 to 1121p. Building issues raced higher, responding to the better outlook for mortgage interest rates. Redland advanced 15 to 585p after some determined buying by Hoare Govett; the broker hosted a presentation to institutional clients yesterday. Lilley held at 45p; Scottish stockbroking firm Parsons Penny, Lilley's joint broker along with BZW, is believed to have placed a 12.6m line of shares in the building group at around 43p. The shares were sold by former directors of Hatfield Estates, taken over by Lilley just over a year ago. An attempted placing of the same stake some weeks ago was unsuccessful. National Power was one of the biggest traded stocks, with 18m shares changing hands. It closed 3 1/2 higher at 137p and was said to have been catching up on PowerGen after a period of underperformance. Brokers connected to the flotation of the two generators will from Monday be allowed to publish their own profits estimates for the companies. They are expected to be bullish. PowerGen was a shade up at 142p on 7m. Other utilities were strongly supported, the Electricity Package adding 60 at Pounds 2125 and the Water Package 48 at Pounds 3083. British Gas, helped in recent sessions by a number of top broking firms taking a more positive stance on the shares, rose 5 to 244p on 6.5m after dealers reported the emergence of an unlikely story that Hanson is preparing a bid for the utility. 'Hanson does not go for regulated businesses,' said one Gas specialist. Revived investment demand found sellers reluctant in ECC stock and the price advanced quickly in thin trading to end 9 higher at 432p. The celebrations continued for United Uniform Services which, on Wednesday, reported greatly improved annual profits as well as a return to the dividend list. The shares added 4 for a two-day advance of 21 at 109p. Rentokil, the diversified group with activities in environmental services and property care, was favoured and appreciated 9 to 286p. Researcher Mr Per Chrom-Jacobsen of Baring Securities rates the stock a buy. Sears was unchanged at 90p on turnover of 14m following lower than expected final results. Once property profits were stripped out, the profits of Pounds 107.1m compared with Pounds 169.6m last time and estimates of Pounds 110m to Pounds 115m, according to Mr Nick Hawkins of Kleinwort Benson. The large turnover in the shares was caused by a two-way pull between buying by income funds and selling by investors worried that the dividend may be in jeopardy. Albert Fisher put on 2 to 123p as Corporate Partners, the investment affiliate of Lazard Freres, said it had bought 3m shares, taking its Fisher holding to 36m or 6.09 per cent of the equity. Land Securities advanced 13 to 529p in steady trade. Credit Lyonnais issued a buy note on the stock, saying it had underperformed by 20 per cent this year. 'Unless rents collapse . . . compound dividend growth of around 15 per cent to March 1993 can still be expected,' concluded the broker. Yorkshire Television outperformed most of the television contracting sector. Market-makers said sentiment had been helped by press reports of sales of the company's popular TV series The Darling Buds of May outside the UK. The company said it anticipated worldwide sales and added yesterday that it was still in talks with US networks. The shares gained 7 to 295p. Emap's agreed bid for Radio City left the former 2 off at 229p and the latter 92 up at 377p. Emap is offering 476p worth of its shares for each Radio City voting share and 398 1/2 p in shares for each non-voting share. The offer is worth about Pounds 10.7m. A substantial review of the electricals sector by Hoare Govett triggered some keen two-way interest in the area. Hoare's Mr Jim Ross said the construction products side of the industry (cables, domestic plugs, switches and fuseboxes) offered the best prospects at present. The Hoare analyst said demand for electrical construction products is forecast to grow by 8 per cent next year and 12 per cent in 1993. Hoare's favourites in this area are BICC, FKI and Volex. BICC edged up 2 to 429p while Volex moved up 3 to 264p. FKI held at 57p in spite of two big individual trades. Hoare is bearish on the power and rail equipment market, and in particular GEC and Hawker Siddeley. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (121).

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Time to reflect on gains seen in 1993 It was an impressive year all round for the world's emerging markets in 1993, but the question now exercising many minds is whether similar returns can be expected in 1994. Already in the first few days of the new year sharp declines have been recorded in a number of markets - Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Mexico for instance - although for different reasons. With regard to the Asian region, some analysts find few surprises in the reverses being recorded: they note that there was substantial year-end book building and the current situation is a healthy return to more realistic levels. However, a more measured opinion comes from Mr Jonathon Compton at Credit Lyonnais Securities. He suggests that the 100 per cent returns which have delighted investors over the last couple of years are unlikely to be repeated in 1994. 'Such returns are almost certainly unrepeatable this year, and I would expect instead to see something in the order of 10 per cent; still pretty good but not like people have been used to,' he says. Of particular concern is the situation developing in China, he adds, which is, he believes, heading towards a balance of payments crisis, sooner rather than later. 'One is looking at a 50 per cent probability that China will face a combination of high inflation, high interest rates and a weak currency.' Another factor likely to influence Asian trading this year, says Mr Compton, is the trend towards higher interest rates, heavily influenced by the situation in the US. In Latin America, Brazil remains the unknown, depending on the outcome of the reform plan, but otherwise, says Mr Roger Palmer of Kleinwort Benson, the region is likely to be a beneficiary of a movement of funds out of other regions, particularly Asia. In addition it can be expected that UK funds will move increasingly into Latin America since they have minimal exposure there at present, notes Mr Palmer. If the Brazilian rescue package is supported by congress a further boost will be granted to both the country and the region. The team at BZW in London find Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Chile attractive.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Dollar terms                     No. of      Jan 7     % Change      % Change                     stocks       1994    over week    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina           (25)        999.04      +0.5         +72.2 Brazil              (57)        263.31     +13.1        +110.6 Chile               (25)        582.72      +5.6         +39.2 Colombia*           (11)        670.95      +4.1         +57.8 Mexico              (70)      1,017.00      +1.6         +50.4 Peru**              (11)        119.52      -1.2         +19.5 Venezuela***        (11)        611.15      +3.3         +17.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- China****           (18)        144.04      -3.5         +44.0 South Korea*****   (156)        120.04      +1.6         +22.3 Philippines         (18)        329.69      -3.2        +146.9 Taiwan, China****** (90)        138.85      +2.7         +88.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- India*******        (77)        126.18      +8.5         +34.6 Indonesia********   (37)        129.24      +3.7        +120.2 Malaysia           (105)        321.93      -5.0         +96.8 Pakistan*********   (15)        409.50      +5.6        +104.6 Sri Lanka**********  (5)        178.10      +0.5         +78.1 Thailand            (55)        445.55      -6.7         +93.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece              (25)        263.91     +15.9         +35.1 Jordan              (13)        172.05      +3.9         +47.3 Portugal            (25)        115.75      +1.7         +50.1 Turkey***********   (40)        247.48     +16.4        +270.1 Zimbabwe************ (5)        178.85     -11.5           na  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Local currency terms                            Jan 7       % Change        % Change                             1994      over week      on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina              613,039.41        +0.5          +72.6 Brazil              126,372,435.2       +24.4        +5959.8 Chile                    1,005.72        +5.5          +56.8 Colombia*                  967.55        +4.4          +58.2 Mexico                   1,362.31        +1.5          +50.0 Peru**                     159.33        +0.2          +59.3 Venezuela***             1,476.88        +3.9          +58.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- China****                  158.36        -3.5          +58.4 South Korea*****           128.27        +2.2          +26.1 Philippines                430.03        -3.2         +166.0 Taiwan, China******        136.94        +2.4          +96.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- India*******               139.53        +8.5          +46.1 Indonesia********          148.26        +4.1         +125.4 Malaysia                   312.27        -7.3          +97.9 Pakistan*********          557.53        +5.6         +140.5 Sri Lanka**********        192.24        +0.7          +92.2 Thailand                   451.83        -6.5          +93.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece                     443.88       +15.4          +55.9 Jordan                     249.88        +4.4          +50.7 Portugal                   139.83        +1.2          +79.4 Turkey***********        1,724.14       +18.5         +542.9 Zimbabwe************       224.75        +5.2            na  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

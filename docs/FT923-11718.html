			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Volume improves in Brussels and Paris - A generally depressing month for European turnover After the roller-coaster ride of the last few days, June seems a long time ago. Almost lost now in the mists of time was the shock that greeted the Danish referendum result on the Maastricht treaty. The 'No' vote took Europe by surprise, and sent jitters through the financial markets. With President Francois Mitterrand, of France, opting to put the treaty to referendum in September and Prime Minister John Major, of the UK, fending off a revolt among members of his own Conservative party who wished to distance themselves from the Continent, the view took hold that the treaty's political and economic convergence theories were in serious danger of collapsing. Consequently, volumes were depressed, with two main exceptions: both Belgium and France registered significant improvements against May. Elsewhere, turnover shrank by between 18 per cent, in the case of the Netherlands, and 3 per cent, for the UK. Belgium's increase is partly ascribed to the fact that May's volume had been depressed by the large number of companies going ex-dividend. However, the market was also less affected by the Maastricht fallout than other European bourses. In a recent report, Ms Rachael Rowe of Kleinwort Benson notes that in spite of this, daily volume remained below BFr1bn (Dollars 32.7m) and was likely to stay there for some time to come. Nevertheless, she says that 'within a European context, Belgium has been one of the best performing markets against a background of general nervousness surrounding the future of the Maastricht treaty'. 'Most of the bad news in terms of company projections for 1992 earnings, the decreasing likelihood of an interest rate cut in Germany by the year's end, and a weak economic environment has already been digested by the market,' she wrote. The situation in France, which saw the biggest climb in volume during the month, was a consequence of heavy selling following the Danish vote and President Mitterrand's decision to call an autumn referendum. Mr James Cornish of County NatWest, who supplies the monthly data, notes that 'end-quarter options and futures expiry and window dressing at the end of the first half of the year' also swelled the figures. A weaker dollar and further worries about the pace of US economic recovery affected the Netherlands, which prompted investors to switch out of cyclical stocks and into defensive issues. Negative corporate news, particularly from Philips, the Dutch-based electrical giant, also affected sentiment. Philips lost 18 per cent in one day as analysts downgraded the stock following a profits warning from the company.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse             Mar       Apr       May       June        US                   1992      1992      1992       1992   Dlrs bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium          48.28     51.36     40.80      50.14      1.60 France          108.97    112.17    100.16     134.26     26.20 Germany         126.68    107.90    125.80     109.97     72.21 Italy         5,944.80  7,457.20  9,747.60   8,594.77      7.46 Netherlands      11.60     12.20     14.70      12.00      6.99 Spain           607.28    461.52    513.47     515.35      5.37 Switzerland      11.88     12.48     13.29      12.46      9.06 UK               32.59     41.17     35.35      34.05     64.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

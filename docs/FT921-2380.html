			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Lower recruiting by banks forecast THE BIG four clearing banks plan to recruit only 5,000 school-leavers this year, a seventh of their annual intake in the late 1980s, the Bifu financial services union said yesterday. Bifu, which is campaigning to make jobs an election issue among its members, said that at least 27,000 jobs had been lost among financial services companies last year. It predicted that at least 30,000 would disappear this year from the 500,000 that remain. The prediction that the big four would take on 5,000 school-leavers this year, made after an analysis of recent monthly intakes at two of the big four clearers, is about 1,000 fewer than last year's total. In the late 1980s the finance sector was one of the largest recruiters of school-leavers. Retailing was one of the few sectors which took in more. Barclays Bank, traditionally the biggest recruiter among the four, confirmed a significant drop in recruitment, down from 11,000 in 1988 to about 2,000 last year and roughly the same this year. It was unable to say how many were school-leavers, but said that of the 1988 figure about 90 per cent were under 19. Midland Bank said its intake of school-leavers last year was minimal and it expected the same this year. In 1988 it recruited 2,500 school-leavers. The reduction in the big four's intake has been mirrored at other financial services companies. Norwich Union said its recruitment of school-leavers and graduates this year was likely to be minimal. In 1987 it took on 554 school-leavers and last year recruited 251, as well as 64 graduates. Its decision to freeze recruitment this year  - except in unusual circumstances, for example if a school-leaver has language skills  - will have a significant impact in Norwich, where it is one of the largest employers. Bifu's prediction of 30,000 job losses this year in the financial services sector has been raised from about 25,000 mentioned a few weeks ago. Statements accompanying the clearing banks' financial results led to the upward revisions. Mr Leif Mills, Bifu general secretary, has written to the leaders of the main political parties expressing concern about the job losses and bank branch closures. It said: 'We are concerned that the depressed state of the economy will make us less competitive and remove the UK from the central role in the European and world financial financial market. This again will have an effect upon employment in the finance sector.'</p>

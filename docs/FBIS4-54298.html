			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] has prepared a "program for a new information system"  containing the Japanese Government's strategy for introducing a  new information system to the public sector. The program aims  at linking Japan's system with the national information  infrastructure (NII), concept of which is taking roots in the  United States with the multimedia age nearing.    Five areas including education and research have been  chosen,  and they will be enabled to tie in directly with the U.S.  information infrastructure, by improving on the computer-run  information and communications networks. For instance, the  program will improve electronic libraries so that people would  be able to search for library materials using their personal  computers, provide information network systems to research  institutes, and turn administrative materials into database  systems. The government's overall views on the program will be  consolidated by the middle of July. MITI then intends to work  on the Finance Ministry to make the program a major part of the  public works projects in the next year's budget. The project is  also expected to encourage investment from private industry.    MITI plans to call a meeting of the Industrial Structure  Council (an advisory panel to the MITI minister) on 19 May, and  will report on the concept of the "program for a new information  system" that can be called Japan's version of the NII. This is  the first time that a program for the public sector's  information system will be formulated.    Last September, the U.S. Government announced the NII  concept, which was a revised version of Vice President Gore's  "concept for a super highway" -- with the revision made to make  the private sector lead the project. MITI's concept follows the  U.S. Government's way of thinking. The government, as the major  user, will push for a buildup of the information system, and  this will hopefully contribute to the recovery of the  recession-bound market.    The five public-sector areas chosen for the new information  system program are -- in addition to education and research  organizations -- medical care and welfare, general  administration, and libraries. In the area of education, 100  elementary and middle schools will be connected in personal  computer networks, and projects to conduct classes with overseas  schools will begin. Experiments with the new concept might begin  even before the end of this year by using funds from the 1993  supplementary budget.</p>

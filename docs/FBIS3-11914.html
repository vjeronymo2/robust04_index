			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Jose, 27 Mar (PL) -- Vice President German  Serrano Pinto expressed regret today over the pressure exerted  against several Central American and Caribbean small states to  vote in favor of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo for  OAS secretary general.    In remarks made to a Costa Rican radio station from  Washington where he headed his country's delegation at the  voting, Serrano Pinto cited his sadness over the coercive  methods applied against the members of the continental  organization by a nation he declined to identify.    Costa Rica's government officials have not commented  officially about the outcome of the election, which handed  victory to the Colombian president with 20 votes cast for him  and 14 for the Costa Rican candidate, Foreign Minister Bernd  Niehaus.    As Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon charged a few  days ago, the United States resorted to pressuring the Caribbean  and Central American states to hand the election to Gaviria, as  that country regards Gaviria as "a candidate of hemispheric  projection."</p>

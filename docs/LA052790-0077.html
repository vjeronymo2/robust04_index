			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDUCING HANDICAPS FOR THE DISABLED;  </P> <P> BOLD NEW LEGISLATION WOULD EXTEND PROTECTIONS TO BROADEN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY  </P> <P> About 43 million Americans have trouble walking, talking, hearing and seeing.  Most disabled men and women are unemployed and depend on public assistance to  survive. Many are willing -- and able -- to work. Too often, they face physical  or social barriers that prevent employment. The Disabled Americans Act would  make those discriminatory barriers illegal.  </P> <P> The bill would extend the protections of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans  job discrimination based on race, national origin or gender, to Americans who  have physical and mental disabilities "affecting a major life function." Men  and women who carry the AIDS virus would gain timely and compassionate  protections against discrimination as well.  </P> <P> In addition to the workplace protections, the legislation, approved by the  House of Representatives, would prohibit discrimination in hotels, stores,  restaurants and other public accommodations. It would mandate as well equal  access to public transportation and telephone services.  </P> <P> After reconciliation with a bill passed earlier by the Senate, the legislation  is expected to reach the White House before Congress breaks for the Fourth of  July. The President's signature would guarantee a larger measure of  independence for disabled Americans.  </P> <P> Bush supports the broadened protections in the face of some business  opposition. Sure, compliance would cost, but not the small fortune opponents  claim. Typical expenses include the price of putting in a ramp, widening a door  or hiring a sign-language interpreter. Those things can add up, but surely no  business would go bankrupt making an office or store physically accessible to  people with disabilities. Small businesses would be exempt from the new law, as  would firms that would suffer "undue hardship" from the expense. Firms with 25  or more employees would have two years to make changes; firms with 15 or more  employees would have four years. Allowing firms to phase in the improvements  would spread the expense in a reasonable fashion.  </P> <P> Social access is as important as physical access. How many bosses have refused  to hire a qualified worker who happens to be handicapped for fear of making  other employees or clients uncomfortable? The new law would make such biases  illegal.  </P> <P> Discrimination based on race, gender, national origin or disability is contrary  to the founding principles of this nation. The Disabled Americans Act would  extend basic federal protections to broaden equal opportunity. All Americans  would benefit.  </P></p>

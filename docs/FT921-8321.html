			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Wakeham seeks coal power deal MR JOHN Wakeham, the energy secretary, is trying to persuade electricity suppliers to buy enough coal-fired electricity from generators to guarantee sales of 40m tonnes from British Coal's deep mines, according to Coal UK, the newsletter published today. The deal would mean that British Coal could sell a further 20m tonnes of cheaper coal from surface mines, giving it sales close to the 65m tonnes it presently sells to the electricity industry. Although reports that Mr Wakeham was working hard to secure a contract between British Coal and the electricity industry surfaced last week, it is still unclear whether the regional electricity companies will accept Mr Wakeham's proposal. If the proposal is accepted, it would compel the generators, National Power and PowerGen, to buy from British Coal to supply the regional companies. The deal is thought to offer British Coal Pounds 35 a tonne, compared with more than Pounds 42 a tonne at present. This would allow it to keep open 28 pits it identified as most economic.</p>

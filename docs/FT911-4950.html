			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Letter: Basic cause of inflation of property prices Sir, Much recent comment including your Leader (April 16) overlooks the basic cause of inflation of house prices and credit - the artificial restraint on supply imposed by planning regulations. Current 'values' represent more than double the new building costs of an average house depreciated at, say, 1 per cent to 2 per cent a year, representing a premium over agricultural use of land of perhaps 100 times. In a free market your equity of Pounds 800bn would drop by Pounds 400bn, bringing the asset value of property to that which could earn a reasonable return if rented. Redevelopment of older substandard property would become worthwhile. No totally free market in land is likely or even desirable, but corrections for the gross distortions which overprice hovels, and price out the young and homeless are urgently needed. Some of the measures you rehearse should be implemented, including capital gains tax on equity release. Until the financial services industry as well as householders realise that 'wealth' is Chinese Money unless capable of producing an income, the better. Much of this lending would have been better directed to industry. Derek Broome, Potters' End, Mears Ashby, Northampton</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COSTA MESA ALIEN BAN IS SUSPENDED BY KEMP;  </P> <P> IMMIGRANT RIGHTS: THE HUD SECRETARY, IN OVERRIDING HIS GENERAL COUNSEL'S  RULING, CITES A CONCERN FOR 'CLEAR INJUSTICES AND ABSURDITIES' THAT COULD  RESULT.  </P> <P> Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp on Monday suspended a ruling  by HUD's general counsel that said cities can withhold federal grant money from  groups that serve illegal aliens.  </P> <P> Citing a concern for the "clear injustices and absurdities" that could result  from the opinion, Kemp called for an "urgent" meeting with immigrant rights  groups and Costa Mesa officials who had originally proposed an alien-funding  ban.  </P> <P> "This is great news, I'm elated," said Vibiana Andrade, an attorney with the  National Immigration Law Center who had vowed to sue any city that tried to  enforce such a policy. "I think it's wonderful that they are putting the brakes  on something that could have created a very bad precedent for any city that  wants to implement restrictive policies."  </P> <P> In a long-awaited ruling last week, HUD General Counsel Frank Keating said  cities can implement such a policy without violating anti-discrimination laws.  </P> <P> The opinion sparked an outcry among immigrant-rights groups and representatives  of other nonprofit rights organizations who warned that enforcement of such a  policy could result in widespread discrimination against Latinos and radically  alter the way the nonprofit groups operate.  </P> <P> Keating's ruling was based in part on HUD regulations that went into effect  June 1, prohibiting aliens who apply for immigration amnesty from benefiting  from a HUD Community Development Block Grant for a period of at least five  years.  </P> <P> On Monday, Kemp suspended those regulations as well.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear if Kemp had seen the ruling before it was issued.  But after Kemp read news accounts, according to an aide, he became concerned  about its ramifications.  </P> <P> "The strict interpretation of the law is that the Costa Mesa policy is legal,"  said George Rodriguez, a special assistant to Kemp. "However, that does not  mean that HUD endorses the policy."  </P> <P> Rodriguez said Kemp specifically was concerned with the implications of  "letting cities or local jurisdictions carry the ball on immigration."  </P> <P> Kemp also cited the impact "of putting nonprofits in the role of immigration  agents," according to Rodriguez.  </P> <P> Kemp said he wants to meet as soon as possible with Rep. C. Christopher Cox  (R-Newport Beach), Costa Mesa city officials, immigrant rights groups and  "other concerned parties" to discuss the opinion and its possible impact.  </P> <P> "The waffling by HUD on this measure is indicative of the political ambivalence  towards immigrants," said Father Jaime Soto, Hispanic vicar for the Diocese of  Orange.  </P> <P> "I'm hopeful that in HUD's reconsideration of this policy, they will find the  political will to see beyond the anxious confusion that oftentimes predominates  this debate," he said. "I hope they see the clear social interests in serving  the residents of a community without distinction."  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa City Council had passed an alien-funding ban last August but  subsequently voted to suspend it when federal authorities questioned whether it  might violate anti-discrimination laws.  </P> <P> The policy stated that the city "will not consent to support individuals or  agencies who employ, provide assistance to, house, feed or in any other  fashion, support illegal aliens." The sole programs exempted were medical and  dental services.  </P> <P> After Thursday's ruling, several Costa Mesa council members said they would  seek to have the policy reinstituted. However, city officials said Monday that  they will now likely put off any decision until after conferring with HUD  officials.  </P> <P> "It's something we're greatly concerned with," Mayor Peter F. Buffa said. "I am  going to put a call in to Secretary Kemp's office in the morning and will make  sure that myself and other city officials are available to meet with Rep. Cox  (who sought the HUD opinion on behalf of the city) and anyone else that the  secretary suggests because we think this is a very important issue."  </P> <P> It was expected that Buffa would be the swing vote on a decision to reinstitute  the policy in Costa Mesa. The mayor previously voted to adopt the policy but  then voted to suspend it pending HUD's ruling. However, after hearing of Kemp's  concerns, Buffa said the city must move cautiously.  </P> <P> "We don't particularly want to be in the position of being the first one  through the door and seeing if a huge federal agency follows," he said.  </P> <P> Councilman Orville Amburgey, who had originally proposed the funding policy, on  Monday questioned why city officials had not been forewarned of Kemp's  announcement.  </P> <P> "It sounds to me like Mr. Kemp is trying to make political hay out of this  issue," Amburgey said. "We have a very severe problem in Southern California  with illegal aliens. As a representative of Costa Mesa constituents, I have to  do whatever I can to mitigate it. . . . "As long as the interpretation of the  policy is legal, that's all we want from them. It's become a national issue and  very political, and I won't tolerate it. All we want to know is if we implement  this policy will HUD withhold (Community Development Block Grant) money from  us."  </P> <P> But several immigrant rights advocates were heartened by Kemp's change in  policy.  </P> <P> "It is very good news," said Nativo Lopez, director of Hermandad Mexicana  Nacional, a Santa Ana immigrant rights group. Lopez said he received a  telephone call from Kemp's office to inform him of the new position.  </P> <P> "It makes us more confident that he will look with more scrutiny and  sensitivity at this policy to make sure that service care providers aren't  pressed against the wall and made agents of the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service," Lopez said.  </P> <P> "Quite frankly," he continued, "in previous discussions we've had with  Secretary Kemp, he has never expressed that view. That's why when this policy  came down, we were quite shocked. We know that philosophically he doesn't think  that way. We think he's more sensitive."  </P> <P> Carlos Holguin of the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights and  Constitutional Law exclaimed: "That's good, that's great."  </P> <P> "Under the Reagan Administration, we would have expected such a policy decision  (such as the one last week in support of the pending Costa Mesa policy), but  the Bush Adminstration is a little more conscious of and sensitive about these  things," he said.  </P> <P> Holguin suggested that the Bush Administration is probably already under some  pressure to show more sensitivity in its immigration policy in light of a  recent report by the General Accounting Office of widespread discrimination by  employers against immigrants or those who appear to be foreign-born. Under 1986  reforms of the federal immigration law, employers are now required, under  penalty of sanctions, to make sure that their workers are legal residents.  </P> <P> "If they allow local governments to implement similar policies (that would  require social service groups to verify a client's legal status), the outcry  would be even more intense," Holguin said. "It just doesn't make political  sense at this time."  </P> <P> Norma Cantu, regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and  Educational Fund's San Antonio office, agreed that the Bush Administration  appears to be trying to overcome perceptions that immigration policy is  discriminatory to some groups.  </P> <P> "There is much too high a rate of discrimination in implementing immigration  policy," Cantu said. "What the GAO report found is a barometer for what's  happening out in our society.  </P> <P> "We are very concerned with policies such as this one (as proposed in Costa  Mesa) because of the discrimination they can create," she said.  </P> <P> In a 1982 case pressed by attorneys for MALDEF, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled  that immigrants, regardless of their legal status, cannot be barred from  attending public schools. The immigrant-rights group last week indicated that  it would also keep a close eye on the Costa Mesa policy.  </P></p>

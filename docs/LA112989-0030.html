			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AIR FORCE SAYS BILL THREATENS SOME TEST FLIGHTS;  </P> <P> DESERT CONSERVATION: MILITARY OFFICIALS SEEK TO ALLAY BUSINESSES' FEARS THAT  PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS MIGHT FORCE EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE TO MOVE.  </P> <P> Air Force officials told Antelope Valley business people Tuesday that a desert  preservation bill pending in Congress could hamper low-altitude flights from  Edwards Air Force Base.  </P> <P> However, they rejected local speculation that the base might be forced to move.  </P> <P> The proposed California desert protection act, sponsored by Sen. Alan Cranston  (D-Calif.), would give about 7.5 million acres of desert, mostly in Southern  California, either wilderness or parkland status. The land would include tracts  under the 20,000-square-mile area of airspace used by Edwards Air Force Base  and other military bases.  </P> <P> Cranston and environmental groups supporting his legislation contend that the  bill does not attempt to restrict military use of airspace over the desert. But  Air Force officials argued that language in the bill could be interpreted to do  that.  </P> <P> "It probably would preclude us from being able to meet our mission," said  Robert Johnstone, chief of the plans and policies division at Edwards' Air  Force Flight Test Center. The 300,000-acre base in southern Kern County is  where most of the Air Force's advanced aircraft are designed and tested.  </P> <P> Johnstone's warning came during a forum on the dispute held in Lancaster before  a group of Antelope Valley business leaders. Edwards is the single biggest  economic force in the high desert region. It employs about 14,000 people and  has an estimated regional monetary impact of $1.1 billion a year.  </P> <P> Business leaders from nearby Lancaster and Palmdale in northern Los Angeles  County came to the session believing that the Air Force might move the base if  Cranston's legislation passed. But Johnstone and other Air Force officials said  the talk of moving was the result of a misunderstanding.  </P> <P> "Right now, I don't have my suitcases packed," Johnstone said.  </P> <P> The Air Force likes its 20,000-square-mile restricted flight area between  Edwards and the town of Bishop to the north because it is sparsely populated  and has a diversity of terrain suited for combat flight testing. Many flights  are done at low altitudes, under 3,000 feet, to simulate avoiding enemy radar.  </P> <P> At issue in the desert dispute is language in Cranston's bill that specifically  allows low-level military flights over the desert areas, provided they are "in  approximately the same location and degree as existed prior to the enactment of  this act."  </P> <P> His bill was originally silent on the subject, but military officials wanted  the added language, and Cranston obliged. The military says the new language  could hamper it by preventing testing that is different from what's done now.  </P> <P> Environmentalists say they want some conditions in the bill to prevent the Air  Force operations at Edwards from expanding from the current testing mode into a  broader training operation. There are already 90,000 aircraft sorties a year in  the military airspace, Johnstone said.  </P> <P> Jim Dodson, the base's budget officer who also is a director of the California  Desert Protection League, an environmental group backing Cranston's bill, said  preservationists are not bothered by the current flights. He said his group is  satisfied with the bill.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dubai, March 8 (AFP)--Rival northern and southern  troops have reinforced their positions across Yemen, bracing for  renewed fighting.    The build-up came despite growing opposition in the main  cities to any spread of violence, the YEMEN TIMES reported in  its latest edition seen here.    The English-language weekly published two maps showing where  units loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner, and  his southern rival, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, were being  swelled by reinforcements.    These moves could lead "at any time" to a "large-scale  conflict", since there had been no political settlement to the  seven-month-old crisis, the paper warned.    North and South Yemen united in May 1990, but a crisis  erupted last August when al-Bid refused to take up his duties in  the northern capital Sanaa, demanding political, economic and  security reforms.    The armies of the two former states, which each have about  50,000 men, were never merged after unification.    According to the YEMEN TIMES maps, rival units are facing  each others in 'Amran, Ma'rib, Dhamar and Harib, in the northern  part of the country.    Clashes in the past two weeks in Abyan province have already  killed more than 20 people and left dozens of others wounded,  sources have said.    It was here a few dozen kilometers (miles) east of Aden that  the largest build-up appeared to be taking place despite a  reconciliation agreement signed by Salih and al-Bid on February  20 in Amman, Jordan, the paper said.    In the south troops were preparing for action in Qataba,  Mukayras and near the port city of Aden, the former South Yemeni  capital.    The regular army units on each side were also counting on  tribal support if a large scale war erupted.    President Salih has already received the backing of the  powerful Hashed tribal confederation, led by the Muslim  fundamentalist Speaker of the Parliament Shaykh 'Abdallah  al-Ahmar.    And Vice-President al-Bid has deployed militiamen around  Aden, and is being backed by the Bakil tribe, Hashid's rival.    Witnesses have also reported seeing military equipment being  regularly flown into Sanaa and Aden from abroad. The exact  nature and origin of those equipment is still unknown.    The recent build-up in war preparations prompted Sanaa  university lecturers to launch a "popular resistance" movement  last week to make the "politicians listen to reason."    Hundreds of people in Sanaa, Ta'iz and Hudaydah, in the  north, and Aden, in the south, have signed a petition opposing  violence and demanding that the Amman agreement be implemented.    And organisers say that it has won the support of some  military officers from both sides.    Several Yemeni leaders, including al-Bid, have also called  for a "civil disobedience" campaign to resolve the crisis  peacefully.</p>

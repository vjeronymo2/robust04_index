If that grievance procedure or subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> binding arbitration procedure finds that the participant did in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact satisfactorily complete a term of service, then that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual will be eligible to receive an educational award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or be eligible to serve a second term of service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;2522.230  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Under what circumstances may AmeriCorps participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be released from completing a term of service, and what are the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, AmeriCorps programs have the authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release participants serving in approved AmeriCorps positions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from completing a term of service for two reasons: for compelling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal circumstances as demonstrated by the participant or for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Release for compelling personal circumstances.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general, AmeriCorps programs have the authority to define the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances by which a participant may be released for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compelling personal circumstances. Programs wishing to release  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants serving in approved AmeriCorps positions may elect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To grant the release and provide a portion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational award equal to the portion of the term served; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To permit the participant to temporarily suspend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of the term of service for a period of up to two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years (and such additional period as the Corporation may allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for extenuating circumstances) and, upon completion of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, to allow the participant to return to the program with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which he or she was serving or to a similar AmeriCorps program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the assistance of the Corporation, in order to complete the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remainder of the term of service and obtain the entire AmeriCorps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Release for cause.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AmeriCorps programs have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to define the circumstances by which a participant may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be released for cause, except as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section. AmeriCorps programs must establish a written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy to be signed both by the participant and the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directors that clearly states the circumstances under which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants may be released for cause. Examples of conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which programs may decide constitutes grounds for release for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause include chronic truancy, consistent failure to follow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directions, and failure to adhere to program rules and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines. Under no circumstances may a participant <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability constitute grounds for release for cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Circumstances requiring release for cause.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AmeriCorps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs are required to release for cause any participant who is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convicted of a felony during a term of service. Any participant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who is officially charged with a violent felony (e.g., rape or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homicide), or sale or distribution of a controlled substance, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any participant convicted of the possession of a controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance, will have his or her service suspended without a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> living allowance and without receiving credit for hours missed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any individual whose service was suspended because of being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charged with a violent felony or sale or distribution of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance may resume service if he or she is found not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guilty or if such charge is dismissed. Any individual whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service was suspended because of being convicted of a first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offense of the possession of a controlled substance may resume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service by demonstrating that he or she has enrolled in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved drug rehabilitation program. A person convicted of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second or third possession of a controlled substance may resume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service by demonstrating successful completion of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation program. Any person that drops out of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AmeriCorps program without obtaining a release for compelling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal circumstances is considered to have been released for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Impact of release for cause.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A participant released for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause may not receive any portion of the AmeriCorps educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> award. In addition, any individual released for cause who wishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reapply to the program from which he or she was released or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any other AmeriCorps program is required to disclose the release  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to that program. Failure to disclose to an AmeriCorps program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any history of having been released for cause from another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AmeriCorps program will render an individual ineligible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive the AmeriCorps educational award, notwithstanding whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or not that individual successfully completes the term of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grievance procedure.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any AmeriCorps participant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wishing to contest a program decision to release that participant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for cause may file a grievance according to the procedures set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth in part 2540 of this chapter. Pending the resolution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such grievance procedure, a program may suspend the service of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that participant. If the initial grievance procedure or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent binding arbitration proceedings find that there was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not cause for release, the AmeriCorps program must reinstate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participant; moreover, the program must credit the participant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with any service hours missed and pay the participant the full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of any living allowance the participant did not receive as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a result of such suspension. The Corporation retains the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion to determine whether Corporation funds may be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay the living allowance withheld during a participant's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;2522.240  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> What financial benefits do AmeriCorps participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serving in approved AmeriCorps positions receive?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AmeriCorps educational awards.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An individual serving in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an approved AmeriCorps position will receive an educational award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the National Service Trust upon successful completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each of up to two terms of service as defined in &sect;2522.220.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Living allowances_(1) Amount.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subject to the provisions of this part, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual who participates on a full-time basis in an AmeriCorps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program carried out using assistance provided pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;2521.30 of this chapter, including an AmeriCorps program that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives educational awards only pursuant to &sect;2521.30(c) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chapter, will receive a living allowance in an amount equal to or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater than the average annual subsistence allowance provided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VISTA volunteers under &sect;105 of the Domestic Volunteer Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4955).

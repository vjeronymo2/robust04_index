			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Carsberg renews quest to curb monopoly: Oftel's proposals for BT SINCE 1984, when BT was privatised, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the departing director-general of Oftel, has overseen a sweeping extension of price controls on the privatised telecommunications operator. At first, the watchdog covered services that provided half BT's revenues. It now covers services that account for almost 70 per cent of BT revenue. If BT hoped it would escape some of this regulation in the next few years as competitors enter its market, encouraged by the government's liberalisation of the telecommunications market last year, it will be disappointed. It seems likely that as Sir Bryan departs this summer for his new job as director-general at the Office of Fair Trading, he will leave behind an even more extensive system of regulation. According to an Oftel consultative document, published yesterday, on proposals to renew price controls on BT from the middle of next year, the case for regulation is undiminished. Although BT may face growing competition in some areas of business services, it is likely to retain an overwhelming monopoly in most sectors of the market for the foreseeable future. In the absence of competition, regulation is needed to prevent BT exploiting its monopoly power. The document suggests three possible forms of regulation: a direct limit on BT's profits; continuation of the price cap introduced in 1984; and a profit-sharing arrangement that would ensure that the company shared any unforeseen excess profits with its customers. Oftel is firmly in favour of maintaining the current price-capping formula, which limits BT's price increases to an amount less than the annual retail price index, the so-called 'RPI - X' formula. It says that, in spite of its drawbacks, the RPI is the most transparent index to use, rather than BT's input prices or a special basket of telecommunications prices. The main issue to be decided by the review will be the value of 'X' in the formula, which at present limits price increases to the RPI less 6.25 per cent. The document says the cap should continue to cover prices for local, long-distance and international calls as well as private circuits. Regulation should be extended to cover the rental price of hard-wire handsets and might apply to new services such as call forwarding and call barring, it says. Oftel is seeking views on whether the price controls should cover an overall basket of services or whether individual services, such as international calls, should have special caps. It rejects the idea of a one-off reduction in charges. Sir Bryan recommends that the next price cap should last between four to five years, the length of the previous two caps. The document raises the possibility of linking quality-of-service targets to the price controls, particularly where the quality of the network as a whole is at issue. Oftel has no statutory powers relating to BT's quality of service, although since 1987 BT has been forced to publish quality-of-service reports. It suggests that the present compensation scheme is the best way to deal with customer complaints about poor quality. Sir Bryan will consider whether BT should be required to publish its accounts on a current-cost basis, which would reflect the high costs faced by its competitors in installing modern telecommunications networks. The drawback to that would be that it would allow BT to charge higher prices, although it may also encourage competition by reflecting the real costs of installing equipment. The document casts doubt on the merit of controls on particular costs, such as BT's investment expenditure. It will review the adequacy of traditional measures of BT's productivity, such as unit costs and the number of people employed per exchange line. Those measures will be central to Oftel's judgment of the scope BT has to cut costs, and its likely profits in the next few years - and therefore how tightly the cap should be set. The other main issue to be covered by the review is the flexibility and structure of BT's tariffs, particularly the balance between prices for installing lines and making calls, between prices for calls at peak and cheap-rate times of day, and the size of local telephone districts. Oftel favours an extension of the low-user scheme, which is designed to compensate those on low incomes who might be affected by BT's moves to rebalance its prices by raising line rentals and cutting call charges. It will consider whether that scheme, which covers between 1.5m and 2m customers, should be extended to a further group of customers, defined as those whose telephone bills are significantly below the median. The review will also examine whether BT should be obliged to provide a recently developed talking terminal service which allows deaf people to use the telephone. After considering responses, Oftel will seek to negotiate a formula with BT. If that fails, the issue will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Responses to the paper, The Regulation of BT's Prices, should be submitted to Oftel, Room 229, Export House, 50 Ludgate Hill, London EC4M 7JJ. They should arrive by Friday March 27.</p>

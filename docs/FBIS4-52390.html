			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- The Livestock Cooperatives  Federation has decided to develop pasture lands in China as part  of its plan to explore livestock resources abroad.    As an initial step, the federation sent on Tuesday a  fact-finding team to the three Northeastern Chinese Provinces --  Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin -- to determine the feasibility  of creating pasture lands there.    The team will also sound out the possibility of bringing in  the 1.5 million tons of corn South Korea introduces from China  annually for use as livestock feeds, directly from China instead  of through third countries like Hong Kong as now.    Overseas development of pasture lands is needed as there is  no room to expand pasturage in the country and hay fodder prices  are higher in Korea than those of grain feeds, a federation  official said.</p>

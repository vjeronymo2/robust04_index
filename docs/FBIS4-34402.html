			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Midday Television Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Barely 43 hours before the election that will decide  who will be the new president of Colombia, voter preference is  more divided now than in previous elections. Recent polls  indicate a virtual tie between the two candidates. The election  results on 19 June will surely be a photo finish. This is why  Ernesto Samper Pizano and Andres Pastrana Arango will begin a  bona fide Colombian tour in order to secure the votes that will  take them into Narino Presidential Palace.    Andres Pastrana will visit Armenia, Pereira, Medellin,  Moteria, Cartagena, Barranquilla, Santa Marta, Valledupar,  Cucuta, and Bucaramanga this weekend. Meanwhile, Ernesto Samper  Pizano will visit Popayan, Pasto, Neiva, and a half dozen other  cities in the southwest. The two candidates are asking  Colombians to defeat abstention on 19 June. Before beginning  their tours, the two candidates expressed their confidence in  winning:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Why should  Colombians vote for you?    [Pastrana] For change. The country realized on 29 May the  country can change. People saw change was, in fact, possible;  that is why we are telling the people that if one extra person  votes for Andres along with the 2.5 million Colombians who did  the last time, we will have consolidated change in Colombia.    [Reporter] Why should Colombians vote for you?    [Samper] Because I believe I have the necessary experience  and knowledge to administrate the country. I have an excellent  running mate, Humberto de la Calle. We represent the new  Colombia. We represent those who do not want to be  discriminated against and want better living conditions. I am  ready to make the social turn Colombia needs. [end recording]</p>

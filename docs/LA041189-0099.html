			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW KOREAN AIRLINE GIVES BOEING $1-BILLION ORDER  </P> <P> A new South Korean airline with plans for service to Europe and North America  announced Monday a deal worth about $1 billion to buy nine Boeing Co. jetliners  and take options on seven more.  </P> <P> Including the new agreement with fledgling Asiana Airlines, Seattle-based  Boeing has announced orders for 110 jetliners worth $8.7 billion so far this  year.  </P> <P> Asiana, based in Seoul, began operations within South Korea on Dec. 23. It said  it will use its new jets to expand to other Asian markets and eventually to  North America and Europe.  </P> <P> Asiana ordered five 737-400s and took options for another five. It also signed  letters of intent to order two 747-400 jumbo jets and take options for two  more, and to convert two previous options for widebody 767-300s to firm orders.  </P> <P> A 747-400, the world's largest passenger jet, sells for $116 million to $136  million, depending on configuration and equipment, Boeing said. The smaller  737-400 twin-jet sells for $31 million to $36 million, while a widebody 767-300  goes for $66 million to $73 million.  </P> <P> "In the short term, we could have saved a few dollars by buying or leasing  older planes," S. Y. Park, chairman of Kumho Business Group, Asiana's parent  company, said at a news conference.  </P> <P> "However, a new airline has enough problems establishing its market base  without the burden of heavy maintenance responsibilities and the uncertainty of  whether older planes will perform reliably." Park said other aircraft  manufacturers had talked about selling planes to Asiana, "but at first, others  didn't take us seriously. Boeing did take us seriously."  </P> <P> J. F. Chorlton, a Boeing vice president, said Asiana had indicated an interest  in Boeing aircraft as early as a year ago. He said Boeing had made room on its  production line for the planes before the order was announced.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> GROUP TIES JOB BIAS TO IMMIGRATION ACT  </P> <P> The Immigration Reform Act of 1986 has led to discrimination against minority  job applicants because employers are afraid of being penalized if they do not  detect illegal aliens in their work forces, a coalition of minority groups  said. The Coalition for Immigration and Refugee Rights called on Congress to  eliminate sanctions for employers who hire illegal aliens. The group pointed to  a San Francisco survey that found half of all employers feel it is risky to  hire people who speak limited English, because they might not be legal  citizens. Employers who fail to adequately check the status of their workers  are subject to fines of up to $2,000 per worker for the first offense.  </P></p>

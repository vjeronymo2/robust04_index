			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Arms sales emerge from desert mirage - British officials optimistic that other orders will follow BAe's pounds 4bn agreement to supply bombers to Saudi Arabia IT WAS like a mirage in the desert. The arms purchases foreseen in the second stage of the UK-Saudi Arabian Al-Yamamah agreement in 1988 were trumpeted as Britain's biggest export deal. Until this week they proved alluring but unseizable. Immediately after the 1988 agreement Saudi Arabia gave approval for three minehunters to be built at Vosper Thornycroft's yard at Southampton. Then, for more than four years, Saudi Arabia continued to earmark part of its oil production for British defence supplies, but no more equipment orders emerged to boost the sagging fortunes of UK arms manufacturers. These were headed by British Aerospace, prime contractor for the programme and its principal beneficiary. Imminent deals were forecast so often that the company's employees and investors began to doubt whether the sales would materialise. The order for 48 Tornado bombers, announced by Mr John Major in Riyadh on Thursday, was the top item in the list. They will complete a Saudi fleet of 120 of the Anglo-German-Italian aircraft, including 24 air-defence versions. With weapons, spares and training, they account for only about half the estimated Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn value of the latest deal. Traditional Saudi secrecy surrounds the rest, but it is believed to include extensive ground facilities for the aircraft and improvements to the country's air-defence radar and command and control systems. British officials are optimistic that other orders will now follow. Westland, due to supply up to 88 Black Hawk helicopters which it would make under licence from Sikorsky of the US, greeted the Tornado sale as 'very good news'. Westland said that since the 1991 Gulf war the Tornados had clearly been the Saudis' top requirement. 'Until that was resolved it was always difficult to focus on other contracts,' the company said. Vosper Thornycroft, scheduled to launch the third of its Saudi minehunters next month, is awaiting confirmation of a further three. It is making naval vessels for Oman and Qatar, but is left with no other work in its specialised niche - building ships out of glass-reinforced plastic. BAe hopes to sell a further 60 Hawk trainer aircraft to the Saudis, in addition to 30 already delivered. It is relying increasingly on exporting Hawks, both as trainers and as light fighters. Apart from Saudi Arabia, the Tornado has found no clients outside the three manufacturing countries. Jordan, Oman and Malaysia all backed out of planned Tornado purchases. The Saudis are understood to have raised the volume of oil set aside for British defence purchases by 20 per cent to 600,000 barrels a day - equivalent at current prices to about Pounds 2.5bn a year. Revenue from selling this oil goes into an account run by the UK government and is passed on to BAe, which in turn pays other companies as sub-contractors. More than Pounds 10bn has already been paid through this channel. But the arrangement has proved problematic because oil prices have fallen far short of the expectations which underpinned the original calculations. BAe has 4,000 expatriates working in Saudi Arabia on a large programme of support work and services under the first part of Al-Yamamah, for which the funding system has not provided a big enough 'kitty'. This week's deal was a well-kept secret. Doubts about the Tornado sales had revived since the autumn, when the US agreed to sell 72 advanced versions of the McDonnell Douglas F-15 to the Saudis for Dollars 5bn. These include 48 aircraft equipped for ground attack, like the Tornados. BAe always maintained that the Saudis were still interested in having Tornados as well, but they were clearly tempted to play their US and UK suppliers off against each other. Their negotiations with the new US administration on the exact specifications of the F-15s - stripped of some of their capabilities in response to Israeli concerns - are still incomplete. However, the Saudis seem to have concluded they would not obtain a long-range strike capability to match that of the Tornado. The deal comes at the end of a month in which RAF Tornado bombers have twice played a successful part in bombing raids from Saudi Arabia's Dhahran air base against military installations in southern Iraq.</p>

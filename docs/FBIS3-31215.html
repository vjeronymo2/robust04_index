But barring high civilian casualty  rates from Nato bombs, the main Serbian army in the area appears  prepared to let Bosnian Serbs face Western air strikes alone.    "We believe that Serbs in the Republika Srpska (the Bosnian  Serbs' self-proclaimed statelet) have enough wisdom and strength  to protect their weapons from air strikes and to cause damage to  attacking planes in the event of any bombardment of their  artillery positions," Colonel Ljubodrag Stojadinovic, the  Yugoslav army's spokesman, said in a rare interview yesterday.    The possiblity of Western intervention bringing the  80,000-strong Yugoslav army (VJ) of Serbia and Montenegro to the  rescue of Serbs in Bosnia has been an important consideration of  Nato military planners. Despite repeated denials, the rump  Yugoslav federation is widely believed to be giving direct  support to the Serbian nationalists fighting the mainly Muslim  government in Bosnia. It was in an effort to pressurise  Belgrade into halting such assistance that the UN imposed  economic sanctions on Yugoslavia in 1992.    The open involvement of the well-equipped VJ in the fight  against United Nations servicemen in Nato aircraft would be a  first step towards widening the Bosnia war and turning Nato's  attempt to lift the siege of Sarajevo into the opening of a  bloody new war. But according to Colonel Stojadinovic, Nato air  strikes on Serbian artillery positions around Sarajevo do not by  themselves appear to be a sufficient cause for the VJ to join  the fray.    "However," he added, "if it seems that the air strikes are  aimed against Serbs (civilians), then this would be viewed as  something completely different... It would be viewed as  internationally legalised genocide. The result would be  uncontrollable warfare."    One problem facing Nato planes in an attack would be that  many of the 100 or so big guns that enforce the Serbian siege of  Sarajevo are perilously close to both Serbian and Muslim  residential areas. The positioning of weapons near hospitals and  public buildings is a tactic employed by all sides in Bosnia.  Bombing raids would have to be precise in order to keep  civilian casualties, euphemistically known as "collateral  damage", to a minimum.    When asked how the VJ would distinguish between "acceptable  collateral damage" and "genocide", Colonel Stojadinovic replied:  "Just as the attacker has a right to evaluate the criteria for  target selection, those under attack have a right to determine  if the concept of air strikes has exceeded acceptable  boundaries... I am certain that in any bombing raids around  Sarajevo, the least number of casualties would be among  soldiers."    Command of the VJ is vested in a body known as the Supreme  Defence Council, comprising the presidents of Serbia and  Montenegro and the armed forces' chief of staff. In practice  the real power is with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia,  who has overseen the VJ's transformation from a multi-ethnic,  Communist-led fighting force, to an essentially Serbian  professional army. The course the VJ steers will depend solely  on the political ambitions of Mr Milosevic. "The final military  position, of course, is dependent on politicians and state  policy," Colonel Stojadinovic said.    There was an element of bravado and rhetoric in what the  colonel said, but the impression he gave was one of concern: "As  you can clearly see, I am extremely worried."    He compared the situation in the Balkans today to 1914,  when,  following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand by a young  Serb in Sarajevo, Austria attempted to stem Serbian aspirations  towards a pan-Slav state and issued Serbia with an  uncompromising ultimatum. The result was the First World War.    "The only difference between then and now is that the Serbs  are not responsible for that massacre in the Sarajevo market.  That's what makes Nato's ultimatum (for Serbs to withdraw their  artillery from around Sarajevo) ridiculous."</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Li stresses support for UK telecoms MR LI Ka-shing, chairman of diversified Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, yesterday re-affirmed his company's commitment to its UK telecommunications business, in an attempt to end speculation concerning the group's ambitious international telecommunications strategy. Mr Li said it was Hutchison's 'firm intention' to continue supporting its UK operations, which could require capital of up to HKDollars 9bn (USDollars 1.6bn) Mr Li said the main ongoing UK investment would be in the company's personal communications network, a new mobile system designed to compete mainly with existing cellular networks. UK telepoint and paging networks were complete and would not require as much further investment. Mr Li's statement was the second concerning the company's telecommunications interests in the past week. The first, issued following a request from the Hong Kong stock exchange last week, stated that Hutchison would refocus its attention on Hong Kong and China. The failure to mention the UK fuelled speculation that these oper-ations would be sold or abandoned. Further confusion followed on Monday when Hutchison made 40 people redundant in Hutchison Telecommunications' corporate head office in Hong Kong, about 80 per cent of the total workforce there. Despite the latest statement, some analysts questioned how long Hutchison would stick by its UK operations. 'I expect the future investment in the UK will be well below the figure originally envisaged and I still anticipate Hutchison's withdrawal from the business as soon as a serious buyer emerges,' said Mr Clive Weedon at Nomura. Hong Kong investors' dissatisfaction with Hutchison's telecom business was demonstrated on Thursday, when the share price rose 12 per cent after a magazine article claimed the UK operations would be sold or shut down by the end of the year. Although Mr Simon Murray, Hutchison's managing director and main architect of the group's telecommunications investment in the UK, denied the story, it is understood that there is opposition within the Hutchison board to continued expenditure in the UK.</p>

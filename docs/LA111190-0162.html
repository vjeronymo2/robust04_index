			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK CASE  </P> <P> Betty Broderick is an unfortunate woman who was finally driven to a desperate  act by the callousness and cruelty of her husband, and by the barbarous divorce  laws of the state of California, which promote divorce and make a mockery of  marriage.  </P> <P> Dan Broderick destroyed his wife's life.  </P> <P> He betrayed his marriage vows and cheated on his wife with his young legal  assistant. He abandoned his wife, sold the family home and took the children.  </P> <P> He gave her what support he felt like, withheld it when he wanted to punish her  (there was no legal settlement made at the time of the divorce) and openly  lived with his girlfriend.  </P> <P> Finally, he left Betty Broderick with nothing to show for the nearly 17 years  she had put into her marriage.  </P> <P> Sadly, the actions of men like Dan Broderick are supported by the law and  social climate of these times. They suffer neither legal nor social sanctions  no matter how heinous their treatment of their wives and families.  </P> <P> MIMETTE EHRENFREUND, La Jolla  </P></p>

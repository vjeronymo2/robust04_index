			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cologne/Saarbruecken (DPA) -- The leading  associations of the Germany industry have described the  enlargement of the European Union [EU] by Sweden, Finland, and  Austria as a positive signal for enterprises in Germany. The  Federal Association of German Wholesale and Foreign Trade (BGA)  expects new jobs and lower prices from the enlargement of the  European Union.    The accession of the three countries will provide new  impulses to the German export economy, BGA Executive Director  Peter Spary said. "We are now even bigger than the North  American free trade zone NAFTA [North American Free Trade  Agreement]," Spary said on Saarland radio. The German consumers  can also be happy about the enlargement: "Competition in  wholesale and foreign trade will reduce prices even further."    The Federal Association of German Industry [BDI] in Cologne  stated that the Germany industry was relieved that the  membership negotiations with Sweden, Finland, and Austria were  concluded on time and is hoping that agreement with Norway will  follow in a few days.    For the German industry, the enlargement of the European  Union by EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries has  always been at the top of its European objectives list. "The  intensive trade and investment relations with this area speak  for enlargement as do the democratic and liberal traditions of  these countries." The industry is hoping that with their  accession, the advocates of a cosmopolitan policy and a policy  of the market economy by the European Union will receive further  support.</p>

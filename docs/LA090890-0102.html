			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MTV: THE NAUGHTY ENVELOPE, PLEASE;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS PROGRAM PROVIDES IMPROMPTU STAGE FOR  MUSICIANS ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF CENSORSHIP.  </P> <P> What so proudly they hailed, 'round about the twilight's last gleaming Thursday  night at the MTV Video Music Awards ceremony, was Sinead O'Connor.  </P> <P> The target of controversy recently for threatening not to perform if the  American national anthem were played before her show at a New Jersey hall,  O'Connor won scattered boos but more cheers on Thursday at the Universal  Amphitheatre as she picked up three MTV Video Music Awards.  </P> <P> Accepting the best video of the year honor for "Nothing Compares 2 U," which  came after her awards in the best female video and best post-modern video  categories, a seemingly surprised and bashful O'Connor thanked her associates  and then used the podium as a platform to address the issue that was the  dominant motif of the irreverent three-hour show -- the C-word.  </P> <P> "I have a very great respect for people of all countries, including American  people," said O'Connor, defending her action in New Jersey. "I'd like to say  that my attitude over the national anthem was in order to bring attention to  the censorship issue. As far as I'm concerned, censorship in any form is bad,  but when it's racism disguised as censorship, that's even worse, and that was  the point I was trying to make."  </P> <P> Host Arsenio Hall helped defang the seriousness of the moment afterward.  </P> <P> "Sinead! Way to go, baby!" yelled a typically cheerleader-ish Hall (who had  called the Irish singer "that cute little lady with the bald head" earlier). "I  never heard 'em sing 'The Star-Spangled Banner' at a concert! Maybe you ended  up at a baseball game or something -- you took a wrong turn!"  </P> <P> If inevitably seen by some as self-aggrandizing, O'Connor's was one of the more  tasteful plugs for freedom of speech in a self-consciously naughty show that --  with racy performances by Madonna and 2 Live Crew -- pushed the edge of the  envelope of what can be shown on TV, or MTV, but nonetheless stayed well within  the realm of self-censorship. (KTTV-TV Channel 11 will rebroadcast the show  Wednesday at 8 p.m.)  </P> <P> Compared with last year's show, which featured profane comedy from now-banned  Andrew Dice Clay and a backstage fistfight between members of Motley Crue and  Guns N' Roses, the 1990 telecast was relatively tame. But it wasn't for lack of  trying.  </P> <P> Proudly introduced by actor Eric Bogosian as "my fellow Americans -- with  honor," the controversial rap group 2 Live Crew performed one of its few  non-misogynistic songs, "Banned in the U.S.A.," sounding like ventriloquists'  dummies as they haplessly parroted quasi-patriotic defenses of their First  Amendment rights. In a show of rap solidarity, M.C. Hammer, Public Enemy's  Flavor Flav and members of N.W.A. also walked out on stage.  </P> <P> If 2 Live Crew (w)rapping its dirty ditties in the flag lacked class, the  clean-imaged M.C. Hammer still managed perhaps even worse taste -- by showing  up at the podium to accept his best rap and best dance video awards pointedly  swigging and plugging the diet cola whose advertisements featuring him  dominated the commercial breaks in the show. The audience half-expected him to  announce he was going to Disneyland next.  </P> <P> Madonna was also a contender in the most shameless sweepstakes, with an  otherwise wittily choreographed "Vogue" dance number -- in an amusingly  incongruous baroque setting -- marred by moments in which subservient boy  dancers in short pants placed their hands on her heaving bosom (twice) and  stuck their heads up her dress (twice).  </P> <P> Far more shocking was Cher, who showed up to present the climactic award . . .  conservatively dressed.  </P> <P> The best rock 'n' roll moment occurred off-camera, when Aerosmith ripped  through a rave-up version of the Beatles' "I'm Down" during a commercial break  before performing the scheduled "Love in an Elevator" -- for which the veteran  group won best hard rock/metal video.  </P> <P> "Thank you Tipper (Gore) and Jesse (Helms)," said singer Steven Tyler, keeping  the evening's main riff going, "for making sure that as long as there are a few  four-letter words on the album, it'll sell an extra million copies!"  </P> <P> Other winners included Don Henley (best male video), the B-52's (best group  video), Michael Penn (best new artist), Billy Idol (best video from a film) and  Tears for Fears (breakthrough video). Madonna herself was shut out, though her  "Vogue" video won in three technical categories, including best director for  David Fincher.  </P></p>

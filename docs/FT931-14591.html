			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Warning on E German pay rates: Federation of industry chief appeals for renegotiation of current contracts THE most important single achievement of the German government's planned 'solidarity pact' with unions, employers and the opposition should be the renegotiation of current wage contracts in east Germany, according to the German federation of industry (BDI). Mr Tyll Necker, the federation's president, said the second key element should be the demonstration by all levels of government of a genuine capacity to cut spending, in order to finance the burden of transfers to the eastern economy. He maintained in an interview that neither of those elements was assured, although Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, has expressed his determination to complete negotiations on all fronts by the end of the month. Mr Necker backed the Bundesbank's maintenance of high interest rates in order to keep pressure on both government and trade unions to accept restraint in public spending and wages, in spite of the cost to industry. Exporters, in particular, were feeling pressure from the resulting revaluation of the D-Mark, he said. However, Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial corporation, criticised the Bundesbank on Saturday for maintaining its harsh monetary policy too long. He said it was a 'dangerously wrong conclusion' for both the domestic and international economy. Mr Necker warned that failure to postpone the 26 per cent pay rise due for east German engineering workers on April 1, as part of their long-term wage equalisation deal with western workers, would lead to a 'catastrophic situation' for the rest of east German manufacturing industry. Talks which opened last week between IG-Metall, the engineering workers' union, and employers in eastern Germany produced no progress in renegotiating the deal. As for a comprehensive government savings package, under negotiation again last night between Mr Kohl and his colleagues in the government coalition, Mr Necker said it was important to create a 'public awareness' of the need for drastic savings in order to pay for the cost of German unification. Mr Kohl's talks are aimed at producing a firm proposal on savings in government spending, both in the current year and in the medium-term, totalling about DM12bn (Pounds 4.9bn). Reports over the weekend confirmed that substantial cuts in social spending - totalling as much as DM7bn - were high on the agenda.</p>

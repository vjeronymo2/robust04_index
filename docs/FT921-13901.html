			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Double investor protection I UNDERSTAND that if a building society failed, the deposit protection scheme would reimburse the first 90 per cent of deposits up a maximum of Pounds 20,000 per individual. My wife and I have a joint building society account. If our society were to fail, would we each be eligible to receive the first 90 per cent of deposits? Would it be better to have separate accounts? Each of you is entitled to the full protection so long as the joint account is not held for only one of the account holders beneficially. It is not material whether there are two separate accounts or one joint account held for the two account holders beneficially. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- A private think tank urged  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday [14 June] to slash  government spending by 20 trillion yen and nearly halve the  number of government employees by the year 2004 to make Japan a  tax-free nation in 2005.    In a report submitted to Hata and prepared by its study  group, the PHP Institute said the government should trim state  expenditures in a step-by-step manner starting in 1995 to avoid  raising taxes.    Among key proposals in the report:    The government should    -- Privatize state universities immediately    -- Abolish the food agency which tightly regulates rice  production and distribution    -- Ban special entities under the jurisdiction of government  ministries which absorb retired ex-bureaucrats    -- Reduce the number of seats in the House of  Representatives  to 250 from the current 511 and that in the House of Councillors  to 50 from the current 252    -- Reduce the number of national government employees by 45  percent or 520,000 over the next five years    -- Integrate the current 21 government ministries and  agencies and one office into six offices.    The institute also said the government could save a total of  111 trillion yen by the year 2004 if it set aside the money  saved under fiscal and administrative reforms for a fund for  welfare purposes. More than half of the fund should be used for  raising welfare standards to achieve a welfare nation without  any tax in the year 2005, it said.    The report is roughly in line with a persistent opinion  expressed by the institute's founder, the late Konosuke  Matsushita, founder of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.  Matsushita had said, "a high tax erodes the will to work. The  nation should be run without any tax."</p>

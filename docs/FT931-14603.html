			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Chancellor damps hopes of interest rate cut MR NORMAN Lamont, the chan-cellor, yesterday signalled a cautious approach to further UK interest rate cuts by stressing that the government faced a difficult task keeping inflation in its target range. Appearing on BBC Television's 'Breakfast with Frost' programme, the chancellor said there were 'many encouraging signs' that the economy was improving. He also insisted there was 'very little room for manoeuvre' if the government was to keep to its target of holding underlying inflation between 1 and 4 per cent over the life of this parliament. These remarks in a wide-ranging but soft-centred interview with Sir David Frost suggested the chancellor was in no hurry to approve a further cut in bank base rates from 7 per cent. This follows speculation in financial markets last week that interest rate cuts were imminent. His comments came as officials confirmed that Mr John Major has set up a cabinet committee to suggest new schemes to tackle rising unemployment. With the jobless total set to rise above 3m over the next few months, the prime minister is anxious to show that the government is minimising unemployment's damaging impact on confidence. The Treasury has so far resisted calls from other Whitehall departments for a large-scale jobs programme in the Budget on March 16. A report from Full Employment UK, a policy consultancy, to be presented to the prime minister this week, estimates it would cost over Pounds 630m to operate an obligatory scheme to take 400,000 long-term unemployed off the dole queue. Mr Lamont reaffirmed that the government aimed to bring underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, to between zero and 2 per cent by the end of this parliament. He made clear that this would not be easy. Official figures issued last Friday showed the underlying inflation rate crept up to 3.7 per cent last month from 3.6 per cent in November. Speaking of the 1 to 4 per cent target range, the chancellor said: 'It sounds a rather generous target, but it isn't. It is very tough by the standards of the past.' Mr Lamont said the impact on inflation of sterling's depreciation since leaving the European exchange rate mechanism had been less than feared. But it was 'early days yet' and the lower than expected boost to prices was probably because the disinflationary forces in the economy had been so strong before the September 16 currency crisis. The chancellor denied that the pound's departure from the ERM had left the government's anti-inflation strategy in tatters. He admitted, though, that the sterling crisis had acted as a 'shattering blow to confidence'. He stressed that the floating of sterling had also created opportunities; the government had been able to cut interest rates while conditions had improved for exporters. But he said currency depreciation could 'never' be the answer to Britain's economic problems. 'It is in the long term the road to ruin,' he said. The right way to improve performance was to become competitive. A welter of economic data this week should give a clearer idea of how far Britain's economy has recovered since departure from the ERM and the adoption in November of policies to encourage growth. The British Chambers of Commerce quarterly business survey, on Thursday, is expected to confirm the picture of greater optimism conveyed by smaller business surveys and reports of high turnover in the winter sales. Mr Lamont agreed with Sir David that growth in Britain 'could be better' this year than the 1 per cent forecast in the Autumn Statement. Although he insisted he was sticking to his forecast of 'around 1 per cent growth', Mr Lamont said he expected activity would accelerate to a higher growth rate in the second half of this year and to a faster rate next year. 'Obviously, one has to be cautious before ringing the bell and saying the recession is over,' he said. But there were 'good trends' in retail sales, car sales and production.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has developed  mobile launchers for its Nodong-1 missiles, making it extremely  difficult to intercept the missiles or to locate launch  facilities and knock them out of commission, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN  newspaper reported Friday.    ``North Korea will put the Nodong-1 missile into operational  deployment next year,'' the YOMIURI quoted international  military sources as saying.    ``When North Korea succeeded in test firing the Nodong-1 in  late March, it was launched from a fixed platform, so we thought  that changing the location was very difficult,'' a Japanese  Defense Agency spokesman was quoted as saying. ``But later the  United States and Japan learned that a mobile launch was  possible by analyzing intelligence.''    ``The Nodong-1 is so large that launching it from a ship  proved impossible, however,'' the senior official reportedly  said.    ``Since it does not use a fixed launch platform, it is hard  to discover the launch location. Moreover North Korea has  transferred most of its military facilities underground, so an  attack by U.S. forces on the missile facilities is difficult.''    The Nodong-1, a modified Scud-C ballistic missile having a  1,000-kilometer range, is capable of reaching most areas of  Japan except parts of Hokkaido.</p>

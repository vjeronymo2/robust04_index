			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AGOURA GIRLS' TEAM DOMINATES STAUB CROSS-COUNTRY MEET  </P> <P> Calculators were not necessary to determine the outcome of the Division I  girls' race in the Kenny Staub Invitational cross-country meet Saturday  morning. The result was visible to the naked eye.  </P> <P> Agoura placed five runners among the first eight finishers, easily beating  Palos Verdes, 19-38, at Crescenta Valley Park. The loss is Palos Verdes' second  this fall after three consecutive undefeated seasons. Agoura also was  responsible for the first defeat, beating the Sea Kings three weeks ago in the  Woodbridge Invitational.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill (96), Simi Valley (117) and Redlands (125) rounded out the top  five.  </P> <P> "They really surprised me today," Agoura Coach Bill Duley said of his Chargers.  "They knew what they had to do today and they executed it beautifully."  </P> <P> Sparked by the 1-2-3 finish of Deena Drossin, Tiffany York and Kristy Camp,  Agoura combined for a meet-record team time of 94 minutes 33 seconds, knocking  16 seconds off the mark set in 1981 by Santa Ana Foothill.  </P> <P> The finish resembled an Agoura-Palos Verdes dual meet more than an invitational  race. Six Agoura runners placed in the top 10, with the remaining four spots  filled by Palos Verdes runners. Simi Valley's Lori Church (11th) was the  highest-placing runner from another school.  </P> <P> Drossin's bid for her third course record of the season took a turn for the  worse with a half-mile left in the three-mile race.  </P> <P> The defending state Division I champion won in 17:42, but a wrong turn added  almost 50 yards to Drossin's race. Had she stayed on course, she might have  broken the course mark of 17:31.  </P> <P> In the boys' Division I race, Ben Mesfen of Venice remained undefeated, winning  in 15:27. Agoura's Ryan Wilson was second in 15:43. Hoover claimed the team  title over Palos Verdes, 58-71, behind the third-place effort of Margarito  Casillas (15:52).  </P> <P> Jeff Wilson (15:50) of Newbury Park and Westlake's Jeannie Rothman (17:55) won  the Division II boys' and girls' individual titles. Thousand Oaks scored 111  points to take the boys' Division II team title and Claremont edged Westlake,  71-74, for the girls' championship.  </P> <P> Illnesses and ineligibility hampered defending City Section champion Taft,  which finished a distant fifth in the Division I race. The Toreadors were  running without Jim Gough, a transfer from Toronto, who is on the 10-week  ineligible list because of transcript problems.  </P></p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Walbrook issues survival plan WALBROOK INSURANCE, a subsidiary of London United Investments which is in administration, has a balance sheet deficit of Pounds 170m, the directors told major policyholders at a meeting in Chicago yesterday. Walbrook, which stopped paying claims on May 29 after having made additional reserves which gave it net negative worth, urged policyholders to accept a plan to keep the company out of liquidation. Under the proposal, the largest policyholders would receive 100 per cent of claims on condition of returning 60 per cent in subscription for redeemable preference shares in the company. The shares would carry no dividend and be redeemable in 2012, on pain of a shareholder vote to wind up the company. They would rank above the rights of current shareholders. Large policyholders - those which have above Dollars 1m in potential outstanding claims - number 200 in the US and UK. To approve the plan, enough will have to vote in favour to cover the value of the net liabilities and a reserve. There are more than 200,000 total policyholders. However, small policyholders would be paid in full and not be required to subscribe to the shares. Claims settled but not paid by May 29 would also be paid in full. Letters of credit and valid set-offs would be honoured. The directors of Walbrook - Sir Ian Morrow, Professor Ian Percy and Mr Bill Goodier - would remain in charge, which they said would allow greater flexibility and avoid the costs of liquidators fees. 'This plan maximises value for the policyholder, while protecting the company's major asset,' Sir Ian said yesterday. He called the plan a 'unique effort' to avoid the risk of becoming 'deadlocked in complexities'. The policyholders were urged to sign non-binding agreements on or before July 24, which would allow the scheme to come into operation towards the end of the year. If the plan fails, the company faces the prospect of a formal scheme of arrangement, or provisional or full liquidation. Walbrook has estimated gross liabilities of more than Pounds 900m and undiscounted claims of Pounds 1.3bn.</p>

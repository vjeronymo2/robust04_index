			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Kohl backs employers as strikes cripple cities THE GERMAN government stood its ground yesterday as the main public sector union called 75,000 workers out on strike, crippling local transport in several important cities, and prepared to bring other services to a halt. Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, said the employers' final 4.8 per cent pay offer had his 'full support', and that he was unable to improve on it. But as he spoke Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, president of the union, the oTV, demanded payment of its original 9.5 per cent claim. Heartened by an 89 per cent vote for strike action among her 900,000 members in western Germany, she renounced her earlier acceptance of an arbitration offer of 5.4 per cent. The weight of voting for strike action, and early signs of good co-ordination among the half-dozen unions involved, suggest a hard battle ahead. The government is committed to cutting costs and the record federal deficit. By giving in to the public sector unions it would be widely seen to be encouraging militancy among private sector workers. IG Metall, the 4m-member engineering union, has already called warning strikes later this week as a protest against the employers' 3.3 per cent pay offer. However, the mood among travellers was generally cheerful, helped by warm spring weather. Commuters endured massive traffic jams or walked or cycled to work. Traffic flow was further hampered by unpunished illegal parking. Striking traffic wardens in Cologne, instead of giving out tickets, papered cars and vans with notes appealing for support. The first wave of stoppages in the public sector strike was specifically aimed at public transport. Transport services were halted in 11 cities. Some 15,000 of the 17,500 transport union members in Berlin stayed away. All-out transport stoppages are expected to spread to other areas today, including the industrial centres of North Rhine Westphalia. Further disruption, affecting airports, rubbish collection, ancillary services to schools and hospitals, local and national administration, street repairs and other essential public services will take effect progressively, union leaders warned. The DPG post office union, meanwhile, called out 8,500 workers in key sorting centres. Action by signal-box staff disrupted trains in Frankfurt and Dortmund, while the main rail union, GdED, threatened further escalation. The oTV has started the action well armed with about DM600m (Pounds 204m) in its strike fund. Strike pay will cost it an estimated DM1m a day for every 10,000 members taking action. Its last national strike, in 1974, ended with an 11 per cent pay deal. Then, it called out 139,000 bus, tram and train drivers and rubbish collectors on the first day. On day two, a further 40,000 members joined in. The employers settled on the third day.

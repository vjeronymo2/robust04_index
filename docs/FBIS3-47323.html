			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Izumi Oshima: "Tokyo Intends To Bolster </F> Its Say With Beijing"]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan -- Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime  minister and foreign minister, and Qian Qichen, Chinese deputy  premier and foreign minister, held talks on 8 January in which  they agreed that both Japan and China will shift the fourth set  of yen-based loans from the conventional, medium five- to  seven-year formula to a new, short three-year formula. Japan's  yen-based loans to China have been Japan's most powerful  diplomatic card to play with China, which is a "political  power." The Japanese Government seems to have intended to  shorten the renewal period of the loans to maintain a say in  pending issues in Asia because China is seeking to use its  influence in clearing up the issue of North Korea's suspected  nuclear development program, settling the issue of democracy in  Hong Kong, and the issue of Japan-Taiwan relations.    With regard to the shortened period of the fourth set of  yen-based loans, a source traveling with the foreign minister  pointed out that: 1) With the five-year formula, Japan would be  unable to deal with China's drastically changing economic  situation and exchange rates; and 2) Other Asian nations have  been complaining about Japan's "special treatment" of China in  granting that country the five-year formula.    The meaning of Japan's yen-based loans to China is that from  an official posture, Japan cooperates economically with China's  reform and opening policy, and from a spiritual standpoint,  Japan provides China with the loans as "Japan's postwar  reparations." It can be said that this is a good time for the  Japanese Government to alter the conventional practice because  of the nonexistence of major issues currently pending between  the two countries.    Although the same source said that Japanese-Chinese  relations  are at their best level compared to any time in recent years,  Japan's diplomatic influence on China remains limited. Japan  announced its decision to unfreeze the yen-based loans to China,  which had been isolated from the rest of the world following the  Tiananmen incident in 1989. At the G-7 summit talks, Japan has  championed China. Whether Japan's attitude has served to  increase its influence on China remains questionable.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- The Kim Chaek Iron and  Steel Complex, a metallurgical giant of Korea, has begun to  produce rollers.    The roller-making equipment is operating normally.    It had undergone load tests and trial operations repeatedly.  The workers of the complex built the modern roller production  and regeneration processes with their own efforts and  technologies in a short span of time.    They finished ahead of schedule the construction project  involving the removal of 5,000 cubic metres of earth, concrete  tamping of 1,000 cubic metres and assembling of 500 tons of  pillars and beams.    The scientists and technicians succeeded in mechanising and  automating all the roller production processes through repeated  tests for the solution of scientific and technical problems  arising in the rotation number of the casting machine, the  temperature of infusion and prevention of vibration.</p>

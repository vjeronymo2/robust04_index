			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shmue'l Katz: "The Israeli as </F> /Schutzjuden/--Willingly"; passages within slantlines published  in Latin]    [Text] One of the shocking phenomena in the history of the  people of Israel in the exile was the /Schutzjuden/: the  protected Jews.    The local leader, or the elector in the Germany of the Holy  Roman Empire, took under his protection the Jewish community  that was subject to him, or the Jews who sought to come to the  area under his rule. They were completely undefended. In  exchange for payment (in the form of taxes or other means) he  would "ensure" their safety from anti-Semitic attacks. The  result of existence at the bottom of the ladder, this dependence  was one of the elements, at the same time both spiritual and  physical, that the Zionists sought to uproot.    The shame of the /Schutzjuden/--whatever its form--was  liquidated by a new generation of Jewish defense, which was  founded at the beginning of the century in pogrom-stricken  Czarist Russia. At that time, the Zionist pioneers in  Eretz-Yisra'el established their "Hashomer." Thus arose the  Jewish Brigades, which participated in the liberation of  Eretz-Yisra'el from the Turks during World War I, a complete  military tradition, that had slumbered for 1,800 years.  Afterwards, it developed into armed resistance to the repressive  rule of the British in Palestine; and it even flourished in the  framework of the Israel Defence Forces--which is considered to  be one of the best armies, if not the best army in the world.    Today, in 1993 [as in source], suddenly (as the agreement  between Prime Minister Rabin and President Bush in exchange for  the American guarantees was cooked up only last year) the  independent Government of Israel has included in its plans the  revival of the situation of the /Schutzjuden/. According to this  plan, foreign soldiers will "protect" Jews in Israel. The logic  is absurd. Its implication: /Schutzjuden/ not out of the  necessity of tragic historical circumstances, but /Schutzjuden/  out of choice. A naturally proud and independent Jewish  community is forced by its government into a situation of  dependence.    No less shocking than the humiliation of morale and spirit  inherent in the "peace with Syria" plan of the Rabin-Peres  government is the lack of willpower and a line of thinking,  which cannot withstand the critique of logic. The idea is that  the Syrians will honor a peace treaty with Israel, if Israel  relinquishes the Golan Heights. "Otherwise," so it is hinted,  Syria will initiate a war.    As a purely military issue, these things are not logical.  Syria's strategic position, opposite the Golan, is inferior  relative to that of Israel. And, indeed, the Golan is the  strongest natural factor of deterrence that the State of Israel  has. For that reason, Syria has been careful to observe the  territorial conditions of the supposed "separation of forces"  agreement, which was reached after the Yom Kippur War in 1973,  and which left Israel within sight of Damascus itself.    But the Israeli Government clarifies, before the entire  world, that it is so frightened by the threats of war that it is  willing to sacrifice its security in the north, and to hand over  to Syria--and especially to the hands of the bloodthirsty tyrant  and the hands of whoever will be his successors--the very key to  that security.    And, indeed, we will be subject to the mercies of the  Syrians, for when the security pearl of the Golan is in their  hands--as they have declared--they will be able to decide that  the time has come "for the final assault" on Israel, and then  they will not hesitate to order the "promised" American forces  to evacuate the area within 24 hours. Alternatively, if the  American forces will resist, then the Syrians will attack them  to an extent that will arouse the American public against the  presence of their forces in the contested area, or Israel will  be required to make additional concessions in order to prevent  casualties among the Americans.    There will be a great justification for the American call  for  a withdrawal of forces, and it will be heard from all quarters,  both from friends of Israel and from hostile parties.    From all quarters, with the same clarity as night follows  day, it will be said: "If those Israelis, who could definitely  have defended themselves, were so stupid as to relinquish  territory to the Arabs who for two generations have been  threatening and have twice tried to destroy them, why should the  American youths risk their lives in order to defend them?"    More knowledgeable Americans will add that the Israeli  Government agreed to relinquish the Golan Heights in exchange  for the Americans' promise of guarantees--and that they could  have taken care of it themselves for five years from Israeli  resources--even if at higher interest cost, but without  political obligations. Must American youths endanger their lives  in order to defend Israelis from the consequences of their  government's stupidity?    Moreover, Americans with a good memory will remember that  the  Israelis were always proud, and even insisted, that they did not  want foreign soldiers to fight for them.    No, "the guarantees," if they are ever given, will evaporate  (as happened in Sinai in 1967).    The feeling that the Americans will defend Jews has a  special  significance in light of the special affection that the American  administration feels towards Syria. It is difficult to find a  pragmatic reason for the treatment that the Syrian dictator  receives.    In the political sphere, Syria has nothing special to offer:  it is a poor country and lacks oil reserves. It has no  ideological charm and it continues to decorate the list of  countries that encourage terrorism.    But for years, especially since the days of President  Carter,  Syria has been spoiled and cultivated. Its interests were  protected, even though they were illegitimate, and its crimes  were swept under the carpet. Asad was the first foreign  statesman that President Carter chose to meet in 1977. At that  meeting, he said to Carter that Israel "must withdraw from all  of the territories," etc., and added that Israel must allow the  return of the refugees to Yaffo, Gaza, and Lod. Upon his return  to the United States, Carter declared that Asad was "moderate."    This love affair continued during the Gulf war, during which  Syria joined officially the coalition against Iraq but did not  lift a finger in combat, it won a grant of $2 billion (which  were allocated immediately to arms purchases). And when Syria  purchased Scud missiles from North Korea, Washington warned  Israel--the intended target of the missiles--not to stop the  ship that was bringing them to their Syrian destination.    [Editorial note] Shmu'el Katz was the first commander of the  IZL [National Military Organization--pre-1948 underground  resistance organization. A former MK [member of Knesset], he has  published a number of books on Zionist and Jewish history. He  published recently a two-volume biography of Ze'ev Jabotinsky.</p>

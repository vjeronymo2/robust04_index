In a statement, Mr Maninger said it appeared from Mr  Mandela's utterances he had not considered the alternative. "We  are convinced there will be a volkstaat, particularly once the  ANC realises it is cheaper to accommodate the aspirations of the  Afrikaner than to try to suppress us indefinitely," he said.    The only positive things about his statements were that he  had increased Afrikaners' determination to obtain a volkstaat  and mobilised them, he added.</p>

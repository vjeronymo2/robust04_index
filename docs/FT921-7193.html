			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Algerian reshuffle broadens appeal ALGERIA'S ruling Council of State announced at the weekend the formation of a new government which includes one Islamic fundamentalist and a dissident member of the leading lay-opposition party, write Lara Marlowe and Francis Ghiles. However, the cabinet reshuffle was greeted with scepticism by some Algerians who had been expecting more radical changes. The key portfolios of defence, the interior, foreign affairs and the economy remain unchanged. In an apparent attempt to conciliate Moslem militants, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, the prime minister, appointed a former senior member of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), who left the party nine months ago, as a cabinet minister. Sources close to the FIS in Algiers said Mr Said Guerchi's participation in the government, where he holds the post of minister of employment and vocational training, would not diminish their hostility to the junta in power. Mr Hashemi Nait-Djoudi, the former deputy leader of Hocine Ait-Ahmed's Front of Socialist Forces (FFS), was named minister of transport and telecommunications. A highly respected economist, Mr Ahmed Ben Bitour, was appointed treasury minister, a key position considering the difficult financial situation Algeria finds itself in.</p>

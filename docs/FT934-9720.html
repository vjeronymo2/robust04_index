			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses retrace ground after early rise BOURSES made an attempt to recover from Friday's losses, but in the end they had to settle for equilibrium, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT exemplified the continental trend, the DAX index hitting an intraday high of 2,031.32 before subsiding to close 1.75 lower on the day at 2,010.81. Turnover fell from DM8.5bn to DM7.4bn. Daimler, excited a month ago by its New York stock market debut, dropped another DM10.50 to DM712, DM59.50 below its high for the year, while BMW eased only 20 pfg to DM613.80 against a 1993 high of DM640. In retailing, Karstadt, rose DM20 to DM617 on talk of a merger between it and the Hertie store chain. Hard news, meanwhile, took Lufthansa up DM3 to DM155 on a third quarter profit and a more than halved 9-month operating loss. AMSTERDAM took a negative view of the details of Akzo's merger with Nobel Industries of Sweden. The shares closed down Fl 12.10, or 6 per cent at Fl 185.10 following their 11 per cent gain last week after good third quarter results. Some analysts were concerned that the terms of the merger - under which the Dutch chemicals group will raise Fl 1.3bn through a share placing - were very expensive. Others commented that, in spite of a dilution in earnings next year, the new group could be expected to capture increased market share as the sector passed the bottom of the current downward cycle. Cost cutting measures would also result in substantial savings over time, they added. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.7 to 135.7. KLM fell Fl 1.00 to Fl 39.80 following weekend news that no agreement had been reached on the Alcazar talks. However, there was speculation that should these talks fail, KLM and Swissair might attempt to form a link between themselves. PARIS was modestly better following losses throughout last week. The CAC-40 index gained 3.78 to 2,084.79. In the automotive sector, Michelin rose FFr6.20 to FFr175.70 while Peugeot slipped back FFr5 to FFr653. In a review, Lehman Brothers noted that there has been a 9 per cent outperformance by the sector over local markets in the year to date, in spite of car sales and earnings falling short of expectations. This, it said, had been due to interest rate cuts and favourable currency movements, which could also provide a favourable backdrop to a good performance through 1994. ZURICH gained ground early in the day as bargain hunters returned, and while prices turned back from their best levels, the SMI index finished 21.1 higher at 2,675.3. Interest centered on blue chips, which had been particularly hit by the correction. Roche certificates, the most active issue, added SFr70 to SFr5,730. Banks and insurers saw gains: Winterthur bearers rose SFr36 to SFr868. Electrowat added SFr30 to SFr3,310 with its forecast of higher net income proving in line with expectations. MILAN's Comit index finished 1.14 higher at 556.60 in thin volume. Telecommunications issues saw the best business, with Sip dipping L34 to L3,245 and Stet edging L13 higher to L3,885. The fanfare that greeted the launch of Fiat's new small Punto car at the weekend failed to spill over to market dealing. The shares finished L22 higher at L3,446 after a high of L3,535. MADRID closed mixed after a strong opening on the bond market gave shares an early boost, the general index ending 0.50 down at 299.54. However, the market extended its critical support. After Kleinwort Benson's upgrade of the market from underweight to neutral a week ago, as a result of domestic interest rate cuts in October, and the more promising outlook on labour reform and wage moderation, Goldman Sachs said yesterday that it was raising its twelve month target for the index to 370. ISTANBUL advanced 4.1 per cent aided by an improvement in the political outlook after the government announced anti-terrorist measures. The composite index rose 599.6 to 15,085.9. TEL AVIV, down 1 per cent on profit-taking on Sunday, rebounded again on underlying rumours of peace moves to close at a new all-time high in active trading. The Mishtanim index jumped 6.28, or 2.5 per cent to 253.78 in turnover of Shk465m.

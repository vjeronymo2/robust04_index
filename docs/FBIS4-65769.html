			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti by Massimo </F> Giannini in Rome; date not given: "I Will Not Be the Tax  Cadorna"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Finance Minister] Tremonti  finds himself with a heavy burden on his shoulders. To try and  translate into reality the umpteenth "dream" which the new  Luther King of Arcore, [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi, has  recounted to Italians: a drastic cut in tax pressure and a  reduction in personal income tax, with an exemption on all  incomes under 10 million lire a year.    [Giannini] What do you think of this, minister?    [Tremonti] At this stage it is premature to make grand  promises. I have not made any and I never make any, also  because we have to set everything within a major general reform  of the system. [Tremonti ends]    This already tells us a lot about the caution and the  "realpolitik" of the person. We are already light years distant  from the triumphalist preelection mirages drawn by Berlusconi.    [Giannini] Does this mean that, after employment and health,  the new government of the Right is preparing to beat another  retreat in the area of finance?    [Tremonti] Nothing of the sort. But one has to progress in  an ordered manner, and to distinguish immediately between two  phases. There is an immediate kick-start action in the tax area,  which should take place within the first 100 days. The first  measure to prepare is the detaxation of reinvested profits,  extended to all manufacturing companies.    [Giannini] You are already talking of lightening the burden.  How do you resolve the problem of less income?    [Tremonti] The effect of this measure, if we calibrate it  correctly, will in 1994 be limited to the November installment.  In 1995, however, the effects of the recovery of industrial  activity should increase tax revenue, compensating for the fall  in income of the previous year, but with an additional  advantage. For the first time, the tax office will cease having  a simply tax-levying function, and will become the positive  partner of enterprises. Then there is the second measure, the  "hiring premium" -- tax relief or a reduction in contributions  for companies which take on personnel. In this case, too, the  reduction in income will be compensated for, because the new  jobs create salaries, and hence new personal income tax, and  hence new VAT.    [Giannini] Let us now come to the major structural changes  in  the system. What should we expect in the next budget?    [Tremonti] Talking already about specific measures is  premature. I can say that I will seek to obtain the necessary  legislative instruments with which to design a new tax system.  The reform, it seems to me, ought to move in three basic  directions. Number one: from complex to simple. Citizens ought  to be able to do their own tax duty in a linear and transparent  fashion. For me there are two fundamental teachings. One is  that of Stuart Mill: The human mind is simple, and needs simple  stimuli. The second is that of the French people, which closed  their bill of grievances with a precise demand: one king, one  law, and one tax roll, because it wanted to be governed, it  wanted the certainty of law, and it wanted to pay its taxes in a  nonoppressive fashion. Up till now, in Italy, each of these has  functioned in the opposite way. Too much confusion, two much  legislative stress. Do you know how many laws and decrees have  been passed in the tax area between 1986 and 1993?    [Giannini] Tell us, Minister.    [Tremonti] Exactly 1,820. And do you know how many decrees  we have inherited, be it through a correct choice of legislative  policy, from the old government? Well 60, and 60 decrees all  currently in the pipeline are not law, but totally the reverse.  Is it not absurd that, to simplify the model 740 [Italian  personal tax declaration], my predecessor as minister had  produced a cubic meter of legal text? That I will never do....    [Giannini] And what will you do? And what should we expect  for the 1994 model 740.    [Tremonti] I hope that, with a finally new tax system, it  will be a more humane income tax declaration, from every point  of view.    [Giannini] Tell us about the two other directions.    [Tremonti] The second is the move from direct to indirect  taxes, from taxation on income to taxation on consumption. We  are at the end of the political centrality of personal taxation  and progressive taxation, which must remain but which can no  longer pretend to be the queen of the system. We are no longer  in the age of idealism, but in the age of consumerism, and the  brunt of the levy should fall on things and on nonessential  consumer goods. In this way the philosophy too is changing, no  longer just Hegelian and authoritarian, but Kantian and  contractualist, with people who, buying and consuming, choose  themselves how much tax to pay.    [Giannini] OK, but will the tax rates change, will personal  income tax bite less hard?    [Tremonti] We will need a change in rates, in order to  reduce  the progression, and hence contain the burden, in particular for  single-income families.    [Giannini] For you, is Berlusconi's idea that one can reduce  general tax pressure in our country credible?    [Tremonti] In theory yes, in practice we need to look at  the balance sheet figures, from the side of expenditure and that  of income. From this viewpoint, we are in May and the data we  have at the ministry are still those from March. In any event I  must wait for the outcome of the self-assessment operation. But  in general I have the feeling that the general situation is  anything but rosy.    [Giannini] We ought then to expect a deficit which is even  higher than what has been forecast?    [Tremonti] It is early to say so, I am taking a major  inventory. One thing which is certain is that, even to mark the  political change from the First to the Second Republic, I will  not do any make up job on the income, and I will state clearly  whether these are only nonoperating losses, that is whether the  hole is really due solely to the recession, or whether there is  not also an active shortfall, that is true and real holes.    [Giannini] In which case other body blows will be dealt,  other than tax relief.    [Tremonti] I hope not, also because I am counting on the  move  to a new tax system. We have had enough body blows. I do not  believe in the tactics of the Cadorna front [Italian front in  World War I]: 40,000 dead to recover 30 meters of ground;  maneuvers of 15 trillion lire to discover after a few months  that we are back again where we started. It is not a question  of defending Isonzo [Italian World War I battlefield], we need  to win the war and reconstruct the system from the beginning.    [Giannini] Precisely. What is the third and last direction  of the reform?    [Tremonti] It is the move from the center to the periphery,  i.e., tax federalism. This means here reconstructing our  democratic system from the bottom, based on the very simple  mechanism of "I come, I see, I pay," which is our translation of  the Anglo-Saxon principle of "no taxation without  representation." Today, this is a problem of direction.  Historically, federalism moves from the divided to the united.  For us it runs in the opposite direction, federalism is  imposing itself as a reaction to an excess of etatism. It does  not burn with the fire of race and language. It is,  secondarily, a problem of naming. For us the most valid model  is that of self-government, autonomy which moves from the bottom  to the top.    [Giannini] What does this mean, at the level of taxes?    [Tremonti] Local taxes should remain where they have been  paid, without me carrying them to Rome. The major taxes, on the  other hand, are structurally state-level and should serve to  finance the state and for the purpose of territorial  redistribution. We need, ultimately, to find a just balance  between sacrifice -- with a sense of solidarity and at national  level -- and benefit -- at the individual and local level.  People who pay taxes should have the tangible impression that  they get back something and that they control with their own  vote who uses their money. This is an essential factor for  democracy, but also for public morality. It is not by chance  that, under the previous regime, it was precisely local entities  which were the main sources of embezzlement of state funds.    [Giannini] On this subject, someone has just spoken about  partial remission of taxes on buildings, and of tax remissions  which should even be covered by those found guilty of bribery  and corruption. What do you think of this?    [Tremonti] Absolutely not. Nobody has ever spoken to me  about this. And in any cause, to consider this, one would need  a two-thirds majority consensus.    [Giannini] Tell us the truth, minister. You are said to be  an independent technician. In reality you have seemed  ideologically to be closer to the Left, then you entered the  Segni Pact, and now you are governing with the Right. rom WHere  are you coming?    [Tremonti] I consider myself as being on the Left in so far  as the Left is a metaphor for change. And, leaving aside the  metaphor, I accepted the proposal of the person who offered me  this prospect of change in total autonomy. I have accepted the  challenge. I am in this government not for the sake of the  ministerial office, but solely to be able to try, among other  things, to design a new tax system. If I can not work well, I  am going.</p>

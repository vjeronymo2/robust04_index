			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> DOLLAR ENDS MIXED IN EUROPE  </P> <P> The dollar ended mixed in European trading today after a round of central bank  intervention dampened the currency's strength. Gold prices were mixed.  </P> <P> Foreign exchange dealers said the absence of any strong policy statements  arising from the Group of Seven industrialized nations meeting in Washington on  Friday provided the foundation for a further strengthening of the dollar.  </P> <P> But the bullishness was dampened by intervention from the Federal Reserve, West  German Bundesbank and other European central banks, which sold dollars and  diluted the impact of the currency's rise.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar  rose 0.43 yen to close at 129.70. Later in London it was quoted at 129.60 yen.  </P> <P> In London, one British pound cost $1.7345, cheaper for buyers than the $1.7410  exchange rate late Friday.  </P> <P> Gold bullion was trading in London at a bid price of $388.95 a troy ounce, up  from $388.25 bid late Friday.  </P> <P> In Zurich, the bid price was $387.50, down from $389.90 bid late Friday.  </P> <P> Financial markets were closed in Hong Kong on today for the Chinese Lunar New  Year holiday. They reopen Thursday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- Pohang Iron and Steel  Co. (Posco) flatly denied rumors Tuesday that its Chairman Kim  Man-che would meet Pak Tae-chun, former chief of the mammoth  steelmaker, in Japan during Kim's current four-day visit.    The former deputy prime minister and finance minister, who  was sworn in March 8, has wound up a company reshuffle and  embarked on his first trip abroad to become familiarized with  Japanese steelmakers and to discuss technological cooperation.    Kim chose Japan as his first overseas destination because it  is not only the world's biggest steelmaker but also because it  is Posco's major technology teacher, a company official said,  adding that Kim had no reason to meet Pak.    Rumors of a Kim-Pak rendezvous have circulated since former  Chairman Chong Myong-sik and other executives refrained from  traveling to Japan lest the public misunderstand the purpose of  their trip.    Pak, who has been in Japan since resigning the chairman's  post, had expressed his wish to come back home through various  channels.    But Posco, reacting sensitively to the rumors because of  Pak's connection to politics, emphasized that Kim was strictly  on business in Japan, discussing technological cooperation, the  position of Japan's steel industry and Mitsubish Motor Co.'s  plan to import Posco cold-rolled sheets.    Company officials added that Kim had no reason to meet Pak,  with whom he has no personal relations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M.W.: "Imposed Partnership"] </F>   [Text] "The Partnership for Peace" program thrust upon  Poland does not satisfy it," declared President Walesa on the  eve of his meetings with U.S. President Bill Clinton and the  leaders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary in Prague  on 12 January.    Asked if Poland seeks full membership in NATO or only its  security guarantees, the president said that "paper guarantees"  are good for nothing. An authentic security guarantee would be  Poland's integration into European structures, including NATO.  Walesa thinks that his meeting with the U.S. President will be  "difficult" because Clinton will probably defend his program,  which is kind of imposed on us.    President Walesa will fly to Prague at 0615 GMT on 12  January, while Prime Minister Pawlak departs 45 minutes before  the president. That same day in the evening, also separately,  both politicians will return to Warsaw. According to the  Belvedere and the URM [Council of Ministers Administration], the  top state officials cannot travel together. The president and  prime minister will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Andrzej  Olechowski, who is already in Prague to prepare the meeting with  Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The  Polish delegation will first meet with Czech officials, and then  with the Americans.    During his meeting with Edward Moskal, chairman of the  Congress of Polish Americans, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander  Luczak thanked him for the support extended by that organization  for Poland's seeking full NATO membership.</p>

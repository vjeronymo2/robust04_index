			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Principles" rubric: </F> "Finance Ministry Promises To Keep an Eye on the Federal Budget.  The Senate Has To Put Up With It So Far"]    [Text] Sergey Dubinin, acting finance minister, who  presented the Law on Financing the Federal Budget Expenditures  in the Second Quarter of 1994 to the parliament's upper chamber  yesterday, said that the 9.4 trillion rubles [R] in Central Bank  credits "have already been kind of allocated," and that the  government still sees the established R10.6 trillion as the  "upper ceiling."    The government plans to hold all talks with the regions  "within the limits of the established volume of the budget;"  that is, Mr. Dubinin assured, "if someone asks for more money,  one should understand that we will thus cut someone else's  funding."    The government "still insists," he said, that the regions  may  keep 22 percent of tax revenues -- not 35 percent, as local  authorities demand. At the same time, the acting finance  minister emphasized, territorial authorities have been given the  right to impose any taxes "without limitation even on the part  of the federal parliament." In addition, local authorities will  be exempt from the obligation to report to the center about  regional budgets' expenditures.    As for "government debts toward last year's credits," Sergey  Dubinin pointed out that, "legally speaking, nothing but  obligations under bilateral treaties can be recognized as  debts." Such include, for instance, the treaty on government  orders with the Defense Ministry, agreements with workers'  collectives on the payment of wages, and government agreements  with coal miners, he said. The government has estimated last  year's debts of this kind at R4 trillion, of which R3 trillion  have already been repaid, Dubinin said. The remaining R1  trillion is expected to be repaid by issuing securities, a  measure on which an agreement with the Central Bank has already  been reached, Mr. Dubinin said.    During the discussion on the draft law the acting minister  told the senators that if they fail to adopt the document, which  was earlier passed by the lower chamber, this would "create an  extremely difficult situation, because only a lawyer will be  able to figure out in light of the current Constitution whether  the government may undertake any financing at all." A bit later  Sergey Dubinin remarked, however, that if "an extreme situation"  like that occurs, then "even a decision by the State Duma alone  may be considered fully sufficient for maintaining the country's  viability."</p>

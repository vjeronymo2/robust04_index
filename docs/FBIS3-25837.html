Last year, the port reported a handling capacity of 175.96  million tons, a net increase of more than 13 million tons over  that of 1992, according to the Ministry of Communications.    The figure puts Shanghai some 100 million tons ahead of  Qinhuangdao port, the second in terms of handling capacity,  located in north China's Hebei Province. The increase amount  almost equals the annual handling capacity of Rizhao in East  China's Shandong Province.    The handling capacity of the port rose by 5.2 percent in  1991  and 11 percent in 1992. Its growth rate last year was 7.4  percent.    In addition, major seaports of China reported a handling  capacity of 635.56 million tons in 1993, up 12.6 percent  compared with the previous year.    Of the ports which have a handling capacity of more than 50  million tons each, Shanghai's growth rate is lower than those of  Ningbo in Zhejiang and Guangzhou in Guangdong and much higher  than those of Dalian and Qinhuangdao.</p>

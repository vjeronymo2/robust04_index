			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> LARGE HILLTOP HOUSE OKD  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday approved a controversial proposal to build a  7,000-square-foot house on a hilltop above the city despite objections from  neighbors who complained that the structure was out of scale with the  surrounding area.  </P> <P> The council's 3-2 vote overturned the Planning Commission's denial of the  project at 1041 Summit Drive.  </P> <P> During a three-hour public hearing, neighborhood representatives said they  would not oppose the project if the applicant, Murray Ozer, agreed to move the  house 10 feet back from the street.  </P> <P> However, Ozer's representatives said moving the house would detract from the  design of the project and argued that Ozer had already agreed to numerous  compromises requested by the neighbors. Mayor Allan Alexander and Vice Mayor  Vicki Reynolds voted against the project, saying the house would be too visible  to neighboring hillside homeowners.  </P></p>

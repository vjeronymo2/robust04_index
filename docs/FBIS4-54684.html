			<p>BFN     [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic  had a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton's  special envoy Charles Redman. Mr Redman informed Prime Minister  Silajdzic on the arrival of a contact group in Sarajevo on  Thursday, 5 May. The Bosnia-Herzegovina prime minister informed  Redman that the negotiations have been brought into question  because of the disrespect for the NATO and UN ultimatum on the  withdrawal of the aggressor forces from around Gorazde.  Silajdzic emphasized the aggressor forces did not withdraw to a  distance of three km from Gorazde and did not withdraw their  heavy artillery from the 20 km exclusion zone from the town  center as demanded by the ultimatum.</p>

The letter said: "The government of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea demanded that the Armistice Agreement be  replaced with a peace agreement and that the `U.N. Command' in  South Korea be dissolved. But the United States and South Korea  answered this with nuclear war exercises and with a grave  provocation by alleging that the DPRK was using its peaceful  nuclear facilities for the `production of nuclear weapons.'"    Noting that the United Nations is under moral obligations to  see that the DPRK and the United States sign a peace agreement  and contribute to the independent and peaceful reunification of  Korea, the letter urged the UN secretary-general to show enough  response to this end.</p>

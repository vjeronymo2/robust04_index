			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Former Russian presidential  aide Gennadiy Burbulis on Thursday [3 February] conditioned  cooperation with and support for Russia's new cabinet on its  pursuit of political and economic reforms.    Burbulis, a member of the Russian State Duma, and head of  the  humanitarian and political center "Strategia," made the remark  in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    He also said reformists must pursue a "more realistic"  course  of reforms and acknowledge mistakes that have been made over the  past two years resulting in bankruptcies and unemployment.    More emphasis must be placed on securing the livelihood of  pensioners and other disadvantaged citizens, he said.    In an apparent barb at the new cabinet of Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin, Burbulis warned that the country's problems  cannot be solved by such measures as excessive issuance of  currency, which would fuel inflation, and reckless issuance of  subsidies for state farms and industry.    He was speaking amid widespread speculation that market  reforms are threatened by last month's cabinet shakeup and the  departure of leading free marketeers Yegor Gaydar and Boris  Fedorov, and Liberal Social Welfare Minister Ella Pamfilova.    Chernomyrdin has argued that the reshuffle was necessitated  by the strong showing of ultranationalists and Communists in  December's parliamentary elections.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin has vowed that reforms will  continue but has largely distanced himself from the new cabinet.    Burbulis, who is a leader of Russia's Choice, the largest  party in the lower house of the legislature, is visiting Tokyo  as a member of the Russian delegation to a two-day trilateral  forum between Russia, Japan and the United States on problems of  security in the north Pacific, which ended Wednesday.</p>

"There was no progress overnight in negotiations on  fishing,"  said Spain's Foreign Minister Javier Solana.    The main hitch in Norway's membership talks remains demands  from Spain and Portugal that their fishing fleets should be able  to net 14,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively of cod fish from  Norwegian waters each year. Portugal, which considers cod its  national dish, bought 40 percent of its total fish imports from  Norway in 1993.    Norway has also refused to countenance demands from France  and Ireland for limits on Norwegian fish exports.    The foreign ministers talks, which resumed here this  morning,  have also faltered over new decision-making procedures to be  adopted when Sweden, Finland, Austria and possibly Norway join  the Union.    Italy, Britain and Spain are demanding changes to the  statute  to make sure that small nations accounting for only small  percentages of total EU population cannot veto decisions.</p>

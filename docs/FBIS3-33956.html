Mohammad Yunus Kanuni, the political counselor at the Afghan  Defense Ministry, told MENA that these youths' identities have  not been ascertained yet but interrogation of other prisoners  showed that they were Egyptian, Sudanese, and Algerian nationals.    He regretted the fact that the names of those killed are not  known so as to inform their families. He said that Hekmatyar's  forces took away their passports as soon as they joined and gave  them aliases that do not indicate their real identities.    In reply to a question on how these youths had come to the  areas of fighting in Afghanistan, Yunus said that a number of  service offices that operate under false Islamic names succeeded  in enticing these youths to come to Afghanistan under the false  pretext of "Islamic jihad."    The Afghan official expressed hope that Muslim youths will  understand what the real situation in Afghanistan is before they  think of traveling to it under false slogans that take jihad as  their symbol. He added that the service offices treat these  groups as mercenaries.</p>

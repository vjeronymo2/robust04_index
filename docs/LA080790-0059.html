			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N. RETALIATES WITH EMBARGO ON OIL, ARMS;  </P> <P> SANCTIONS: SECURITY COUNCIL'S STUNNING UNANIMITY IN STRIKING BACK AT IRAQ IS  SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR BUSH.  </P> <P> Acting with swift and resounding unanimity, the United Nations Security Council  on Monday imposed a worldwide economic and military embargo on Iraq for  invading Kuwait and setting up a puppet regime to run its oil-rich neighbor.  </P> <P> The resolution, approved 13 to 0 with 2 abstentions, requires all 159 member  nations of the global organization to stop importing oil from Iraq and Kuwait  and to halt nearly all exports to the Baghdad regime, including arms.  </P> <P> It was only the third time in U.N. history that such sweeping sanctions were  imposed, following earlier embargoes voted against the white-minority  governments of Rhodesia and South Africa.  </P> <P> The vote represented a major triumph for President Bush's campaign to place  broad-based economic pressure on Saddam Hussein to force him to withdraw his  troops.  </P> <P> Experts on the oil trade cautioned that Iraq still might be able to sell oil on  the black market or to oil-dependent countries that choose to defy the  sanctions in order to keep their economies strong.  </P> <P> However, the sanctions are expected to significantly complicate and constrict  Iraq's chief method of producing income and to ostracize the nation in  international commerce.  </P> <P> "These sanctions must be enforced," Bush said at the White House after the  vote. "We need to discuss full and total implementation of these sanctions,  ruling out nothing at all."  </P> <P> British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in Washington to discuss the Persian  Gulf crisis, added: "I cannot remember a time when we had the world so strongly  together against an action as now."  </P> <P> Iraq's envoy to the United Nations termed the embargo "illegal" and the product  of U.S. intimidation. "One superpower is trying to use the U.N. and the  Security Council to realize its objectives, as if the Security Council was  simply its foreign ministry," Ambassador Abdul al Anbari said.  </P> <P> However, only two Security Council members did not vote for the resolution:  Cuba and Yemen both abstained.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, once Iraq's main arms supplier and often at odds with the  United States in U.N. affairs, voted for the sanctions. So did China, another  permanent Security Council member along with the United States, Britain and  France.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has indicated that a naval blockade to stop tanker  shipments from Iraq and Kuwait is being considered to back up the embargo.  </P> <P> Industry experts warned that it may be difficult to stop all sales of Iraqi and  Kuwaiti oil because those nations produce 4 million barrels a day, or about  7.5% of world output. Higher prices will provide a strong temptation to cheat.  </P> <P> "You're dealing with oil, and you're dealing with money -- and the impact of  that on a lot of countries is going to be very serious," said Patrick Connelly,  a specialist on the oil trade at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.  </P> <P> In another analysis, the Middle East Economic Survey said it is doubtful that  Saudi Arabia would increase its oil production to make up the shortfall.  Increased Saudi production would be necessary to prevent oil-consuming nations  from suffering significant adverse economic effects, but the Saudi government  may be fearful of antagonizing Iraq, which has massed troops on its border.  </P> <P> But G. Henry Schuler, director of the energy program for the Center for  Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the embargo could pinch  Iraq.  </P> <P> "If Western Europe, the United States and Japan comply in good faith, there is  very little Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil that's going to move," he said. But "the  boycotting nations . . . are going to feel the pain long before the Iraqis feel  the pain."  </P> <P> In an important gesture of support, Turkish President Turgut Ozal said in a  broadcast interview that as a result of the vote, he will close the pipeline  across his country that takes Iraqi oil to the Mediterranean for shipment.  </P> <P> "We will obey the U.N. embargo," Ozal said. Earlier in the day, Iraq had  announced that it would halt the flow of export oil through one side of  pipeline that passes through Turkey to the Mediterranean and that it had  reduced the flow through the other side by more than half because of decreased  demand.  </P> <P> Another pipeline for Iraqi oil crosses Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The Security Council resolution was the result of three days of  behind-the-scenes lobbying by the United States. It came after the United  States, Japan and the European Community had announced their own trade  boycotts.  </P> <P> "Iraq must learn that its disregard for international law will have crippling  political and economic costs, including but not limited to arms cutoffs," said  Thomas R. Pickering, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. "Iraq's aggression  must be and will be stopped."  </P> <P> Other favorable votes were cast by Canada, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia,  Finland, Malaysia, Zaire and Romania, all temporary members of the council.  </P> <P> The resolution calls on U.N. members to prevent their citizens from aiding in  the transshipment of Iraqi or Kuwaiti products -- language obviously directed  at the Turkish and Saudi Arabian pipelines.  </P> <P> It also calls on all states to cut off loans or any other form of economic aid  to Iraq but allows the shipment of medical supplies and other humanitarian  assistance. The U.N. action came as the stock market tumbled and oil prices  climbed over fears that Iraq might send its troops into Saudi Arabia and  tighten its grip on the world oil market even further. It followed an earlier  resolution, passed 14 to 0 last Thursday, condemning the invasion and demanding  immediate withdrawal from Kuwait of an estimated 100,000-man Iraqi invasion  force.  </P> <P> Iraq's Anbari charged that the sanctions will "destroy the world economy. It's  going to destroy Third World countries. The United States and U.S. oil  companies will make billions of dollars, but the poor Third World countries  will suffer the consequences."  </P> <P> But Pickering said it was Iraq's "blatant aggression" that had plunged the gulf  region into crisis.  </P> <P> Citing Iraq's and Kuwait's huge reserves, he said, "Thirty percent of the  world's oil is now under Iraqi control . . . thus threatening international  economic health and stability."  </P> <P> Compliance with the sanctions will hurt some nations more than others. Japan,  for example, now imports 550,000 barrels a day from Iraq and Kuwait, or 12% of  its consumption, and would have to make up for the loss elsewhere.  </P> <P> Brazil, which declared its support for the embargo, imports 30% of its oil from  Iraq.  </P> <P> Turkey gains about $500 million a year from its pipeline operations for Iraqi  oil and gets half of its oil supply from Iraq at a favorable price.  </P> <P> "We stand to suffer a great deal," said Turkish Ambassador Mustafa Aksin in a  telephone interview. "We are not a rich country, and we don't have the room for  maneuver that a country like Japan has, for example. But I think Turkey will do  what is right."  </P> <P> Latest U.S. government statistics show that West Germany, France, Britain and  Japan all imported large amounts of oil from Iraq in 1988, indicating that they  will need to replace part or all of this amount from other sources and probably  pay a higher price for petroleum as long as the embargo lasts. Western Europe,  Japan and the United States have accounted for 70% of Iraq's oil sales in  recent years.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia could make up almost half of the 4-million-barrel daily shortfall  with its surplus capacity if it chooses to do so, according to the Middle East  Economic Review. The United Arab Emirates could supply another 600,000 barrels  a day, and Venezuela has a 500,000-barrel-a-day spare capacity, the publication  said.  </P> <P> U.S. imports of Iraqi crude oil amounted to 10% of total U.S. purchases of  foreign oil in the first five months of this year. Kuwaiti oil represented a 2%  share.  </P> <P> Shannon reported from United Nations and Eaton reported from Washington.

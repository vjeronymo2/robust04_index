			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Delhi clue to Sri Lanka deaths: A common factor in recent killings Connections with India appear to be a significant factor behind a string of assassinations of Sri Lanka's senior political and military figures. Mr Gamini Dissanayake, the opposition leader who was to have been presidential candidate in Sri Lanka's elections next Wednesday, was assassinated because of his role in the India-Sri Lanka 'peace accord' of 1987 which brought a huge Indian peace-keeping force to crush the secessionist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Sri Lanka's new government has asked Indian investigators to help with inquiries into Mr Dissanayake's murder, perhaps risking again inflaming Tamil rage at a time when it has been trying to bring peace to the northern Jaffna peninsula for which the LTTE is seeking autonomy. At the time, of New Delhi's last intervention, the Indian elite were worried about the possible impact of LTTE propaganda on Tamil Nadu, the large southern Indian state which has a secessionist history of its own. The narrow Palk Straits separates Sri Lanka's northern province, the 'traditional homeland' of the island's Tamils, from Tamil Nadu. Mr Dissanayake was proud of the part he played in the 'peace accord' and of his close friendship with Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the Indian prime minister who, like Mr Dissanayake, was assassinated by a Tamil suicide bomber. The presence of an Indian army bigger than Sri Lanka's own led to the resurgence of the Sinhalese radical youth movement (JVP), which in 1971 raised the romantic Che Guervara banner, but this time is ultra-Sinhala nationalist and Pol Potist in sentiment. In the late 1980s, the JVP mounted a bloody campaign in the south which damaged the island's tourism industry and eventually overshadowed the Tamil rebellion. In 1988, pressed from north and south, the then President Ranasinghe Premadasa asked India to pull out its troops. Mr Gandhi refused. The Indian peace-keeping force lost 1,400 men. Mr Gandhi's successors then withdrew the force. The LTTE expected to be rewarded with at least regional autonomy. Mr Premadasa disappointed them, soon establishing good relations with the new Indian prime minister, Mr PV Narasimha Rao. On May Day last year, an LTTE suicide bomber killed Mr Premadasa. In February this year the LTTE accused 'Sinhalese chauvinist forces' of gathering in the south and engaging in a new proselytising drive. 'This coming together is being secretly encouraged by India. Thus, there cannot be any doubt Gamini is an Indian lackey,' it said. Mr Lakshman Kadirgamar, Sri Lanka's foreign minister, has now asked the Indian government 'to provide the services of two Indian experts to help in the investigation into the assassination' of Mr Dissanayake. The cabinet had responded to a request by Mrs Srima Dissanayake, who has replaced her late husband as the conservative United National Party's choice to stand in the presidential elections against the Peoples' Alliance candidate, prime minister Chandrika Kumaratunge. When the newly-elected People's Alliance, which gambled successfully on a growing peace constituency and looks forward to a 'peace dividend' to cut defence spending sharply, sent a four-member 'peace mission' to Jaffna, it was received by an LTTE commander and treated to an LTTE guard-of-honour. The two sides sat on opposite sides of a table which had two flags, the Sri Lankan and the LTTE. On the wall was a picture of Velupillai Prabhakaran, the LTTE supremo. The meeting, given widespread television coverage, gave the impression that the delegates represented two separate states. Mr Prabhakaran is seen as the toughest guerrilla leader in the world, says one western diplomat. The questions now are whether India sends its investigators, and whether Mr Prabhakaran will see their arrival as the formation of another Delhi/Colombo axis against him.</p>

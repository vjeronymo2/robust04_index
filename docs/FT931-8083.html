			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Food and Drink: Poor food - it sticks in my throat, but .. /  ..when top-class restaurants cannot get the basics right,they deserve to be taken to task, says Nicholas Lander ALTHOUGH I have written this column for four years, I still find the obvious question the most difficult. Should anybody ask me 'Where is the best place to eat in London?' I mumble and try to change the subject. It is only when I can move this question on to specifics - area, price, type of cooking - that I feel more confident, particularly as I am convinced that not only is the quality of restaurants improving nationally, but so too is the value they offer. At least, I thought that until the past fortnight, when two dinners and one lunch for a total of eight people costing a total of Pounds 360 all proved a grave disappointment. Normally, I do not review unsatisfactory restaurants but this sorry sequence, which inadvertently taught me a lot, will be the exception to this rule. Although a long-time admirer of Nico Ladenis as a cook, I decided just to mention his move to the Grosvenor House en passant rather than devote another article to his restaurant, now known as Nico at Ninety. After all, Ladenis is now plugged into the effective Forte PR machine. It was the need to distract a friend whose wife was away that finally provided a raison d'etre for a visit. Fortunately, we were all interested in wine because the highlight of the meal was the knowledgeable British sommelier, who steered us in the direction of two interesting, relatively well-priced, bottles. But his enthusiasm was not matched by that of the maitre d', who had to be prompted into divulging the fish specials and who managed to run the descriptions of all four into one long convoluted sentence. We therefore decided to order meat but had difficulty choosing because, having eaten Ladenis's food before, there seemed to be little new. The dishes that had been stimulating five years ago were repeated, but at higher prices (Pounds 42 for two courses) and our own lack of enthusiasm seemed to be reflected in the kitchen. Small details annoyed me. The dessert menu, which baldly asked me to pay Pounds 8 for a lemon tart (albeit in French), was worn and needed replacing. Out of the corner of my eye I kept spying a waiter, only half hidden by the kitchen door, swigging from a bottle of Perrier. Two days later, meeting a fish merchant friend at the new restaurant in Harvey Nichols, in Knightsbridge, I first surveyed the fish counter in the food store. Fresh halibut, turbot and glistening red mullet whetted my appetite. However, the chef cannot be in touch with the store's fish buyer because the only fish on the restaurant menu were lemon sole with a crab sauce (half way through my meal I saw a blackboard in the kitchen which read NO LEMON SOLE) and an Italian fish chowder which I mistakenly ordered. This was bland and thin and its only connection with Italy, I felt, was the tomato. The restaurant will have problems until the relatively inexperienced Henry Harris, formerly sous chef at Bibendum, eventually finds his feet as a head chef and their personable general manager, Dominic Ford, stops running around trying to plug too many holes and concentrates on orchestrating the service - which is poor in spite of the 15 per cent service charge. We had to ask for menus, ask again to order, and then our conversation was interrupted three times by the waiter. But my meal was irrevocably spoilt by having to sit and watch a single lady diner wait 20 minutes for a bowl of fish soup. That is no way to treat a lady. But the head-scratching service at La Semillante, Mill Street, London W1, made this experience pale into insignificance. Here our meal was barely salvaged by happy recollections of John Cleese in 'Fawlty Towers,' although watching a commis waiter walk out of the kitchen with an empty tray, put it solemnly down on a table, pick the tray up again and walk back into the kitchen will remain a low point in the career of this restaurant correspondent. We went there because I intended to write an article on pastry chefs and I had been reliably informed that the chef, Patrick Woodside, a graduate of Tante Claire and Claridge's, was one of the best. Certainly his bread is first class and he is possibly an inventive, talented chef. However, as well as being let down by inept front-of-house staff, his talents are hidden by a menu that contains more past participles than anything I have seen since I took Latin A level and a kitchen brigade that on the night could not get the basics right. A filet of hare came without the crispy rice advertised on the menu; another dish came with a potato 'fondant' and brussel sprouts that had not been thoroughly cooked. We were not asked why we had left a good portion of the meal uneaten. The overall experience of these three restaurants left me wiser, poorer and even more reluctant to make recommendations. But there was another cause for concern. Quite understandably, none of the restaurants uses the large pretentious silver 'cloches' to cover the plates. But none of the food came to me, on cold winter evenings in air-conditioned rooms, as hot as I would have liked. For any reader able to design a suitable cover there is, I believe, a ready market.</p>

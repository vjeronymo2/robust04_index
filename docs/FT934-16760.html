			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Lilley still 'invisible' MR Peter Lilley, the social services secretary, last night claimed an unenviable place in opinion poll history after being voted the cabinet's most invisible member for the fourth year in succession. The annual Gallup survey for today's edition of The Daily Telegraph showed that only 11 per cent of voters were able to identify Mr Lilley from his photograph. The only consolation was that four years ago, when he first topped the anonymity poll, a mere two per cent had any idea of who he was. Predictably Mr John Major, Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Kenneth Clarke dominate the other end of the recognition scale. Mr John MacGregor and Mrs Gillian Shephard could, like Mr Lilley, benefit from a little more public exposure.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / C&amp;G case dominates behind-the-scenes talk: The Lloyds bid has focused the attention of BSA delegates The talks in the hall during the Building Societies Association conference were about the housing market, the savings market, technology and regulation. The talk in the bars and receptions, by contrast, was of next week's court case in which the legality of the Lloyds Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society will be tested. On the platform, the few explicit references to the Lloyds bid consisted almost entirely of the words 'sub judice'. But in a more coded form it lay behind the vigorous defences of mutuality in some speeches. The point most concerning societies if the bid clears the courts is the ability to offer cash to society members of less than two years' standing. The legislative intention to prevent speculative flows of retail deposits seems to have been clear - the doubt is in the effectiveness of the drafting. Mr Geoffrey Lister, BSA chairman and chief executive of Bradford and Bingley, told a press conference that if the deal was allowed to go ahead, then the BSA would immediately press the government for a change in the law, in time to affect any future cash bids. Separately, Mr Andrew Long-hurst, C&amp;G chief executive, and Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds chief executive, who addressed the conference on 'creating shareholder value', both expressed confidence in their legal advice. More broadly, the Lloyds bid has led to intensified lobbying of the government by societies who want to ensure that the Treasury review of the societies legislation does not include allowing other organisations to approach society members directly against the wishes of the board. Societies are conscious that they face potential predators in a way they have not previously done, even if they do not feel like an endangered species. Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich building society, for example, said that societies would have to give value to their members on a continuing basis, in order to show the difference made by not having to pay dividends to shareholders. The BSA also took the opportunity to highlight some market research showing that societies 'are perceived as more caring and customer-friendly than either banks or insurance companies'. Given the poor publicity that both the other classes of organisation routinely attract, this is scarcely surprising. What seems more striking is that this was the first piece of market research the BSA has ever commissioned about attitudes to societies. Apart from defining societies as the acceptable face of financial services, it looked specifically at membership rights. On one level, the results do bear out claims by societies that though mutual they are sufficiently accountable, since almost two-thirds of customers were aware they had membership rights, and about half could give an example of one without being prompted. At another level, however, they underline the strength of some of the criticisms leveled at societies. Only 3 per cent said they had ever attended an annual general meeting, only 17 per cent had ever exercised their right to vote, and 42 per cent had never exercised any of their rights. 'It's a fiction to pretend that building society boards are not accountable to their members,' Mr Lister said. If so, it is a fiction that appears to have at least some basis in fact.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / People: Gold quits Scottish Enterprise Lex Gold, one of two joint managing directors of Scottish Enterprise, the official development body for southern Scotland, is to retire from the organisation in March at the age of 52, Scottish Enterprise said yesterday. His departure will mean that the posts of both managing directors are becoming vacant. On November 28, John Cond-liffe, Gold's fellow managing director, died suddenly at the age of 46. The vacancies could lead to a reorganisation of the management structure of Scottish Enterprise, which began operating in April 1991. The system of having joint managing directors, with Gold responsible for corporate services and Condliffe handling strategy and the operations of the 13 local enterprise companies in the Scottish Enterprise network, was put in place before Crawford Beveridge, the ceo, took up his appointment early last year. Earlier this year it was learnt that Beveridge wanted to simplify the structure but no change was made. Two further changes are in the pipeline. First, dozens of jobs at Scottish Enterprise's Glasgow headquarters are likely to go in the next few months because of cuts in the organisation's budget. Secondly, Sir David Nickson, chairman of Scottish Enterprise, hands over next month to Professor Donald MacKay, an economic consultant and one of Scotland's leading economists. Gold has been a key figure in shaping Scottish Enterprise, formed through a merger of the Scottish Development Agency and the Training Agency in Scotland, of which he had been Scottish director. He says he is looking forward to 'new and fresh challenges' after 33 years in public service, but although he has received invitations to consider possible posts, nothing has been fixed up. ***** Hogg Group, the insurance broker, has announced a reorganisation of its senior management which sees James Vaughn, stepping down from his position as executive chairman. Vaughn, now 65, will remain on the board, becoming a non-executive joint deputy chairman and a member of a newly formed executive committee. Anthony Howland Jackson, 51, currently chief executive, takes over from Vaughn as executive chairman. Vaughn, an American who joined Hogg in 1983, says he intends to spend less time on day-to-day company matters. On the other hand he remains chairman of Hogg's North American subsidiary and hopes to spend at least half of each year in New York. ***** The ITV Network Centre, which will have more than Pounds 500m a year available to commission programmes for ITV, has appointed Vernon Lawrence as controller of network drama and entertainment. Lawrence, the current controller of entertainment at Yorkshire where he commissioned some of ITV's biggest successes such as Darling Buds of May, is the latest to join the new commissioning team. Last week Stuart Prebble of Granada Television joined as controller of factual programmes. The appointment of Lawrence, 52, of both drama and entertainment brings together two important roles in ITV. He will have two deputies: one responsible for drama and the other for entertainment. ***** Adrian Day has been appointed managing director of Racal Radio, part of the Racal Electronics Group. Managing director of Racal Recorders for the past three years, Day has been brought across to strengthen the management team at Racal Radio. He will be focusing on developing the group's military communications business. David Poole (above) has been appointed md of Racal Recorders Group. Martin Lea, formerly sales and marketing director of Racal-Datacom, succeeds Poole as md. ***** Wellcome, the UK drugs group, has acknowledged the move towards more collaborative ventures in the pharmaceuticals industry with the creation of a new post of director of group licensing. The new incumbent is Mark Weedon (above), formerly president of Wellcome's Canadian subsidiary. John Robb, chief executive, says an indication of the job's importance is that Weedon will report directly to him. The decision to create the post - taken unanimously by Wellcome's top 50 managers - was to help fill critical gaps in the group's product and geographical spread. 'Not all sides have been covered. We need to look at more co-development agreements, particularly in Japan where partners can help us push drugs through the regulatory process,' says Robb. He says Wellcome's presence in Japan is too narrowly based with only two products. Yet Japan remains the world's second largest market. The job will also entail completing the group's portfolio by licensing in drugs, as well as licensing out those drugs that do not fit the core portfolio.</p>

A ranking government official said  Tuesday the request would be put to Russia at the coming  bilateral meeting on the loans slated for late this month in  Seoul.    Russia has not made any clear commitment on assuming  responsibility for loans to the former Soviet Union totaling  1.47 billion U.S. dollars and overdue interest of 80 million  dollars, he added. This will be an important item on the agenda  at the upcoming government-to-government meeting with Russia, he  said.    In April last year, Russia agreed with the former Soviet  Union's group of creditor nations to reschedule the servicing of  the group's loans as the successor to the Soviet Union. But  Russia has not signed any such agreement with South Korea about  the latter's loans to the former Soviet Union.    Under an agreement reached by the group of seven advanced  nations in November 1992, Russia will repay 61.34 percent of the  loans the former Soviet Union secured from the west and the  other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  the remainder. Russia would take responsibility for repaying  all of the loans only if the other CIS member nations were  unable to shoulder their share.    The official said the agreement is the only document that  Russia has signed in regard to repayment of South Korean loans  to the former Soviet Union, though it vaguely provides for this  responsibility.    The government will also request that Moscow repay the loans  in the form of industrial materials, land leased in the Far East  of Siberia for construction of an industrial estate for South  Korean firms, or the rights for South Korean fishermen to fish  in the sea of Okhotsk -- instead of in the form of arms -- if it  wants repayment in kind.    Russia has insisted on a written guarantee covering  repayment  of the loans to the former Soviet Union if South Korea agrees to  reshedule the debt servicing in the same manner as that Moscow  agreed with the Soviet Union's creditor nations.</p>

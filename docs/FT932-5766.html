			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Bankers mount attack on fortress France: Moves by foreign bankers to secure a stake in the privatisation programme OVER the next few weeks hordes of bankers will troop into the glass towers of the French finance ministry to bid for business in the new privatisation programme. The sale of 21 state-controlled companies over the next two years could provide a lucrative source of business for the international banks that have, for years, been building up their operations in Paris. But past French governments have shown a chauvinistic streak in their choice of advisers. Plum roles have gone to Gallic banks such as Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais. Foreign banks hope that the new administration will be more internationally minded. They may be disappointed. The last right-wing French government did at least pay lip service to the principle of internationalisation during its FFr120bn (Pounds 13bn) share sales from 1986 to 1988. The rule was that a French bank was appointed as lead adviser for the domestic part of the issue and a foreign one for the international tranche. This did at least give US, UK and Swiss banks a chance to participate. In the flotation of Compagnie Generale des Eaux, Credit Lyonnais acted as chief domestic adviser with Morgan Stanley as chief international adviser. Credit Commercial de France and Goldman Sachs played the same respective roles in the privatisation of Societe Generale. SG Warburg was chief international adviser for the Havas sale and lead manager for the UK on Alcatel-Alsthom. The preference for French banks was partly a reflection of the unusually close links between politics and finance in France. Even today two of France's biggest banks, Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris, and three of its largest insurers are owned by the state. As a result many of France's largest financial institutions are run by civil servants who were educated at the elite grandes ecoles alongside the people who are now orchestrating the privatisation programme. Preference aside, another reason French banks dominated the deals was that foreign investors were only allowed to hold a maximum 20 per cent stake in a newly privatised company. In theory, the new French government should be more open-minded in its choice of advisers. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, has abolished the 20 per cent ceiling. And since the mid-1980s, international investors have played an increasingly prominent part in the Paris stock market. 'Maybe, just maybe, we've seen the last of the old 'Fortress France' mentality,' said one American banker in Paris. But in practice there are signs that the role of international banks will be severely restricted in the new privatisation drive. The socialist government set a precedent by appointing French banks as its chief advisers on both the domestic and main international parts of its partial privatisation programme. The new administration says it has not yet decided how to organise the next set of share sales, but early signals suggest it will stick to the cosy old ways. Mr Alphandery has said he plans to revive the noyaux durs, the friendly investors that take long term stakes in newly privatised concerns. Most of these will be industrial partners keen to form alliances with the old state-controlled groups. But others will be banks, eager to strengthen their client relationships. Societe Generale played an active part in the last privatisation round, both in its own sale to the private sector and as an adviser on other issues. Last month it joined a group of three investors taking minority stakes in the Total oil group. Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, announced last week that it also envisaged raising its holdings in Rhone-Poulenc and Assurances Generales de France, both privatisation prospects. It saw itself acting as as 'adviser, vendor and investor' in the new issues. Most foreign financiers suspect the French government will favour noyaux durs investors when selecting its advisers. 'It's impossible to think that it won't make a difference,' a British banker commented ruefully. Mr Alphandery has said he hopes to encourage foreign investors to act as noyaux durs. But Anglo-Saxon investment bankers have traditionally been less enthusiastic about 'industrial banking' than their continental European counterparts. 'The cost of taking a stake in a privatised French company is too high a price to pay,' said one. The critical question is whether the French banks are capable of handling the issues on their own. They do have a significant weakness in that none of them, not even Paribas, which has the highest international profile, has an adequate equity distribution network outside France. 'Distribution could become a serious problem if an issue proved difficult to sell,' said a British banker. 'But that doesn't seem very likely. After all, French privatisations have usually sold themselves.'</p>

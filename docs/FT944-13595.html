			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Japan gets taste for food from abroad - Imports have reached record levels Japan said yesterday it would set up a network of information centres to deal with an expected surge in consumer inquiries, and even complaints, about the safety of foreign foodstuffs as food imports reach record levels. Even before Japan finalises international trade agreements like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord, food imports are surging thanks to a strong yen, poor grain harvests in 1993 and a drought this summer. Three years after Japanese farmers finally lost a fiercely fought campaign to keep the country's markets closed to foreign beef and oranges, a vast range of agricultural products from Kansas steak to Australian carrots and Chinese garlic are entering the country in unprecedented quantities. This year, Japanese consumers' taste for imported meat, fruit and vegetables has been particularly noteworthy. In the first six months, imports of beef rose 23 per cent, that of citrus fruit 25 per cent, and of vegetables 71 per cent from the previous year, according to Japan's external trade organisation (ETO). The trend is such that Japan has now become the world's largest net importer of farm products, the agriculture ministry proudly proclaims. In the first half of this year, food imports rose by 18 per cent in dollar terms to Dollars 22.4bn, says the ETO. Grain imports rose by 62 per cent and vegetables by 29 per cent. Last year, agricultural imports totalled Y32.1bn (Dollars 331m) and fishery imports Dollars 14.7bn, according to finance ministry statistics. The US is by far the single largest supplier, with nearly a 30 per cent share of agricultural sales. Consumer attitudes have changed considerably even since 1991 when the opening of Japan's market to foreign oranges prompted scare stories about excessive spraying, and foreign beef was labelled cheap but of poor quality. The strong growth in imports has come despite veiled but persistent resistance among the Japanese authorities, whether prompted by vested interests or genuine concerns about retaining self-sufficiency in food. Japanese regulations demand that cherries, for example, have to be kept under 10 degrees centigrade for 12 days before they can be imported into the country. Officials sometimes find more vicious ways to obstruct increases in agricultural imports. Daiei, a big supermarket chain, has had whole shipments ruined by customs officials spraying insecticide on the grounds that an insect was seen wriggling under a lettuce leaf. Such sightings did not happen when the retailer imported in much smaller quantities than it does today. 'We are importing foreign produce increasingly as regular supplies and not just to supplement what is available domestically,' says Mr Minoru Tamura, divisional merchandise manager at Daiei. The growing difficulty of relying on domestic suppliers alone has recently encouraged Japanese retailers to look abroad increasingly for even basic vegetables. Climate changes, for example, are having a big impact on domestic supplies. This year, in particular, the unusually hot summer took its toll of domestic vegetable supplies, leading to shortages and a surge in some prices. But one-off natural aberrations aside, the structural changes facing Japanese agriculture are making it imperative that retailers look outside the country for supplies. The number of farming households in Japan has dwindled from 6.1m in 1960 to 3.8m in 1990, according to the agriculture ministry. Domestic production, it says, has shown no growth in recent years. What is more, half of those engaged in farming are already more than 60 years old and many of them will not find successors to take over what is more often than not the family business. Last year, only 3,420 out of more than 665,000 new school-leavers took up farming. An agreement at the weekend to allocate Y6,010bn to compensate for the effects of the Uruguay Round global trade accord will help the farming community but is unlikely to reverse the trend. The greying of Japan's farming community and the fewer number of hands available has also meant that, in the words of Daiei's Mr Tamura: 'Japanese farmers don't like to grow vegetables that are heavy, like cabbage, and those that require intensive labour, such as tomatoes and cucumbers.' The benefits of increased agricultural imports to Japanese consumers have been tremendous. The shortage of certain vegetables as a result of this year's unusual heat would have led to a surge in prices but 'imported fresh vegetables helped stabilise the market,' says the ETO. More long-term, opening the doors to imports is helping to bring Japanese food prices closer to international market levels. Mr Tamura expects more agricultural produce to be imported into Japan as markets are liberated and sees China as a particularly promising source. Self-sufficiency in basic foods is important, he says. 'But that doesn't change our policy of buying the best produce from the best source.'</p>

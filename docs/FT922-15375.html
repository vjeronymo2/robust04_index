			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Fondiaria reinforces AMB link FONDIARIA, the leading Italian insurance group, is spending DM562m (Pounds 196m) to buy a 14.2 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second largest insurer, in a move further cementing links between the two. The deal, which raises Fondiaria's share in AMB to 20 per cent, will reinforce the Italian group's growing foreign activities and may help AMB to resist the unwanted advances of Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the French state-owned insurer, which owns 25 per cent of AMB. AMB and AGF have been locked in a battle of wits over the French group's desire to gain a significant minority stake. AMB has so far registered voting rights for only 9 per cent of AGF's holding and made clear it regarded AGF's share purchases as unfriendly. Fondiaria is already associated with AMB and Royal Insurance of the UK in a recently-established tripartite alliance, European Partners for Insurance Co-operation (EPIC), designed to develop joint European insurance ventures. The Italian group had an option on an 18.8 per cent stake in AMB formerly held by Royal, which was sold to Credit Suisse last year. That option expired yesterday, explaining the timing of the announcement. Last January, Fondiaria sold to AMB, for DM600m, its 25 per cent stake in Volksfursorge, the former German trade union-owned life insurer, in which it had invested jointly with AMB. The move provoked speculation that Fondiaria could use the proceeds to exercise the option to buy into AMB - as has now happened.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Businesses are divided over additional deregulation  measures the government plans to draw up by late June as part of  a package of external economic measures. "The Five-man  Committee on Administrative Reform," the gathering of top  leaders of five major economic organizations, which has played a  major role in pushing deregulation, cannot tell when it can meet  again in face of objections from some business sectors.    Moreover, on 25 May, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry issued a statement jointly with three organizations  representing small and medium companies, declaring opposition to  any further easing of the Large-Scale Retail Store Law.    So far feeling in the business world has in general kept  step  with moves to deregulate, but as the debate on deregulation  enters its final stage, clear differences of view are emerging.    The Five-Man Committee on Administrative Reform was set up  in  February 1981 to give a push to the Ad Hoc Commission on  Administrative Reform. At the time it was led by Toshio  Tsuchimitsu and leaders from the Japan Federation of Economic  Organizations [Keidanren], the Japan Association of Corporate  Executives, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the  Kansai Economic Federation also took part. Last September the  committee even invited Koshiro Ishida, director-general of the  Management and Coordination Agency, to a meeting and handed him  a statement giving its views on the need for deregulation.    Keidanren and other organizations have recently asked for a  meeting of the influential committee to be called, the reason  being they want to keep the business world informed about  important issues such as the promotion of deregulation, and  thereby reduce the resistance of bureaucrats who oppose the  move. But a Keidanren official admitted: "We don't know when  the meeting will be called because some organizations have since  become hesitant about the idea; they are concerned that  deregulation might adversely affect small and medium companies  and employment figures."    Shoichiro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corporation, who  will be formally appointed as new Keidanren chairman on 27 May,  regards deregulation as one of the most important tasks facing  the country.    However, it looks as though he will face rough going in  promoting it, given the conflicting views now arising among  businesses on the issue of deregulation.</p>

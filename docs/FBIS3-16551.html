			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Khokhlov report under the general heading "Army </F> Finances Sing Gloomy Songs": "Khaki-Colored Reform"]    [Text] There is a whole section in Boris Yeltsin's message  to parliament "On Strengthening the Russian State" which is  given over to an analysis of the reform in the Army and problems  of the Armed Forces. This is nothing to be surprised at, as it  seems that the only stabilizing force in this unsettled country,  which is, moreover, surrounded by local conflict zones, is the  "man armed with a gun."    The Russian Federation president noted that the reforms in  the Army and Navy are going according to plan, in accordance  with the concept of the Armed Forces' organizational development  elaborated at the Ministry of Defense, the Russian Federation  Law "On Defense," and the defense minister's orders. Since  spring 1992 (after the presidential edict on creating a Russian  Army), 11 laws and more than 100 normative legal acts have been  elaborated and adopted. The Armed Forces' strength has been  reduced by 457,000 men. Three military district directorates,  eight army directorates, the army corps directorate, 19  divisional directorates, and eight military schools have been  disbanded. The process of reducing the number of large  strategic formations (Army -- corps) and combined units  (divisions), military higher educational establishments,  scientific research institutes, and redundant command and  control organs is continuing.    At the same time new structures are being formed which  respond to the demands of the new times. Who could earlier have  thought that the Moscow and North Caucasus Military Districts  would have ended up on the border? Now new force groupings are  being formed within them. However, there is every sign that the  Armed Forces' basic structure will be preserved until 1996.  Military experts consider this to be necessary for two reasons.  First, they say, we have had enough "revolutions," the  evolutionary route for the Army and Navy's reform is preferable.  Second, the ailing Russian economy will not be able to "stand"  a fundamental restructuring of the Armed Forces.    Our strategic nuclear forces continue to be the main  guarantor of this country's security. The principle of mobile  defense lies at the heart of the general-purpose forces'  organizational development. The priorities for military  technical policy have been given as the maintenance of nuclear  security, the equipping of mobile forces, and the supplying of  the Armed Forces with up-to-date facilities for military command  and control, communications, intelligence, and electronic  warfare.    The reforms are in general under way, moving forward, and  expanding. We must wait and see what results they will bring.  Informed sources in the Ministry of Defense claim that three  things are important for the Russian Army and Navy's reform.  First, money. Second, money. And third, money yet again.    Incidentally, the military budget for 1994 has not yet been  confirmed. The monthly "rationed" injections of cash for the  Army are practically speaking only being used for wages and  plugging "holes"....</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> PLACES;  </P> <P> IT'S LILAC TIME  </P> <P> ASSORTED KNOW-IT-ALLS who insist we can't grow lilacs in California evidently  have never visited 80-acre Margaretten Park in Leona Valley. The private  arboretum, home to 900 or so varieties of lilacs, is sponsored by the  International Lilac Society and will be open to the public the weekend of April  7 and 8 (from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.) and by appointment.  </P> <P> Thanks to 40 years of careful planting and tending by Dr. Joel Margaretten, the  park's appropriately named Bouquet Canyon now hosts more than 50,000 of the  fragrant bushes. History tells us that Marco Polo transported lilacs from China  to Persia. When he resumed his voyage, he went on to plant the hardy shrub in  Turkey; the lilac, a relative of the olive tree, flourished in both those warm  climates. The Austro-Hungarian ambassador to Turkey at the time saw the  flowering bush in the Sultan's garden in Constantinople and brought it to  Vienna, where the plant adapted to the European climate.  </P> <P> Dr. Margaretten, a semi-retired dentist and passionate lilac grower, has  re-adapted the lilac bush to a Mediterranean climate and a winterless season by  withholding water for a portion of the year, thereby allowing the plant to go  through its natural deciduous cycle of dormancy and rebirth.  </P> <P> The lilacs' Southern California horticultural haven is also home to a handful  of bullfrogs, a collection of desert mosaics built by the former owner just  after the turn of the century and a dog named Lilac.  </P> <P>  Margaretten Park, 38570 N. Bouquet Canyon Road, Leona Valley; (805) 270-0580.  </P> <P> JANEY MILSTEAD  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Liberian peace agreement appears to be back on  track. The country's three main parties have agreed that on 7  March they will install a new transitional council to run the  country. The disarmament process will also begin on that same  day. In addition a date has been set for multiparty elections  in Liberia, 7 September. The three component parties in the  agreement are the Interim Government led by Dr. Amos Sawyer, the  National Patriotic Front of Liberia, NPFL, led by Charles  Taylor, and the ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy  in Liberia] militia.    The coordinator of the peace process there is the United  Nations special representative in Liberia, Mr. Trevor Gordon  Somers. On the line to Monrovia, Fergus Nico asked him how he  felt about the latest agreement:    [Begin recording] [Somers] We reached agreement very early  this morning-- somewhere around 1 o'clock, 1:15 in the morning--  after slogging away all day, so that this has brought the  satisfaction that after hard work the parties were able to reach  an agreement. I think it is a good effort on the part of the  Liberians. The three parties have demonstrated despite the  difficulties that they had faced in reaching certain aspects of  the agreement, they had (?certainly) taken the kind of decision,  for example, that they have named a date for the installation of  their government. As you know the Liberian people have yearned  for that forsome time. And I think that is the most important  thing that the parties could have done.    [Nico] Well, let us look ahead to that-- the 7 March, the  installation of their transitional power sharing council. What  kind of distribution of portfolios do you think [word  indistinct] between the parties?    [Somers] At present, you know the parties have managed to  distribute 13 of the 17 cabinet posts. The four on which they  have not reached an agreement are defense, finance, justice, and  foreign affairs. And of the other 13, it is a fairly even  distribution among the three parties.    [Nico] But the other four are the most critical portfolios,  are they not?    [Somers] That is correct, that is correct. But I am  satisfied that they will continue to work to find a solution to  that problem before we get to the 7th. There will be a lot of  maneuvering, there will be a lot of discussions.    [Nico] Can we just turn to the other aspect of what seems to  have been the main success from the early hours of this morning  -- the question of disarmament? There's always been this  question of whether disarmament should start before the talking  or vice versa. Now you seem to have secured agreement that they  will start at the same time. Do you think really we will see  your troops beginning to collect significant number of weapons?    [Somers] The plan is that within approximately three-week  period, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Peace-  Monitoring Group] and the UN military observers will be fully  deployed throughout the country. Once they are fully deployed  then we are ready to lift the arms. And at the moment we start  the lifting of arms, that is the moment that the government  should (?be seated). And I think the act of disarmament itself  is one that will (?roll) fairly quickly, because the various  factions will bring their fighters to points, where they will  then be moved to encampment centers. And I think this is a kind  of thing that will (?rush through) once we get started with the  arm lifting.    [Nico] Is it correct to say the Ugandans and Tanzanians will  be ready to go? No word yet on the Zimbabwean contingent?    [Somers] The Tanzanians and Ugandans are already in their  (?forward) positions, ready to go. The Zimbabweans, we now have  reached the point where we are just checking with the Americans  to determine whether sufficient resources are in hand for the  Zimbabweans to come and stream as soon as we get the green  light.

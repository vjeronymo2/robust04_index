Members have  protested outside the South African embassy in Mmabatho against  the deployment of the Internal Stability Unit [ISU]. The ANC  branch claimed the ISU has been harassing residents in the  search for looted goods.    And the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] has called for the  prosecution of former Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope and  has called for ballistic tests on the weapons of right wingers  who moved in to the homeland earlier last week.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [TRUD's correspondent interviews Boris Ivanovich Katorgin, </F> General Designer of the science-production association  "Energomash"]    [Text] Katorgin: A few days ago I discovered in  the works of Academician M. V. Keldysh an acknowledgement, which  today is of very topical interest: "Only due to the creation in  our country of powerful rocket engines has it been possible to  move forward at a fast tempo towards the conquest of space." One  would like to learn more about a science-production association,  an organization which was headed for many years consecutively by  V. P. Glushko.    The story of our science-production association begins on 15  May 1929, when a group was formed in the Leningrad Gas Dynamics  Laboratory to develop rocket engines. In 1934 this group became  part of what became the first jet-propulsion scientific research  institute in the world, and in 1941 it was reorganized into an  experimental design office. During the past 60 years this  organization and its staff have undergone all kinds of changes,  but the subject of its work has remained  unchanged--liquid-propellant rocket engines.    TRUD: Please tell us, even if only briefly, the  most important landmarks in the development of the organization.    Katorgin: The first liquid-propellant rocket  engine to be produced in this country was the ORM-1 engine,  which was developed in 1930-1931 in the Gas Dynamcis Laboratory,  and which devoloped a thrust of about 20 kg and a pressure in  its combustion chamber of several atmospheres. As the design of  the engine was being perfected it went through more than 70  modifications, right up until the appearnce of model ORM-65,  which was suitable for manned flight. This engine was built in  1936.    When at the end of the war V.P. Glushko on the instructions  of Stalin acquainted himself with the engines of the V-2 rocket  in Germany, his experimental design office had already created a  series of rocket engines into whose designs at that time had  been incorporated all the basic principles of liquid-propellant  engines in their contemporary form.    Those who today try to minimize the significance of the  scientific achievement of Academician V. P. Glushko tend to  forget that the decision after the war to launch the production  of engines for the V-2 in the Soviet Union was inspired by  completely different (although in their own way important)  aims--to gain experience in the organization of such a complex  and for those times unique type of production, to prepare the  material base which was required for it, to forge cooperation,  etc.    Valentin Petrovich at the same time solved another, no less  important problem. It was demonstrated and proven that any  attempts to "squeeze out" of the engines of the V-2 any  appreciable reserves of power, reliability, etc., had no  prospect of success.    Today we can say with legitimate pride that in the engines  for the Sputnik and Vostok rockets, which put the first  artificial earth satellite and the first man, Yuriy Gagarin,  into space, were realized those same principles and solutions  which were laid down and developed experimentally by V. P.  Glushko and his pupils on their own, and indepedently from the  Germans. These principles and solutions were also in many ways  different from those of the Germans.    TRUD: You mentioned an engine of the next  generation?    Katorgin: Yes, I mentioned the first  liquid-propellant engine of powerful thrust which uses  oxygen-kerosene fuel, and which was developed in the years  1954-1957 for the first stage of the carrier Vostok. In  connection with it the RD-108 is usually mentioned, also a  four-chamber engine, which uses the same fuel, is based on the  same design and technological principles, and which made up the  second stage of the rocket in question. Both of these engines  and their modifications up until the present time have been in  operation as part of the assortment of space carrier-rockets  which are are making it possible to carry out the the Russian  Program for Manned Flights.....    TRUD: Were there any other landmark events in the  life of your science-production association?    Katorgin: Naturally! I would mention, for example,  the creation of the RD-253 for the carrier-rocket Proton, the  first stage of which is made up of six engines of this type.  This is the most powerful existing single-chamber  liquid-propellant engine, and operates on high-boiling fuel  components. And take note of this: Since 1969 this engine has  been operating without malfunction in the first stages of the  carrier Proton, providing flights for space vehicles on  assignments relating to the national economy, as well as  launches of interplanetary space stations and space vehicles  towards the Moon, Venus, and Mars. It has also put into  circumterrestrial orbits the long-term manned space stations  Salyut and Mir. And today this engine surpasses foreign analogs  in its characteristics, and has good prospects for many years to  come.    And finally the third important stage in the creative work  of  the science-production association was the development,  production, and putting into service of the RD-170 engine, which  is recognized throughout the world as unique in its power and  its design solutions. Without exaggeration it is an engine of  the 21st century, and is attracting the close attention of many  foreign companies who are working in the field of rocket engine  building. It is a four-chamber liquid-propellant engine which  posseses the highest parameters and power charactertics for  rockets of its class.    We are convinced that the use of the engine in question,  which has no analogs in the world with respect to its  combination of characteristics, will open up wide possibilities  for the creation of continuously functioning orbital complexes  on circumterrestrial orbits and for the actual realization of  manned flights to Mars.    TRUD: It is quite clear that making such a  significant journey into unexplored realms, at times under such  extreme conditions, as did Valentin Petrovich and his comrades  at the end of the thirties and the beginning of the forties,  could only have been accomplished by a collective of like-minded  people.    Katorgin: This is indeed true! One of the unique  qualities of Valentin Petrovich as a director lay in the fact  that at all stages of the work of the science-production  associaiton he knew how to unite "under the banner" of his ideas  a pleiad of outstanding designers, engineers, and scientists.  And, incidently, this applied also to talented craftsmen and  simple workers, who in no way yielded place to the legendary  Levsha.....* It was specifically this approach to the solution  of personnel problems which today gives our asscociation a high  degree of viability, even at a time of "great shocks" in our  economy.    Valentin Petrovich possessed an amazing integrity of  character, as well as devotion to a single great idea, which he  strove to achieve under any circumstances, even to the limit of  human capacities. He was without a doubt not only a pioneer, but  also a great enthusiast for space. His life, as well as his  thoughts and actions were all related to space. All the rocket  engines which he created bear the stamp of his will and his  talent.    TRUD: What high-priority project is your  science-production association aiming at today?    Katorgin: The presently available test base of the  association, which is fitted out with up-to-date equipment, can  be used for conducting comprehensive tests of various kinds of  products under conditions which have been made as close as  possible to operational ones. This refinement, if you will, is a  kind of invitation to potential partners and to collaboration.    You will be surprised to learn that our interests nowadays  go  beyond the limits of activities which are traditional for  science-production associations.    I will note for a start that space is rapidly being turned  into an arena of international cooperation, and is becoming a  realm of politics on a grand scale. At the center of attention  for world business today are projects for a global  telecommunications system, a system which would be suitable for  inclusion into the world system of communications based in space  which is being built up today.    Analysis shows that Russia today, in spite of the extreme  seriousness of the general situation in our economy, has at its  dispoisal all the necessary elements for its own independent  organization of a system of satellite communications and for  entering into competition on the world market in this field.    In order to organize such activities in space, in the  interests of the Russian people sensible federal programs are  necessary, which would (particularly in the intiial stage of the  work) be provided not simply with declared, but with real and  active support from the government. Unfortunately no unifying  and mobilizing initiative on the part of government agencies in  this field, which is so important for Russia, can be perceived.  And time is passing.    TRUD: Speaking of the future, do you consider a  further incrrease in the power of the rocket engines built by  the association as an urgent task?    Katorgin: I believe that the capacity and power engineering  of the liquid-propellant rocket engines which are being built  for today are completely sufficient for answering the  requirements of humanity within the foreseeable historical  perspective.    TRUD: If it is not a secret, what do you dream of  today ?    Katorgin: Why should there be any secret here? I would like  to believe that all we Russians recognize that in the future we  simply cannot live without space. Without a recognition of this  truth we cannot continue to move ahead with confidence in the  conquest of space.    The enormous experience which we have accumulated in the  creation of powerful liquid-propellant engines and our  possession of unique technologies creates a favorable basis for  fruitful international cooperation. Our science-production  association is open to contacts and cooperation. And we shall  welcome any steps in this direction.    [*Translator's note: Levsha (Lefty) is the main character in  a well-known story by the Russian writer Nikolay Leskov  (1831-1895)--"The Tale of the Cross-Eyed, Left-Handed Craftsman  of Tula and the Steel Flea."    In the story (briefly outlined) Tsar Alexander I after the  end of the Napoleonic War makes a state visit to England.  England was then the most technologically advanced country in  Europe, and the tsar during his visit is taken on tours of  English factories of various kinds. The tsar, in a tradition  begun by Peter the Great, is very much of a "Westernizer"--(that  is he tends to admire everything European and to disparage  everything Russian). Accordingly he is very impressed with  everything he sees, as are all the members of his staff--all  with the exception of a Cossack officer, one Platov, who is in  the habit of saying: "Yes, that's very good, but our Russian  craftsmen can do just as well or better." Before his return to  Russia the tsar is given a gift by a group of English steel  manufacturers,--a life-sized steel flea, which, when wound up  with a very small key, can hop about and move its feelers.    The tsar returns to Russia and forgets about the flea. Some  years later (in 1825) he dies, and is succeeded by his brother  Nicholas I. Nicholas, (who is less of a Westernizer than  Alexander), finds the flea, summons Platov, and asks him if he  can't find a Russian craftsman who can copy it, or at least make  something as good.    Platov takes the flea and departs. After some weeks he  returns with Levsha (Lefty), a cross-eyed, left-handed craftsman  of Tula (a town famous for its metal workers). Platov tells the  tsar that Levsha has improved the flea. On inspecting it the  tsar can see no change from the flea's previous condition,  except that, although it can still move its feelers, it can't  seem to hop about as nimbly as before. On Levsha's suggestion  the tsar examines it under a microscope. He now sees what the  "improvement" has been: Levsha has shod the flea with tiny  golden horse-shoes.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / SEC rules on executive pay SENIOR executives' pay packets will come under tighter control from their shareholders as a result of new rulings announced yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US capital markets regulator, writes George Graham. Mr Richard Breeden, the SEC chairman, said the new rulings would compel companies to publish more and clearer information on the salaries and share incentives paid to executives, and would prevent the barring of shareholder resolutions on this subject. Ten companies, including IBM, Bell Atlantic and Aetna Life and Casualty, have been ordered to include shareholders' resolutions criticising executives' pay or stock option packages on the ballots for their annual general meetings this year. The SEC has until now allowed companies to suppress such resolutions, taking the view that executive compensation was a matter of 'ordinary business'. It has now decided that the subject is a 'significant policy issue'. The decision follows a wave of criticism of the bloated salaries many US executives receive even when their companies are losing money. However, Mr Breeden said resolutions may still only be advisory, since the law in many states requires pay to be decided by the board of directors.</p>

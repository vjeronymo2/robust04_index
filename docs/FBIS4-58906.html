			<p>BFN     [Text] Jeddah, May 8, SPA -- The Organization of the  Islamic Conference (OIC) [ICO] has expressed grave concern over  the serious escalation of the situation in the Republic of  Yemen, especially the recent incidents in many provinces which  have killed and wounded a large number of people.    In a statement issued Saturday [7 May], the OIC expressed  hope that usual stability and cordiality among the people of  Yemen would be restored, differences would be discarded and  efforts would be exerted to confirm their unity and resort to  dialogue and understanding rather than violence and fighting.    The OIC called on the leaders and people of Yemen to show  restraint and remain committed to their firm belief and wisdom  and work together for the progress of Yemen and the protection  of its immortal civilization.    OIC Secretary General Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid called on Yemeni  leaders, ulemas and politicians to work as one for the best  interests of the country.    He asked them to find points of agreement and reduce points  of disagreement and withdraw massed troops separating brothers  to their previous positions.    Dr. al-Ghabid once again confirmed the OIC's readiness to  exert good Islamic offices and mediation efforts out of its  Islamic duty and in conformity with the principles of Islam.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Two ABC Wednesday-night, half-hour sitcoms will switch time periods this week,  network officials announced. "Anything but Love," which stars Jamie Lee Curtis  and Richard Lewis as colleagues at a Chicago magazine, was in a 9 p.m. slot. It  will be broadcast at 9:30 p.m. beginning Wednesday. "Doogie Howser, M.D.,"  which debuted Sept. 19 and stars Neil Patrick Harris as a brilliant teen-age  physician, will move to 9 p.m. "We are pleased with the performance of both  shows so far this season," said Robert A. Iger, president of ABC Entertainment.  "However, we want to take advantage of the inherent younger appeal of 'Doogie  Howser' while maximizing 'Anything but Love's' excellent adult appeal," Iger  said. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

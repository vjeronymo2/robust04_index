			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand  National Assembly, has declared that there is no longer any  alternative to European democracy. Cindoruk returned to Turkey  after participating in the third plenum of the Black Sea  Economic Cooperation Assembly.    In a news conference at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, Cindoruk  said that during the meeting, which was attended by the  parliamentary speakers of 40 countries, Europe established a  consensus on democracy. He said:    [Begin Cindoruk recording] Democracy is being consolidated  in Europe. There are countries in Europe which have embraced  democracy and have no difficulties in implementing it, as well  as countries, which are in the process of adopting democracy.  This process must be accelerated and a convergence of laws and  institutions must be achieved. We are now seeing that human  rights have ceased to be a national legal issue. Human rights  are no longer a country's internal affairs. Especially in  Europe, they have become a common law regulated by the  countries' joint laws and agreements. Therefore, no country can  consider itself independent on the subject of human rights or  regard this matter its internal affair. [end recording]    Cindoruk pointed out that it is very important to secure  agreement among the parties if the constitutional amendments are  to be enacted. He criticized the fact that members of the  Democracy Party, which has been banned, participated in a  demonstration against Turkey in Germany.    [Begin Cindoruk recording] They made a grave mistake. I  denounce the fact that they demonstrated against Turkey. They  say that they will participate in politics in Turkey. Their  action will disappoint the Turkish public, which is sensitive.  Let us resolve our problems in Turkey. I do not resent those  who apply to an international court; but, I say that if they are  to engage in politics, the forum for that is Turkey. Let them  come here and engage in politics. The laws and the executors of  the law are not against them. Everyone is implementing the law  and the rule of law is in effect. If an error is committed, the  courts will rectify it. The State Security Court is a reliable  court. [end recording]</p>

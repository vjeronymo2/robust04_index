			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (23): Lisbon shapes up for change  -Portugal The Lisbon stock exchange will this year mark its 250th anniversary by moving out of the arched 18th century building where it began, into a sleek office block in the new financial centre taking shape on the outskirts of the city. The change signals a coming of age for the exchange after putting into place sweeping operational and administrative changes that officials believe place Lisbon on the same efficiency level as the most advanced exchanges in Europe. Recent reforms include the adoption of a continuous trading system, a computerised national stock registration house and a 700-section administrative law that governs insider trading, company disclosure rules and many other areas. 'The reforms have inspired new confidence in investors who have seen the exchange taking great strides towards becoming more efficient, transparent and well regulated,' says Mr Jose Cardoso de Matos, director of marketing and organisation for the Lisbon bourse. This confidence was a contributing factor to the positive performance of the exchange over the past year. Trading volume rose by 97 per cent to Es2,849bn (Dollars 16.2bn) in 1993 while the value of the market more than doubled to Es2,193bn. It is true that bond trading accounted for 85 per cent of total volume while shares represented only 15 per cent. But share trading volume nevertheless rose 58 per cent on 1992 to Es417.9bn. The 183 companies quoted had a market capitalisation of Es2,193bn in December, 1993 compared with Es1,431bn a year earlier. Share prices also increased substantially, with the Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa (BVL) share index rising 55 per cent in 1993 to a year-end high of 848.54. The index has continued to rise steadily this year, reaching 922.37 on January 24. Sharply falling interest rates that made the return on bonds and bank deposit increasingly less attractive were the main reason behind the solid performance of shares in 1993. One-year bond rates fell to 10.5 per cent compared to 19 per cent two years earlier. Bank deposit rates dropped from 15 per cent to 7 per cent in less than a year. This compared less than favourably with earnings of around 20 per cent offered by share investment funds. For the first time in the recent history of the Lisbon bourse, domestic investors, particularly pension, mutual and other investment funds, led the movement into shares from May, 1993. Foreign investors, who have previously dominated share rallies and still account for an estimated 30 per cent of total trading, followed closely in their footsteps. A second reason for Lisbon's strong performance in 1993 was the official listing of the exchange on the Morgan Stanley index of emerging markets, with a 5 per cent weighting. 'Lisbon had been trying unsuccessfully to establish itself as a developing but traditional European market,' says Ms Elizabeth Rothfield, a director of sales and research with Lisbon-based independent stockbrokers Midas Investimento. 'By becoming an emerging market, the bourse has attracted new investment from the growing number of emerging market funds launched mainly in the US and the UK.' Most analysts see continued growth for share prices in 1994, though it is unlikely to be as strong as last year. They are also agreed that a price correction is almost inevitable. 'If share prices continue to climb over the next few months it is very likely there will be a spell of profit-taking that will set the index back,' says Mr William Cunningham, a Lisbon-based partner with consultants Arthur Andersen. Mr Joao Rendeiro, president of fund managers Gestifundo, forecasts that shares prices will rise between 20 to 30 per cent this year. He says industrial companies have the greatest potential for price gains, which could reach 100 per cent, while banks may show a 10 per cent fall in price. He sees Banco Comercial Portugues and Banco Portugues do Atlantico as the only positive exceptions in the banking sector.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / World Trade News: EC misses out on Asian boom in investment EUROPEAN companies are missing opportunities in the global investment boom in high-growth developing countries, according to a new report by the European Round Table, a club of 40 top industrialists. The report shows that the share of EC companies in foreign direct investment in developing Asia, where the market is growing by 6.5 per cent annually, slipped from about 15 per cent in the mid-1980s to 12 per cent by the end of the decade. In Latin America, which is expanding by 4 per cent a year, the EC share dropped from 24 to 20 per cent over the same period. In Africa, with a market a sixth the size of Asia's and growing at half the pace, the European share has jumped from 17 to 40 per cent. Japan is now the biggest foreign investor in developing countries, with a third of total overseas investment of nearly Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.90bn) last year. By implanting their industry in fast-growing economies, the Japanese are building a strategic competitive position. The European Round Table - which includes the chief executives of such companies as Nestle, Unilever and Daimler-Benz - argues that foreign direct investment brings benefits to both sides. FDI accounts for just 3 per cent of total investment in developing countries but it has, the report claims, bigger effects on output, jobs and productivity. Developing countries are increasingly competing for foreign direct investment by deregulating and liberalising their economies, the report says, though it urges further moves in this direction. The round table adds its voice to calls for a Gatt for investment, a global agreement that would provide for transparency (clear rules and procedures), for rights of establishment by foreign companies and for parity of treatment with domestic companies (national treatment, in Gatt parlance). Industrialists also favour rules binding on international corporations - for example, in policy conflicts between home and host governments.

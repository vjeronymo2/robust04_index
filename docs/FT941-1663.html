			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Technology: The power to invent the future - Xerox pioneered much of today's PC technology. Its latest work could be as influential If Xerox, the US document-processing company, had turned all its bright computer ideas into money, it would be one of the richest and most influential companies in the world. Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, California, the Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre (Parc)did the pioneering work for much of today's personal computer technology. This included the first personal computer, graphical user interfaces (the link between the user and the computer) featuring icons and a mouse, laser printers, local area networking and object-oriented computer languages for faster software development. Now, two decades after its foundation, Xerox Parc is working on projects that could become as influential as its earlier efforts. But this time, it is determined not to let them slip through its fingers and be exploited successfully by others. Under the leadership of Xerox's chief scientist, John Seely Brown, the research centre continues to be a breeding ground of innovative ideas that could change the way people use and interact with computers. Paul Saffo, a research fellow at the Institute for the Future, a technology think-tank in California, says Brown and his colleagues at Xerox Parc are 'producing some of the most innovative ideas around'. Xerox likes to be known as 'the document company'. It might seem strange for a business focused on paper and photocopiers to pioneer computer technologies that have promised the 'paperless office'. But personal computer technologies have increased the use of paper: graphical user interfaces make PCs easier to use and cheap laser printers have helped to generate more paper documents than before. 'Our mission at Parc is to find novel ways of handling the document,' Brown explains. 'We recognise that the document is essentially a social artefact.' This has led to technology such as PaperWorks, which can embed computer instructions invisibly within paper documents, thus bridging the gap between paper and electronic documents. It has also led to the development of advanced computer display screens that have many of the same qualities as paper documents. Xerox Parc's active matrix liquid crystal display screens have very high resolutions, better than laser-printed paper documents. With its partner, AT&amp;T, Xerox Parc is developing commercial versions of the LCD screen in a way that could revitalise the LCD industry in the US and win back market share from Japan. But it is the acknowledgement that there is a social dimension in the way computers are used that is producing some of the most interesting developments at Xerox Parc. 'One of the themes here is how to use the tremendous advances in computer technologies in a way that will bring simplicity to life and not just keep adding features and complexity that cause people to feel overwhelmed,' Brown says. To make computers more effective, the user interface must be improved. The best computer interface, as far as Brown and his researchers are concerned, is one of which they are hardly aware. Last year, Xerox introduced the LiveBoard, an electronic whiteboard or chalkboard. Linked by telephone lines or a network, people in remote locations can draw and write on the 67in-wide LiveBoard screen during collaborative work sessions. 'The Liveboard is what I like to call 'shoulder-to-shoulder computing'. I've seen people use it and forget that they are using a computer system,' Brown says. 'It is part of our goal to build computer systems that support a distributed workplace, with the same kind of social dynamics that we are used to.' The LiveBoard is part of a concept known as ubiquitous computing. It envisages a workplace in which people are surrounded by hundreds of computers. Some are tiny, like the ParcTab, about the size of a Post-It note, while others are no larger and only slightly thicker than a sheet of paper. Workers in this office of the future would wander around with a small computer ID badge. Through infra-red connections, the badge would announce them to all the nearby computer devices in their vicinity. It would not only trigger automatic doors, but also identify users to the computers. During a meeting, for example, an office worker would be able to use whatever computer device was nearby to do work, receive messages from colleagues and send out requests for information. This would essentially take the 'personal' out of personal computer. Brown explains that providing information to workers at the right time and 'capturing' their knowledge will be of key importance for companies. This is where adaptive learning comes into play. Brown is the founder of the California-based Institute for Research on Learning, which addresses the problems of lifelong learning and how that applies to corporations as well as individuals. 'There are 100,000 people at Xerox. Each one of us is learning and inventing every day. If you want to master the enterprise, you have to develop technologies that capture that knowledge in ways that can be used to benefit the organisation,' Brown says. With fast-changing markets and increasing demands for employees to master new skills, the ubiquitous computers become essential tools that create what Brown calls a 'knowledgescape'. Computers become gateways for tapping an organisation's knowledge base and also adding to it. Like other computer companies, Xerox Parc is also interested in ever smaller computers. But its focus extends beyond palm-top computers to the molecular level, a science known as nanotechnology. This borrows some of the techniques used by makers of silicon chips except that instead of making electrical circuits, microscopic mechanical machines can be constructed. The key to developing effective nanotechnologies is being able to manipulate individual atoms and molecules. Xerox Parc researchers claim that with such precise control, it would be possible to build a computer no larger than a sugar cube that would be more powerful than all the world's computers combined. That, however, is still some way off, even for Xerox Parc.</p>

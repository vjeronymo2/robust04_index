			<p>BFN     [Text] Comrat, BASAPRESS, 6/6/1994 -- The Gagauz Supreme  Soviet Presidium decided to summon on 9 June an ordinary session  of the Gagauz Parliament. Vasili Neikovchin [name as received],  spokesman of the Gagauz Parliamentary Presidium, stated to BASA  that the deputies will examine the final variant of the  "Gagauz-Eri-Gagauzia" project of special juridical status for  Gagauzians. After the project is finalized it will be presented  to the Moldovan Parliament. Peru Buzaji, chairman of the Gagauz  Parliamentary Commission for settling the problem of juridical  status, stated to BASA: "During the last four months of  negotiations with the similar Moldovan Parliamentary Commission  led by Ion Ungureanu and meetings between Moldovan and Gagauz  officials, practically, a convenient compromise has been  reached. This time it seems that the Moldovan Parliament has no  reason not to adopt this project as a fundamental law for Gagauz  people's autonomy." He pointed out that it is very important  "that the future Moldovan Constitution will have an article  recognizing the Gagauz people's existence." Buzaji also  specified that there were disagreements between the Chisinau and  Comrat leaders on the first two articles, Articles 12, 25, etc.  Article 22, for example, states that Moldova will be responsible  of security and defense in the region. Buzaji said that the  Gagauz side insisted that the soldiers of the districts densely  inhabited by Gagauzians be not involved in combat operations  without the Gagauz Parliament's consent and the written consent  of each soldier. "We made many compromises but we are not going  to give in any more, because Gagauz people will not admit and  not forgive this," said Buzaji. "We hope that the current  Moldovan leadership is aware of the realities and that it will  be the parliament's decision to offer Gagauzians the historical  chance to self-determination, national rebirth and their  development as a nation."</p>

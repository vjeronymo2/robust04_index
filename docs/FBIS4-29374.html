			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The first phase of  sanctions proposed by the United States against North Korea over  its nuclear recalcitrance is unlikely to have much effect on  Japan, well-placed sources predicted Thursday [16 June].    Japan has indicated that it supports in principle  Washington's draft resolution to be submitted to the UN Security  Council in response to North Korea's refusal to permit  inspections of its nuclear facilities.    The sources pointed out, however, that the first phase of  sanctions, including bans on arms trade and development  assistance, would have only a minimal effect on Japan. The  first phase of proposed sanctions, still subject to change,  includes a ban on nonpassenger flights into North Korea, an  embargo on technical and scientific cooperation, and  participation in sports events, cultural, scientific,  educational and diplomatic exchanges. Local governments  bordering on the Sea of Japan which currently have exchanges  with North Korea may be asked to exercise restraint in their  relations if sanctions are adopted, the sources said.    With the absence of diplomatic relations between Tokyo and  Pyongyang, bilateral cultural exchanges have been limited to 100  or so North Koreans coming to Japan annually. A Justice  Ministry survey reveals that some 16,000 North Koreans entered  Japan in 1992, but 90 percent of these North Korean nationals  were residents of Japan returning from a trip overseas. Only  756 of the North Koreans coming to Japan entered the country as  business-related people or tourists with 51 entering the country  on cultural or sports exchanges.    The second phase of sanctions would more closely affect  Japan  since it would be asked to close down the flow of billions of  yen in hard currency in support that Korean residents of Japan  send to their relatives in North Korea. North Korea has warned  that any sanctions imposed by the United Nations would be  considered a declaration of war and has said Japan would not be  able to evade its "deserved punishment."</p>

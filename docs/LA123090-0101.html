			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DURING 1990, MANY ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENTS WROTE ABOUT THEIR THOUGHTS AND  FEELINGS IN ARTICLES FOR ORANGE COUNTY OPINION PAGES. AS WE LOOK BACK ON THE  YEAR, SOME OF THOSE THOUGHTS ARE RECALLED.;  </P> <P> HENRY N. PONTELL ON A NEW COUNTY JAIL  </P> <P> While the Orange County Board of Supervisors has focused its attention (and  ours) on building new facilities as the panacea to jail overcrowding, efforts  to resolve the problem could be moved in a different direction that would  result in more realistic expectations regarding the use of punishment resources  and the enhancement of public safety.  </P> <P> Before embarking on a dramatic jail construction program, a detailed and  balanced examination must be made not only of the incredible economic  consequences, but also of other sentencing methods (for example, expanding and  initiating such mechanisms as work furlough, community service, electronic  monitoring and intensive supervision) and better coordination in the criminal  justice system.  </P> <P> Serious attention to prevention and education will go a lot further in reducing  crime than will incarcerating criminals.  </P> <P> A crisis mentality regarding jail overcrowding will do more harm than good,  both fiscally and socially, and should be abandoned. Only then will  policy-makers be able to seriously consider crime and its punishment -- and  develop effective long-term policies.  </P></p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Edmonds says unions facing cash collapse: GMB leader forecasts 'gaps in movement' A number of Britain's trade unions will suffer financial collapse in the next two years, a senior union leader predicted yesterday. Addressing the GMB general union conference in Blackpool, Mr John Edmonds, general secretary, forecast 'a number of gaps in our trade union movement, gaps that we and the other survivors must fill'. Although Mr Edmonds did not mention any union, it is believed he was thinking among others of Ucatt, the construction union which has severe financial problems and is in merger talks with the TGWU general union. The GMB intends to launch a recruitment drive across the labour market and plans to establish a stronger presence in areas where it has previously been weak. Mr Edmonds' self-confidence has been strengthened by the results of his union's check-off campaign. The GMB has increased membership as a result of persuading workers to have their subscriptions to the union deducted by their employers. 'The check-off campaign has tested the sinews of every union; It has been the survival of the fittest,' said Mr Edmonds. 'Not every union is doing as well as the GMB.' The GMB's exploratory merger talks with the TGWU have not made any progress over the past 12 months, but Mr Edmonds made clear yesterday that his union would develop on its own 'a new concept of trade unionism among a fragmented and vulnerable workforce'. He said the European Union's social legislation and the return of a Labour government at the next general election would win 'better trade union rights in Britain' and this would help the unions to recruit among workers in secure jobs in the manufacturing sector. But this would 'not be enough any more' to win support for trade unionism in small workplaces 'where collective bargaining is some distant dream,' he added. Recruiting in the non-unionised sector of the labour market was 'the dilemma we must resolve before this decade is over,' Mr Edmonds said. 'We must go back to our roots' and 're-invent community unionism with the local trading office as the centre of a network providing solidarity and mutual support,' he told delegates. Mr Edmonds added that 'new solidarity based on the local community' would have 'to replace the natural solidarity of the large site.'</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Foster's sees no strategy change as executive resigns FOSTER'S Brewing, Australia's largest brewer, yesterday said its recovery strategy would be unaffected by the resignation of Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, following a boardroom row. Mr Nobby Clark, chairman, said Mr Bartels would be replaced by Mr Ted Kunkel, chairman of Molson Breweries, the Canadian brewer jointly owned by Foster's and the Molson Companies. Mr Kunkel, a New Zealander, is a former Foster's executive who headed the group's Carlton and United Breweries subsidiary in Melbourne before being posted to Toronto in 1987 to head Foster's Carling O'Keefe subsidiary. Mr Clark said Mr Kunkel was the unanimous choice of the board and suggested his previous experience with Foster's, during which he reported to Mr Bartels, would provide management continuity. He said the appointment would not alter the company's outlook, its commitment to maximising value for all shareholders, or its strategy of selling non-core assets to become a single purpose brewer. Analysts said Mr Kunkel was regarded as an outstandingly successful head of Molson Breweries, which was created in 1989 from a merger of Carling O'Keefe and Molson's brewing division. The merger resulted in greater efficiency for both companies following the closure of a number of breweries, rationalisation of competing brands and increased exports to the US. Mr Clark said Mr Bartels' decision to resign 'was the result of an amicable arrangement initiated by him in the best interests of the company and its employees'. Mr Bartels is understood to have been prompted to resign by the board's decision to pay an interim dividend for the six months to December, when the group made a net profit of ADollars 77m (USDollars 59.2m). The decision reversed the strategy adopted by Mr Bartels and Mr Clark, who persuaded the board to suspend dividend payments after Foster's reported a net loss of ADollars 43m for 1990-91. Mr Bartels argued for a further delay in resuming dividend payments, as part of his attempts to strengthen the group's balance sheet. He is understood to have had the support of Mr Clark and the group's independent directors. However, the dividend was forced through after two directors representing Asahi Breweries of Japan, which owns 20 per cent of Foster's, voted with directors representing International Brewing Holdings (IBH), which owns 38 per cent of Foster's. IBH is controlled by Mr John Elliott, a former chairman and chief executive of Foster's who built the group into an international food, finance and pastoral group under the name Elders IXL. Mr Elliott resigned as chairman and chief executive in the wake of a record loss of ADollars 1.3bn in 1989-90, but remains non-executive deputy chairman. He has led boardroom opposition to Mr Bartels' strategy of strengthening Foster's balance sheet by not paying dividends and seeking the highest prices for asset sales. The strategy was damaging to IBH, which relies on Foster's dividends for its sole source of income to meet interest payments on debt of about ADollars 2.5bn. Mr Elliott has also pressed for a capital return to shareholders from the proceeds of asset sales. Mr Bartels survived an attempted coup in November after Asahi refused to vote for an IBH motion at Foster's annual meeting which would have prevented the re-election of independent directors supporting Mr Bartels. However, Asahi's decision to support IBH demands for an interim dividend appears to have altered the balance of power in the boardroom in Mr Elliott's favour.</p>

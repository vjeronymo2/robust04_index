			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Italy's bribes scandal has multinational air THE arrest of Mr Giorgio Scanavaca, managing director of the Italian subsidiary of Siemens, the German industrial group, casts a further shadow over the activities of foreign multinationals in Italy's widening political corruption scandal. It is almost a year since ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering and electronics group, first appeared in the investigations, then still largely limited to Milan. The group was alleged to have paid about L16bn (Dollars 10.8m) in kickbacks to obtain orders for the city's underground railway line. The foreign trail went relatively cold thereafter, bar a further bout for ABB, whose chief executive in Italy, Mr Umberto Di Capua, was arrested and briefly jailed on allegations believed to be linked to the metro orders. Mr Di Capua, who only joined the company after the completion of the new line, was released soon after. However, in the past week, the foreigners have been making a comeback. Last week saw the arrests of senior executives from the Italian subsidiaries of both Sweden's Ericsson and GEC of the UK on allegations linked to contracts from ASST, the former state telephones agency. The list has now been lengthened with the detention of Mr Scanavaca as Milan magistrates pursue their latest line of investigations into alleged bribes on orders for telecommunications equipment. However, the German group is not a complete stranger to the corruption scandal. In May 1992, investigations into alleged corruption in a hospital south of Milan, triggered allegations that the company had handed over about L50m in kickbacks to win a contract. The impact on the standing of foreign companies in Italy is still being digested and public reaction has been limited so far. Officials at Ericsson were unavailable for comment yesterday, while a Siemens official had 'no comment' to make on the arrest of Mr Scanavaca beyond pointing out that he had come forward to testify before magistrates voluntarily on Tuesday evening. The official also pointed out that Siemens Telecommunicazioni, the subsidiary chaired by Mr Scanavaca, was formerly owned by GTE, the US telecoms group, prior to its takeover by Siemens in 1987-88. The subsidiary specialises in public networks and transmission systems. So far, only ABB appears to have taken its alleged involvement on board. Well before the inauguration of Fiat's new 'ethical code of business practice' last week, the company had already moved to tighten up its procedures. The group already had a chapter on ethics in its booklet on business values drawn up in 1988. Following its brush with the Italian magistrates, procedures at its subsidiary were reinforced, with executives obliged to sign a letter committing themselves to respecting the national law in any dealing with public-sector employees.</p>

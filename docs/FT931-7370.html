			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Duke of Westminster quits Tories over lease reform THE Duke of Westminster, widely believed to be Britain's richest man with wealth estimated at up to Pounds 3.5bn, has left the Conservative party. He resigned in protest at the government's plans to change leasehold law in a way that cuts across existing private property rights. The duke, whose family has been associated with the Conservative party since its beginnings, has resigned after 20 years as president of his local Chester Tory party, having become convinced that the government's plans would take effect. 'I cannot morally stay within a party which I fundamentally believe has ideologically gone off the rails,' he said yesterday. The government is promoting a bill which would allow holders of long leases to buy the freehold of the property. Ministers estimate that some 750,000 long leaseholders will benefit from the reforms and say that landlords will not be treated unfairly since the tenants must pay the market price for the freehold of the property. But the bill has sparked deep opposition from some senior Tories, who say that it interferes in property rights in a way that its critics see as more typical of a Labour than a Tory administration. The duke's vehement hostility to the proposals has been apparent for many months, and he was among those trying to prevent them being incorporated in the party manifesto last spring. In a speech last month to the British Property Federation, he said: 'The implications of this legislation are fundamental in a country which has no written constitution and relies on parliamentary precedent . . . Because this law interferes with basic liberties, it should send shivers down all our spines.' His decision to resign was taken after great soul-searching and 'in sadness rather than anger', one of his staff said yesterday. She added that he did not intend it to influence the course of the bill and that if the government were to drop it, she did not think he would rejoin. 'We felt pleading with him to change his mind wouldn't be appropriate,' Mr Stephen Maund, Tory local agent, said yesterday, expressing his regret at the decision. News of his resignation earlier this month came the day after the House of Lords first discussed the bill. The duke was present for Tuesday's debate, but had to sit on the steps of the throne rather than with other peers because he has not taken the oath of allegiance yet this session. If he takes the oath in time to take part in the future, detailed debates on the bill, he will sit on the cross-benches with the independent peers, rather than with his former Tory colleagues.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Because of the size and diversity of the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer conducted substantially more pricing surveys there than in other areas. For the Goods &amp; Services component, Runzheimer generally surveyed to obtain six times as many price quotes in the Washington, D.C., area as in the typical allowance area. For the Housing, Transportation and Miscellaneous Expense components, data collection was generally triple that of the typical allowance area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> 3.

Specific examples of products and services from these four subdivided categories can be found below. These examples only represent a minor portion of the total number of items (products and services) Runzheimer priced within each subdivided category. (See Appendix 2 for a complete description of all marketbasket items.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

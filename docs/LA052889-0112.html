			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EL TORO ABOUT-FACE;  </P> <P> MARINES START TO GET IN STEP WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS  </P> <P> The evidence was troubling: A vast pool of underground water, stretching more  than three miles from the edge of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to the  heart of residential Irvine, had been contaminated with a cancer-causing  chemical.  </P> <P> As the local water district official delivered his report at a recent public  meeting, he built a case against the military as the source of the  contamination. Seated in the front row, Navy Capt. S. R. Holm Jr., attired in  freshly pressed dress blues, listened intently until it was his turn to speak.  When he stood, he had no counterattack, only a conciliatory offering.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Full Responsibility'  </P> <P> "If it is shown that we were at fault, we will take full responsibility," Holm  said.  </P> <P> Holm's remarks, some say, reflect the U.S. Marine Corps' gradual change of  attitude toward environmental issues. The Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air  Station and El Toro Marine Corps Air Station have long been among Orange  County's largest producers of hazardous wastes, according to county records.  For nearly four decades, solvents, jet fuel, paint products and hydraulic  fluids were dumped routinely -- an illegal practice by today's standards -- at  El Toro, a 4,900-acre jet fighter and bomber training base, and at the nearby  Tustin base, a 1,000-acre helicopter training facility.  </P> <P> It was even common practice at many installations, including El Toro, to spray  dirt lots and vacant fields with petroleum wastes and chemicals to control dust  on windy days.  </P> <P> But the Marines are changing their ways. Facing public pressure, tougher laws  and a health risk to their own troops, they have given environmental issues a  higher priority, said Holm, director of facilities management at the El Toro  base. The corps is willing to right the environmental wrongs of the past and  cooperate with local, state and federal regulatory agencies, which have  complained for years about the military's failure to clean up its hazardous  waste, he said.  </P> <P> At the El Toro air station, the Marines in recent years have identified 14  sites, including several landfills and firefighter training pits, where  hazardous wastes such as jet fuel and paint thinners may have been dumped in  the past. Similarly, 11 such sites have been identified at the Tustin base.  None of these sites has yet been excavated or tested, so it is not known  whether they contain any high levels of toxic wastes or radioactive material.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $500,000 Effort  </P> <P> To make that determination, the corps says that within the next year, it will  use more than $500,000 from the military's $400-million Defense Environmental  Restoration Account -- the U.S. Defense Department's special environmental  cleanup fund -- to investigate the suspected hazardous waste sites at each  base.  </P> <P> "We haven't always been the best neighbor when it comes to taking care of the  environment," Holm said. "But we like to think we've gotten a bit more  enlightened in recent years."  </P> <P> Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, one of the military's harshest local  </P> <P> critics, agrees that the Marines have begun to show a "greater inclination to  listen" to concerns and complaints from surrounding cities and outside  agencies. But he predicted that the Marines' "new attitude" will be tested as  water and health experts begin acting to clean up what is potentially the  largest ground-water contamination case in Orange County history.  </P> <P> Varying levels of trichloroethylene, or TCE, have been detected in the ground  water beneath the El Toro air base and portions of Irvine. The presence of  cancer-causing TCE, a strong degreasing agent used by the military until the  late 1970s to clean jet fighter and helicopter engines, poses no immediate  threat to public wells.  </P> <P> But Orange County Water District officials warn that if the polluted ground  water, which has contaminated several miles of the aquifer, is not removed, it  eventually could seep into Irvine's domestic drinking supplies. The aquifer is  a pocket of porous rock near the earth's surface where water collects.  </P> <P> "There has been an attempt by the Marines to be more forthcoming about  environmental issues," Agran said. "But we are dealing with something here that  is much bigger than disclosure or public relations. We have a serious problem,  and I think this is a big test of the Marines' willingness to cooperate."  </P> <P> To that end, the Marines say they are better armed now to meet the challenge.  </P> <P> For years, one person monitored the handling and disposal of tons of hazardous  materials and wastes at both air stations. Since 1984, the Marines have added  five experts to their environmental staff, headed by Navy Ensign Michael Rehor,  a chemical engineer. In addition, a hazardous waste recycling program has been  launched on the bases to sell unused or contaminated jet fuel, solvents, paints  and petroleum-based products to civilian contractors.  </P> <P> As part of a $7.5-million military contract awarded recently to a Santa Ana  firm, a long-awaited inspection of 460 underground fuel storage tanks at the El  Toro base is scheduled to begin this summer, a process that may take up to four  years to complete. Only 80 of the tanks are in use; the rest have been  abandoned and, for the most part, are empty. State and local health officials  have long pushed for a tank inspection program at El Toro out of concern that  the tanks, many of which are as old as the 56-year-old base, may be leaking  toxic residues.  </P> <P> Under California law, all underground chemical and fuel tanks should have been  inspected by their owners by 1986. So far only one tank at El Toro has been  examined. That 110,000-gallon storage tank was found to be in good condition,  but a feeder line carrying high-performance jet fuel had a tiny leak, which has  been patched, county officials said.  </P> <P> "A year ago, we were not very happy with the Marines," said Robert Merryman,  Orange County's director of environmental health. "But today, as far as  compliance with the underground tank-testing program goes, we're very pleased."  </P> <P> The Marines have taken several preventive steps as well. Classes on the  handling and proper disposal of hazardous materials and wastes are conducted  regularly for those who live and work at the two bases. Storage drums  containing paint thinners, hydraulic fluids, oily rags and lubricants must be  clearly marked, numbered and stored at one of 60 hazardous waste accumulation  sites at the two bases. Each barrel is listed on a master log and its movement  on base is tracked.  </P> <P> "A large part of our job is education," Holm said. "We've got 10,000 Marines  here, many of them young kids from the hills of West Virginia or Oklahoma. At  home, they think nothing of going out back and dumping a couple of cans of  motor oil into the stream. For them, it's an acceptable practice."  </P> <P> But that doesn't work in Orange County, he said. "Fortunately, today's Marine  is much more sensitive to the environment than 10 years ago. . . . But that's  not to say we don't have a long way to go."  </P> <P> The ground-water issue remains the most serious problem.  </P> <P> Though the Marines have refused to acknowledge full responsibility, county,  state and federal officials say the El Toro base is the primary source of the  TCE found in the contaminated ground water. The U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency last year recommended placing the entire El Toro base on the national  Superfund list for toxic waste sites. If it receives Superfund status, EPA  officials will then oversee inspection, cleanup and monitoring of any hazardous  waste sites on base, including the TCE-contaminated ground water.  </P> <P> The TCE controversy illustrates one of the most persistent complaints about the  corps: its slow response to resolving environmental problems.  </P> <P> "We are not pointing the finger at them for what they did 20 or 30 years ago,"  said Curt Berchthold, senior engineer with the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality  Board, which oversees most of the watershed in Orange, Riverside and San  Bernardino counties.  </P> <P> "We know people dumped TCE and other chemicals on the ground. The problem we  have is the rate at which they are moving to correct those problems. They  continue to go about their business in a very slow and methodical fashion."  </P> <P> Part of the problem, Holm said, is the bureaucratic nature of the military.  </P> <P> "Frankly, I wish we could move faster. When people say we're slow, I think it's  a fair criticism," Holm said. "Trouble is, this is a big place, and people  forget that we're like a small city. It takes time to react."  </P></p>

Green thanked the FHP medical  group, which on Tuesday gave a $75,000 check to the Huntington Beach Art Center  Foundation, the fund-raising arm of the center.  </P> <P> The center is scheduled to open in spring, 1991, and will include three  galleries covering 4,000 square feet of exhibition space, a performance room, a  studio and a bookstore. The renovation of the building is expected to cost  about $750,000, bringing the total cost of setting up the center to about $1.5  million. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

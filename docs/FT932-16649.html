			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / London Tec first to report loss THE FIRST operating loss has been made by a Training and Enterprise Council after the government said it was clawing-back more than Pounds 300,000 from the Tec because of inadequate substantiation of its claims for equipping young people with jobs and qualifications. London East Training and Enterprise Council (Letec) made an operating loss of Pounds 483,267 in the 17 months to March 29 1992 on a turnover of Pounds 27.522m. The operating loss included a general provision of Pounds 200,000 to cover the clawback. The department of employment originally wanted to claw back Pounds 1.9m but agreed to negotiate a lower sum after the Tec, whose chief executive resigned earlier this year, provided documents to substantiate most of the claims. Letec, which is expected to make an operating profit this year, is understood to be the only Tec to make a loss last year although several others are believed to have had funds clawed back after making similar inadequately substantiated claims. The National Audit Office last year questioned the accounts of the Department of Employment for 1991-92, the third consecutive year, and found that Pounds 21m of payments to Tecs and the Employment Service had been incorrectly made. Tecs are responsible for payments to provider of training for the two main national training programmes, Youth Training (YT) and Employment Training (ET). Among lapses of financial control identified by the government's spending watchdog was allowing claims that were not adequately substantiated. Tecs have complained about the complexity of audit trails imposed upon them. Mr David Dickinson, chairman of Letec, said that his Tec, which had been obliged to use the government's own computer system in collecting data, had provided the department with information on the total number of 'outputs' that training providers had told the Tec they had produced. However, the department demanded individuals' certificates for qualifications and proof of jobs found. Letec said its attempts to do this had been exacerbated by the fact that one large provider went into liquidation and the receiver declined to give names of trainees. Mr Dickinson said that Letec had incurred substantial costs securing college-based Youth Training places at a time when few employers were offering training. The Tec also made a provision of Pounds 200,000 for this financial year to further cover financial claims it made on the government but for which it might not be able to provide adequate documentation to back up its claim.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Theeeeere's Johnny: The talk show king is abdicating Kenneth Tynan should have been alive this week in America. Still, his ghost might have the satisfaction of knowing that he was probably the most quoted man in the country, all the words taken from an article he wrote in the New Yorker magazine more than 14 years ago. To everybody outside the US, this proposition will appear preposterous. What or who could Tynan have written about in February 1978 that conceivably could have been considered more notable in this particular week of May 1992 than, say, Ross Perot, George Bush and Bill Clinton (who want to be president), Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal (the glorious present and future of basketball), Roger Keith Coleman (sadly strapped in the electric chair in Virginia) or Murphy Brown (who does not even exist in real life)? The answer is Johnny Carson, who retired last night after 29 1/2 years as host of NBC Television's Tonight show, the grandfather of talk-show programming. And for those who still scratch their heads and say 'who' or 'why', assuming, as they reasonably might, that there is no American television programme that has not been exported somewhere in the world since the invention of the medium, the second answer is that Johnny Carson is one of those peculiar national institutions, beloved of every culture, that is simply not very exportable: a bit like cricket, which, let's face it, is only played in the old British empire - and, for obscure reasons, Holland. Explaining Carson's appeal is quite difficult, which is why Tynan's article has been so massively mined by a new generation of critics and social commentators this week. The best of his quotes, as valid today as then, comes from Billy Wilder, the film maker. 'By the simple law of survival, Carson is the best. He enchants the invalids and the insomniacs as well as those who have to get up at dawn. He is the Valium and the Nembutal of the nation. No matter what kind of dead-asses are on the show, he has to make them funny and exciting. He has to be their nurse and their surgeon. He has no conceit. 'He's the cream of middle-class elegance, yet he's not a mannequin. He has captivated the American bourgeoisie without ever offending the highbrows and he has never said anything that wasn't liberal or progressive.' Obviously longevity on the job has added to Carson's unique place in the national affection. He has survived seven presidents, two wars, the collapse of the Soviet Union, assassinations and urban unrest. Each night at 11.30pm (an hour earlier in the midwest, which is an early closing part of the country) Americans, who have almost as many televisions in their houses as others have lightbulbs, became accustomed to tuning in, or out. Carson catered for both. Already a successful quiz show host, he took over Tonight from the mercurial Jack Paar on October 1 1962, only after several considerable luminaries of wit, including Groucho Marx and Bob Newhart, had turned it down. Since then, he has outlasted all the competition the other networks have thrown at him. He has cut down a lot on the original Monday-to-Friday schedule in recent years but the programme's trademark introduction ' Ed McMahon, the second banana, shouting out 'Heeeeeere's Johnny' - is in the national lexicon. The programme's formula also never varied. On comes Carson, always in a jacket and tie, never in a suit, never an open-necked shirt, for the opening monologue, six or seven minutes of skilled patter, with good, contemporary one-liners provided for him by a team of script writers and always ending with an imaginary golf swing. He would occasionally dress up as comic characters of his own invention, a bit like the late Benny Hill, but cleaner. The jokes might not linger but the impeccably timed deadpan comic delivery often made them seem better than they were. Thus, in this final week, there were good lines about Vice-President Dan Quayle and his assault on the Murphy Brown TV character who has been the object of his discontent ('I thought the vice-president never watched Murphy Brown because it was up against 'F Troop' on cable'). Some have seen Carson over the years as an arbiter of political taste and certainly his contempt for Richard Nixon over Watergate was palpable. The safer conclusion was that if he turned his not-always-gentle barbs against a politician, then his target was probably already in trouble. But the principal metier was always showbiz, increasingly so after the show moved from New York to Los Angeles in 1972. His first - and last - guest was Tony Bennet, the singer. This year he finally induced an appearance from Elizabeth Taylor, fetchingly dressed in black biker gear with decolletage. There was a session with Frank Sinatra in 1976, made memorable when another guest, the comedian Don Rickles, insisted on talking to the crooner as a subaltern in the Mafia. The high (or low) light was the televised marriage on a programme in 1969 of the falsetto singer Tiny Tim to Miss Vicky, which attracted a record audience. If Carson always remained subtly up-to-date in his material, he did age on the job. Now 66, the thick black thatch of the 1960s has become a suitably distinguished silver. But beyond the physically visible and the inevitable scandal sheet coverage of earlier failed marriages, he remained a curiously elusive figure. Kenneth Tynan, again, summed this up best after weeks spent observing the man at work. Talking to Carson, he wrote, was 'like addressing an elaborately wired security system'. But perhaps, he went on, what people saw on their screens was the real thing: 'Where other performers go home to relax after the show, Carson goes to the show to relax - the studio is his den, his living space.' This den is to be inhabited shortly by his successor, Jay Leno, But, if you believe half the tributes paid to Johnny Carson this week, the national dens and bedrooms will be never be the same again.</p>

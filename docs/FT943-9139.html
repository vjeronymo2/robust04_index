			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Rim mixed as Kuala Lumpur gains 1.7% Technical buying and purchases by public fund managers supported share prices, and the Nikkei 225 average posted a moderate gain, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was up 51.11 at 20,821.36 after a day's low of 20,690.24 and high of 20,845.27. Prices firmed in the afternoon on a rise in the futures market, while overseas investors continued to buy chemical and steel shares. Volume decreased from 271m shares to 249.5m. Traders expected public fund managers to support activity over the next few weeks ahead of this month's public offering of Japan Tobacco and Japan Telecom. The success of the listing of the state-owned tobacco group, in October, is considered crucial in determining the fate of the former Japan National Railway group's plans to go public. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 1.02 at 1,662.52 and the Nikkei 300 edged ahead 0.30 to 302.45. Rises outscored falls by 532 to 414, with 203 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.08 to 1,349.34. Steel companies once again led trading on buying by overseas investors and profit-taking by domestic institutions. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y2 to Y372. Nippon Soda, a chemical company, advanced Y18 to Y457 on reports by the Nikko Research Institute, the research arm of Nikko Securities, which said it would outperform the market due to a rise in pre-tax profits from its restructuring programme. Takasago International, which makes fragrances for cigarettes, moved ahead Y14 to Y852 on buying linked to the Japan Tobacco's listing. In spite of selling prompted by Nomura Securities' downgrades of investment ratings, Sony was finally up Y20 at Y6,000 and Matsushita Electric Industrial recouped some of its loss to end Y10 off at Y1,770. In Osaka, the OSE average added 44.84 at 23,098.36 in volume of 83.6m shares. Small-lot buying supported real estate and machinery stocks, regarded as laggards. Roundup Sentiment was mixed in the region, the two biggest markets, in Hong Kong and Australia, offering the least enthusiasm on the day. KUALA LUMPUR improved 1.7 per cent on increased retail and institutional buying. The composite index gained 18.68 at 1,111.48 as volume swelled from 425m to 528m shares, the largest since late February. Brokers said sentiment was further boosted by news that Bank Negara would lift the ban on the sale of short-term paper to foreigners from today. Multi-Purpose Holdings rose 42 cents to MDollars 4.84 in volume of 11m shares on a 48 per cent increase in interim net profits. SINGAPORE was motivated by a good session in Malaysian shares traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index climbed 23.53 to 2,300.03. BANGKOK was lifted by institutional buying of blue chips ahead of today's holiday closure. The SET index rose 18.17 to 1,425.49 in turnover of Bt10.64bn. Shares in Siam Makro, the cash-and-carry store operator, rose sharply on the first day of trading to close at Bt72, compared with an initial public offering price of Bt50, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. Siam Makro, a joint venture between the privately controlled SHV group, of the Netherlands, and the Charoen Pokphand group, of Thailand, is the first Makro company to go public in the 16 countries where the stores have been established. The Thai company, valued by the market yesterday at Bt15.8bn (Dollars 634m), raised nearly Bt2bn by selling 18 per cent of its stock in the initial offering in order to finance rapid expansion. MANILA saw strength in PLDT following a rise of Dollars 2 1/4 in the ADRs on Wall Street overnight, leaving it up 1 per cent on the domestic market at 1,760 pesos. The composite index firmed 32.80 to 2,976.99. Some analysts forecast that the market would fall back today following a sharp rise over the last two sessions. SEOUL gained ground on hopes that first-half results from manufacturing companies would be better than expected. The composite index was ahead 8.98 at 939.19, just off a day's high of 940.87. Gainers led losers by 484 to 279. Korea Mobile and Samsung Electronics went the day's limit up to Won391,000 and Won93,900 respectively, Samsung reporting that its first-half net profits more than quadrupled. TAIPEI lost more than 2 per cent on reports that the central bank might tighten monetary policy in the near future. Sentiment was also unnerved by news that the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an inquiry into 10 investment trusts for alleged manipulation of plastics and electronics stocks. The weighted index gave up 145.99 to 6,692.02, but was off an intraday low of 6,618.14. Turnover came to TDollars 102.7bn. The electronics sector bore the brunt of the day's losses, with United Microelectronics dropping TDollars 6.50, or 4.3 per cent, to TDollars 146.50. HONG KONG lost impetus as bank shares, particularly HSBC Holdings with its interim results due next Monday, were depressed by the problems reported in the colony by the London-based Standard Chartered. The Hang Seng index eased 93.54 to 9,524.54, and turnover fell from HKDollars 4.28bn to HKDollars 3.565bn. HSBC finished HKDollars 1.75 down at HKDollars 93.50, its low for the day. Financials led the sub-indices down with a fall of 1.6 per cent. Among trading houses, Swire Pacific reported a 14 per cent rise in first-half net profits, but brokers said the results were in line with expectations and the stock closed HKDollars 2 lower at HKDollars 59.75. Meanwhile, the H share index of China-incorporated stocks rose 6.5 to 1,357.49. SHANGHAI offered a similarly ambivalent attitude to investment prospects, its domestic, A share index falling 7.15 per cent as the B shares, designed for foreign consumption but now effectively open to mainland Chinese investors, put on 2 per cent, the index advancing 1.59 to 80.45. Some brokers said foreign investors were responsible for yesterday's B share gains. Others, just as positively, said mainland Chinese investors were making the running. AUSTRALIA fell as stronger employment figures shook the domestic bond market, the All Ordinaries index losing 13.7 at 2,062.8. Turnover expanded from ADollars 337.8m to ADollars 403.4m. Broken Hill Proprietary, the steel, mining and oil conglomerate, strengthened in early trading to ADollars 19.70 but closed after the jobs data at ADollars 19.54, down 4 cents. WELLINGTON dropped a percentage point as investors stood back ahead of Saturday's by-election in the South Island seat of Selwyn, which may make or break the government. The NZSE-40 index fell 20.91 to 2,067.19.</p>

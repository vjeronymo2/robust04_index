			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- The chairman of the  Supreme People's Assembly [SPA], Yang Hyong-sop, released a  statement today welcoming the remarks of president of the  Democratic Party [DP] of South Korea Yi Ki-taek at an emergency  press conference on June 14, at which he reiterated his party's  position of opposing "sanctions" and "pressure" against the  fellow countrymen in the North and hoping for ensuring peace of  the country through dialogue and negotiation and expressed his  willingness to visit Pyongyang as "a special envoy of the  government", if possible.    Saying it is only too natural that at a time when figures of  various strata are visiting Pyongyang from other countries,  concerned over the acute situation prevailing on the Korean  peninsula, the president of a South Korean opposition party  wants to visit Pyongyang to meet with fellow countrymen, Yang  Hyong-sop said:    Taking note of the fact that president Yi Ki-taek, who had  expressed the hope for a visit to Pyongyang more than once from  the beginning of the year, expressed again his intention to  visit Pyongyang as "a special envoy," I view this as an  expression of the spirit national independence for averting the  danger of war facing the nation and ushering in a bright future  of the nation through dialogue and negotiation by pooling wisdom  and strength of leading politicians of the North and the South.    So, I think that he may visit Pyongyang as the president of  the Democratic Party or as "a special envoy."    We will heartily welcome his visit. Convinced that if he  visited Pyongyang, we could seek a fair and good way of  radically improving North-South relations in an atmosphere of  mutual understanding and respect as fellow countrymen, I express  the hope for his early visit to Pyongyang.    Anyone who is concerned over the destiny of the fellow  countrymen, if but a little must not bar his visit aimed at  overcoming the grave difficulties facing the nation and opening  a new phase of reconciliation and unity of the fellow countrymen  but offer all the necessary conditions and conveniences.</p>

Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations of Japan, said: Japan has carried through its  stance against the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets  which could lead to managed trade. As a result, the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks failed to hammer out an accord and I  think that it was inevitable.    Commenting on the future economic relations between Japan  and  the United States, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan  Federation of Employers Association, said: I cannot help but  say that the Japan-U.S. economic relations have entered a  difficult situation. Mr. Nagano also expressed his caution  against moves in the United States.    Kosaku Inaba, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, said: the U.S. Congress is moving toward imposing  sanctions against Japan. We intend to use international trade  rules to ask the U.S. Congress not to invoke sanctions against  Japan. It is necessary for both Japan and the United States to  make efforts to continue their discussions and build a firm  cooperative relationship.</p>

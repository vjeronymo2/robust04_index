			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 12 KILLED IN BEIRUT SHELLING DUEL  </P> <P> Muslim and Christian forces turned their howitzers on residential areas of  Beirut today, killing 12 people in a withering attack that began on the eve of  the civil war's 14th anniversary.  </P> <P> The leader of the Christian army said the fighting had reduced Lebanon to "a  cadaver in a coffin" and urged the superpowers to help end the fighting.  </P> <P> The shelling duel was the fiercest since the Arab League called a cease-fire in  Lebanon a week ago. The sudden barrage, which shattered an overnight lull, took  civilians by surprise and forced them to rush back to bunkers and underground  bomb shelters.  </P></p>

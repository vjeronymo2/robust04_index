			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Surge forecast in airport traffic Britain's airports are set for a surge in demand for air travel, according to government forecasts published yesterday, Rachel Johnson writes. Demand will grow faster at regional airports than London airports, and business traffic will outpace leisure traffic. The Department of Transport predicted that air traffic at London and regional airports is to grow by up to 163 per cent between 1992 and the year 2010 - an annual rate of between 3.1 per cent and 5.5 per cent - provided there are no constraints from shortages of airport or airspace capacity. According to the estimates the number of domestic and international passengers will rise to between 279.5m by 2010, from 106.1m in 1992.</p>

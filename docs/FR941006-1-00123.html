			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Safety and efficacy of iron-containing drugs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also authorizes FDA to regulate the marketing of any products to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> help ensure that the products are safe and effective for their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended uses. ``New drugs'' may not be introduced into interstate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce unless they are the subject of approved new drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications (NDA's)(25 U.S.C. 355(a)). The act defines a ``new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drug'' as: (1) Any drug (except a new animal drug or an animal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feed bearing or containing a new animal drug) the composition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is such that such drug is not generally recognized among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experts qualified by scientific training and experience to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as safe and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or suggested in the labeling thereof; or (2) any drug the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition of which is such that such drug, as a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigations to determine its safety and effectiveness for use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under such conditions, has become so recognized, but which has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not, otherwise than in such investigations, been used to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material extent or for a material time under such conditions (21  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 321(b)). In order to be approved, an NDA must contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate data to demonstrate that the drug product is safe and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or suggested in the labeling (21 U.S.C. 355(d)). In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for NDA approval, the product must be manufactured using current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> good manufacturing practice and the product labeling must not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> false or misleading (21 U.S.C. 355(d)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 411 of the act (21 U.S.C. 350) provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary of Health and Human Services may not classify any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural or synthetic vitamin or mineral (or combination thereof)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a drug solely because it exceeds the level of potency which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary determines is nutritionally rational or useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except in the case of a vitamin, mineral, other ingredient of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food, or food, which is represented for use by individuals in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment or management of specific diseases or disorders, by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children (individuals under the age of 12 years), or by pregnant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or lactating women.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the iron-containing products that FDA regulates are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered dietary supplements. The iron-containing products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that FDA currently regulates as drug products are generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescription products and are so designated, in most cases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they contain an amount of folic acid that exceeds the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount in which folic acid may be used as a food additive (see 21  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 172.345).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Nikiforenko, deputy of Orenburg Oblast </F> Legislative Assembly, under the "Elections in the Regions"  rubric: "Compromising Materials Did Not Help Either"]    [Text] Orenburg Oblast's electoral commission for the  results of the elections in the Orenburg region has confirmed  the mandates of 36 deputies. This is absolutely adequate to  form the leading organs of representative power.    The voters supported the leaders and activists of the  "Against Poverty, Unemployment, and Corruption" bloc of the  peoples' patriotic forces, which included representatives of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Russian Communist  Workers' Party, the Agrarian Party of Russia and the Agrarian  Union, the Union of Commodity Producers, the "For Social  Justice" electoral association, the trade union of the  agro-industrial complex, the "Officers Union," and other  organizations. They also refused to vote confidence in  representatives of "Russia's Choice," "Democratic Russia," and  the social democrats.    The "democrats" conducted themselves in a very nervy manner  right through the campaign, and their unofficial supervisor V.  Shapovalenko, who holds the post of presidential representative,  attacked the left-wing forces' candidates in radio and  television broadcasts and violated the statute on the elections,  which forbids officials of state organs of power to campaign.    On election day, Shapovalenko conducted himself in a very  tempestuous manner at the polling stations, striking fear in the  hearts of commission members and verbally abusing communist  candidates. The oblast electoral commission was forced to send  the president an official statement about his improper behavior.  He is now interpreting the election results loosely and is  dissatisfied because practical men representing the working  people's interests have been elected to the oblast legislative  assembly.    The compromising materials which the presidential  representative prepared against candidates who were not to his  liking and with which he hit television viewers a day before the  elections, also failed to work. It is no accident that many  Orenburg residents doubt whether the position of presidential  representative is necessary.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY VERDICTS IN CINCINNATI, FT. LAUDERDALE  </P> <P> Look out, Times, your bias is showing again! In "Verdict Is Guilty in 2 Live  Crew's Rap Album Sale" (Oct. 4) we read that an "all-white" jury convicted  Charles Freeman of selling obscenity in Florida.  </P> <P> Are you trying to make this anti-obscenity issue into one of race? Simply  stated, a jury convicted Freeman based on the facts: The lyrics of the songs  from 2 Live Crew are obscene. Under the guise of "freedom of expression," 2  Live Crew is hiding words that degrade and violate women and children. The  music is not the problem, but the words definitely "appeal to a morbid interest  in sex." I congratulate the jury.  </P> <P> SANDRA SKELLY  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

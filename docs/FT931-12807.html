			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Arthur Shaw to confront rebels The embattled board of Arthur Shaw, the loss-making West Midlands building materials group quoted on the USM, is due to set the date today for an extraordinary meeting to consider rebel shareholders' calls for the removal of Mr Gordon Pearson, the chairman. The rebels, who claim the support of shareholders controlling 49 per cent of the equity, want to replace Mr Pearson with Mr Ian Tickler, his predecessor, whose family founded Shaw and which still controls a 13.4 per cent stake. They also want to reappoint Mr Donald Crammond who was ousted from the board last August. Last week Mr Pearson, who controls a 15 per cent equity stake, obtained a temporary High Court injunction preventing two former directors from being re-appointed, or seeking re-appointment, to the board. This was lifted yesterday pending a full hearing of the case next week.</p>

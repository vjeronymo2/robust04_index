			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] An attempt is being made to have the U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR) influence the Peruvian Government into  changing the labor reform it is implementing and adopting new  labor policies. The statement is included in a document  prepared by the Coordinating Board of Peruvian Labor  Federations, which is led by Teodulo Hernandez.    The document, signed by Peruvian union organizations, states  that the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial  Organizations (AFL-CIO) believes that the Peruvian Government  "is seeking to compete with U.S. manufacturers by using a system  based on an overworked, cheap work force."    "This," the document adds, "is not a model compatible with  the needs of a reasonable, productive trade integration."    The document admits that these conditions could be brought  to  bear upon the Peruvian Government by recommending the suspension  of duty-free imports of Peruvian products by the United States.  [passage omitted]    The U.S. Government could fall into the trap of pressing for  the elimination of our labor reform by threatening to take  retaliatory measures.    The document notes that the USTR is expected to make a  decision in June in which he could affect approximately $300  million worth of Peruvian exports.    The document states that this could happen "unless the  Peruvian Government makes substantive corrections in its policy  toward trade unions."    The document says that U.S. officials have received reports  that "Peruvian union representatives" may have been "publicly  threatened by representatives of the Fujimori government" with  being "brought to trial before military courts and sentenced to  life on charges of treason to the fatherland." [passage  omitted]    The Peruvian trade unions state that their demands are  designed to bring about changes to "restrictions imposed upon  the free action of unions in our country, or otherwise face the  exclusion of Peruvian exports from the Generalized System of  Preferences (GSP)."

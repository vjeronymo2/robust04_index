			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT WAS BRENNAN'S LIFE AND HE GAVE IT HIS LAST ENERGY  </P> <P> The resignation of Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. caught most of  Washington by surprise Friday night, but it was not totally unexpected among  those who had sufficient personal contact with him to see the increasingly  visible signs of his deteriorating health. Among those observers was Times  staff writer Jim Mann, who covered the Supreme Court from 1976 through 1984 and  who returned three months ago to interview the 84-year-old jurist.  </P> <P> When I walked into Justice William J. Brennan Jr.'s chambers last April, I  hadn't talked to him for more than six years, not since I had left the Supreme  Court beat back in 1984.  </P> <P> What I saw, and what he said, took me by surprise. At the age of nearly 84,  Justice Brennan, the court's senior member, was quite evidently failing -- and  he came very close to admitting it.  </P> <P> "Recently, my doctor told me I'd better not make any speeches or other outside  activities," Brennan told me in one of his last interviews as a member of the  court. "I'd better just stick to my work here . . . . I apparently have some of  the ills that afflict 84-year-olds, and therefore I'd better pace myself better  than I've been pacing myself."  </P> <P> His once-booming, gravelly voice was low and weak. His body was thinner. His  mind and mood were good, but he seemed preoccupied with his health -- so much  so, in fact, that he dwelt on it in the sort of detail Supreme Court justices  usually avoid.  </P> <P> "I came back from Israel a couple of years ago with a terrible case of  shingles, really a miserable case of shingles," Brennan said. "Then I had a  serious reaction only last fall to antibiotics that I was taking for influenza  . . . at about that time. And I'm not out of that yet . . . . It was the  reaction to those things that prompted my doctor to say that you just better  slow down."  </P> <P> Confronted by such problems and doctor's orders, Brennan decided to conserve  all his remaining energy for the Supreme Court. He clung to the court as  tenaciously as men cling to life itself. For Brennan, that was natural: for 34  years, the Supreme Court was his life.  </P> <P> He canceled 12 scheduled speeches and other public appearances. "Right now, my  wife and I are busily trying to figure out what in hell we're going to do this  summer," he said, the frustration evident in his tired voice.  </P> <P> Others in similar situations have elected to step aside and to spend their  precious time with their families, away from the tensions and demanding  schedule of a full-time job. On the court over the last decade, Justices Potter  Stewart and Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Chief Justice Warren E. Burger all chose to  step aside before their health began to fail.  </P> <P> But there was a crucial difference between Brennan and the other three  justices. Stewart, Powell and Burger were all moderate-to-conservative justices  who knew their replacements would be selected by President Ronald Reagan and  his conservative Administration.  </P> <P> Brennan, by contrast, was the acknowledged leader of the liberal wing of the  court. His successor was not likely to be as avowedly committed to the causes  of individual justice and freedom as was Brennan.  </P> <P> In the interview, Brennan insisted that he never thought of such political  considerations. "It's never for a minute dawned on me that it was important to  my decision whether or not to retire who sat in the White House," he told me.  "Never gave it that much thought."  </P> <P> Yet Brennan knew full well he was by far the most effective remaining advocate  of the traditions of former Chief Justice Earl Warren.  </P> <P> Even in his last months on the court, more than two decades after Warren had  retired, Brennan was eager as ever to proclaim the values he felt the Warren  Court had embodied.  </P> <P> The tradition of the Warren Court was, he said, "an application of the  Constitution to enhance and further human dignity and individual rights. Rather  than, as was the case for a long while, to have the court put its clout on the  protection of interests other than the interests of the individual."  </P> <P> On the bench, Brennan pressed forward in the Warren Court tradition until the  very end. But he also became philosophical about the seemingly inevitable  swings in public opinion and changes in the direction of the Supreme Court  itself.  </P> <P> "Perhaps that's the very nature of our democracy, that, as a democracy, we  don't stand still," he said. "We're always pushing ahead, to goals that we've  had from our beginning. And again, in individual rights and individual  liberties, we'll get back to them in time."  </P> <P> He said "we," but he was referring to mankind, not himself. Brennan knew that  his own time on the court was running out.  </P></p>

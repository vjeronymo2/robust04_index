			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Portugal may resume foreign borrowing this year PORTUGAL is likely to resume foreign borrowing this year, but this will be done carefully so as not to raise the country's overall indebtedness, Mr Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, governor of the central bank, said yesterday. Government proposals for the 1992 budget presented earlier this week include the possibility of raising up to Es153bn (Dollars 1.1bn) on the international financial markets. This includes Es63bn for debt repayments and Es90bn on new financing. Mr Tavares Moreira said the total figure was too high and that any new borrowing should be used to repay outstanding debt, and not to add to the debt burden. 'Borrowing should be limited to cover the Es63bn in repayments,' he said. Portugal has refrained from direct borrowing on the international markets for some years and used recent capital inflows to reduce the country's external debt which stands at about Es15bn. Mr Tavares Moreira said that restrictions on foreign borrowing by companies would be eased this year - companies have to deposit 40 per cent of the value of any foreign borrowing with the central bank at no interest. The restriction is designed to discourage companies from borrowing abroad where they can find much more attractive interest rates, but it has been the focus of criticisms from Portuguese businesses which say they are penalised in the face of foreign companies investing in Portugal. 'This (compulsory) deposit could be reduced in the near future, but gradually. A first step could be to bring the deposit down to 30 per cent, with further reductions following later, so that by the end of the year it could be substantially reduced,' said Mr Tavares Moreira. Any easing of capital controls would be limited to commercial transactions such as buying equipment abroad. He said Portuguese interest rates could fall by about 3 percentage points this year, though they would remain high by international standards. Companies currently pay up to 25 per cent.</p>

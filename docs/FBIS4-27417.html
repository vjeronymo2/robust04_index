			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has decided on its approach at the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks negotiations on government  procurement reopening in Tokyo on 3 June. With regard to the  creteria for regular monitoring of the openness of the market  (objective criteria), it plans to propose using the share of  foreign products in past government procurement as a  quantitative criterion, and progress in the implementation of  measures to improve procurement procedures announced last March  as a qualitative criterion. However, the United States is  expected to reiterate its desire to discuss procurement by the  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). It may again  demand that a certain measure of numerical targets be included  in the objective criteria.    Government procurement is one of the three priority sectors  in the framework talks. The focal issue here is how to increase  the ratio of foreign products in telecommunications and medical  equipment purchased by Japanese Government agencies. With  regard to the issue of objective criteria, the following points  have been agreed upon during the recent discussions between  Japan and the United States which led to the resumption of the  framework talks: 1) these criteria will not be considered  numerical targets; 2) both quantitative and qualitative criteria  will be created; and 3) a comprehensive evaluation of the  openness of the market should be conducted by using a number of  criteria. In line with the above, the Japanese Government has  finalized its concrete proposals on objective criteria in this  sector.    In government procurement, the ratio of foreign products in  telecommunications equipment (in 1992) was around 6 percent  (according to a Japanese Government survey). The government  plans to monitor this ratio regularly to demonstrate its  positive attitude toward expanding procurement of products made  in the United States and other countries. Japan also plans to  include the number of foreign companies participating in bids as  one objective criterion. This data will be a measure of how  actively U.S. companies sell their products. A regular check on  this figure will contribute to encourage U.S. efforts to  participate in the market.    The measures to reform bidding procedures announced in March  consist mainly of steps to better reflect the foreign companies'  opinions. By looking at how faithfully such measures have been  implemented, Japan hopes to eliminate "suspicions about the  existence of dango [bid rigging]" among some U.S. companies.    With regard to NTT, Japan argues that "This company has been  privatized. It is not logical to discuss NTT procurement at the  framework talks."    In relation to objective criteria, the United States will  probably ask for mid- and long-term commitments to sustain the  current trend of increasing foreign share in government  procurement, claiming this does not constitute a numerical  target. Japan intends to reject this demand, in the belief that  "any commitment for the future should be interpreted as a  numerical target."    Since government procurement is an area under direct  government control, it has been considered a sector where it  would be easier to reach an agreement. The Japanese Government  has also been hoping to bring progress to the framework talks as  a whole by achieving an agreement in procurement. However, if  conflicts arise un the NTT issue, negotiations may not proceed  smoothly along the line of this scenario.</p>

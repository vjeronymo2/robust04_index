			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Arts: Of clothes and shows - Television AMID the general passion for denigrating television, we should try to break the habit of judging the medium solely in terms of its populist worst, while judging other things - painting, music, landscape, the novel, clothing, sculpture, virtually everything but television - by its best. When did you last see an article heaping contempt upon the clothing industry because of the poor style and shoddy materials of cheap mass-produced clothes? Never, probably. Yet those are the clothes that sell in the largest numbers, which get the biggest 'ratings'. Whatever their popularity, we disregard them and talk among ourselves about Barbour jackets, Cheaney shoes, and Keturah Brown knickers. Why are so many people so ready to use Eldorado, You've Been Framed, and Treasure Hunt as sticks with which to beat television, when they would never dream of using Woolworth's trainers or Co-op jeans as sticks with which to beat the British clothing business? Suggest that it would be a crime not to repeat such magnificent programmes as those in BBC2's 'Alan Bennett Season' - the final sequence of An Englishman Abroad with Burgess striding across the bridge in his finery, earning an incredulous double-take from a Russian sailor, while Gilbert and Sullivan swell on the soundtrack, is near perfect, and Thora Hird's performance in A Cream Cracker Under The Settee is so powerful, that when I went to lay it down on tape and watched the first two minutes, I was hooked until the end even though I had seen it before - and people will murmur grudging agreement before harking back to Eldorado and the ghastliness of Jeremy Beadle. It is as though you were trying to talk about Burberrys while your colleagues will only pour scorn upon tricel blouses from Tesco. But is the analogy fair? Surely the proportion of good material on television is nowhere near as great as the proportion of good products in the British clothing industry? This is, of course, a morass of subjectivity, but my guess is that the proportions are just about the same, as they probably are in print or prepared food. The point is, that with the amount of television now on offer, and video recorders in almost 90 per cent of homes, there is, even in the supposedly dreary depths of summer, more worthwhile television available than any normal person could get through. Have you been watching Video Diaries on BBC2? Admittedly this week's was an embarrassing example of the excesses of America's Me Generation ('Enough about me, let's talk about you; what do you think about me?'). However, others in the series have been startlingly successful. In particular the programme made by an Albanian doctor, Ylli Hasani, was agonising, eye-opening, funny and utterly unforgettable. It seems astonishing that an amateur using a borrowed video camera should be able to reveal more about the true state of one of the former communist countries of eastern Europe than all the professionals, but here was vivid proof. It is odd to have to say so, but Hasani's picture was more appalling than that presented by dramatist Andrew Davies and director David Tucker in A Very Polish Practice which opened a new season of BBC1's 'Screen One' on Sunday. Davies is of course the man who brought us that acid-laced cocktail of humour and sly social observation, A Very Peculiar Practice. Having married Dr Daker to 'nasty girl' Grete, and moved the two of them to Warsaw, Davies transferred his beady eye to Poland and had terrible fun at the expense of the old apparatchiks, the new entrepreneurs (mostly one and the same) and, thank goodness, that monster of English xenophobia and reaction, Bob Buzzard. Perhaps some viewers imagine that drama as strong and idiosyncratic as this crops up throughout world television; if so, they are wrong. It is similarly rare in other countries to find documentaries as intensely felt as Ron Peck's Fighters, a long and engrossing account of young boxers from London's East End. Like a remarkably large number of other recent non-fiction programmes, this one clearly expressed the views of its maker; there was no 'on the one hand, on the other hand' about this, no attempt to include the abolitionist line. Here was a boxing programme by a boxing fan, and the sea change which seems to be producing so many opinionated programmes of this sort is something we shall need to return to in a later column. That was on Channel 4, as is the series Nomads, which began last Thursday with a memorable account of life among the Moors in the western Sahara. In no other anthropological programme (except the magnificent Baka: People Of The Rainforest where it played a small part, I seem to remember) has there been such a fascinating illustration of the universal tendency for wives to threaten to go home to mother if husbands don't buck their ideas up. After years of watching television anthropologists treat their subjects like Meissen china, it was heartening to find here the same sort of robust attitude that you would expect if the subjects were Welsh miners. Traveller, wine drinker and sometime cook, Keith Floyd, is now a familiar figure, but Floyd On Spain on BBC2 on Tuesdays is probably his best series yet. He seems to have resisted the temptation to become The Compleat TV Show-off and is, so far as one can tell, being himself, as he enthuses over fish, landscape, women, wine, or a marvellous cooking club for men. The gap between this and Fanny Cradock's Kitchen Magic in 1955 feels like more than a single generation. There is incomparably more entertainment in Floyd's programmes. Arts enthusiasts are being offered Live From The Proms on BBC2, which recently showed not only Tchaikovsky's 'Manfred' symphony (you can spend a long time in concert halls without hearing that), but also an elegant interval film about the St Petersburg Philharmonic and how life has changed for the musicians as Leningrad has reverted to its old name and the 'totalitarian' conductor Mransky has been succeeded by the 'democrat' Temirkanov. Better still, and also on BBC2, Dancemakers offered a profile of choreographer Jonathan Burrows, whose work I should have known about but did not. What we saw was almost all fast and vigorous (can he do slow and lyrical?) but above all - and this point was virtually ignored by Ross MacGibbon's programme, good though it was in other ways  - very funny. Funny choreographers are rare enough, so it is good to be introduced to one by television. And there is more, much more. On Friday, BBC1 launched what looks like being the best police series for years, Between The Lines, which has the authenticity of The Bill, some of the fast action which has been missing since The Sweeney, and that frisson that comes with the suspicion that a series has a little devil in it. This time the devil appeals to the widespread belief that police malpractice should be investigated by somebody other than the police themselves, this series being about an internal investigation unit. Finally, on Tuesdays, BBC2 has a series which seems to be aimed straight at FT readers: The John Bull Business, another current affairs series which abandons the old fence-straddling posture in favour of a far more critical stance which is both surprising and informative for a non-specialist. This, too, we should perhaps return to. Of course there is an awful lot of rubbish on television, just as there is an awful lot of rubbish in every library and every supermarket. Yet we do not perpetually condemn the entire world of books as 'Rubbish, not a thing to read', nor the collective output of the food industry as 'Rubbish, not a thing to eat'. So why are such different rules applied to television?</p>

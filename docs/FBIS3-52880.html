[passage omitted]    [Shakarah] An historic document dated 1932 lists statistics  on the Iraqi Army. It says that when Iraq joined the League of  Nations, the Army had only two divisions and only 549 officers,  9,320 noncommissioned officers and soldiers, and 794 volunteers.  What is the size of the Iraqi Army now?    [Al-Rawi] From its formation until the 14 July 1958  revolution, the Iraqi Army was a small one, incapable of meeting  the national and pan-Arab requirements to defend the Arab nation  and serve its national objectives. The colonialists were trying  to impose their control over the Army and use it as a tool to  protect their colonialist objectives and schemes and crush any  nationalist movement by force. After 1958, the Army began to  grow gradually with the formation of new divisions. Then, the  17-30 July 1968 Revolution brought to power a nationalist  authority that believes in national and pan-Arab objectives.  That authority adopted a long-term policy to rebuild the Army  on strong revolutionary bases. Thanks to mujahid leader  President Saddam Husayn, may God protect and preserve him, the  Army became the revolution's striking arm and vigilant eye that  protects the homeland and the people's achievements. The Army  was organized on modern, scientific bases, and its combat  capabilities and technical methods were improved. The formations  were significantly enlarged until today when it has become the  fourth largest Army in the world after the U.S., Russian, and  Chinese Armies. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Stocks stage recovery on bond rally UK government bonds staged a recovery yesterday, giving a strong boost to the London stock market. Dealers reported cautious buying of long-dated gilts, where yields rose close to 9 per cent earlier this week. However, some warned the recovery was a technical correction after recent heavy selling. Mr John Kendall, chief economist at Baring Brothers, said dealers' attitudes had not shifted significantly. 'I think we have further to go before things calm down,' he said. The London stock market shrugged off its prolonged run of weak sessions after the gilt rally and a stronger performance from stock index futures. The FT-SE 100 index recorded its best daily gain for the year, closing at 2,980.8, a rise of 48.9. In the gilts market the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 rose more than three points to around 103 1/2 , to yield 8.41 per cent. The September contract of the long gilt future traded on Liffe, the London futures and options exchange, jumped more than two points to 100 11/16. Government bonds, Page 26 London shares, Page 38</p>

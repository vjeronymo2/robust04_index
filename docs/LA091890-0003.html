			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST SCHOLARS FIND RELEVANCE IN THE PAST;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: TURKISH AND ISRAELI PROFESSORS GIVE ATTENTIVE STUDENTS STRONG  BACKGROUND IN THE REGION'S HISTORY.  </P> <P> The arrival this summer of Hasan Kayali at UC San Diego and Meir Zamir at San  Diego State University could not have been timed better.  </P> <P> The two Middle East scholars are finding that the last six weeks' events in  Kuwait and the Arabian Peninsula have provided a compelling backdrop to their  modern history courses on the region.  </P> <P> The Turkish-born Kayali was recruited to the UCSD department of history as its  first Middle East specialist, both to design courses in the subject area and to  strengthen the university's research efforts as part of a possible future  Middle East studies program. While only 20 undergraduates pre-registered for  his initial course (tracing the Middle East from the year 1600 to the present),  that was before the Iraq crisis erupted, and Kayali expects more students to  show up when classes begin Monday.  </P> <P> "Since this is a very politicized subject, I expect many students will come  with preconceptions," Kayali said. "I want to give them an opportunity to  re-examine what they think, to re-evaluate their views, to alert them to the  diversity in the Middle East, and to caution them against going with easy  generalizations."  </P> <P> Zamir, an Israeli professor who holds a guest history chair for the 1990-91  year at San Diego State, was forced because of limited classroom size to turn  away more than 40 students from his modern Middle East history course, which  began late last month.  </P> <P> The 40 students who qualified for the class by registering ahead of time are  much more attentive than those he taught in a similar class during a guest  professorship in 1988-89, Zamir said.  </P> <P> "I would say that the students are certainly much more attuned to the  complexity of the situation, that despite the tendency of American students to  be without patience for history, they know today they need serious, not  instant, study of the past in order to make sense of the present," said Zamir,  a historian from Ben Gurion University in Beersheba, Israel.  </P> <P> Zamir assigns what he calls "heavy, heavy readings" because he finds most  American students have so little background about the Middle East "that most  don't even know the maps."  </P> <P> Zamir added, "So far I don't see any 'Rambo' attitude among these students,"  contrary to media reports and public opinion polls suggesting that Americans  favor military action against the Iraqi regime.  </P> <P> Kayali, who comes to his assistant professor post from the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, also stressed the importance of learning the  historical antecedents of contemporary Middle Eastern politics and culture.  </P> <P> "Students are going to be disappointed if they take the course just as a  substitute for reading the papers, as sort of a current events course," Kayali  said, although he will make copies of news articles for students to discuss in  the context of historical patterns.  </P> <P> "I'm not offering instant analysis of current events, so I want students to be  interested in learning history as a tool to figure out the present."  </P> <P> But Kayali is confident that studying the sweep of Middle East history over the  past 300 years can intrigue students enough that they will go beyond the  insights they gain into how to view the present American military role on the  Arabian Peninsula.  </P> <P> "There's the historical claims that Iraq has had on Kuwait, the sectarian  divisions in Muslim societies, both in Iraq and elsewhere, the meaning of the  Islamic revival, the explanations of terms such as Shiite (Muslims) and Sunni  (Muslims), as well as the substance of and historical precedents for Islamic  resurgence," Kayali said.  </P> <P> Kayali, who earned both his undergraduate degree and doctorate from Harvard  University, returned to the United States only last week from a summer in  Turkey, where among other things he was buying books to augment a budding  Middle East collection at the UCSD research library.  </P> <P> "There's lots of concern in Turkey that the country will be dragged into an  active conflict with Iraq," Kayali said, adding that the gung-ho support by  Americans for action in the Middle East -- as reflected in public opinion polls  -- is not necessarily shared in Turkey.  </P> <P> "There's no support for Saddam Hussein, but there's fear of a war because we  have to live with him or whomever comes next," Kayali said. His father was  sufficiently worried about a possible mobilization of Turkish citizens that he  urged his son to return to the United States as early as possible, Kayali said.  </P> <P> Both Kayali and Zamir see their "outsider" status as foreign-born scholars a  plus in teaching the present courses.  </P> <P> "The fact that I come from the region, the fact that I am more attuned to the  region, I think that makes it helpful," said Zamir, who also has taught at  Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.  </P> <P> "I'm not teaching the course as it is usually taught in the U.S., with an  emphasis on present political systems, but rather I'm looking at internal  changes within the region and at its own development. . . . I want to get away  from the jargon of international politics and superpower relations -- things  that Americans like very much."  </P> <P> Neither Kayali nor Zamir wants to push his own view of the present crisis on  students.  </P> <P> Kayali, in demurring on giving his opinion, said that, once his students plow  their way through the region's history, "they'll have as good an opinion as I  do, and that is an aim of the course."  </P></p>

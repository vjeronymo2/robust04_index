			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, Jun 25 (AFP) -- After a meeting between  Honduran Government officials and U.S. Defense Secretary William  Perry today, it was officially reported that the United States  will install a regional center to counter drug trafficking  activities in Honduras.    The Pentagon's number one man met with Honduran Armed Forces  Commander General Luis Alonso Discua, Vice President Retired  General Walter Lopez Reyes, and Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz  Aguilar at noon today. The meeting was held at Palmerola, a  military base that was constructed in 1982 and is located 84 km  to the north of Tegucigalpa. There are approximately 1,000 U.S.  soldiers stationed at Palmerola.    Perry arrived in Honduras this morning after visiting Panama  and traveled to Puerto Rico later in the day. The United States  must withdraw approximately 10,000 Southern Command soldiers  from the Panama Canal area by December 1999 at the latest.  Perry said the withdrawal from Panama had prompted them to  consider transferring several air units to Palmerola. He said,  however, that "in general, all the military installations in the  region are being reduced because of geopolitical changes."    Honduran Foreign Minister Paz reported, however, that "this  issue had not been discussed" at the meeting with Perry and that  "Honduras is not going to become a military platform" for the  United States. "I believe the U.S. policy, at an international  level, is to close bases and to decrease the number of their  soldiers stationed abroad. I do not believe they are interested"  in increasing their presence in Honduras, Paz asserted.    The Honduran minister added that, at the meeting with the  U.S. secretary, it was agreed within the framework of a treaty  to establish a regional center in Honduras to counter drug  trafficking" and that Honduras would want the center to be  located at Palmerola.    "It is clear that Honduras has to redefine its relations  with  the United States based on dignity," Paz observed, alluding to  several reforms to the 1954 U.S.-Honduras military treaties that  were proposed by the Honduran Government several months ago.  The presence of the U.S. troops in Honduran territory is  included in those agreements. According to the foreign minister,  the issue "was broached in a very preliminary manner" during the  meeting with Perry.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Move on HK military land BRITAIN IS trying to break a deadlock with China over the future of land in Hong Kong now used by British forces after Beijing assumes sovereignty over the territory in 1997, Simon Holberton writes from Hong Kong. Beijing wants to decide the future of all military land. Britain wants to pass surplus acreage to the Hong Kong government, for use in new development. It also has no wish to see People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the centre of Hong Kong. However, Britain is understood to be ready to offer China possession of the Prince of Wales building, headquarters of British forces, on Hong Kong island. The Tamar naval base, of which the Prince of Wales building is part, would be a valuable development site.</p>

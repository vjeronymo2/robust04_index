			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLIES UNANIMOUS IN HAILING BUSH INITIATIVE  </P> <P> America's allies at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit meeting here  reacted with unstinting praise Monday for President Bush's surprise arms  reduction proposals.  </P> <P> As West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl put it: "With his great initiative for  rapidly reducing conventional arms, President Bush has today paved the way for  further success of our alliance.  </P> <P> "I congratulate him on this far-sighted step, with which he has once more  impressively affirmed the United States' leadership."  </P> <P> British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was reported by aides to have said  that Bush's proposals for cutting conventional arms in Europe had "transformed"  the summit.  </P> <P> All other national leaders praised the Bush initiative, even French President  Francois Mitterrand, who is loath to see any major troop reduction in Europe.  </P> <P> The French, while not participating members of NATO's military structure, have  been the most hawkish in maintaining a large standing army -- 50,000 troops in  West Germany -- and an independent nuclear weapons force.  </P> <P> "I think it's impressive," said Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of  Bush's initiative. "It is worthy of very serious consideration, which is what  it's receiving."  </P> <P> Asked for her reaction, Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Haarlem Brundtland  responded: "Very positive," the same words used by Spanish Prime Minister  Felipe Gonzalez.  </P> <P> "Good proposal," said Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, and Danish  Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen called Bush's ideas "excellent" and "very  positive."  </P> <P> "It will give NATO the initiative in the conventional arms talks in Vienna," he  added.  </P></p>

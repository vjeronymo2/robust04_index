			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As of 29 March, five major Japanese automakers have  formulated their plans to increase purchases of foreign auto  parts in particular. In their plans, the automakers came up  with financial targets concerning their purchases, because they  took into account the ongoing bilateral frictions over the  automobile sector. In trying desperately to avoid having their  targets be considered commitments, however, automakers are  trying to put across their individual plans through such means  as setting different fiscal years as their respective target  periods. While praising such efforts by the private sector, the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] remains very  sensitive to how the United States will now respond, saying that  "the atmosphere in Washington is quite severe" (as stated by a  top MITI official).    Although the five automakers' procurement plans cover all  overseas products, they focus primarily on importing more auto  parts and completely assembled automobiles from the United  States. Automakers have avoided disclosing their data on past  purchases, and they have also set different fiscal years as  target periods. However, if we dare add up all the figures  listed in the automakers' finalized purchase plans, the total  purchases of auto parts come to approximately $23 billion.    This figure surpasses the target figure of $17.8 billion  which the five automakers had to share and meet when it was  announced during U.S. President George Bush's visit to Japan in  1992 that Japan would "purchase $19 billion worth of auto parts  in fiscal year 1994." However, the figure falls far short of  the expectations of the U.S. automobile industry, which is  "demanding a 30-percent annual increase." Consequently,  concerns have been voiced doubting the effectiveness of the  latest voluntary purchase plans in resolving the bilateral  automobile trade dispute.    However, there are some advantages for Japanese makers of  fully assembled automobiles to purchase U.S. auto parts. Among  crucial parts, for example, antilock braking systems (ABS) "made  in the United States are 80 percent less expensive than those  made in Japan" (as stated by a Toyota Motor Corporation  official).    On the backdrop of the yen's appreciation against the dollar  and the recovery of U.S. auto parts manufacturers, Japanese  automaker officials recently confessed that "if we really wanted  to, there are many U.S. auto parts that we could buy."    The problem, however, is that automobile exports -- which  have been the mainstay of the Japanese automobile industry --  are continuing to drop. Due to declining exports, the domestic  production of automobiles by the Honda Motor Company, Ltd. is  expected to drop from 1.2 million units in 1992 to around 1.06  million units in 1994.    Because the outlook is also uncertain for domestic  automobile  sales, automakers find it difficult to boldly announce plans to  import more auto parts. While maintaining that "there may be  adjustments in automobile production" (as stated by a Mazda  Motor Corporation official), automakers express strong concerns  that their voluntary target figures may assume lives of their  own and become commitments.    Meanwhile, it is expected that the United States will now  ask  Japan to sell more fully assembled U.S. automobiles in its  markets rather than U.S. auto parts because this would lead to a  more direct increase in profits.</p>

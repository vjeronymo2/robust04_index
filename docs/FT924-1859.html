			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Round and round go the Uruguay trade reform negotiators URUGUAY round negotiators are all dressed up and ready to go but someone has called off the party. They winged their way to Geneva from all quarters of the globe earlier this month in the expectation of stitching up the final deals by Christmas. But the trade officials, meeting in the multilateral round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are wondering when the real end-game will begin. Hopes were raised high at the end of last month that the last lap had been entered when US and EC trade negotiators resolved a year-long clash over reform of farm trade. But it now seems clear that there will be no accord, even on a provisional basis, by the end of the year. However, negotiators have not given up hope that the wide-ranging talks, spanning 15 broad trade areas, 28 separate accords and detailed country commitments to open markets for specific goods and services, will be completed before the US administration's negotiating authority from Congress expires next March. Since the US-EC settlement last month, governments involved in the 108-nation round have had to make up their minds whether to push for changes to last December's draft 'final act' which sets out the rules to govern world trade for the rest of the decade and beyond. Many countries have problems with aspects of the text - but too much tinkering could upset the delicate balance in the package between different national and sectoral interests. Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the Gatt, has said the draft can only be changed by consensus. That has not inhibited the US from raising a host of difficulties, to the annoyance of trading partners. The EC, exhausted from internal wranglings over its farm trade deal with Washington, does not much want to renegotiate anything beyond agriculture. To add to the confusion, all sides are indulging in a certain amount of posturing to show the folks back home they are fighting their corner. But amid the fog, the state of play in the negotiations can be dimly discerned: Agriculture: The main dispute concerns plans to convert all farm import barriers into tariffs which would be reduced over time - 'tariffication without exception'. This is opposed by Japan and South Korea, which want to keep their rice import bans, and by Canada, Switzerland and others which operate farm supply management systems. They privately acknowledge that they have no chance of winning their case - but they still hope to secure compensating concessions. Market access: These country-by-country negotiations, designed to cut overall tariffs by at least 30 per cent, have been delayed as negotiating teams have waited for the EC to present a draft list of new farm tariffs. Meanwhile Washington and Brussels have still not settled arguments over industrial tariffs. The EC is holding out for reductions in very high US tariffs on textiles, ceramics and dyestuffs, while the US is pressing for zero-for-zero deals on wood and paper products, non-ferrous metals, electronics, fish and alcoholic drinks. Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy rules: The US says it wants to re-open these texts, which would tighten the rules for imposing anti-dumping and countervailing duties on dumped imports that inflict injury on domestic companies. Japan and other Asian exporters argue that industrial countries are using such duties to harass legitimate trade. Intellectual property: The US wants to strengthen protection granted to pharmaceutical patents in developing countries. India has already served notice that it would then press for faster liberalisation in the textiles sector while the US is being urged by its textiles lobby to push back the dismantling of the quota-driven protectionism of the multi-fibre arrangement (MFA) from the proposed 10 to 15 years. Services: The framework General Agreement on Trade in Services could be complete by the end of this week, according to Gatt officials. But the complex bilateral negotiations on reform of different services sectors and specific market-opening measures are going slowly. The US and EC are pressing Japan and Asian developing countries to go further in liberalising financial services, while they continue to battle between themselves over EC restrictions on imports of US and other foreign audiovisual services such as films, videos and TV programmes. Multilateral trade organisation: The US has questioned the need for an MTO to implement the results of the round and give world trade rules the status of international law. It remains tantalisingly unknown which of these problems are for real, which are being raised principally for domestic consumption, and which can be successfully renegotiated. But the uncertainty makes it almost impossible for frustrated negotiators to decide whether they should be making a final push for settlement, or packing for Christmas.</p>

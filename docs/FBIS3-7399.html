Secretary of Defense William Perry handed down instructions  that include sending tactical aircrafts to South Korea within a  day or two at outbreak of war, and the U.S. Air Force in Korea  was ordered to increase its artillery and other supplies as  backup, the paper said.    Only one of the three U.S. Air Force battalions stationed in  Korea, comprised of 24 F-16s, can carry laser-guided bombs,  according to the paper.    The U.S. decision to be prepared for armed conflict on the  Korean peninsula was based on South Korea's physical distance  from the United States and lacking scale of the U.S. forces  there, it said.    Perry was quoted as saying that the United States will watch  for another four to six weeks whether North Korea will allow  international nuclear inspections before pushing for economic  sanctions.    The paper went on to say China opposes a U.N. Security  Council resolution, recommending instead a statement issued by  the council president.    Washington could agree to the idea if the statement clearly  indicates possibility of sanctions if North Korea ignores the  warning about inspection demands, the paper said.</p>

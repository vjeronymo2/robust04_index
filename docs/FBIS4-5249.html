			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Paul Keating of Australia will pay an  official visit to Vietnam shortly. This event is taking place  nine months after the visit to Australia by Vietnamese Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet. Here is our comment on the event:    The visit to Australia by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet in last year is considered a historic event in bilateral  relations and so it will be the coming visit to Vietnam by  Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. [sentence as heard]    These significant events taken place in less than a year  prove that relations between Vietnam and Australia have reached  a turning point in cooperation for mutual benefit.    During the last two years, the relations between the two  countries have seen wonderful developments. In 1992, the trade  turnover between the two countries was less than $2 million and  the figure is 120 times now, reaching $252 million. At present,  Australia is the sixth biggest investor in Vietnam with 23  projects worth $2.65 billion. However, leaders of the two  countries will wish to further develop bilateral cooperation,  especially in trade. These wishes are likely to be achieved.    On his visit to Australia last year, Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet reaffirmed that the Vietnamese Government welcomes and will  create favorable conditions for Australian companies wishing to  do business with Vietnam.    For his part, the Australian prime minister also affirmed  that his country is ready to help Vietnam in transport,  telecommunications, infrastructure, energy, and (?oil and gas)  exploration.    It is expected that there will be new and positive decisions  made during the coming visit to Vietnam by the Australian prime  minister to make the bilateral cooperation and relationship more  fruitful.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Japan's grey army captures niche market: Elderly consumers' preferences range from anti-wrinkle cream to books on dying The growing army of ageing Japanese represents an important new consumer market, according to Dentsu, the country's largest advertising agency. The grey wave has, over the past year, become a lucrative opportunity for sellers of cosmetics, life assurance and books about death, on the evidence of the agency's annual survey of hit products, a revealing barometer of Japan's changing public tastes. It is likely to be a long-term trend, as Japan has the world's fastest ageing population profile, with more than one in four destined to be older than 65 by the year 2020. Examples of grey wave winners include cosmetic group Shiseido's new anti-wrinkle liquid, of which it has sold 1.5m bottles in its first year after launch. This is double Shiseido's initial projection, partly because Wrinkelift Essence has also sold surprisingly well among skin-conscious mid-20 year olds. Cures for baldness, an affliction that dogs an estimated 15m Japanese, represents another fast growing market, in every sense. In tune with the Japanese love of long-term planning, many are preparing now for the end. Books about dying are experiencing a revival, showing 'a greater desire to learn how to live and how to die,' says Dentsu. The most popular, Peaceful Death, by radio commentator Rokusuke Ei and published in March, has sold more than 1m copies. To ensure consumers can afford to keep spending all the way to the grave, Japanese life assurers have offered a new policy that pays out six months before death, on presentation of a doctor's certificate. Sales are estimated to have reached 1m in the first half of the year alone. Nostalgia, meanwhile, is running high among young and old alike, which Dentsu attributes to a backlash against the technological sophistication of the 1990s. Space Invaders, one of the first computer games, is making a comeback 16 years after its launch. Taito, its maker, has sold 300,000 copies this year in the original black and white format and has increased its target to 1m, says Dentsu. Buyers range from young families up to the grey wave. The products that have made a hit over the past year indicate that Japanese consumers crave familiarity in what they buy, perhaps a mark of the shock inflicted by the worst recession since the second world war. The innovations to have made Dentsu's 1994 list are, revealingly, improvements on old ideas. There is a wrinkle-free shirt, made from a fabric that remembers its pristine shape, and a white swimsuit designed not to go transparent when wet. Bargains continue to be as popular as they were in the midst of the downturn, but this year the focus has shifted to imports, cheapened by the rise in the yen's value. Car imports rose by nearly 46 per cent in the first nine months of the year, led by Japanese models made abroad and followed by German and US vehicles. Drinks were the other beneficiary of the import boom, helped by the hottest summer for years. One of the biggest winners was US cola, on supermarket shelves at a mere Y39 (24p) a can. Consumers were slightly more prepared to buy luxuries in 1994 than they were in 1993. But truly extravagant gestures such as seen in the heady late 1980s are now absent, mourns Dentsu. So the best-selling expensive products have made a point of offering value for money. Dentsu's top product in this category is the silent electronic piano, which can be played through earphones. The hard-pressed piano industry is pinning hopes for a revival on it. This is a boon to families with musical children  -80 per cent of the silent piano market - living in cramped apartments. It allows their parents to grow old in peace, perhaps dozing in front of another 1994 hit product, the wide-screen television.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Gardening: Euphoria over the Euphorbias THIS YEAR'S Chelsea flower show offers a crash course on an intriguing plant: the euphorbia. Oxford University's Botanic Garden is sending a special exhibit to instruct us in the 'frogspawn bush' and its thousands of cousins. Euphorbias or spurges have a long history. According to Pliny, Euphorbus, court-physician to King Juba of Mauretania, made use of the latex they contain for medicinal purposes. Euphorbias have also been used for making furniture cream and waterproofing. North American euphorbias have proved a sensationally fast emetic, and Indian euphorbias go into making fireworks. For years euphorbias have been known to gardeners as an exceptionally valuable and varied foliage plant - although not one to everyone's taste. They provide eye-catching tints of acid yellows, oranges, blue-greys, pinks, and burgundy, at any level from the rock-garden upwards. The most eye-catching features in many a herbaceous border at present are massive clumps of Euphorbia characias, waving their lime-green heads at shoulder-height. Timothy Walker, superintendant of the Oxford Botanic Garden, is known by his staff to be quite potty about the euphorbia. In a manifesto written for Chelsea, he acclaims it as nothing less than 'the most horticulturally valuable genus in the plant kingdom'. The Botanic Garden grows more than 100 different species in cool-houses or outdoors. Or rather, it did; a vicious frost last November killed about a quarter of the collection. Oxford biology undergraduates meet the euphorbia early in their career. It is held up as a prime example of how remarkably well a single genus can adapt to different environments. Euphorbias can be found growing wild in English woods, Anatolian pastures, Russia (E. soongarica grows to six ft in one year), and the Himalayas. What cactuses are to the deserts of South America, euphorbias are to Africa's infernal regions. Botany students linger over the euphorbia as a taxonomic brain-teaser. In Walker's words, it is 'the flagship of the lumpers'. Taxonomical thought is divided into two camps. 'Splitters' argue for the ruthless division of large families, whereas the more genial 'lumpers' would like to leave well alone. The euphorbia, they maintain, is one vast family of about 2,000 true species, although some experts have numbered as many as 3,000. As for its sub-classification, the euphorbia still awaits a taxonomist with the stamina to come up with a wholly convincing arrangement. Taxonomic puzzles tend to leave gardeners cold. However, anyone with a taste for one-upmanship will enjoy acquiring the word 'cyathium', the correct name for the euphorbia's strange frogspawn-like 'flower'. It could even be useful to get a clear view of those whorling bracts, male glands, and more or less warty ovaries. They will reveal whether your E. characias is subspecies characias from the Mediterranean, sporting black male glands with short horns, or E. subsp. wulfenii from the east, with yellow glands and long horns. And yet, growing in the garden's demonstration beds is a handsome hybridised characias with glands which are neither eastern nor western, but somewhere in between. Part of the fascination of euphorbias is their promiscuity and variability. Rather like snowdrops and hostas, euphorbias are good news for the specialist nurseryman. At Oxford, would-be collectors of garden-worthy euphorbias get a useful start in deciding which of the selected forms is desirable or bearable. You have to be blessed with subtle colour sense to be able to place a fiery shocker like E. griffithii 'Dixter', and the various forms of 'polychroma' can be hard to take. Experienced gardeners will also spot thugs likely to stage a hostile take-over bid for any garden, notably 'cyparissias' and that evil little biennial 'stricta'. In autumn, some of the most brilliant plants in the garden are the euphorbias, especially villosa. This four-foot high floppy plant is staked in a masterly way using woven birch-prunings. This ingenious method was devised by Mr Robinson, the popular superintendant who held sway from 1942 to 1963 - a short career, given the legendary longevity of the Oxford garden's superintendants over 300 years. The current superintendant and his staff are working to conserve a remarkable euphorbia: stygiana. The rarest of them all, it grows on small craters in the Azores; the plant recently brought back to Oxford was one of only 10 specimens left in the wild. Rather surprisingly, this succulent, sprawling plant, with candy-pink stems, has adapted well to life by the river Cherwell. Students at the garden have managed to propagate it by air-layers, so it may not be long before the euphorbia's fans can try it for themselves. The Oxford University Botanic Garden's exhibit can be found at the educational end of the Great Marquee.</p>

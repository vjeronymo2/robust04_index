			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: DESIGNER'S HOME MAKES A STATEMENT  </P> <P> On a remote peak in Jamul, designer David Klages is building a house that  should someday rank him among San Diego's great architectural innovators.  </P> <P> For four years, Klages, who once made a living doing more conventional  landscape and building design, has dedicated himself to alternative modes of  construction.  </P> <P> First came a large dome house in Ramona. Its shell was made by spraying the  underside of an inflated fabric dome with "shotcrete," a material more commonly  known as stucco.  </P> <P> After completing that project in 1988, Klages and his wife, Donna, moved into a  mobile home on their hilltop acreage in Jamul, and Klages began designing and  building his dream house.  </P> <P> Framing took several months. Instead of conventional wood construction, Klages'  house is built around steel rebar and wire mesh. Walls consist of 6-inch-thick  polystyrene -- the lightweight stuff used to package electronics equipment --  sandwiched between 2-inch layers of shotcrete.  </P> <P> Building inspectors are doubtful when they first see Klages's designs, but they  rally after he shows them specifications prepared by his engineer proving that  the structures are several times stronger than they need to be.  </P> <P> Klages combines his creative construction ideas with a sensitive eye for  design. Tract housing typically covers terrain leveled by heavy equipment.  Klages likes to work his designs around nature.  </P> <P> "I see the house as a piece of sculpture that's grown out of these rocks," he  said, nodding toward several granite boulders. He's wrapping a swimming pool  around one of them, and he's designed his house around an old California live  oak.  </P> <P> To get there, you follow a rough dirt and asphalt road for a couple miles  before turning into his driveway, a narrow, ribbon of concrete which climbs  toward his peak at a breathtaking angle.  </P> <P> Klages gave a tour of the project while a stucco crew mixed a batch of  shotcrete.  </P> <P> He led a visitor up a dirt path, to the edge of the pool, currently just a pit  lined with a network of steel reinforcing. Behind the pool is the guest house,  where Klages and his wife plan to live until they can afford to build the main  house.  </P> <P> Its steel framework stood against the sky like the skeleton of some latter-day  Gothic cathedral, rebar and mesh bent to form curved walls rising to a pointed,  Gothic peak.  </P> <P> Klages decided not to use the inflatable dome method because his wife prefers  square and rectangular rooms, not the odd floor plans that domes produce  because they fail to easily accommodate conventional furniture.  </P> <P> The guest house will have two levels: an enclosed work space and an open  poolside entertainment area, including a fire pit, up top, and lower level  living quarters including a bedroom, bathroom and kitchen.  </P> <P> Windows in the side of the southern wall will capture spectacular views to  Mexico. Three sets of sliding doors will open onto a cantilevered deck which  juts precariously into a canyon like a giant diving board.  </P> <P> Klages plans to move into the guest house in three or four months. He guesses  he will have spent about $200,000 for the land, site preparation, roads and the  600-square-foot guest house.  </P> <P> Since the project is an experimental prototype, costs are not nearly as low as  they could be eventually.  </P> <P> "If we got this into mass production, costs would drop by probably 30%," Klages  said. "Then you save probably 50% on energy and 70% on maintenance. If you look  at a building over 30 years, mine won't need maintenance. It might need paint  in five years, but nothing will attack it -- mold, vermin, termites."  </P> <P> Klages said the house will be extremely efficient. The walls will keep  interiors warm during winter and cool during summer.  </P> <P> Windows are placed to catch low-angled winter sun. It will heat up floor tiles  inside, which will radiate warmth after the sun has set. The walls will help  keep the rooms warm, or, during summer, protect them from the heat outside.  </P> <P> The steel-and-concrete construction is also fireproof.  </P> <P> In the event of fire, "We will be the only ones here who will be able to relax  in the pool and watch everything around us burn," Klages said.  </P> <P> Not that the methods don't have drawbacks. Klages doesn't know how much the  walls might crack as the building settles. While he says the house should be  waterproof, it hasn't yet gone through several seasons of rain.  </P> <P> So far, there has been interest in Klages' building ideas, but no concrete  results, other than the two homes.  </P> <P> Through a friend's international consulting business, Klages proposed low-cost  shotcrete housing for Uganda and for a Navajo Indian reservation in Arizona,  but neither group opted for his innovative methods.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, banks -- generally not open to revolutionary designs which could  make loans more risky -- haven't closed their doors on Klages. The dome house  was built with conventional bank financing, he said. Klages is building the  guest house with a loan from a relative, but hopes a conventional lender will  finance the main house -- three telescoping structures resembling the guest  house.  </P> <P> Klages, 38, has studied the work of a variety of design innovators, including  San Diego designer and artist James Hubbell, whose mountain complex in Santa  Ysabel uses a steel mesh-and-concrete technique.  </P> <P> A self-taught designer, Klages left college to travel the world and read books  on his own. He began his career at 19 as a landscape designer. His heroes are  people like Wallace Neff, the Southern California architect of the '30s and  '40s best known for traditional home designs, but also the refiner of the  balloon-form technology Klages used as the basis for the dome house.  </P> <P> Such innovation takes a tremendous personal commitment. Klages doesn't seem  worried that his large investment in his home might not result in commissions,  or even a home that will retain its value in the conventional real estate  market.  </P> <P> There's a good chance his construction methods will never be accepted.  Certainly, most designers who experiment with alternative modes of building  never achieve widespread acceptance.  </P> <P> But Klages doesn't care whether he becomes famous.  </P> <P> "I like adventure, and I consider this adventure," he explained. "I went up the  Amazon, I danced on tables at Carnival in Rio, and I visited the ruins at  Macchu Picchu.  </P> <P> "To do experimental stuff is one of the hardest thing. You're resisted by every  agency. You have to really love it."  </P></p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kuwait delays completion of Opec's output cut deal STRONG DISAGREEMENT between Kuwait and other members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries over the wording of a final communique had by late yesterday prevented ministers from sealing a deal to cut production for the second quarter, after nearly four days of talks. Ministers have decided allocations for second quarter production that would cut output to slightly less than 23.6m barrels a day, that the cuts should in most instances be pro-rata and that the full reduction of just under 1m b/d from the first quarter ceiling should take effect on March 1. Kuwait has also said it is willing to pump 1.6m b/d, nearly 400,000 b/d less than its claimed output, under this basic agreement. But it also insisted yesterday that the communique should contain some form of proviso making clear that present output levels were temporary and reflected neither its eventual capacity, after full rebuilding of its damaged oil industry, nor its historic production levels. Iran and some other delegations, however, flatly rejected any such special mention for Kuwait and at least three proposed drafted wordings had failed to bring the parties closer by late last night. Almost all members believe it is vital for Opec to produce a unanimous agreement, with no stated reservations or exceptions, if their proposed output cut is to look fully credible. The row over the communique scotched momentum towards a deal that by late on Monday was enough to persuade the Saudi Arabian's to pack their bags ready to leave. The Algerian, Gabonese and Indonesian ministers all left on Monday saying the basis of a deal had been reached. But Kuwait was unwilling to budge after Mr Ali al-Baghli, the country's oil minister, was understood to have been given assent by Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti crown prince, to accept a level of 1.6m b/d only on condition that there be some formal Opec acknowledgement of the Gulf state's special status since the Gulf war. Several delegations were again settling their hotel bills ready to leave last night, and there was no little concern in some camps that Opec was taking so long to finalise a deal for which an apparent pre-meeting consensus had been so publicly trumpeted. Although a number of industry analysts attending the meeting said the proposed second quarter ceiling would be welcomed by the markets, if adhered to, many also felt that much further delay in finalising the deal cast familiar doubt on Opec's real internal discipline. However, Kuwait is determined that the present agreement should not be seen as somehow freezing the present accident of its lower overall output capacity.</p>

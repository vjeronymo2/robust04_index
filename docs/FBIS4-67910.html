			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, April 20 (HTC) -- In a cautiously worded,  handwritten note, an official spokesperson of the Government of  India today sought to clarify the report on the Agni missile  plan being temporarily capped, which appeared in this newspaper  today.    While describing the report as ``unfounded and baseless,''  the note asserted that ``after the recent successful flight of  Agni, all the objectives set for this mission have been  achieved.'' This, in fact, suggests that the project is being  abandoned altogether, whereas the HT report had only said it was  being put on hold for the present.    While not contradicting that the DRDO [Defense Research and  Development Organization] had been denied the [Indian Rupees] Rs  5 crore it had sought for conducting three more Agni test  flights, the official note says that fund requirements of  different departments are decided ``in relation to progress of  various projects. Individual scheme-wise allocation is not  undertaken at the Government level.''</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Asda - Pick of Lex / A selection of comments from this week's FT Asda's shares have outperformed the market by 34 per cent so far this year, the best performance of any FTSE 100 stock after British Steel and GKN, and better than all the food retailers except Morrison. Thursday's sparkling figures show why. Asda is enjoying a renaissance which has brought it back from the brink. Like-for-like sales growth rose 7.1 per cent in the first half, far better than other superstores and a considerable achievement in a competitive market. The performance reflects a full-scale revamp of Asda'a offering, as well as price-cutting. The latter led to an 0.5 per cent fall in gross margins, significantly worse than at competitors such as J. Sainsbury or Tesco. This, however, was more than offset by a combination of greater productivity and increased sales volumes. The result is that operating profits at the Asda stores rose at more than twice the rate of sales growth. The muted market reaction to Thursday's numbers reflects some disquiet about Asda's falling depreciation charge. But the real issue is whether Asda is becoming just another well-run food retailer, rather than a recovery story. Its three-year restructuring programme comes to an end next summer. Thereafter, earnings growth will slow. In the meantime, investors' preferences are likely to shift to the dull performers in the sector - for example, Sainsbury.</p>

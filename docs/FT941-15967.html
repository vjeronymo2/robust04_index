			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: French spectacles group seeks fresh investment Chauvin, the French spectacles manufacturer, plans to raise capital by bringing in institutional investors in order to finance expansion. Mr Bernard Chauvin, whose family owns 80 per cent of the company, said he hoped to attract institutional investment to accelerate Chauvin's development and to reduce debts. Chauvin recently bought the spectacles division of Smith &amp; Nephew in the UK and has taken control of Ankerpharm, a spectacles manufacturer in eastern Germany. Ankerpharm made had sales of FFr140m (Dollars 24m) last year and the old Smith &amp; Nephew business mustered turnover of FFr65m. Mr Chauvin said the two companies were not as profitable as Chauvin, but that both had great potential. Chauvin, which has invested heavily in expanding its French research and development facilities by ploughing FFr80m into the construction of a new research centre at Montpellier, saw net profits fall to an estimated FFr30m last year from FFr38m in 1992. Mr Chauvin said he expected acquisitions to contribute to a sharp increase in turnover this year, with sales rising to about FFr580m against an estimated FFr345m for 1993.</p>

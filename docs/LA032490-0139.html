			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CHP GOLD ZEROES IN ON SPEEDING TRUCKS  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol officials in Santa Ana on Friday unveiled a new,  well-disguised squad car that they hope will help slow down speeding big-rig  trucks.  </P> <P> The new car, which is painted gold with white doors instead of the traditional  black-and-white, is one of 16 Highway Patrol cars being deployed up and down  the state.  </P> <P> The cars will be driven by CHP officers in full uniform.  </P> <P> Injury and fatal accidents in which a truck driver was at fault have climbed by  nearly 68%, from 3,320 in 1982 to 5,565 in 1988, according to the CHP.  </P> <P> In 1987, the CHP conducted a yearlong pilot program in which specially marked  vehicles were assigned to five freeway segments with heavy truck traffic,  including Santa Ana and Westminster. State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim)  authored legislation ordering the study. The program reduced the number of  truck-caused injury accidents by 11.2% compared to the previous year. Fatal  accidents caused by trucks dropped 33%.  </P></p>

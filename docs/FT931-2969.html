			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Italian Liberal leader steps down: Party chief accused of receiving illicit funds denies any wrongdoing THE LEADER of Italy's Liberal party resigned yesterday. He is the third party head in a month forced to step down as a result of being implicated in the corruption scandals that have rocked the country. Mr Renato Altissimo's move came after he was warned on Monday he was under investigation by Milan magistrates for allegedly receiving L50m (Dollars 32,000) in illicit funds from Enel, the national electricity authority. Mr Altissimo, who denied any wrongdoing, was one of 10 parliamentarians advised this week they were under investigation over Enel payments. The small Liberal party is a partner in the four-party government coalition led by prime minister Giuliano Amato, but Mr Altissimo's decision is not expected to affect its stability. Nevertheless, it underlines again the extent to which the corruption scandal is eroding the credibility of the traditional parties and removing well-known figures from public life. Already Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, and Mr Giorgio La Malfa of the Republicans have had to step down after being accused of accepting illegal payments. Mr Amato again came under fierce attack in parliament yesterday. In chaotic scenes in the Chamber of Deputies, Mr Amato was frequently interrupted by members from the neo-fascist MSI party and Lombard League as he concluded the debate on how to confront the crisis caused by the corruption allegations. He urged parliament to adopt a bipartisan approach to dealing with corruption. But it was still unclear how the parties would agree on legislation to achieve a political solution to the corruption scandals. In another development Milan magistrates began yesterday to leak excerpts of a confession by Mr Gabriele Cagliari, head of Eni, the state energy and chemical company, arrested a week ago. He is said to have confirmed that Eni made illicit payments to political parties before he took over in 1990 and during his period as chairman. The magistrates have long regarded Eni as the heart of the system of illicit party funding. The scale of parliamentary involvement in the scandal has also been underlined this week by action by other magistrates in Naples and Reggio Calabria. In Naples three deputies are now under investigation in a new scandal over the privatisation of rubbish collection. The deputies include Mr Giulio Di Donato, the leading Socialist in Naples, and Mr Raffaele Mastrantuono, a Socialist and a member of the parliamentary commission charged with assessing whether to waive the immunity of members implicated in the scandals. At the same time Mr Riccardo Misasi, a deputy and key figure in the Christian Democrat power structure of southern Italy, has been accused of corruption and links with the Mafia over contracts in Reggio Calabria. Another new investigation has been opened with potentially far-reaching consequences - this time into the affairs of the agricultural finance consortium, Federconsorzi, which collapsed with huge debts in 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 (AFP)--Beijing denounced Friday  the meeting in Washington between President Bill Clinton and  Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, as "severe  interference" in China's internal affairs.    "The meeting ran counter to the position of recognising  Tibet  as a part of China's territory, which the United States has  repeatedly asserted, and constitutes a severe interference in  China's internal affairs," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.  According to the White House, Clinton joined a meeting Thursday  between the Dalai Lama and Vice President Al Gore to discuss  efforts to initiate a dialogue with the Chinese leadership on  the future of Tibet.    The meeting had gone ahead "despite the repeated  representations and opposition of the Chinese government," the  spokesman said.    "We demand that the US side keep up its commitment to  recognising Tibet as a part of China...and refrain from taking  actions which may undermine Sino-US relations," he added.  Chinese communist forces moved into Tibet in 1951 and took  control of the Himalayan region. The United States has  repeatedly cited the example of Tibet when criticising the human  rights situation in China.    The spokesman also slammed the passage through the U.S.  Congress of a foreign operations bill that grants 30 million  dollars for the creation of a U.S. radio network to broadcast  into China, including Tibet, and other Asian nations. The real  motive behind the establishment of Radio Free Asia "is to make  use of the media to interfere in the domestic affairs of China  and other Asian countries," the spokesman said. "The move by  the US Congress constitutes an encroachment upon the universally  acknowledged basic norms governing international relations."    Together with progress in human rights, one of Clinton's  preconditions for the renewal in June of China's preferential  trading status is allow foreign radio broadcasts into the  country.    China has repeatedly blocked Voice of America broadcasts in  the past.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL SITE LAND SALE  </P> <P> The emergence of a controversy over the sale of school lands after 11 years  (July 7) is both amazing and amusing. As the owner of a home adjacent to the  parcel in question, which is known as "Horse Flats," I offer a few  observations.  </P> <P> In fairness to the school board, the sale of the majority of the land seemed  appropriate to most observers at the time. The specter of forced busing for  racial balance was upon us. Enrollments were falling as residents shifted to  private schools. The board contemplated elaborate transportation plans to meet  the court requirements. The giant high school complex planned for the site  seemed unnecessary and would surely have complicated the busing plan, as it  would have been located in a corner of the city, in an almost all white area,  with only one access road.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the board made some obvious errors. As should be clear from  its name, the Porter Ranch Development Co. planned to develop the land, which  means that everyone involved should have anticipated additional children in the  area, and the board should have reserved sufficient land for at least an  elementary school.  </P> <P> Then there is the issue of the sale price. The sale was not well advertised.  The post-sale announcement, which was very small itself, came as a complete  surprise to most local residents. Even with the negative effects of the busing  on the attractiveness of the area, home prices were rising rapidly. Horse Flats  was the last large parcel of essentially flat land left in the city.  </P> <P> Considering both of these factors, I believe that almost anyone who was given  sufficient notice that the land would be sold for only $1.5 million could have  assembled the resources to purchase it. Alternatively, a well promoted sale  would have led to a substantially higher price.  </P> <P> ARTHUR SCHUETZ  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

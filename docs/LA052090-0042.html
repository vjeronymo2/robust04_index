			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I enjoyed "The Andrew Lloyd Webber Story." PBS did an excellent job in going  behind the scenes to talk to the British composer of such mega-hit musicals. I  loved the excerpts from "Evita," "Cats," and "Phantom of the Opera."  </P> <P> Mayvelyn Diaz, Glendale  </P></p>

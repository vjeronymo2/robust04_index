			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CLARIFYING A CONTROVERSY'  </P> <P> Your editorial doesn't resolve the problem. Middle-income American retirees  have great concern over long-term health care, nursing home needs, and if  healthy, senior housing at an affordable price. None of these are being  addressed. That's why there is "the rage" to which you refer in your opening  sentence. We want to live out our senior years in dignity and self-worth. The  alternative is a fear based on hard evidence when friends and neighbors are  caught in catastrophic illness. In such circumstances, we dread the possibility  of assets spent and relief available only as penniless dependents.  </P> <P> Taxing seniors on levels of tax returns fails to take into account all the  factors that impact on middle America. It's double taxation at work, too.  Retirement incomes were gathered after prior taxation while working. And in  most cases, these incomes are not tied to inflationary trends. That was why a  cost-of-living index was tied to Social Security payments. And after being  given, taken away by taxation on Social Security, and now on Medicare.  </P> <P> Older Americans support health care for the "37 million Americans who have no  health insurance of any kind." That this condition exists rests with Congress.  Don't blame our social needs for this failure.  </P> <P> I find whatever "controversy" that has been created comes from an unwillingness  to grapple with reality. There can be resolution of the problem(s). Reduce  waste. Cut budgets of a military-industrial complex whose appetite has no  stomach for more humane aspirations. Or let's learn to have lips that read,  "taxes."  </P> <P> HYMAN H. HAVES  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

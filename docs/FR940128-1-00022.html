			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed adoption of this rule is supported by several additional factors. First, as stated above, the application of HACCP to the seafood industry has been the subject of a substantial amount of work, by the Federal government, some States, academia, and the seafood industry itself, to develop specific HACCP models and otherwise to apply HACCP to seafood processing and importation. The Model Seafood Surveillance Project (MSSP) was conducted by NOAA at the request of Congress in 1986 to design an inspection system for seafood consistent with HACCP principles. This project resulted in the development of 16 regulatory models for specific seafood products that describe the basis for a mandatory seafood inspection system. Each model applies many of the NACMCF principles described above in the context of a specific product, such as breaded shrimp, raw fish, and molluscan shellfish (Ref. 35, pp. 67 to 73).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MSSP was conducted with significant industry involvement. The importance of industry participation in the development of HACCP systems was stressed by NAS in its 1985 study of HACCP (Ref. 36, pp. 13, 309, and 310). As part of the MSSP project, 49 workshops were conducted involving 1,200 industry, State, and university participants. HACCP controls were considered for economic fraud and plant sanitation/hygiene as well as for safety because economic fraud and sanitation have been problems in the seafood industry. The MSSP models cover nearly all the types of seafood products consumed in the United States except for low acid canned seafood, which is already subject to a mandatory HACCP control and inspection system under the low acid canned food regulations adopted by FDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Low acid canned seafood products represent about 25 percent of all seafoods consumed in the United States (Ref. 7, p. 23). The regulatory system in place for them represents the first formal application of HACCP principles to food by a regulatory agency. As with this proposal, the regulations for low acid canned foods were requested by industry, and they were developed through cooperation between Government and industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the low acid canned food regulations apply HACCP concepts to two hazards only, i.e., botulism in canned foods and contamination because of poor container integrity, they are regarded as a major success and demonstrate the benefits that HACCP can provide. Botulism in canned goods has been effectively controlled under the low acid canned food regulations and is no longer a particular source of consumer concern. NAS recently concluded that canned fish is among the safest of seafood items. (Ref. 7, p. 320).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seafood industry associations have been active in developing HACCP systems that their members could use. For the past several years, the New England Fisheries Development Association (NEFDA) has been assisting firms in the northeast to implement HACCP systems through Federal grants. NEFDA's activities include a pilot project for 15 processing firms and participation in a retail seafood HACCP pilot (Ref. 18, p. 26).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Academia has been active as well. For example, the Oregon Sea Grant, which services the Oregon marine community as part of the national Sea Grant extension service, has issued a publication, ``Hazard Analysis &amp; Critical Control Point Applications to the Seafood Industry'' (Ref. 37). This publication explains the fundamentals of HACCP, inventories microbial hazards of seafoods, and describes model HACCP systems for specific types of seafood processing operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of efforts like these by Government, industry, and academia, a considerable amount of literature and expertise now exist to facilitate the development of HACCP systems by seafood processors and importers, significantly more than for most other major segments of the food industry. Given the advanced state of knowledge about the application of HACCP to the seafood industry, FDA is proposing to make the use of HACCP mandatory for the seafood industry to ensure that there is compliance with section 402(a)(1) and 402(a)(4) of the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, seafood industry representatives have been urging the Federal Government to adopt a mandatory, HACCP-based system for years. The National Fisheries Institute, the largest seafood industry trade association, and others from the seafood industry testified repeatedly at congressional hearings from 1989 through 1992 in support of legislation that would mandate such a system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indeed, nearly all of the seafood bills introduced in the Congress since the late 1980's, including the bills that passed both chambers in 1990, contained HACCP elements. While there were different views on the merits of these legislative proposals, virtually all Government agencies, both Federal and State, that testified on these proposals_as well as most other witnesses_expressed support for the HACCP concept as it applies to seafood. The Chairman of the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference (ISSC), an organization of States, Federal agencies, and industry that considers issues relating to molluscan shellfish safety, testified that a HACCP-type approach is now being used for aspects of the shellfish program and endorsed HACCP for all seafood.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Significant elements of the seafood industry continue to press for the Federal Government to institute a HACCP-based program. An article in a 1992 edition of a seafood trade publication on the advantages of HACCP concluded: ``With the seafood industry under a continuing barrage of negative press regarding the wholesomeness and safety of product, the industry is impatient to get started with a seafood inspection program that will reassure consumers *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Ref. 19, p. 39).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In February, 1993, the Executive Vice President of the National Fisheries Institute wrote to the Secretary of Health and Human Services asking that she ``initiate a state-of-the-art program for seafood which would be of significant benefit to consumers * * *. HACCP-based regulation is very feasible for the seafood industry * * *. There is no reason to wait for congressional action to put this modern technology in place'' (Ref. 38). As recently as April, 1993, the President of the Pacific Seafood Processors wrote to FDA expressing support for a mandatory seafood HACCP program (Ref. 39). The members of that organization process the majority of domestically harvested seafood. These requests provide further evidence of the appropriateness of this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

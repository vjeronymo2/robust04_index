			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Fraud protection urged for home banking clients BANKS SHOULD be forced to accept liability for unauthorised transfers of money from the 1m accounts operated remotely from homes and offices by computers, the Consumers' Association said yesterday. It said that the committee reviewing the code of practice for banks, headed by Sir George Blunden, should introduce an amendment to ensure that banks take responsibility for cases where money is transferred wrongly because of mechanical failure or computer hacking. The code, which is to be amended from next March after two years of operation, at present allows banks to make customers sign clauses which indemnify the bank against responsibility for computer errors and fraud, said the association. Bank of Scotland, which was a pioneer in home banking with its Home and Office Banking System (Hobs), said it disclaimed responsibility for losses due to the failure of equipment, or 'circumstances not reasonably within the bank's control'. The association said that the 1989 Jack Committee on banking conduct had excluded home banking from its draft code, but there were now 1m users of a growing service and it was time that banks were made liable for unauthorised transactions. It criticised banks for their approach to the code as a set of guidelines rather than a commitment to customers. This was 'misconceived and out of step with thinking in other parts of the services sector'. The association said that the code should also be amended to ensure that all banks pre-notify charges to customers - a service provided by Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank, National Westminster, TSB Group and Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building Society. Ms Jean Eaglesham, the association's head of money policy, said customers were 'fed up to the back teeth' with banks 'dipping into their accounts without notice to extract charges and interest'. All banks should include interest charges among the 'charges on charges' which are barred by the code in cases where a customer is forced into overdraft by other account charges, the association said. However, Barclays, Lloyds and Midland said they did not believe there was a strong demand from personal customers for charges to be pre-notified. All said they had had few complaints.</p>

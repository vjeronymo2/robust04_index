			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Trade partners close together yet so far apart 'THERE have been more near-misses on this than Bosnian ceasefires,' a senior US diplomat observed recently. He wondered how it was that while the EC and US share an interest in concluding Gatt's Uruguay Round world trade talks and are seemingly near in their positions, they are still separated by what each sees as vital national interests. On subsidies to farmers, an issue that has held up agreement since the Uruguay Round summit collapsed in Brussels in December 1990, the US, EC and other leading agri-exporters are trying to position themselves in export markets, especially cereals. France threatened to pull out of next Friday's EC summit in Birmingham if the latest EC-US talks in Brussels gave away to the US too much of its food exporting 'vocation'. As the EC's agricultural superpower, France has concentrated its attack on a Gatt provision to cut subsidised food exports 24 per cent on all products. This would be a blow to its wheat trade, the most sensitive commodity for the US alongside soya beans, on which it is conducting a parallel row with the EC. The need to cut subsidised exports, contained in the Round's 'final act' which Gatt drew up last December, is separate to, and on top of, a 36 per cent cut in money paid out on export subsidies. At July's Group of Seven Munich summit, the UK proposed export volume be cut by 21, not 24 per cent. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, has pushed for 'aggregation' or flexibility in farm sectors. This way the EC could export more wheat, for instance, if it sold less barley abroad, provided overall cuts in grain exports reached the target. The full 24 per cent cut, if it contains this flexibility, is a much better deal for the EC than a far lower cut without it. The US knows this, and that the reform of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), agreed in May, will cut European wheat prices to near world market levels. The real difference between the two sides on export volume is about competition, and French wheat is very competitive. If May's CAP reform had cut guaranteed prices a bit further, export subsidies would have been scrapped well within the life of any Uruguay Round agreement, and the US would have been hard pressed to seek restraints on EC exporters. France would have been the main beneficiary from a slightly bigger cut. The second big difference to be resolved is for how long EC compensation payments to farmers for the CAP reform price cuts will be exempt from reductions prescribed by Gatt. Mr MacSharry wants indefinite exemption, because the payments are compensation for price cuts and production cuts. The US, if the cuts in output are formalised, is ready to exempt the payments for only six years. It is still possible Mr MacSharry might relent if the point is established that if these payments do cut output and reduce trade tensions, they should be exempt in the next round of cuts.</p>

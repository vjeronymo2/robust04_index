			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / US Treasury urges reform of corporate tax THE US Treasury has outlined new ideas for transforming the corporate tax system to eliminate the bias that drives companies to finance themselves through debt rather than equity. In a study on the integration of individual and corporate tax systems, the Treasury suggests that reform could generate savings of up to Dollars 25bn (Pounds 13.7bn) a year for the US economy by increasing corporate capital by as much as Dollars 500bn and reducing corporate debt ratios by up to 7 percentage points. The distortion arises from the fact that the US, unlike most other developed countries, taxes corporate dividends twice over: once as the company's profits and a second time as the shareholder's income. Interest payments, on the other hand, may be deducted from taxable income by the company. While the Treasury stops short of recommending any specific legislation to change the current system, the report argues that simply excluding dividends from shareholders' taxable income would be the easiest way of stopping the double taxation. This approach is gaining support in academic circles, because it ends the double taxation of dividends while avoiding the pitfalls of systems in countries such as the UK, France and Germany where corporate income tax is by various means imputed to the shareholder. It would cost Dollars 13.1bn a year in lost tax revenue, the Treasury estimates, but this would still be less expensive than an imputation system. A much more ambitious reform entitled the Comprehensive Business Income Tax (CBIT), however, would bring greater economic benefits, the report says, although it would also be more complicated to introduce. The CBIT proposal would involve taxing corporate income before either dividend distributions or interest payments, thereby treating debt and equity capital equally. Because the tax would be levied on a broader base, the Treasury says the corporate tax rate could be lowered from 34 per cent today to 31 per cent, while still raising the same amount of revenue. The proposal would also end the discrimination against retained earnings.</p>

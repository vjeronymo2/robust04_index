			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Timurovich Gaydar by unidentified </F> correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] What is your forecast for the  economic development of the country for, at any rate, the next  six months?    [Gaydar] I do not think that the newly formed government  will  be so unwise as to completely destabilize the financial and  monetary situation over the next few months. Therefore, I do  not fear an imminent economic catastrophe with hyperinflation  and collapse of the levers of market control of the economy. I  know my colleagues to be quite cautious people and I think that  they are now to a very great extent concerned not to allow  events to develop in that way.    But there is something else which I greatly fear. I fear  constant fluctuations in economic policy, the adoption of  contradictory decisions, the government undertaking financial  obligations, under the influence of various lobbying structures,  which will prove to be impractical, the constant creation of  financial crises, and rates of inflation rising and slightly  falling around a level of 20-25 percent per month. That is, to  put it briefly, the reappearance of that situation which is  neither one thing nor the other in which market instruments are  not totally destroyed but cannot work in a way conducive to  economic development -- the preservation of that extremely  unpleasant and unstable situation between a normal planned  economy and a normal stable market economy which continues to  exist in Russia and which costs us dear in social and economic  terms.    [Correspondent] Yegor Timurovich, these fluctuations which  are indeed very tiring and annoying to the population have  existed for a long time, for many months. They existed when you  were in the government, also. Why have you decided to depart,  so definitely to depart, precisely now?    [Gaydar] Indeed, the policy which has been conducted in  Russia was rather integrated and consistent during the first  half of 1992, the first half-year of the work of our government.  Afterwards the policy was always a compromise one, it was  always formed under the influence of various groups, and we  continued to conduct this policy, among other reasons because we  wanted to make the changes irreversible, we wanted to move  market regulation forwards as far as possible into the tissue of  Russia's real economic life.    Over the past year and a half in the work of the government  and the organs of Russian power there was a fight between two  different tendencies. On the surface it was manifested as a  combat between inflationists and supporters of financial  stabilization, between those who considered that the main thing  was to halt the rise in prices and those who believed that it is  possible in some way to raise the volume of production when  there is galloping inflation.    But I think that the main thing was something else, the  question of the role of the state in Russian society. Our  policy has always been oriented towards an economical, small,  modest state where officials are few, where they do not enjoy  too many rights as far as personal allocation of resources is  concerned, and where their work is strictly supervised by the  law. Another line envisaged a large, plentiful state which  interferes extensively in economic life, where officials have  broad opportunities to take personal decisions -- for example,  to grant credits on preferential terms, subsidies, quotas,  licenses -- in a word, to do things at their discretion. We  allocate enormous credits on preferential terms to agriculture,  we spend crazy amounts of money -- even now, after preferential  crediting has been abolished -- on subsidizing interest payments  for the credits granted in 1993, and in the meantime this money  goes to a large extent, not into agriculture but to the currency  exchange, on hard currency speculation. This is what it is all  about.    Well, it recently became clear to me lately that we cannot  consistently defend our viewpoint any longer -- for instance,  decisions such as that on the construction of a parliamentary  center worth sums of money simply incomparable with the amounts  allocated to many of the most important branches of the economy  -- with this money we could solve the problem of the dumping of  liquid radioactive waste into the Pacific Ocean 20 times over;  or take the decision on setting up the ruble zone with Belarus  -- this is a manifestation of the policy chosen, of a certain  turn in economic policy. The blueprints for a large, plentiful,  and expensive state have already been clearly laid out. This is  unacceptable to me on principle, I simply do not think that this  is for the good of Russia; therefore, I had to leave.    [Correspondent] Yegor Timurovich, if we are talking in terms  of huge amounts of money spent on preferential credits and so  on, does this not turn out to be one of the main sources of  inflation, and not at all of developing production etc?    [Gaydar] Of course, preferential credits were one of the  major sources of inflation in 1992-93.    The money that we allocated to these needs cannot really be  compared with much else. There's nothing in Russia with which  to compare it, apart from defense expenditure.    [Correspondent] But Viktor Stepanovich [Chernomyrdin] has  just said that there will be no more handouts and that easy  credit will be ended. As far as I know, it was ended precisely  when you came into the government in September.    [Gaydar] That's quite right.    [Interviewer] Right, so there will be no more easy handouts,  and so on. Admittedly, it is necessary to return debts to the  agro-industrial and military-industrial complex and elsewhere,  and, at the same time, it is necessary to boost production. Is  it realistic to combine these aims?    [Gaydar] Well, it seems to me that it's extremely hard to  do.  The problem of the state's debts is primarily a problem of  inability to precisely match up one's possibilities and  requirements. When people talk of economic romanticism or  financial romanticism, that's a rather strange term to me.  After all, if romanticism is a clear-cut desire to live  according to one's means, then apracticism [apraktitsizm] is the  wish to handle non-existent money. So this somewhat alters my  traditional approach to the use of these terms. Perhaps you will  excuse me for making use of a character who is traditional in  Russian culture. Professor Preobrazhenskiy [a character in  Bulgakov's play "A Dog's Heart"] used to point out that, if one  regularly missed the toilet, the toilet would be a shambles. A  financial shambles is simply the result of the constant adoption  of decisions that are not backed by real sources of finance.  Until such decisions are taken by the government and  legislative bodies, we will still have a shambles in Russian  finances, our ruble will be weak, and the state will constantly  seek to justify itself to one group after another for having  debts.    [Correspondent] Yegor Timurovich, your decision to go is  probably, nevertheless, a political decision first and foremost,  and I think that it is also linked to the setback suffered in  the elections by the Russia's Choice bloc that you lead.    [Gaydar] Undoubtedly. Of course, I must say honestly that  the results of the elections on 12 December came as a very  serious blow to me, because they put a question mark for me over  the axiom that I have always taken as a starting point in my  life and work. That is the axiom that we have a reasonable and  rational people, full of common sense. I found it very hard to  understand how my fellow citizens, men and women, could vote for  a party that is preparing to send their children off to fight in  Turkey and Iran.    On the other hand, one must understand the realities. Our  country has passed through vast and very serious social changes,  a cataclysm. The whole way of life is changing. It really is  very hard. Nevertheless, after some thought, I came to the  conclusion and conviction that this is only a short-term  black-out of reason.    I am absolutely convinced that common sense is very deeply  rooted in Russia and that it will be triumphant, that people  really do not want wars or military adventures or new  revolutions. They want a normal, calm life. They want a  normal, calm life; they do want everyone to be turned into  entrepreneurs; they do not need that. In a normal, calm life in  a market economy, the overwhelming number of people simply work  normally and calmly and live on their perfectly adequate wages.    Russian big business, including the new businesses, is  essentially divided on questions of economic policy. This big  business includes structures and people who have a stake in  being closely linked with the state apparatus, who have a stake  in decisions being taken by individuals, who have a stake in the  allocation of advantageous resources in one form or another and  of course who, categorically, have no interest in financial  stabilization.    [Correspondent] Excuse me, Yegor Timurovich, advantageous  decisions taken by individuals -- this is, simply speaking, when  a specific person...    [Gaydar, interrupting] Simply speaking, this is when there  is  an official sitting at a table with a long line of people in  front of him. People come to see him, and as a result he can  sign a paper, a quota, for example. Such a quota is worth $5,  10, or 15 million, and he decides who among these hundred people  in the line gets 5 millions, who gets 7 million, who gets 10  million, and who gets nothing. I think that there can be no  situation more conducive to corruption. I cannot imagine any  state apparatus set up without fear or reproach which will not  take bribes in such a situation.    [Correspondent] I see. This is the part of business which  you tried to wage war on.    [Gaydar] I did not try to wage war on it but I tried to wage  war on behalf of a policy which rules out these forms of  enrichment. But there is, of course, another side to Russian  business. That is the side which is oriented toward the  long-term aim, which well understands that such a form of  business is a dead end, for the country at least, which in  effect asks for one thing: Give us stable conditions in which  to work, give us predictable and comprehensible rates of  inflation, give us a firm ruble, give us taxes which are not  probitively high -- and these prohibitively high taxes are a  direct result of the state's handing out so much on an  individual basis -- and in general we will cope with our  problems, ourselves. That is the side of Russian business which  in my view supports the wise policy which is the only possible  policy for Russia if we really want to bring our country out  onto a normal path of development.    [Correspondent] It is difficult to imagine a party which  would go into the elections with a program that declared: We  are creating a state in which bureaucrats allocate vast  favorable credits for commercial banks under the pretext of  supporting production. Usually the program looks different and,  as far as I know, it is always other words which are used, words  about national greatness, about the renaissance of the Soviet  Union and so on. That is, the more, let us say, complicated the  real policies and the real interests behind it are, the finer  the slogans sound. As far as I know you had virtually no such  fine slogans during the election campaign.    [Gaydar] You are right. Usually, such a policy proposing the  strict combination of interests of corrupt officialdom and parts  of the domestic bourgeoisie uses as a cover slogans of national  greatness or national imperial slogans. If internal policy is  impossible to defend, in frank talk, in frank discussion, they  always try to sway people with the chimera of imperial  greatness, and as far as the chimera of imperial greatness is  concerned, it is quite a simple matter; it should be remembered  that the Soviet Union collapsed when the monetary system  collapsed, when the Soviet ruble began to be worthless. Ukraine  ran away from it, everybody ran away from it. And as soon as,  with all the inconsistency of our policy, the ruble became  convertible, as soon as signs of stability arose, they reached  out to Russia, lines formed of those wanting to deal with us,  wanting to create a common economic space, and attitudes to  integration with Russia changed immediately and radically.  Unfortunately, defeat in the elections on 12 December  objectively stopped us from resolving these tasks. In the end,  we lost the battle but I am convinced that we will win the war.</p>

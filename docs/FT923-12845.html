			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Belling pension fund probe widens THE INVESTIGATION into the loss of Pounds 2.1m from the pension fund of Belling, the cooker manufacturer which went into receivership last May, has widened to include two companies linked to Mr Clive J Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur who faces legal actions over his natural resource investments. The first company is Finchley Investments, the Isle of Man company administered from Jersey, which Mr Smith has often used to handle some of his investments. The second is Western &amp; Pacific, a Canadian mining group. It was 57.4 per cent owned by Mr Smith and his family through Finchley and another company, Newsham Investments, in May 1991. Last summer, Belling tried to arrange a Dollars 50m (Pounds 26m) capital injection through Global Prospect Funding. In advance of the deal, Belling paid Global Pounds 2.1m as the first year's interest. The company borrowed the money from its pension fund. In April this year, when the Dollars 50m was not forthcoming, Belling demanded security. Global introduced Finchley Investments which put up shares in Western &amp; Pacific. Belling believed the shares were worth CDollars 1.75m (Pounds 760,000). However, today they are estimated to be worth Pounds 200,000. The Law Debenture Society, the new independent trustee of the pension fund, is investigating the fund shortfall and trying to recoup the money. Global is administered by Mr C J Deacon, a solicitor based in Newcastle-under-Lyme. He is believed to be helping the society in trying to recover the money. One of the shareholders in Finchley was Mr Kelvin Myles, who ran the offices of Bryant &amp; Co, the Jersey accountant which was raided this spring by Jersey fraud office. Documents found at Bryant &amp; Co have triggered a Serious Fraud Office investigation into share dealings in Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and Butte Mining, two companies which Mr Smith had helped float. Bryant &amp; Co also managed some of Mr Smith's off-shore interests. Mr Smith, who also has offices in Newcastle-under-Lyme, was unavailable for comment. He faces litigation from Butte Mining and Sun Glow of the US. Butte alleges fraud and misrepresentation by more than 70 defendants. Sun Glow is seeking Dollars 450,000 from Mr Smith allegedly arising from a personal guarantee. Mr Smith said recently he would contest both actions.</p>

During the meeting the American side briefed the Palestinian  side on the results of the meeting of U.S. President Bill  Clinton with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad the day before  yesterday in Geneva.    After the meeting Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi said that the  Palestinian side stressed to the American side that any progress  along the Syrian or other tracks tends to create progress in the  remaining tracks. She added that the Palestinian leadership is  committed to a comprehensive solution, and there must be Arab  coordination and a complementary stance on this process along  all the tracks.    The Palestinian side told the U.S. peace team that the  United  States should play a more effective role in the negotiations.    Dr. Sa'ib Urayqat who was present at the meeting said that  long discussions took place about the negotiations in Taba and  the problems which stand in their way as a result of the  intransigent Israeli attitude on its method of explaining its  concepts and its understanding of the American role in the peace  process.    Dr. Urayqat said: We have explained the suffering of the  people of the occupied territories as a result of Israeli  practices, also the absorption operations and the seizure of  land. We stressed to the American envoy that the continuation  of Israeli practices over the land has made the peace process  lose its credibility.    On the Palestinian side, the meeting was attended by Dr.  Hanan Ashrawi, Dr. Sa'ib Urayqat, Dr. Nabil Qassis, Dr. Kamil  al-'Isawi, the lawyer Ziyad Abu-Ziyad, and sister Ahlam 'Abbasi.</p>

			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Travel: First stop, Santiago. Destination, heaven - Nicholas Woodsworth embraces the icon of St James of Compostela after following a trail worn by the faithful for centuries East from the gates and church towers of Carrion de los Condes, the N-120 runs arrow-straight over the red-soiled, table-top-flat plain of Spanish Castile. It is a quiet road these days; often there is not a car, a house, a person or any sign of life to be seen, even to the treeless horizon. It is a road built for speeding. Without my noticing it, my speedometer crept well over the limit. And still I felt I was crawling. Where was Santiago? I was feeling impatient, tired and, in spite of my destination, profane. I had been driving for two days from Arles in southern France, and was still 350km short of my goal. I had wanted to arrive before dark. As a result, they went by in a flash. I hardly noticed them until they were in my rear-view mirror - two middle-aged men in walking boots, trudging along the roadside with packs on their backs and staffs in their hands. In seconds they were faint dots of colour picked out by the evening sun; then they were nothing. But they stayed in my mind. Like me, these men were on their way to Santiago de Compostela. Unlike me, they were pilgrims, and they were walking. For them this was not just the N-120. This was the old route of the Camino de Santiago, the way of Saint James - for millions in the Middle Ages the most important and challenging pilgrim trail in Europe. It is still trudged by the faithful today. Had I walked from Arles - one of the four main points of pilgrim departure since the 12th century  - the trip would have taken me eight weeks. How far had those two middle-aged men come? Where would they spend the night? I did not know. But suddenly haste seemed less important. I slowed down and, many hours later than I expected, drove into the holy city at a contemplative doddle. I headed where pilgrims have headed for more than 500 years - the Hostal de Los Reyes Catolicos. It is, say some, the oldest hotel in the world, having been built as a pilgrim hostel by the Roman Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in that momentous year, 1492. However, I doubt if it was as comfortable then as it is now. It has kept all its renaissance elegance, a rich facade, and four dignified interior cloisters with fountains, gargoyles, stone pillars and arches. There is still a Gothic chapel and, overlooking it, a Sala de Agonizadas - a room where the sick and dying attended masses from their beds. Today, Los Reyes Catolicos is a parador. The pilgrims' cells have been converted into rooms and suites and the chapel given over to art exhibitions and musical concerts. The Sala de Agonizadas, due to its perfect acoustics, became for many years the favourite recital room for classical guitarist Andre Segovia. I slept in the hotel like a coddled king. The place still serves a charitable purpose, though: anyone presenting a compostela - a sort of pilgrim's passport showing stamped church authentication of the pilgrim route followed - is entitled to dine here free of charge. Had I been a pilgrim, I think, I would have been just as happy to get in from the wet weather as I would to eat. The rain in Spain is not on the plain at all, but in the Galician hills surrounding Santiago. So wet is this north-west Atlantic coast that the city's brief but repetitive showers have gained the title of the 'urinal of Spain'. So, first things first: off I rushed in the pelting rain and met Luis Sanchez Rivas, who owns a small, old-fashioned shop, a paragueria devoted exclusively to the sale of umbrellas. A precise, elderly man, he is in the same business as his father and grandfather before him. 'Sixty years ago it rained here a lot more,' he said as we reviewed a long row of solemn black umbrellas standing furled in glass-fronted cases. 'It hardly rains here at all now.' I looked doubtfully from the window into a street streaming with water. We were practically shouting at each other to be heard over the rain. Finally, I made the choice of a nifty collapsible number and stopped Senor Sanchez from wrapping it. 'In any case,' he said, handing the umbrella over, 'we like our rain here. You'll find it suits the city and its mood better than any other weather. There is nothing finer than walking through Santiago in a good Galician shower.' He was absolutely right. Santiago, for all its medieval magnificence - the entire old city has been declared a national monument - is a solemn and austere place of silvery rain, shifting, moody clouds and glistening grey stone. Despite the crowds of students and the gaggles of tourists, there is something grave and solemn about the great granite blocks from which the whole city is built; about the slow, heavy, dull ringing of the cathedral bells; about the seminaries, monasteries, archbishop's palaces, convents, chapels, cloisters and crypts that sit solidly and imperturbably at every turn in the street. This is a monochrome city, unaccepting of colour or the vanity of individualism. It is single-minded in construction and uniform in purpose - the submission of human achievement before a greater glory. I strolled the city for hours, wandering under stone arcades, stumbling across hidden plazas, admiring the clean Romanesque lines of its buildings. I marvelled to think of this sophisticated place built so long ago in a rainy and wild region so remote from the rest of Europe. What made Santiago such a magnet that in the 12th century, at a time when people rarely ventured far from home, the city was attracting over 500,000 pilgrims a year? Only faith could have done it. The legend of Saint James's burial in Spain seems to have very little basis, but that hardly seems to matter. What does matter is that for centuries millions have believed that a pilgrimage here virtually assured their passage to heaven. Due to the great power of Saint James, simply arriving here - not to mention the indulgences and remissions that could be picked up along the way - guaranteed a halving of time spent in purgatory. This was worth the considerable risks and hardships of the journey. And what about these days? 'It is as tough a walk now as it was eight centuries ago,' Canon Jaime Garcia Rodriguez told me when I dropped into the pilgrims' welcome centre. In 23 years of work in Santiago, the canon has met tens of thousands of pilgrims, some walking from as far away as Poland. Last year, a special year because the saint's day fell on a Sunday, more than 99,000 pilgrims received compostelas. And where does the pilgrim trail lead? I attended a pilgrims' mass at Santiago cathedral, and began to understand some of the reverence that has made James the patron saint of Spain, and has made Santiago, along with Rome and Jerusalem, one of the three holy cities of Christendom. Santiago's cathedral is huge, ornate, complex and riotously embellished. Inside, behind a facade decorated with some of the finest Romanesque sculpture in the world, is an altar even more lavish in style. At the heart of a fantasy of silver and gilt, cherubs and massive hanging chandeliers, is the silver and jewel-studded image of Saint James. It is an icon up to which every visitor climbs in order to bestow an embrace. Not a regular church-goer myself, not even a practising Christian, I did the same, and thought of the two pilgrims still slogging, tired but expectant, along an arrow-straight roadside somewhere in Castile.

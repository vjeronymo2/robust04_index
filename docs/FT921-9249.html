			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Letter: Thrilling Sir, Jurek Martin writes ('Authenticity reveals the clue', February 1) that one of the prerequisites of a good suspense novel is the ability of the writer to describe sex and violence. Why? Many of the best suspense novels and thrillers have little or no description of sex or violence: suspense and menace are much more important ingredients.

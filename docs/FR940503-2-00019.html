			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For report-based options in live hogs, the underlying futures contract will be the second-nearest futures contract to delivery. For example, the underlying futures contract for a report-based option that is listed in March in connection with the release of the March Hogs and Pigs report would be the June futures contract month. Similarly, the underlying futures contracts for the other report-based options to be listed during the calendar year are: the August futures contract month for the option listed during June; the December futures contract month for the option listed in September; and the April futures contract month for the option listed in December. The CME shall list initially, and thereafter maintain, put and call live hogs report-based options with strike prices at one-cent intervals in a range of six-cents above and below the previous day's settlement price of the underlying futures contract, and at two-cent intervals in a range 10 cents above and below the previous day's settlement price of the underlying futures contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The underlying futures contract months for pork bellies report-based options are: the May futures contract month for the option listed in March; the August futures contract month for the option listed in June; the February futures contract month for the option listed in September; and the March futures contract month for the option listed in December. The CME shall list initially and maintain pork bellies report-based put and call options at eleven strike prices listed in two-cent intervals, including the strike price that is nearest the previous day's settlement price of the underlying futures contract, and the next five higher, and the next five lower strike prices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendments will continue to specify the listing of the ``regular cycle'' of option contract months and the listing of strike prices for such months in the same manner as provided for in the contracts' existing terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In support of the proposed amendments, the CME states the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Options on futures allow hedgers to shield themselves from the adverse impact of a [``Hogs and Pigs''] report while retaining much of the ability to benefit from a favorable market response. However, for hedgers using options on the more distant contract months, the high cost of buying an option_due to the large time value component of the option premium_can outweigh the benefits of protection from an unfavorable market reaction. As a result, many potential hedgers are effectively priced out of the option market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Short-dated options would address this problem. Since these options would be traded for such a short time, the time value component of the option premium would be negligible, and therefore the total premium would be substantially less than for a traditional long-dated option, all other things being the same. This would make short-dated options an attractive risk-management tool for hedgers who require protection around the release of these critical reports, and particularly those whose usage of options is currently limited due to the cost of the premium. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, at the above address.

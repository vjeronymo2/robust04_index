			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITH 6 NEW PUPS, MILLIE GETS A COUPLE OF PATS  </P> <P> Two pups born to First Dog Millie may be named Patrick and Patricia in honor of  their arrival in the White House beauty parlor late on St. Patrick's Day, a  spokeswoman for First Lady Barbara Bush said.  </P> <P> Over a five-hour period, ending early Saturday, the English springer spaniel  delivered a six-pack.  </P> <P> The delivery of Millie's first litter -- five females and a male -- brought a  tear to the eyes of the First Lady and the President, Mrs. Bush said Saturday.  </P> <P> The puppies were described as healthy and "nursing vigorously," although their  mother also spent some time cavorting on the White House lawn.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush, who served as midwife, said the President joined her to watch the  birth of one of the pups in a special whelping box.  </P> <P> "The President and I cried when we saw one of them being born . . . . We had a  tear. It was really sweet. It was so beautiful to see her," Mrs. Bush said. The  President described the birth, the "first dog delivery" he had witnessed, as  "really beautiful, it was unbelievable." Mrs. Bush indicated that he had never  seen any children born, either.  </P> <P> All six of the puppies are already promised to new owners, including one for  granddaughter Marshall Bush, 2, who was at the White House on Saturday with her  parents, Marvin and Margaret Bush, and another for the twin daughters of Bush's  son George in Texas. The sire's family also will get a puppy. But the pups will  spend a few weeks at their birthplace before being moved.  </P></p>

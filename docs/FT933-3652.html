			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Welsh boundary changes attacked BOUNDARY changes designed to increase the number of Euro constituencies in Wales from four to five were attacked yesterday by Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery. He said they involved creating new constituencies through merging Gwynedd and Dyfed and Powys and Clwyd which were 'geographically and demographically incompatible'. Mr Carlile attributed the 'madcap scheme' to the short-circuiting of normal procedures so that the new boundaries could be in place in time for next year's European parliamentary elections.</p>

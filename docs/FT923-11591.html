			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (3): Finding common ground - Ozal and Demirel are both closely identified with the project PRESIDENT Turgut Ozal of Turkey and Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, may disagree on most things these days, but when it comes to arguing the case for the Gap, they sound like a duet. For all its technical, financial and environmental problems, the Gap has supporters where it counts. Both men started their careers as engineers on the project, the president as a young electrical engineer on the Keban Dam, and Mr Demirel as director of the State Hydraulics Works DSI. Today they would each like to be seen as the founding father of the project. Mr Demirel's association with the Gap goes back to the 1950s, when he earned himself the nickname of the King of Dams. He studied as a water technician, obtaining a degree in hydrological engineering from the Technical University of Istanbul. It was when he became premier for the first time in 1965 that the plan for developing the vast water resources of the South East first took off. His government obtained World Bank credits for the construction of the Keban Dam. In a later incarnation as prime minister, he laid the foundation stone for the Karakaya Dam in 1976. Mr Demirel insists it was during this period that plans for the Ataturk Dam complex were drawn up. President Ozal, too, has been closely identified with the project. After studying economics and engineering in the US he took up a post as general deputy director of Electrical Studies and Research Administration in Ankara in the late 1950s. It was during this period that he first formulated schemes for harnessing the Euphrates for its huge hydro power potential. As a young electrical engineer he had worked on the Keban Dam. As prime minister he was to give the political green light to the massive Ataturk Dam and reservoir complex. And as president he was to inaugurate the project when the huge concrete 'bung' was locked into place in early 1990, staunching the flow of the river to allow the authorities to trap water behind the dam. It was President Ozal who formally opened the 26km Urfa irrigation tunnels, to take water from the reservoir to irrigate the Harran, Ceylanpinar and Mardin plains. For a brief moment last week it seemed the president would not attend tomorrow's celebration, allowing Mr Demirel to open the flood gates on to the turbines this Saturday, generating the first kilowatt of electricity from the Ataturk Dam. According to his spokesman, the president would go to Malatya for an apricot festival in his home town. Now it appears that Mr Ozal has changed his mind. The president will be attending. No one ever really believed he wouldn't.</p>

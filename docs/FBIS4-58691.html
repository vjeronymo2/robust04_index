			<p>BFN     [Text] A military source at the Defense Ministry and the  General Staff Command has made the following statement:    Following our previous statement on the developments of the  military situation that was brought about by the secessionist  and criminal gang in the Socialist Party leadership, we present  to the masses of our great Yemeni people the following new facts:    Your Armed Forces and security units, which belong to all  the  Yemeni people and who embrace within their close ranks -- who  believe in God and are confident about its faith and its shining  future -- all the sons of the one big homeland, have remained a  fortress for the entire homeland and the achievements of the 26  September and 14 October revolutions. They are now protecting,  with courage, valor, and sacrifices, the most sacred  achievements of the Yemeni revolution, unity, democracy, and  constitutional legitimacy.    Since they are the forces of the entire Yemeni people, they  know neither malice nor treacherous bloody collective  liquidation. Therefore, and out of their full confidence in the  honorable fate that is worthy of the human and his rights,  honorable unionist officers, NCO's, and soldiers in the units  that take orders from the rebellious elements in the Socialist  Party continue to join the army of unity and constitutional  legitimacy, confident that they will only be received with love,  loyalty, and good treatment. The most recent example of this  was the wise Yemeni treatment of the members of the 3d Armored  Brigade. Today, all members of the 1st Artillery Brigade in  (?Yalin), members of the Khurafi camp where al-Bid's personal  security team is stationed, and members of the military police  battalion in Sanaa joined the ranks of the army of unity and  constitutional legitimacy. They joined the ranks of their  brother members of the Armed Forces, the protector of unity and  democracy, after they became aware of the nature of the wicked  scheme of that secessionist gang that wants to fragment the  homeland.    The source praised the high morale of all members of the  Armed Forces and security units who are offering dear sacrifices  in order to strengthen steadfastness and victory in the homeland  of 22 May 1990.    In a related development, our air defense units continued  their valiant and competent confrontation of the aircraft of  that gang and repelled all their hostile, treacherous raids  against the capital Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, and Ma'rib.  These raids targeted vital and strategic installations in these  valiant cities and aimed at terrorizing citizens. The air  defense units foiled these missions and the aggressors retreated  in failure.    At a late hour yesterday, Colonel Jawad Muthanna, the  commander of the Ba Suhayb Brigade, and members of the brigade  staff were arrested. They had launched sedition in Dhamar and  then fled, but they were caught by the hand of justice.    The source praised the masses of our great Yemeni people in  the entire homeland for their courageous national stand and  their siding with the Armed Forces and security units in the  trench of defending unity and the homeland. After they were  burned by the fire of the fabricated crisis and its pain, these  masses realize that this is the decisive hour of decision  between a wrong that is nearing collapse and a right that is  proceeding with all confidence and competence toward clear  victory, God willing.</p>

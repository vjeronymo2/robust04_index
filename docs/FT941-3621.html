			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Japan tightens forex loss disclosure rules Japan's ministry of finance is to clamp down on the accounting practice by companies whereby unrealised profits and losses on forward foreign exchange transactions have been concealed. From the business year starting in April, the ministry is to require companies to disclose profits and losses which until now have not been disclosed, Japan's financial authorities have become increasingly concerned about the large number of companies suffering from unrealised losses on forward contracts on dollar purchases, due to the appreciation of the yen over the past few years. Many Japanese companies speculated in the foreign exchange markets during the late 1980s and, rather than realising the losses and writing them off, have extended such contracts in the hope that the yen's rise on the foreign exchange markets would be reversed. The decision will force corporate managers to curb foreign exchange deals rolled over constantly to hide losses. The extent of such losses is not clear, even to the financial authorities, but more Japanese corporations have been forced to disclose their mounting losses recently as the yen has strengthened further. Showa Shell Sekiyu, the Japanese subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, last year reported an unrealised loss of Y166bn (Dollars 1.55bn), while Nippon Steel Chemical, an affiliate of Japan's leading steel company, was forced to write off Y14bn last September. Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business newspaper, estimates that unrealised losses at Japan's listed companies total Y1,000bn but corporate reporting of the unrealised losses, to start with the September six-month period, is expected to reveal the true extent.</p>

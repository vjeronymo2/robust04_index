			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Low inflation will not help wage rises says report Higher pay rises fuelled by tax increases have not materialised, and the prospect of continuing low inflation in coming months creates little likelihood of substantial wage inflation, says the latest report from the independent pay analysts Industrial Relations Services, David Goodhart writes. In spite of some anxiety from government and business leaders about the recent upward trend in overall earnings, IRS figures show pay settlements at 2.5 per cent in the three months to the end of May. Half of the 153 settlements recorded by IRS in the quarter to the end of May fall between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. Just over two-fifths of bargaining groups secured higher pay rises than a year earlier, but a similar proportion agreed lower rises. A group of insurance staff at the Iron Trades Insurance Group, the UK mutual insurance company, have rejected a 2.5 per cent pay offer and are planning a one-day strike on Thursday.</p>

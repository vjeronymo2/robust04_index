			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Technology: Smart cards take to the streets - Hong Kong's public transport system is about to be revolutionised In about two years' time, if all goes according to plan, Hong Kong will have chalked up another first in the field of public transport. Not only will it have one of the only profitable public transport systems in the world but it will also be the most technologically advanced. By mid-1996, Creative Star, a consortium of transport providers led by the colony's Mass Transit Railway Corporation, hopes to be issuing the first batch of 3m credit card-sized plastic 'smart cards'. The consortium - which brings together rail, buses, trams and ferries - represents one of the most comprehensive and biggest applications of smart card technology. This system is being designed by ERG Australia, a Western Australia-based company which is a leader in the application of smart card technology to urban transport systems. The system to be introduced into Hong Kong will have initial capacity for 3m to 4m transactions a day producing annual revenues of around HKDollars 8bn (Pounds 660m) across all forms of transport. ERG, which recently won the HKDollars 400m contract, is also advising transport authorities in Manchester, London and Melbourne about the application of smart cards to public transport. Unlike most ticketing systems, which require the ticket to pass through a mechanical device, the secret to the smart card being introduced in Hong Kong is that it does not come into contact with anything. A microprocessor embedded in plastic - which possesses the computing power of IBM's first personal computer - is activated when passed over a 'target' device. This device powers the card and enables it to communicate with the target. Once a form of radio contact is established there is a two-way exchange of information between the card and the target. The card is identified and reports its remaining value; the target assesses if there is enough value in the card to enter the station. If so, it transmits date, time and station of entry. A similar process occurs at the end of a journey, with the cost of the fare being deducted on exit. This process takes place within the twinkling of an eye - just a third of a second. The information passes down data lines (or by microwave communication for buses and ferries) to a 'service provider central computer' owned by the railway or bus company, enabling it to know instantly the usage of routes and lines. This management information, which could be valuable to competitors, is stripped off before the raw billing data is passed on to a central clearing house. Creative Star totes up and distributes revenue according to usage. The card is easy to operate. Creative Star makes much of the fact that a user need never take the plastic out of his or her wallet or purse. All a user has to do is pass it over the target to gain access to the station or bus. According to Brian Chambers, a technical manager at the MTRC in charge of the smart card project, the target's signal could be powerful enough so that it detects a smart card on a passenger without his doing anything. 'People could walk through the turnstile without touching the card,' he says. 'But Japanese research shows that people don't like the idea of a body scan. They prefer to take the card out and touch the unit. They feel a transaction has been executed.' The MTRC is also concerned about the potential possibilities for invasion of privacy inherent in the smart card. As the card is not disposable, users will have the opportunity of personalising their card with a photograph and personal data. This will allow identification of the card in case of theft. Anonymous cards will also be issued, although the ability of the MTRC to cancel a stolen card and reimburse the lost money will be diminished. 'We intend to hold the least amount of data possible,' says Chambers. 'We are endeavouring to make sure there is no link between what personal information we may have and the usage of the card. But if the card is lost what we want is some mechanism of cancelling the card and returning the unused value to the customer.' Creative Star has set ERG a demanding specification for recharging the smart card. It wants to offer three methods of recharging. The first is conventional - take it to the MTRC window and pay the desired amount of cash. The other two methods, however, have the potential to make the card into a cash equivalent. The first is to place the card into an automated teller machine and debit a bank account. The second is to establish a direct debit on a savings or current account. When the card falls to a specified level it is recharged (again to a specified upper level) on passing by a target. In this way, the introduction of smart cards will not only herald the beginning of yet more convenience for the users of Hong Kong's public transport, but also the beginning of the end of small change. If the executives running Creative Star have their way, people will use their smart card for transactions ranging from buying a newspaper or soft drink from a vending machine, to making a public telephone call, paying for parking, buying fast food or sitting in a booth to have a passport photograph taken. Rob Noble, director of marketing and planning at the MTRC, notes that the card is designed for large volume, small transactions. But in offering vendors of other non-transport products access to Creative Star's central clearing system, he says it will not be trying to compete with credit cards. 'We're at the bottom of the market competing with cash,' he says. 'We see it as a convenience for customers. But the more cards in use, the more able they will be to use it for convenient things. We don't want it to be an MTRC card or a transport card, but ultimately a cash card.'</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / EU steel industry moves to next phase of battle: The spotlight will now shift to the non-aided steelmakers Europe's steel industry, battered by recession and deep-seated structural problems, moves into a new stage in its fight for survival and long-term prosperity this week after the resolution of a series of wrangles over state subsidies. During the past year, unsubsidised steelmakers and their spokesmen have lobbied vociferously from the sidelines as the European Commission struggled to win approval from member states for a package of deals to end state aid. Now, with industry ministers unanimously agreeing in Brussels on a deal involving some 5m tonnes of capacity cuts by state-aided producers, the spotlight shifts onto the non-aided steelmakers. To fulfil the Commission's target of reducing overcapacity by 30m tonnes a year of crude steel, they would have to offer capacity cuts of 25m tonnes. Judging by the anger and sharp words following Friday's meeting, the cuts are unlikely to be handed to the Commission on a plate. Some of the non-aided sector's planned cuts are already known. But most private-sector companies have held back from offering cuts until the state subsidy cases were resolved. The stance of the unsubsidised companies, therefore, is now crucial to the success of the entire initiative to restructure the industry. Unless overall capacity is reduced, the industry will have failed to address one of its fundamental structural weaknesses. The private sector, however, is deeply worried by Friday's deal and questions whether it will resolve the industry's long-term problems, whatever cuts in capacity are offered. Mr Ian Rodgers of the British Iron and Steel Producers' Association says: 'All the way along the Commission was looking for the easy way out, rather than the most stringent solution consistent with the Treaty of Paris.' The Commission and the industry ministers said that ending subsidies was the only way to secure a healthy EU steel industry. But by operating in the way it did, says Mr Rodgers, the Commission had failed to send the signal that countries could never come back with a begging bowl if a steelmaker gets into trouble. The industry's disappointment was shared by independent observers. 'The nettle has not been grasped,' says Mr Steven Randall of Beddows &amp; Co, the London-based steel consultants. 'Private-sector companies will ask why they should have to make cuts when loss-making state companies will survive for the foreseeable future.' There are two reasons, however, why the non-aided steelmakers are likely to come up with some or all of the capacity cuts, even though the Commission cannot force them to do so. First, Mr Martin Bangemann, the EU's industry commissioner, warned on Friday that other elements of the Commission's rescue plan, such as Ecu240m (Pounds 183m) to help pay for redundancies, and safeguards to limit imports from eastern Europe, would be withdrawn if unsubsidised steelmakers did not volunteer capacity cuts. Secondly, steelmakers are realistic enough to accept that, whatever their feelings, the subsidies agreement is now set in stone. By deliberately withholding capacity reductions in a declining market, the industry could be cutting off its nose to spite its face. Mr Peter Fish, managing director of the Sheffield-based Meps Europe consultancy, says: 'I think steelmakers will go along with the plan, albeit reluctantly, but whether the capacity cuts will be as deep as they might have been is a different question.' There is also concern about where the cuts will come from. Achieving a 20m-tonne reduction would require about 10m of cuts on top of the 10m-11m already indicated in Germany and France. But Mr Fish believes this will come more from the long products sector, where reducing heavy overcapacity does nothing to help the flat products producers. 'I don't see large integrated producers closing strip mill products plants - maybe a couple of plate mills and associated melting shops will close.' Editorial Comment, Page 13</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMAGE AWAY THE PAIN  </P> <P> Question: I would appreciate an explanation of what is meant by "imaging" when  it applies to efforts to reduce stress.  </P> <P> Answer: Imaging refers to the practice of thinking about something pleasant or  about a positive experience. This may help reduce stress brought about by a  painful experience.  </P> <P> For Malcolm, Syracuse, N.Y.: An estimated 25%-35% of migraine patients are  estimated to be visually impaired to some extent. The impairment is related to  the patient's age and the period of time he has been experiencing the attacks.  Why the visual impairment occurs is not known.  </P></p>

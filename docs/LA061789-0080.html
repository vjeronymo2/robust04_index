Papandreou can marry twice-divorced Liani in a civil  ceremony now, but she wants a church wedding.  </P> <P> It was the second divorce for both Papandreou and his wife. They were married  in 1951 in the United States and have four children, including Education  Minister George Papandreou.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LENDL, BECKER REACH SEMIS AT THE ATP;  </P> <P> TENNIS: THIGH INJURY DOESN'T SLOW GERMAN'S QUEST FOR THE NO. 1 RANKING. GOMEZ  AND MUSTER FALL BY THE WAYSIDE.  </P> <P> Boris Becker, chasing his dream of the world No. 1 ranking, and Ivan Lendl  reached the semifinals of the ATP World Championships today.  </P> <P> Becker showed no signs of the thigh injury which sidelined him last week as he  overcame a determined Thomas Muster, 7-5, 6-4.  </P> <P> The mathematics of the round-robin competition meant that Becker's win also  guaranteed Ivan Lendl, who earlier beat French Open champion Andres Gomez for  his second win of the tournament, a place in the semifinals.  </P> <P> If Muster had beaten Becker, Lendl would have needed to wait for the outcome of  the final group matches Friday to know his fate.  </P> <P> By his own admission, Ecuador's Gomez served so badly that he virtually gave  away the swift 6-4, 6-1 victory to Lendl.  </P> <P> Muster, who lost to Lendl on Tuesday, saved four match points before succumbing  to world No. 2 Becker.  </P> <P> The Austrian suddenly found himself serving at 5-1 down and 15-40 in the second  set.  </P> <P> His serve got him back to deuce, and though Becker earned two more match  points, the German's own mistakes gave Muster a breather.  </P> <P> Muster's escape unsettled Becker, who lost the next 10 points in succession,  dropping his own serve to love and only getting back into the game when Muster  double-faulted.  </P> <P> When Becker got to his fifth match point, in the 10th game, he was determined  not to give Muster another chance to get off the hook, and a fierce smash  clinched the victory.  </P> <P> "It is not my surface," Muster said of the fast carpet laid in Frankfurt's  Festhalle. "In the second set I lost control."  </P> <P> The sixth-seeded Gomez's second defeat in two days snuffed out his hopes of  reaching the semifinals.  </P> <P> "My serving was crucial," said Gomez who, like Muster, prefers a slower court.  "I made five double faults and I felt tired on my serve."  </P> <P> Gomez opened well by breaking Lendl in the second game. But that startled Lendl  into action.  </P> <P> Lendl, who surrendered the world's top ranking in August and is now third, soon  took a 5-1 lead in the second set.  </P></p>

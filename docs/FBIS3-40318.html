			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.V.: "A More Powerful Veteran"] </F>   [Text] More T-55 tanks have been manufactured in Europe  than any other medium armored fighting vehicle. Although  manufactured at the technological level of the 1960's, it has  been exported to several countries in the world. It is armed  with a 100-mm cannon with a rifled bore, which is loaded  manually, and then the PKT 7.62-mm (or SGM) coaxial machine gun  and the DShKM 12.7-mm antiaircraft machine gun.    Numerous modifications and improvements have now been made  in  the T-55 tank in order to increase its rate of fire, armor  protection, and mobility. More or less successful results have  been achieved.    When production of control systems for the M-84 tanks was  being prepared in our country, the same system was installed in  T-55 tanks still in use in units of the VJ [Army of Yugoslavia].  That was the first refinement and improvement of the  characteristics of this armored fighting vehicle. Following  those first modifications, it turned out that its combat and  technical characteristics could be considerably improved with  minor profitable investments, that is, the effectiveness of its  fire could be increased, armor protection could be raised to a  higher level, and the work of the crew could be facilitated by  installing special devices. That, of course, would also increase  the likelihood of the personnel's survival and protection of  assemblies under the most extreme conditions of use.    This tank's rate of fire was increased by installing two  launch rails for Malyutka antiarmor guided missiles. As is  well-known, they can hit enemy armored vehicles and fortified  structures over a range from 500 meters to 3 km, which improves  the T-55 tank's ability to wage antiarmor combat more  effectively over greater distances. At the same time, the  missile operator is protected from enemy fire. Two antiarmor  missiles are mounted on each launch rail; they are guided from  the control panel in the tank. The mechanism for elevation of  the cannon's barrel is used to set the missile's basic slope at  the time of launching. The operator guides the missile by  looking through the tank's existing sights, in which the  magnification factor is increased by additional optical  equipment. In addition to the missiles on the launch rails,  there are four more missiles on the tank's turret.    Modifications to the T-55 have also improved the  characteristics of the ammunition, and installing  heat-insulating pads on the external surfaces of the cannon's  barrel have reduced more than 80 percent deformations occurring  during action because of uneven cooling. This has increased the  accuracy of the main armament--the cannon.    Because an entire family of hand-held antiarmor weapons for  close combat has developed in recent years, including, for  example, rocket launchers with shaped-charge warheads, it was  reasonable to strengthen protection against these projectiles.  At the same time, increasing the tank's overall armor protection  would have been very expensive and impractical, and it would  have considerably increased the tank's total weight and reduced  its mobility. That is why a system for protection against the  shaped charge similar to the design on the M-84 tank was  installed on the tank. That is, screens to protect against  shaped-charge warheads are used on this tank to protect the  tank's flanks beneath the mounts of the boxes and fuel tanks,  the critical line where the tank's armored floor plates join the  sides, and also surfaces at the level where the tank's turret  joins the armored hull.    Twelve launchers have also been installed on the front of  the  turret to eject smoke canisters in front of the tank at  distances greater than 100 meters. The launch tubes, the firing  panel, and other equipment were taken over from the M-84 tank.  Thanks to use of smoke-canister launchers, the tank is  camouflaged by a smoke screen on the forward side, which reduces  the disadvantage of the smoke screen of the heat-smoke apparatus  of the engine, which, depending on the wind direction, is mainly  created behind or to the side of the tank, and provides it  insufficient protection from the front. The smoke canisters are  so designed that they can be activated electrically and by hand  and thrown around the tank.    Aside from making it possible to eject smoke canisters, the  launch tubes increase the turret's protection against the shaped  charge. Actually, projectiles fired at the tank are activated  when they strike those tubes before they hit the turret, which  reduces their effect during action.    A plow has also been installed on the T-55 tank so that it  can dig itself in; it is on the lower front slanted plate of the  nose, making it possible for the tank to dig itself in in 15 to  20 minutes depending on the soil type and category. It takes two  to three minutes to convert the plow from working to traveling  position or the other way around.    This modification has made the tank more independent in  providing its own cover, and the plow serves as an armor plate  affording additional armor protection to the front of the tank.    The improvement and modifications to T-55 tanks, although  carried out under conditions of the embargo, have considerably  improved essential tactical and technical characteristics of  this medium tank, above all the rate of fire over longer range  and protection against shaped charges. This has secured its  survival on the battlefield and made it possible to respond  decently to the enemy's tanks.</p>

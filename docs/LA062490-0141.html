			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHICH AMERICANS ARE ALLOWED TO GO  </P> <P> Who can go there: Can you investigate Cuba for yourself? Aren't Cuba's borders  closed to Americans?  </P> <P> Sort of. A U.S. embargo, part of the ominously named Trading With the Enemy  Act, limits travelers to those going on family visits, official government  business, news-gathering assignments, educational research or as guests of a  Cuban institution. The purpose, as stated in the U.S. guidelines, "is to  isolate Cuba economically and deprive it of U.S. dollars."  </P> <P> Cuba, on the other hand, welcomes pretty much anyone, and the common currency  (outside of the Cuban peso) is the American dollar. The embargo, regulated by  the U.S. Treasury department, is trade-related and restricts Americans from  spending money there.  </P> <P> If you work in the entertainment industry, you can go for the film festival  each December. If you teach Latin American history or a related topic, you  might be able to organize a professional research group of people in the same  field and Marazul may be able to put together a trip. If you have eligibility  questions, call the Office of Foreign Assets Control at (202) 376-0392.  </P> <P> The way things are changing in the rest of the world, the restrictions --  established by the United States, not Cuba -- can only become less impassable.  Last year, about 8,500 Americans visited the island.  </P> <P> Tours: Marazul Tours, a New York City tour packager, specializes in trips to  Cuba, and handled fairly competently my reservations, although there was no  visa under my name when I landed in Havana from Miami.  </P> <P> Marazul can be reached at (800) 223-5334, and ask for Bob Guild. Marazul can  tell you more precisely who qualifies and who doesn't. It also arranges charter  flights from Miami and hotel accommodations.  </P> <P> For a fixed fee (about $700 a week), tour groups will set up and prepay  airfare, hotel rooms and meals in the hotels.

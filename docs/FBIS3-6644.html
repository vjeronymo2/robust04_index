"Fighting would do no good to anyone. What we [the Khmer  Rouge] want is to build up our country and return it to  normalcy," a Khmer Rouge representative in Phnom Penh told The  Nation.    He reiterated the Maoist faction's commitment to pursue King  Norodom Sihanouk's five-point guideline aimed at national  reconciliation and accused the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of  opposing the plan.    Sihanouk's first three guidelines call for: an immediate and  complete ceasefire throughout Cambodia; the immediate and  unconditional transfer of the Preah Vihear temple, Pailin and  other Khmer Rouge-controlled zones to the Cambodian govemment;  and the dissolution of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  (NADK) and its partial absorption into the royal army.    "You see these first three points are what the DKP  [Democratic Kampuchea Party or Khmer Rouge] must give to the  other side," the representative said.    He said the other two guidelines require the Phnom Penh  government to give the DKP the posts of coministers, co-vice  ministers, co-secretaries of states and advisers; and the DKP  and the government must hold talks to settle all these issues.    "Altogether the five points make national reconciliation  possible. But the CPP have been concentrating on the first  three points only and that means they are opposed to national  reconciliation," he said.    The DKP representative referred to Cambodia's present  government as a two-headed government, one head of which is  Cambodian while the other -- and the whole body -- is Vietnamese.    He said a truly national government would not exclude any  political party or political personnel.    "We will never be part of the puppet government. We don't  want to be co-puppets," he said.    He said the future of the Phnom Penh coalition govemment  would be totally compromised if it refused to implement the  peace plan.    "How could they survive if they cannot solve the three main  problems of this country?" he said, citing the influx of  Vietnamese into Cambodia, corruption among government officials  and people's fear for their lives and property.    The Khmer Rouge is aware that the Vietnamese are trying to  swallow up Cambodia. After "closing Cambodia's western border  and opening up its eastern border, they will move little by  little into our land," he said.    However, without help from "some western countries", Hanoi  would be unable to carry out its policy of Vietnamization, the  representative said, without identifying the "colluding" Western  countries.    Asked to clarify the situation in Anlong Veng, the  representative denied that govemment troops have overwhelmed  Khmer Rouge headquarters there. "What they [the govemment]  claimed to be our base is not in fact our headquarters. That is  somewhere else. We were able to seize a number of government  tanks outside Anlong Veng," he said.    Though admitting the situation is tense in Pailin as  fighting  continues the Khmer Rouge representative dismissed reports that  government forces were about to take the town.    "The nearest they've got to Pailin is Treng, about 50 km  away," he said.</p>

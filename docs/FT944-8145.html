			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Tory chief warns big pay rises cause 'real offence' A Conservative party campaign strategy document says 'excessive executive pay packages, especially in the privatised utilities, cause real offence' and calls for increased taxation of executive share option schemes. The disclosure of further details from the draft paper, excerpts from which were published yesterday by the Financial Times, is likely to embarrass the government in the wake of the Pounds 205,000 pay rise given to Mr Cedric Brown, the chief executive of British Gas. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday: 'What British Gas have done is broadly to say 'we are a world class company'.' But the campaign paper, by Mr John Maples, the party's deputy chairman, said such pay rises cause 'real offence' - a view understood to be shared by Mr John Major, the prime minister. The strategy for improving the party's image before the next election, prepared for Mr Major and Conservative central office, is based on interviews with 80 disenchanted Conservative voters on average income. They are described as seeing the government as 'ineffectual and unable to deliver on its promises'. The paper says: 'Could we in the future tax share options as income not capital gains and introduce some level of options above which tax would be changed as they rise in value not just when they are exercised.' This proposal to curb the substantial profits from option schemes available to directors of public companies is broadly similar to the Labour party's policy. A furore was also caused yesterday by the suggestion in the paper that the government consider 'postponing some of April's proposed tax rises if fiscal conditions permit'. The paper continued: 'Delaying implementing the second instalment of VAT on fuel would be dramatic.' Many Tory backbenchers backed this proposal. Mr Jeremy Hanley, party chairman, told BBC Radio's PM programme yesterday that there were people 'who believe that the second tranche of VAT on fuel is uncomfortable for them'. The paper also proposes 'changes to the pace of NHS reform, eg not pursuing further performance pay for doctors'. Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow leader of the Commons, last night wrote to Mr Major urging him to 'categorically repudiate the tactics proposed by Mr Maples'. The paper also says that 'we really must use the Parliamentary timetable, debates, ministerial statement etc' to control the political agenda. Mrs Taylor said this and other suggestions, such as that Tory backbench 'yobbos' metaphorically beat up Labour leader, Mr Tony Blair, were 'an abuse of both parliamentary procedure and the principle that government should govern in the national interest'. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, indicated she would 'deprecate' any behaviour which could be seen as parliamentary yobbery.

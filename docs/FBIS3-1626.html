As a result, the rural economy  registered significant progress. According to statistical data,  1993 was a year of rapid development since the beginning of  reform and opening up. With the exception of cotton, of which  the output was about the same as the previous year, outputs of  grain, oil-bearing crops, aquatic products, cocoons, meat  products, and eggs set all-time records. Village and town  enterprises as well as forestry production also registered great  progress.    Agriculture: The outputs of principal agricultural products  all increased steadily. The outputs of grain, edible oil, and  cocoons set all-time records. According to an estimate, the  total output of grain in 1993 was 25.4 billion kg, increasing by  8.46 percent over 1992 and exceeding the previous high of 25.2  billion kg in 1990. The total output of edible oil was 31.33  million dan [1 dan equals 50 kg], increasing by 11.86 percent  over 1992 and exceeding the previous high of 30.21 million dan  in 1987. The total output of cocoons was 32,300 dan, increasing  by 13.3 percent over 1992. The peasants increased economic  efficiency as well as their income. According to estimates, the  total agricultural output value for the entire province totaled  41.7 billion yuan (based on 1990 constant price), an increase of  8.47 percent or 3.3 billion yuan over the previous year. The  average cash income of peasants could reach 670 yuan, an  increase of 16.9 percent or 97 yuan over the previous year.  Agricultural markets also developed rapidly, with more fine  quality products. The problem of structural surplus of  agricultural products was solved. The total acreage of farmland  sown for fine quality rice totaled 9.31 million mu.  Experimental agriculture also developed in depth.    Animal husbandry and fishery: According to estimates, the  total output value of animal husbandry in the entire province  could total 9.77 billion yuan, an increase of 10 percent over  the previous year, accounting for 23.4 percent of the total  agricultural output value. The quantities of pigs, cattle,  sheep, poultry, and eggs increased by 3.7 percent, 15.7 percent,  2.9 percent, 12.7 percent, and 0.5 percent over those of the  previous year respectively. Animal husbandry in 1993 had three  special characteristics: 1) stress was laid on developing  grain-saving livestock, and beef and poultry reached 29.3  percent of total meat production, with the proportion of beef  and poultry increasing by 2 percent over the previous year; 2)  large operations increased significantly, and production was  geared to market needs; and 3) the extent of utilization of  science was raised in livestock production.    The total output of aquatic products for the entire province  reached 350,000 tonnes, an increase of 15.8 percent over the  previous year. Breakthroughs were made in producing famous,  special, fine, and new products.    Forestry: In 1993 people in the province afforested 1.692  million mu of land and planted 257 million trees at near houses,  villages, roads, and water on a voluntary basis. The average  survival rate of planted trees was more than 93 percent. People  in the province also built shelter belts to protect 8.817  million mu of farmland. Two prefectures and five counties were  named national advanced units in afforestation. The structures  of trees became more reasonable. People in the province built  714,000 mu of economic forests and fruit trees, accounting for  42.5 percent of the total area of afforestation during the same  year. Fifteen kinds of advanced forestry technologies were  adopted in the province. The total value of forestry products  exceeded 2.8 billion yuan, an increase of 14 percent over the  previous year.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo SE may ease listings rules The Tokyo stock exchange, facing a sharp decline in listings of overseas companies, is considering measures to revive trading on its stagnant foreign section. Exchange officials are planning to ease the TSE's asset guidelines which limit listings of overseas corporations on its foreign section to large blue chip companies. They hope to increase listings of more south-east Asian and Chinese companies, with growth potential, which are looking for funding options in overseas capital markets. The exchange plans to scrap the Y100bn net asset requirement for companies wishing to list, and the guideline where companies must report annual profits of at least Y20bn during the three years before the listing. The move comes as TSE has seen an exodus of US and European companies over the past few years due to the rise in costs stemming from the yen's appreciation and the sharp fall in trading volumes of foreign stocks. The number of companies listed on the TSE's foreign section has fallen to 97 from 125 in the peak in 1991. Companies including Eastman Kodak and Chase Manhattan are among those which have delisted, shunning the costs of Y20m to Y30m a year to maintain its status on the TSE.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Gas users advised to check meters Gas customers have been urged to read their meters tomorrow to avoid being overcharged when value added tax is introduced on April 1. Ofgas, the industry regulator, said that British Gas would estimate customers' average daily use before and after April 1 to calculate the VAT to be applied to individual bills. Cold weather around that date could cause consumers to use more gas than later in the quarter, and thus be overcharged for VAT. British Gas has agreed to re-bill customers for the quarter if its estimate is higher than the actual meter readings.</p>

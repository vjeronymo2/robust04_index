			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Romantsov] </F>   [Text] New York, 3 Mar -- When, the other day, on the  heights surrounding the Bosnian capital, the guns at first fell  silent and were later moved away -- which was achieved with the  diplomatic participation of Russia -- there was a two-fold  reaction in the United States. The U.S. Administration, with  restraint but unequivocally, commended this turn of events; but  among observers there were those who detected the "machinations  of Moscow" and a "Russian-Serbian plot" in what was quite  obviously a humane decision.    History also repeats itself as regards lifting the siege of  Tuzla airport, Which opens up the possibility of dropping food,  medicines, and other aid to the population. According to  information received, the first such drop will be made by  Russia, but some people in the United States do not like the  fact that this knot is also being untied, primarily with the  participation of Russia, which is incidentally, acting strictly  in keeping with UN resolutions, and is sending its observers to  Tuzla as part of the UN's Blue Helmets.    The `NEW YORK TIMES', for example, writes that Russia "is  offering its troops in order to enable the Serbs to save face,  confronted as they are with UN demands," and argues about the  hand extended to the Serbs by Russia. Once again Moscow is  amply criticized for catching the West unawares by devising a  formula acceptable to the Bosnian Serbs -- as though the search  for such a formula, opening up the way to humanitarian aid, were  not a task that everyone is tackling.    One can even hear voices claiming that Russia is, for the  second time, depriving NATO of an opportunity to launch air  strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, in fulfilment of the declared  ultimatum, where UN resolutions are not complied with. One has  the impression that these resolutions were prompted not by a  concern for people, be they Muslims, Croats, or Serbs, not by a  desire for peace and the resolution of an extremely complicated  Balkan problem, but by a wish to be sure of "punishing" the  Serbs.    Both the guns being moved away from Sarajevo and the dawning  opportunity to provide humanitarian aid to the population of  Tuzla are substantial political steps. By accomplishing  priority tasks, they are at the same time laying down approaches  to more broadly based tasks -- identifying mutual understanding  between the sides, establishing cooperation between them, and  ultimately settling the chronic Bosnian problem.    In my opinion, the prime rating in terms of importance goes  to the fact that these steps have become possible. What  specific country is making the effort to see that they are  implemented is a secondary matter. If a different view is  taken, one may cast doubt on the treaty between the Bosnian  Muslims and the Bosnian Croats -- even without knowing what it  contains -- just because it was signed in Washington after  active mediation by the United States and by Secretary of State  Warren Christopher personally.    In fact, not everyone in the United States welcomed it with  open arms. Brent Scowcroft, the former national security  adviser to the President, and now the director of the  international policy forum, said that the whole value of the  treaty lay merely in the fact that it "allows the diplomats to  claim a success."    Needless to say, the effectiveness of the document, as with  any other, must be judged by the results it produces. But the  actual signing ceremony is a starting point and hence an  important step. So, Secretary of State Warren Christopher made a  fitting comment when he said: "This treaty shows how much can be  achieved, even after bitter years of violence, when two sides  sit down together at the negotiating table.... It shows that  peace is possible."    Yes, it is possible if one thinks about peace rather than  about "punishing" the Serbs.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Thailand SE offers full brokers seats at Bt300m The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is offering four new seats for full brokers at a cost of Bt300m (Dollars 12m) a seat, giving sub-brokers until the end of this month to apply. The brokers should start trading by the end of this year. A further six are to be admitted in 1995 and more will be allowed in thereafter. At present the exchange has 40 full brokers, and sub-brokers have to deal through them and share their commissions. Leading sub-brokers contending for the new seats include Jardine Fleming Thanakom (which is 43 per cent owned by Jardine Fleming), Ekachart Finance and Securities (which has a research and trading agreement with James Capel), Nithipat Capital, and Sitca Investment and Securities. The SET said new brokers would pay a Bt200m fee, plus 10 per cent of their monthly commissions for five years, up to a maximum of Bt100m. According to Mr Seri Chintanaseri, the SET's president, the exchange may revoke the licences of existing brokers if they fail to meet the criteria set for new members. Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the Thai finance minister, says the offer of more licences is a way of liberalising the financial sector in preparation for foreign competition. At present, foreign companies can hold only minority stakes in Thai stockbrokers.</p>

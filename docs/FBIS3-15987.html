Guoda Salciute describes the first plenary  sitting:    [Salciute] The solemn opening of the fourth session did not  take long. Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas greeted the Seimas  members on the occasion of the opening of the spring session on  the eve of the extraordinary day -- 11 March. [date of  restoration of Lithuanian independence] [passage omitted]    President Algirdas Brazauskas addressed all members of the  Seimas:    [Begin Brazauskas recording] Esteemed Seimas, I would like  to share with you this festive mood in this hall today, on the  eve of the fourth anniversary of the restoration of Lithuania's  independence. I cordially greet you on this day which is very  significant to our state and nation. A free independent  parliament, which was called the Supreme Council then, elected  on democratic principles, was formed four years ago. It has  accomplished a great deal. Although it has not been working for  very long, its steps are significant in our political life and  in the life of our state. Firm parliamentary traditions were  formed during that period in our state, and the second  parliament, elected in a democratic and worthy manner, has been  working for over a year. It has accomplished a great deal; we  all read in the press and heard how many decisions and laws of  very great importance to our state it has passed.    I would like to wish you in this fourth session, the spring  session, hard work, adherence to principles, and wisdom in  dealing with the affairs of our state and adopting laws and  other documents, the list of which, as I have seen, is very  long. These documents are of great significance to all spheres  of our life, including domestic policy, economic reforms, the  consolidation of the tax system and the legal system, and many  other fields.    I would like to wish you successful work and good spirits. I  hope you will not waste energy and wisdom there where good,  common, bilateral or multilateral decisions can be achieved.  Success to you all. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

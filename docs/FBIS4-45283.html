In operations conducted in  eight states, the Federal Judicial Police arrested 24 presumed  drug dealers, also confiscating eight automotive vehicles used  to transport drugs.    Among those arrested as persons presumed guilty of crimes  against health were Urbano Barragan Ruiz, Javier Saldana  Salazar, Lorena Salazar, Jose Israel Rueda Coria, Enrique  Calderon Duarte, Jose Francisco Herrera, Jose Martin Ontiveros  Galindo, Guadalupe Ontiveros Galindo, Jose Angel Limon Juarez,  Jose Nieblas Chavez, Rafael Alcaraz Lopez, and Ignacio Torres  Gil.    One of the largest seizures took place in Nuevo Leon,  according to the report submitted by Roberto Soltero Acuna, the  PGR's state representative, and Horacio Brun Acosta, deputy  director of the Federal Judicial Police, on the confiscation of  one ton and 512 kg of cannabis indica, which had arrived  concealed in a tank truck.    Near km 145 of the Monterrey-Reynosa highway, Urbano  Barragan  Ruiz, driver of a 1986 Kenworth tractor-trailer truck with  Federal Public Service license plates 256-AG9, was captured. The  drugs were concealed in the "belly" of the tank, distributed in  72 packages.    The vehicle was being guarded by Javier Saldana Salazar and  Lorena Galvan, who were following the trailer in a Cheyenne  pickup truck with Tamaulipas State registration VU-47085.    In their statements to the public ministry, the accused  claimed that the drugs had been packed in Uruapan, Michoacan,  and were bound for McAllen, Texas.    Another ton and 17 kg was seized in Sinaloa, specifically,  in  the municipality of Villa Union. Luis Antonio Cornejo, the PGR's  state representative, reported that the drugs were being  transported under a shipment of coconuts. At a checkpoint  (Precos) set up on that site, the blue flatbed truck with plates  350-AG3 was subjected to a search, and the illicit load was  discovered. It had arrived from the municipality of Arteaga,  Michoacan, with the town of Tijuana, Baja California, as its  final destination. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Eight Russian Political groups disqualified from elections The Russian election commission last night disqualified eight of the 21 political groups which had sought to register for parliamentary elections on December 12, because they had failed to gather the required 100,000 signatures. As all 21 claimed to have collected at least 100,000 signatures, it is presumed that a number of signatures were regarded as forgeries. The main victim is the Russian National Union, led by Mr Sergei Baburin, a former hardline nationalist deputy. He said 20,000 signatures had been stolen by thieves who wore police uniforms. All other main blocs have been accepted, including the liberal Russian Unity and Yavlinsky blocs, the centrist Civic Union and the far-left Russian Communists.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Japanese adviser for Camdessus Shigemitsu Sugisaki, a senior official from the Japanese Ministry of Finance (MOF), has been named as special adviser to Michel Camdessus, the International Monetary Fund's managing director, making him the most senior Japanese national at the Washington DC-based organisation, writes Gerard Baker. His appointment follows the promotion of the previous special adviser, Prabhakar Narvekar, to the position of deputy managing director in June. At that time, the Fund's most senior management was expanded from one to three deputy managing directors. A Japanese was not among the chosen three; the other addition to the customary American being Alassane Ouattara, Ivory Coast's former prime minister. Sugisaki, 53, was most recently head of the secretariat at the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission. He joined MOF in 1964, working his passage through the international finance and tax bureaus. He spent three years as assistant to the president of the Asian Development Bank from 1976. Since then he has seen a range of assignments at MOF, becoming deputy vice minister of finance for international affairs in 1990 and deputy director general of the international finance bureau a year later. In a recent interview, Sugisaki said the IMF's role should be strengthened, to achieve co-ordination on macroeconomic policy among leading industrialised nations. He also expressed doubts about the possibility of reforming the current free-floating exchange-rate system. 'Nothing is more desirable than realising stable exchange rates,' he said, 'but it is unrealistic to go back to a fixed exchange-rate system.' Policy co-ordination was likely to be more effective in stabilising currencies. He is expected to hold the position for three years, as did his predecessor.</p>

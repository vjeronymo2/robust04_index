The REUTER story quotes President Kravchuk as saying  that he sees no alternative to a UN-sanctioned air strike and  makes a conclusion about the president's altered position on  this issue. In fact, though, as the full transcript of Mr.  Kravchuk's replies testifies, the Ukrainian president confirmed  the correspondent's assumption about coincidence of opinions on  the subject held by Ukraine's and Russia's presidents, who are  against the bombardment. Replying to a question about who should  make the air strike decision, NATO or the UN Security Council,  President Kravchuk said quite unambiguously that it should be  made by the UN Security Council since it would be a decision on  a forceful interference. President Kravchuk further said that he  was aware that a variant of developments was possible with  bloodshed and massacre which there would be no other way to stop  but make such a decision. [sentence as heard] But such a  decision must be made by the world community, not just one  nation, the Ukrainian president said.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Massacre by Rio's police terrorists: Violence, corruption and economic decay are destroying the hopes of Brazil, a country blessed with natural wealth and a tradition of happy civic order THE last Sunday of August should have been a great night for Brazil. Faced with the threat of not qualifying for the World Cup for the first time in its history, the team had finally produced the old magic in thrashing Bolivia by a glorious six goals to nil. Television commentators ridiculed a front page story in the previous day's New York Times, which prematurely declared Bolivia the new footballing champs of Latin America, and all over the country firecrackers exploded to mark the start of what promised to be nightlong victory celebrations. The makeshift bar at number 12, Rua Antonio Mendes, in Vigario Geral, one of the most violent favelas or slums in the northern suburbs of Rio de Janeiro, was no exception. Inside, seven men were toasting the team, their own hard lives as labourers, metal workers and stall holders temporarily forgotten amid the pride of being Brazilian and the warming, hunger-killing taste of pinga, the harsh local rum. Just after midnight the door burst open. Masked men, apparently police, filled the room, demanding to see the identity cards that all Brazilian residents must carry. As the revellers fumbled through their pockets one of the hooded intruders lobbed a grenade into the small room. In the ensuing dust-and-smoke-filled Pandemonium they opened fire, killing all seven and spraying the room with so many bullets that the walls looked like firing ranges and the red metal chairs were left mangled. The killers then crossed the street to a simple two-room house where a family of seven evangelicals were sleeping under a sampler, embroidered with the message 'The Lord Blesses and Awaits You'. With another burst of fire they slaughtered all seven, from the elderly grandmother clutching her bible to the young girl whose 16th birthday was the next day. By 1am they had claimed 21 victims: the largest massacre in a city where violence is so common that there is a tabloid, O Povo, dedicated to gruesome reportage about the previous night's butchering. Next morning in Vigario Geral stump-like chords protruded from public phones, cut before the carnage began. Stunned locals were frightened to talk openly but all insisted on one thing - the men were military police, or PMs as they are known, apparently on a revenge attack for the murder of four of their rank while collecting their pay-off on a drug deal. As all 21 bullet-riddled corpses were laid out in metal drawers in the blistering midday sun, a woman began screaming 'Killer PMs'. Confirming police involvement, Kilo Batista, deputy governor of Rio state, said: 'I've never seen anything so Dante-esque. It's as if the inner workings of the police were pervaded by a culture of extermination which comes out at night like a beast an the kill.' The Vigario Geral massacre was a rude shock to a country that has the motto 'Order and Progress' stamped across its flag . Brazil has always taken pride in the fact that in spite of its diversity of creeds and colours, its continental size and unfair income distribution, it has remained a peaceful place, remarkably free of ethnic, religious, or regional tension. Unlike its more volatile neighbours, Brazil has never had a revolution or a serious guerrilla movement. Even its independence from Portugal was secured without bloodshed. But a series of chilling incidents, often perpetrated by military police, is prompting many to ask whether the world's third most-populous democracy is beginning to tear itself apart. In the month before the Vigario Geral massacre, military police in Rio slaughtered eight homeless children sleeping at the door of a church, carried out an armed bank robbery and were exposed as running a stolen car racket in cahoots with the city's breakers yards. In the remote Amazonian north, 19 Yanomami Indians were murdered by machete-wielding gold miners and even in the sterile capital, Brasilia, a teenage boy was clubbed to death by a gang of youths. Antoninho Ventim, spokesman for the National Bishops Conference, says: 'This series of cold-blooded assassinations shows that the avalanche of violence in this country has reached uncontrollable levels.' In some ways it is remarkable that this has not happened before. Sitting at an open bar in the Sunday market in Sao Cristovao in northern Rio is like watching a procession of every colour and creed on earth from Nordic blonde ice maidens through curvaceous Carmen Miranda-type mulattas to ebony African warriors. Brazil offered great promise to immigrants, with its riches in natural resources and vast unexplored territory. Today it hosts the largest Japanese population outside Japan, large groups of Germans, Italians, Poles, Lithuanians, Dutch and Swedes. The vast rainforest is home to the world's largest Indian population. Brazil, the last country to abolish slavery, has a large number of descendants of African slaves. Aside from its ethnic diversity Brazil also boasts one of the world's largest gaps between rich and poor - the World Bank puts it second only to Sierra Leone. The difference is most visible in Rio, where, in luxury apartments, the rich sip cocktails served by white-jacketed butlers and pick at food from groaning tables decorated with ice sculptures, overlooked by sprawling slums of shacks where black beans are the staple fare and there is often no clean water. Few countries in the world have so consistently governed for the rich at the expense of the poor, building cycle paths for the middle classes while the poor do not have sewage; pumping money into universities while primary schools are starved of resources; and allowing a third of its population to suffer malnutrition while consistently figuring in the world's top three agricultural exporters. To an outside eye the place seems ripe for revolution. Yet, instead of protest, the visitor sees underfed faces smiling and laughing on the seafront, a crimson-lipped girl swaying her hips provocatively while a toothless old man strums a banjo, lilting music that is mellow rather than angry. Journalists who venture into the favelas find people rarely complain about their lot. Instead, writers must resort to superficial explanations about the beneficial effects of the weather, the beach and the pinga; or Portuguese passivity; or the informal economy that provides half of the city's employment. But many of those living in Rio believe the situation is untenable. The persistent failure of the government to provide for the poor has allowed drug dealers and bicheiros (who run illegal gambling) to move in as the main purveyors of social policy in the favelas, which have become no-go areas for the authorities. Crime is so high that law-abiding people live behind bars, public parks are locked behind iron railings, and no one stops at red traffic lights at night for fear of being attacked. Carlos Roxo, an executive with Aracruz, a large pulp and paper company, complains: 'It's like living in a nightmare. The government doesn't control the police, the police don't control the bandits. We can't descend much further.' For the first time, many Brazilians are giving up on the self-styled land of the future and plotting escape. Those who have lost hope can be seen in the enormous queue for visas outside the US consulate in Rio. Consular officials estimate that between 2m and 3m Brazilians live in the US, most illegally. One says: 'The frightening thing is that we are seeing the cream of society abandoning ship. We're signing visa forms for people we know are a real loss. Brazilians used to go the States to study and come back. Now they stay.' The favourite destination is Miami where recent arrivals include Zozimo, Rio's leading gossip columnist and Pedro Collor, brother of the ousted president. In the Museum of Japanese Immigration in Sao Paulo is displayed a letter written by the first arrivals at the turn of the century, raving about the riches and peaceful living that Brazil offered. Today the Japanese consulate in Sao Paulo is packed with nissei or Japanesedescendants, returning to their homeland, citing the same reasons. Many of those without the resources or desire to leave Brazil are making a religious migration. Brazil is the world's largest Catholic country but the past few years have seen a mass exodus from the church as faith in traditional institutions erodes. Catholic priests watch in dismay the explosion in Afro-Brazilian religions such as candomble, a kind of white magic whose practitioners include the last-but-one finance minister, who always wore white on Fridays. Sprucely painted buildings housing protestant sects such as the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God have sprung up everywhere. In Rio, evangelicals control 25 of the 33 radio stations, forcing the bishops to take to the airwaves themselves in self-defence. The failure of Brazil's institutions to meet the needs of its people makes all the more remarkable last year's street movement to impeach President Fernando Collor - the world's first impeachment of an elected president. So peaceful were the mass rallies that not a single injury was sustained nor window broken. Benito Gama, the congressman who wrote the report accusing Collar of corruption, says: 'We really stretched democracy to the limits.' It may have been their last chance, however. The main reason for the outbreak of violence is frustration with the worsening economic situation. After years as one of the world's fastest growing economies - between the 1940s and 1980s Brazil grew at an average 7 per cent per annum - in the last decade it has seen one country after another overtake it. While Argentina recently sold off its oil company and Chile was described in Washington as a tiger, the Brazilian state still spends its time running manufacturing companies. Four finance ministers and three central bank governors have been defeated in the last year by inflation, which is running at 2,000 per cent per annum, and Brazil has slipped from being the world's eighth largest economy to be the 10th. Last month's relaunch of the Volkswagen Beetle, first produced in Brazil in 1959 as a triumph of its industrial prowess, was confirmation to many of how far Brazil has slipped. Brazil has had a lot of bad luck with its presidents, who have shown an unfortunate tendency to resign, die, shoot themselves or be ousted before completing their mandates. With the end of military rule in 1985, the hope of better days was quickly thwarted when Tancredo Neves died before even taking office. The government of his intended vice-president, Jose Sarney, was a disaster, its uncontrolled spending pushing inflation to 84 per cent a month. The young Fernando Collor, with his fighting talk and dashing good looks seemed to provide new hope but while modernising the state was filling his pockets. 'We can't keep on disappointing the people,' warns Carlos Langoni, an economics professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. Today Collor is living out his own form of escapism. Holed up inside his lakeside mansion in Brasilia he tortures himself with geographic proximity to power while his small staff place signed photos in envelopes as if he were a reclusive pop star. Adamantly denying his playboy past, Collor styles himself as an intellectual, seated at a large desk piled with books by the likes of Paul Kennedy, densely annotated with tiny handwriting. But the elder statesman act does not come off, perhaps because of Mont Blanc pens, the fat Cuban cigars and the bestselling book by his brother, detailing black magic sessions during the presidency at which Collor and his wife would dance round dead chickens chanting against their political enemies. Describing himself as a 'victim of the elites', Collor says he believes the tide will turn and he will return to 'complete my project'. Few Brazilians share his opinion. So angry are they at what is seen as his betrayal that few are prepared to give him credit for the positive changes he inspired. Most Brazilians prefer to forget the fact that 3 1/2 years ago, when Collor assumed office, Brazil was the most regulated and protected economy in the noncommunist world. Prices of everything from bread rolls to cigarettes were fixed by bureaucrats in Brasilia, filling stations were not allowed to offer discounts, or even services such as car-washing, and more than 1,500 items could not be imported including cars, fax machines and computers. Collor may have changed all that but he and his lieutenant PC Farias were apparently looting the country at the same time. Corruption is nothing new in Brazil, but the audacity of Collor's scheme was unequalled. It raked in more than Dollars 1bn, according to police investigations, through 30 per cent commissions on government contracts. Collor's ousting was an was unprecedented event: a Latin American leader stripped of power for corruption. However, there is little expectation that the notoriously slow justice system will follow up with a jail sentence. Collor is even hoping to regain his political rights, which were stripped for eight years. Farias has changed his name to Born Pablo and fled the country, leaving the police trailing hopelessly in his wake like Keystone cops. When people see their leaders rape the country it is little surprise that they lose respect for institutions. That this has happened in Brazil is illustrated by the average Brazilian motorists' behaviour - traffic streams through red lights, cars park at random - and by the small proportion that pays taxes - only 7m of a working population of 55m. A survey found that the only institutions to command any respect were firemen and lifeguards. Is Brazil on the verge of civil unrest - or even a military coup? Francisco Gros, a highly respected banker and former central bank governor, is not so sure that events will be so dramatic. He says Argentina went through 60 years of economic deterioration before implementing serious reform. 'My fear is not that we will have hyperinflation or a social explosion but that the situation will just keep on getting worse and worse and more and more anarchic like a horror film that never ends.'</p>

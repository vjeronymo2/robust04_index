			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mercedes, BMW in talks over possible collaboration MERCEDES-BENZ is in talks with BMW over possible collaboration on parts manufacture, according to Mr Helmut Werner, incoming chairman of the Daimler-Benz luxury car subsidiary. Such a development would mark a milestone in the history of both German companies, each of which has remained among the most determinedly independent and vertically integrated of all the world's car companies. That such fierce rivals are contemplating direct collaboration underlines the extreme cost pressures the entire German motor industry is now under as a result of the strong D-Mark and high labour rates. These pressures threaten to undermine the position of both German companies in the all-important North American executive and luxury car market, where they are already being outsold by Japanese luxury makes. Mr Werner, in an interview to be published today, gives no clues, however, as to which components might be under discussion. He said it would be better to co-operate and try to raise volume output of certain components. 'It would be ill-advised to try to make everything ourselves. 'We are talking and negotiating about what we can offer one another,' Mr Werner added. BMW was unavailable for comment last night. While Mercedes has relaxed its independent stance somewhat in recent years, to the extent of buying in high-performance cylinder heads from Cosworth of the UK and even contracting assembly of one low-volume niche model to Porsche, BMW to date has avoided virtually all forms of collaboration. It has even been examining manufacturing itself its own electronic components. Its partial solution to problems in North America has also been typically independent - setting up its own manufacturing plant in South Carolina. Mr Werner said Mercedes' search for economies was already proving successful. Cuts in the development and production costs for the new 190 series, the so-called 'baby Mercedes' due to be launched this summer, would allow the car to come to market at 'aggressive' prices, he claimed. BMW expects deliveries to distributors to fall this year for the first time since 1974. The setback follows progress in 1992 when BMW recorded a 4.7 per cent increase in turnover and a 7.6 per cent rise in deliveries to 598,000 units. However, turnover growth was hit by currency devaluations and the increased share in sales of the cheaper 3-series. Profits, which were not disclosed, were satisfactory, the group said in a letter to shareholders yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> FULLERTON FINISHES OFF IRVINE, WILL FACE LAS VEGAS ON FRIDAY  </P> <P> UC Irvine's worst season in the school's 25-year history came to an end  Wednesday night, with the Anteaters losing to Cal State Fullerton, 82-63, in  the first round of the Big West Conference tournament at Long Beach Arena.  </P> <P> Irvine finished 5-23.  </P> <P> Fullerton, which broke a seven-game losing streak, advances to a quarterfinal  game against third-ranked Nevada Las Vegas on Friday night at 9.  </P> <P> Some reward: UNLV has eliminated Fullerton (13-15) each of the past five  tournaments, and has beaten the Titans this season by 28 and 18 points.  </P> <P> In their two games against Irvine during the regular season, the Titans won by  27 points and lost the second by 18.  </P> <P> This time they jumped to a 36-16 lead in the first half, and that was about it.  </P> <P> For the only time this season, Fullerton started a game without Cedric Ceballos  on the court. Coach John Sneed benched him for the first four minutes for being  late to Tuesday's practice.  </P> <P> Ceballos, who wore a black armband with the name "Hank" on it, said he was late  after attending the memorial service for Hank Gathers, who was his teammate on  a summer league team at Cal State Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Ceballos finished with 19 points and 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> Mark Hill led Fullerton with 22 points.  </P> <P> The Anteaters suffered another poor shooting performance.  </P> <P> In the first half, Irvine missed all nine shots from three-point range.  Fullerton made seven of 11, including all three attempts by Van Anderson, a  reserve forward who averages three points a game.  </P> <P> Overall, Irvine made only 41% of its shots. Discounting center Ricky Butler,  who scored 22 points on 10-of-14 shooting, the Anteaters made only 16 of 50  shots -- 32%.  </P> <P> From the free-throw line, they made only six of 13 -- 46%.  </P> <P> And Dylan Rigdon, unflappable and unstoppable in the previous game, made only  one shot, a layup, and missed all five of his shots from three-point range.  </P> <P> Rod Palmer, the only senior starter for the Anteaters, added 20 points,  including five three-point baskets.  </P> <P> "Unbelievable," Sneed said of the Titans' performance. "It couldn't have come  at a better time."  </P> <P> Just in time for a game against UNLV.  </P> <P> Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan, pressed for a prediction on the UNLV-Fullerton  game, tried to be diplomatic.  </P> <P> "I don't want to get into that," he said. "I don't know, you know, maybe they  can hang in there and do a good job. . . . I think Vegas is a Final Four team.  I've said that all along."  </P> <P> Fresno State 71, San Jose State 56 -- Tod Bernard scored Fresno State's first  13 points of the second half as the Bulldogs ended a seven-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Fresno State (10-18) will play top-seeded New Mexico State on Friday.  </P> <P> Bernard made three three-point shots during his streak as the Bulldogs  increased a 30-27 halftime lead to 43-33. He finished with 21 points.  </P> <P> "We had one of our poorest games of the season," said San Jose State Coach Stan  Morrison.  </P> <P> San Jose State (8-20) shot only 35% from the field and made 23 turnovers.  </P> <P> The Spartans, who were led by Andre Brooks' 19 points, got to within 44-42, but  Fresno quickly pulled away on a basket by Bernard and five points in a row by  Pat Riddlesprigger.  </P> <P> Tournament Notes  </P> <P> Larry Johnson of Nevada Las Vegas was chosen the Big West Conference Player of  the Year by a coaches' vote. UNLV's Stacey Augmon, last year's Player of the  Year, didn't make the first or second team, earning only honorable mention. . .  . There is hope for the future for Irvine, which placed two players on the  all-freshman team: Dylan Rigdon and Jeff Von Lutzow. Other members: Lucious  Harris of Cal State Long Beach, Idris Jones of UC Santa Barbara and Kevin Logan  of San Jose State.  </P></p>

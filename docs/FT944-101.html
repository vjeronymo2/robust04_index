			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Contrasts, conflicts in long-term equity returns - Adrian FitzGerald compares a spectacular decade with the results of a five-year fight against inflation Major equity markets around the world tend to produce their best returns during the month of January, and things were no different in 1994. The FT-A World Index rose by over 5 per cent on the month in local currency terms; the Japanese market rose by almost 13 per cent. Then the US Federal Reserve spoiled the party in February by raising short-term interest rates. Long bond yields in the US and elsewhere were already being pushed up by fears that inflationary pressures would follow hard on the heels of economic recovery. And the US domestic economy was beginning to show signs of overheating. Six interest rate rises later, those fears have not been laid to rest. Medium and long-term bond yields in the US are 2 percentage points higher than in February reflecting, in the main, the inflation risks that investors still perceive. Long bond yields in other major markets have also risen, though by a lesser degree in most cases. It is not surprising, against this background, that global equity markets failed to extend an excellent start to the year. In fact, the FT-A World Index in local currency, which hit its peak on February 2, is closing the year some 7 per cent below that peak level. What is surprising is that, given the extent of the weakness in bonds, some equity markets did not suffer even greater falls during the year. US equities, for example, have held up remarkably well, falling only 4 per cent from their February peak. Optimistic investors (and stockbrokers) would argue that this resilience is proof that the bull market in equities is still intact and that a strong rally is assured once inflation fears subside. However, realists should take special note of the fact that US equities still appear very overvalued relative to bonds. Indeed, the ratio of bond yield to equity yield - a crude, inverse measure of relative attractiveness - is, worryingly, at its highest levels since just before the October 1987 crash] Equity markets need a bond market recovery, therefore, if progress is to be resumed in 1995. But this does imply, of course, that investors willing to commit new money to financial markets should not ignore the potential returns from bonds. Good returns from equities will only be forthcoming on the back of good returns from fixed interest securities. And here lies one of the more important lessons to be learned from the first half of the decade, a period in which authorities around the world have fought to squeeze inflation out of the economic system. Contrary to the experience of the 1980s, it should no longer be assumed that equity markets will churn out high double digit returns year after year. Moreover, it would also be wrong to assume that equity returns will always better bond returns by a wide margin. Equity returns were spectacular during the 1980s. UK-based investors were particularly well served by international diversification, because of the depreciation in sterling against some of the major currencies. The 21.0 per cent annualised return in Japan, for example, translated into an annualised sterling return of 31.5 per cent. Performances look very different over the first half of the 1990s. Japan has been the worst performing of the major markets and now sells in local currency terms at 54 per cent of its value at the start of the decade. The yen has continued to appreciate, however, which has eased the pain for foreign investors. The biggest losers have been the Japanese themselves who will have struggled to eke out satisfactory returns from most of the major equity markets. Equities will continue to deliver superior, long-term returns to investors prepared to take on additional risks. But long-term means long-term. And the experience of the last five years should serve as a reminder that equity returns may disappoint in the short to medium term. UK-based investors, who tend to have a relatively extreme exposure to equities, will no doubt wish to do some hard strategic thinking in the light of this experience. Despite a poor performance in 1994, UK long bonds have outperformed UK equities during the decade so far. The outperformance averages just 2 percentage points per annum, but it is the first time since 1978 that long bonds have come out on top in a rolling five year analysis. A similar analysis for the US market shows equities and bonds running neck and neck as the New Year approaches. It certainly seems highly likely that the current controversy over the scale of the equity risk premium - the excess return to be expected from equities over bonds - will become even more frenzied on both sides of the Atlantic in 1995.

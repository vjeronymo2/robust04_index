			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Mandate for no change In a week's time, Americans will go to the polls after the most mean-spirited mid-term elections in living memory. The signs are that, thanks to President Bill Clinton's recent successes abroad, the outcome for the Democratic party will be less cataclysmic than many feared. But the Congress that emerges looks unlikely to be equal to the challenges facing the country in the years ahead. A month ago, many were predicting historic victories for the Republican party in the elections on November 8. Party leaders spoke, not only of regaining control of the Senate, but of overturning the Democrats' 50-year-old majority in the House of Representatives. The elections, they claimed, had become a national referendum on Mr Clinton, and the president - and his party - were losing. Mr Clinton's creditable showing in the Middle East and elsewhere appears to have turned the anti-Democratic tide a little. But it is a reflection of the low expectations surrounding the campaign that retaining control of the House - if not the Senate - would now be seen as something of a victory for the Democrat camp. It is hard to pin the voters' discontent on the economy. Three and a half years into recovery, the country is materially better off than it has been for some time. Yet rather than reward Democrats for this performance, the electorate has seemed determined to punish them for the government's inability to solve the country's deeper social problems, such as the high crime rate and the dismal state of the inner cities. Anti-government mood In the face of this anti-government mood, Mr Clinton has increasingly turned towards foreign policy in recent months: the one domain in which government activism is not now associated with failure. Candidates in the field have not had this option. For the most part, they have simply been driven to trying to convince voters that they are as down on Washington as the country at large is. Clearly, incumbent Democrat senators and congressmen fare poorly in such an uncompromising climate. But so does anyone with a moderate, more pragmatic, conception, of what government might hope to achieve through social and other legislation. In many regions, the candidates that have thrived have been those on the extreme right, who reject moderate solutions out of hand. Bipartisan coalitions This kind of polarisation was already much in evidence this summer, in the Republicans' comprehensive blocking of health care legislation. But, judged by the campaign, the 104th Congress will be even less inclined to form bipartisan coalitions to get legislation passed. What does this imply for the rest of the world? In the short term, the events of the past few months make it even more crucial that the 'lame-duck' sitting of the current Congress, in the period just after the election, is able to ratify the outcome of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt. Whatever the difficulties this presents, mustering the required votes next year could be harder still. In the longer term, there is still a chance that Mr Clinton will return to the question of health care reform. But he will have little chance of passing the kind of comprehensive reform he promised in 1992. More incremental measures may be possible, along, perhaps, with a package of welfare reforms which might muster sufficient Respublican support. The true casualty of these elections, however, is the prospect for reforms in areas of US government which require more ambitious bipartisan coalition-building in Congress: above all, the country's bloated system of entitlements. Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats have proposed suggestions for reforming that system during the campaign which make any sense. Yet without fundamental - and politically unpopular - tax increases and cuts in spending, the federal budget deficit will begin to rise again in only a few years time. The US electorate has spent recent months bemoaning the failings of 'big' government. For all that, they seem determined to elect a new Congress which is singularly ill-equipped, either to make it any better, or to make it any smaller.</p>

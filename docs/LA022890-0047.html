			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LA FOLLETTE RETIREMENT IS SETBACK FOR PARENTS GROUP  </P> <P> San Fernando Valley parents seeking to break away from the sprawling Los  Angeles Unified School District said Tuesday they will continue their efforts  despite an announcement that their most important legislative ally is retiring.  </P> <P> The disclosure by Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge) that she  will not seek reelection to her 38th District seat surprised many of the Valley  parents, who have flooded her office with calls in recent weeks to support her  latest effort to break up the school district into eight or more smaller  districts.  </P> <P> "I just spoke with one woman who is just reeling from the news," said Rita  Morrow, a Northridge parent active in support of the break-up effort.  </P> <P> Although La Follette endorsed an aide to succeed her and said she will continue  the fight to break up the district after she retires, many of the parents who  have volunteered their help say they are now without a leader.  </P> <P> "The effort is not going to stop, whoever gets elected," said Barbara Romey, a  Northridge parent and twice a candidate for the Los Angeles school board. But  she and others conceded that La Follette's retirement will be a setback.  </P> <P> With only 10 months remaining in office, La Follette will have difficulty  following through on the breakup plan that most state and Los Angeles school  officials agree would take three to five years to complete, parents said.  </P> <P> La Follette announced her retirement plans at a news conference Tuesday and  said she favors Robert Wilcox, 24, an aide in her office since 1986, to succeed  her.  </P> <P> La Follette has spearheaded several unsuccessful legislative campaigns in past  years to break up the 708-square-mile Los Angeles school district. Frustrated  by the lack of interest among her colleagues in the Legislature, La Follette  this summer launched a plan to have the issue decided by the estimated 1.5  million registered voters who live within the boundaries of the Los Angeles  district.  </P> <P> A task force created by La Follette to study the issue held a series of public  hearings last fall. Sparse attendance, however, indicated that Valley residents  were not as interested in the assemblywoman's efforts as in previous years.  </P> <P> The campaign to break up the 610,000-student district finally caught fire with  Valley parents after the Los Angeles school board voted Feb. 5 to relieve  classroom crowding by operating schools on a year-round schedule.  </P> <P> After the board decision, many of the parents who organized opposition to  year-round schools said a break-up of the district remained the only way to  free Valley schools from overcrowding and other troubles plaguing schools in  the rest of the city. The year-round issue also brought to the surface parents'  concerns about the growing number of inner-city children bused to their  neighborhood schools.  </P> <P> Wilcox said Tuesday that he will continue to serve as executive director of La  Follette's task force studying the breakup issue and that the matter "will be  one of the most important parts of my campaign."  </P> <P> La Follette's task force is expected to release a report next month calling on  the state Board of Education to take steps toward authorizing an election on  the breakup issue.  </P> <P> State and local school officials say the breakup plan faces a host of  obstacles, including legal challenges over the creation of segregated school  districts, as well as fights over the district's $8.5 billion in property and  $164 million in unpaid bills.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jack Cheevers contributed to this story.  </P></p>

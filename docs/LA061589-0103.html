			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG ARM OF LAW TO FLEX ITS MUSCLE IN POLICE GAMES  </P> <P> Thugs, take note. Next week is not the time to knock over that Oxnard Boulevard  convenience store or that A Street bank you've been eyeing.  </P> <P> Beginning Sunday, about 5,200 police officers from throughout the state will  converge on Oxnard for the annual California Police Olympics.  </P> <P> The six-day event is expected to attract representatives from about 400  departments spanning most levels of law enforcement -- from city police  officers and county sheriff's deputies to members of the U.S. Border Patrol and  federal marshals. Even state lottery investigators are expected to compete.  </P> <P> "Oxnard is going to be a very safe place," said patrol officer patrol officer  Lee Wilco, co-chairman of the Oxnard Police Department's organizing committee.  </P> <P> It also will be crowded. City officials expect 50,000 spectators -- most of  them from out of town -- to gather to watch the long arm of the law flex its  muscle in 45 competitive events, including arm-wrestling, boxing and  bodybuilding.  </P> <P> The throngs attracted by the games are expected to pump $5 million into Oxnard  and four other Ventura County cities where events will be held and contestants  will hang their hats.  </P> <P> One of the few other times the county has seen a convention on this order, city  officials say, was when Oxnard was host for the 1985 Police Olympics, billed as  the second-largest sporting event after the international Olympics.  </P> <P> Hotels were so packed, Wilcox said, that he had to put up two competitors at  his home.  </P> <P> But despite the week's festive atmosphere, competing officers still must go by  the book. They can be disqualified, fined or even put on probation for  roughhousing, cheating or even swearing. Judges can call for a hearing on the  smallest infraction. A judge once yanked a gold medal from a foulmouthed power  lifter on his way out of the ring.  </P> <P> "John McEnroe wouldn't even get past the judges," said Bob Burke, a member of  the board of directors of the California Police Athletic Federation, which  oversees the games.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Incentive to Officers  </P> <P> Unseemly behavior, organizers say, would defeat the purpose of the games, which  were founded in 1967 as an incentive for police officers to keep in shape but  have continued as a means of generating good will.  </P> <P> "These are mainly people who get in the paper for shooting someone," Burke  said. "We want to show them in a positive light."  </P> <P> As in the conventional Olympics, the top three competitors in each category win  gold, silver or bronze medals. But in the police version, competitors who place  fourth and fifth also take home medals -- and the thrill of victory.  </P> <P> "It hurts so good," said Jim Struck, an Oxnard police officer who last year won  gold medals in the light-heavyweight boxing and karate divisions. To make sure  he gets to repeat the experience, Struck said he has been working out two hours  daily on a punching bag and in the ring.  </P> <P> Other competitors have been as earnest. Take Sgt. Easie Williams, a Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department detective who coaches the largest boxing team in  the competition. He has been pitting his 10 charges against each other in 12 to  15 rounds a week -- that on top of a running regime of two to three miles  daily, plus weightlifting.  </P> <P> "These guys aren't fooling around," Wilcox said. "It's fierce competition."  </P> <P> </P> <P> World-Class Athletes  </P> <P> In fact, some competitors such as George Lopez, who will box in the 156-pound  weight class Wednesday and Friday, are world-class athletes.  </P> <P> A 29-year-old community relations officer for the Los Angeles Police  Department, Lopez fought for Argentina in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, where he  was defeated by Ray Downey, the Canadian boxer who went on to win a bronze  medal.  </P> <P> "He's got a good, crisp jab," said Larry Moore, who coaches Lopez as the Police  Department's athletic director.  </P> <P> Competitors will begin arriving Sunday, although the action does not begin  until 8 a.m. the next day, with the triathlon through Oxnard State Beach behind  the Embassy Suites Hotel, headquarters for the games. Admission to all events  is free.  </P> <P> The competitive roster includes such Olympian staples as tennis, rowing, track  and field, and equestrian events. Many contests, however, are tailored to the  talents of police officers -- arm-wrestling, pistol shooting and contests with  police dogs. Such events as surfing, water-skiing and scuba highlight the  "California" in the competition's name.  </P> <P> Organizers expect the boxing matches, which begin at 7 p.m. Monday, Wednesday  and Friday in the Oxnard Civic Auditorium, to attract the widest following.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boxing Fans  </P> <P> On one night alone in 1985, boxing attracted more than 2,000 fans, the  auditorium's capacity. To catch any overflow this year, organizers plan to pipe  fights via cable television into two adjacent conference rooms.  </P> <P> It is that sort of attention to detail that won Oxnard the 1989 bid over two  other cities. Organizers said they were impressed by the welcome they received  in 1985. At the time, Oxnard was the smallest city to have hosted the  California games.  </P> <P> "Usually you don't get that much community support," said Duke Nyhus, the  founder of the games and the executive director of the California Police  Athletics Federation.  </P> <P> In return, Oxnard will go down in history as home to the last California Police  Olympics. In an attempt to avoid a dispute with the International Olympic  Committee, which has sought to enjoin police organizations in other states from  referring to their games as "Olympics," the California Police Athletics  Federation plans to change the name of the event to the California Police  Summer Games beginning in 1990.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lengthy Planning  </P> <P> But Oxnard's role has not come without sacrifice. The Oxnard Police Department  has already invested three years in planning the games. Since September, Wilcox  and another officer have been relieved of regular duties to devote themselves  full time to organizing the games.  </P> <P> The event is expected to cost the city $350,000, which it hopes to recoup  through entrance fees for participants, although some cities have not been so  successful. Newport Beach, for instance, lost money when it was the host for  the games in 1986, organizers said.  </P> <P> While many existing facilities were suited to particular events, such as the  L.A. Raiders training field where daily soccer games will be held, others had  to be jury-rigged. Organizers, aided by Santa Paula Honda Automobiles, had to  build a race track on the future site of a housing development at Gonzales Road  and Oxnard Boulevard for motocross events Wednesday and Thursday.  </P> <P> Some streets will be closed next Thursday and Friday to make way for a  decathlon and a 50-mile bike ride. What's more, organizers plan to tap the  services of more than 500 volunteers.  </P> <P> "It's a tremendous undertaking," said Mayor Nao Takasugi, "but it brings  recognition to the city of Oxnard and gives it an economic boost, and builds  police morale."  </P></p>

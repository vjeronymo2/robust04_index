			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives at Bournemouth: Brittan and Howe hit back on EU Two of the leading pro-Europeans in the Conservative party yesterday hit back at calls from rightwing Tories for Britain to distance itself from Europe, arguing that this could lead to the government's defeat at the next general election. In another sign of the divisions over the European Union which have resurfaced at this week's conference, Sir Leon Brittan, one of the UK's European commissioners, and Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, angrily denounced a recent string of attacks on Brussels by the right of the party. They were joined last night by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who reasserted his call for Britain's place to remain at the heart of Europe. Sir Leon, addressing a fringe meeting of the Conservative Group for Europe, issued a thinly veiled attack on Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, describing his recent call for Britain to leave the EU as 'damaging and dangerous'. He said: 'People have been indulging in fantasy. If things go on in this way, we are on the road to extremism and xenophobia'. He did not refer by name to Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, who made a powerful attack on the EU in his conference speech this week. However, Sir Leon warned that there were leading anti-Europeans in the party who did not admit that they wanted the UK to leave Europe, 'but who are acting to pull us in that direction whether they say so or not'. In a speech to the Tory Reform Group last night Lord Howe attacked Mr Lamont's 'complacent assertions' about Europe and mocked calls by rightwing Tories for the adoption of a clear anti-European stance against Labour. 'Wrapping ourselves in the union jack would simply be a prelude to burial at sea, in clear blue water, somewhere out in the mid-Atlantic,' he said. He added that any move to reduce the UK's links with Europe would not be accepted by the British people or by industry. 'There is no majority in Britain for isolation or independence on those terms, however deceptively packaged in the Europhobes' rhetoric of self-government,' he said. Both speeches added to speculation that the party could face a serious split in the run up to the European inter-governmental conference in 1996, which will map out the EU's institutional structure. However, Lord Howe also argued that the party was on the verge of a tough internal battle over how to respond to Mr Tony Blair's recent election as Labour leader, and that it would be dangerous to move any further to the right. In the first admission by a senior Tory figure of the threat posed by the Labour leader, Lord Howe said that Mr Blair's election 'could prove the most important political event in the last two decades'. He added: 'Its long-range effect could rank with Margaret Thatcher's re-definition of the centre ground in 1975-79 as one of those periodic shifts that radically alter the terms of political debate in Britain. 'The best way of meeting and beating the Blair challenge is emphatically not by pressing on regardless to the right,' he said. 'Establishing as much clear blue water between ourselves and Labour is the Pavlovian response of a party on a suicide mission.' Mr Heseltine, in a speech to a fringe meeting, listed what he called Britain's clear interests and objectives in the EU's development. 'We must recognise that the European Union is here, is going to remain and has been responsible for an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity on our continent,' he said.</p>

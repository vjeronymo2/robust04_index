			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Worries over interest rates and the weakness in the fixed income markets prompted selling in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 3,184, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 briefly moved ahead and touched 3,188 before the worries on inflation and interest rates took hold. The contract then went into decline, with the retreat in the fixed income markets leading to further pressure on September. Continuous selling saw it fall to 3,157, just shy of the 3,155 support level, and the premium to cash was significantly reduced in the process. Dealers reported active arbitrage activity as the premium between the cash and futures narrowed, with traders busily buying September and selling equities. The contract ended at 3,158, down 17 from the previous day's close and around two points above the fair value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume was 9,477 contracts. In traded options, turnover returned to more modest levels. Some 24,227 contracts were dealt, against 36,649 lots on Wednesday. Just over 7,300 contracts were transacted in the FT-SE 100 option, and British Steel was the most active among the stock options with a total of 2,615 lots. It was followed by HSBC at 1,841 contracts and National Power at 1,467.</p>

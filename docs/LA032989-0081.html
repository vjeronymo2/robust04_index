			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SPONSORS OF SUNRISE SERVICE LEFT IN DEBT  </P> <P> A smaller-than-expected turnout for the 69th Easter sunrise service at the  Hollywood Bowl Sunday left the volunteer sponsors with a $20,000 deficit,  producer-director Norma Foster said Tuesday.  </P> <P> An estimated 6,500 worshipers attended the service instead of the hoped-for  15,000. Foster attributed the small crowd to weather forecasts signaling a  chance of rain. "It showered briefly about 3 or 3:30 a.m., about the time when  many would have been rising, but the skies were clear after that," she said.  </P> <P> Foster said this year's service had a budget of $53,000, of which $33,000 went  for labor costs for lighting, sound and stage operations. This was the first  time in three years under Foster's direction that the program has finished in  the red; in previous years shortfalls were common, once as high as $30,000.  </P></p>

			<p>Cooperation   <F P=102>   NC3005091694 Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA in Greek 29  May 94 p 43 </F>  <F P=103> NC3005091694 </F> <F P=104>  Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA </F> <F P=105>  Greek </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Marnellos] </F>   [Excerpts] Cooperation between the antiterrorist services  and U.S. teams that are participating in the efforts to  dismantle the 17 November terrorist organization will be  changing.    The amendment of the cooperation status with the Americans  is  one of the three parts included in the reorganization of the  Antiterrorist Service (IAEV) [expansion unknown].    According to a police source, Greek authorities were not  satisfied with the cooperation with the Americans because they  were only taking information without providing any. Thus, the  Greek officers often felt like investigative employees for the  Americans, who continued their investigations after every  terrorist action without providing any information.    Of course, the cooperation with the Americans will not be  suspended, but there will be an effort to become equal. The  Greek authorities need U.S. assistance, in means and  information, which until now had not been sufficient.    The issue of equal cooperation was raised by Minister of  Public Order Stilianos Papathemelis during his visit to the  United States two months ago. He received assurances that the  cooperation would be improved.    The other two parts of the reorganization provide for the  establishment of a group of 15 to 20 scientists with various  specialties, who will be advising the director of the  antiterrorist staff, and for more flexible operations of the  existing four departments of the service.    The scientific staff, in English called a think-tank  (reservoir of thought) will be manned by experts who specialize  in analyzing leaflets, economists, sociologists, electronic  translators, and analysts of information from foreign and local  publications, and so forth. [passage omitted]    The third and last part of the reorganization aims at  disengaging those serving in inactive departments of the  antiterrorist unit and greater coherence and flexibility among  the four departments of the antiterrorist service. The service  is expected to operate in its new form by the summer, while any  pertinent decisions [not specified] are expected to be announced  officially in the next few days.</p>

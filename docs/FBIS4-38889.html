			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov: "Two Banks of One River. </F> Dniester Region and Moldavia at Negotiating Table"]    [Text] As you know, the meetings in April between the  president of Moldavia [Moldova] and the Dniester Moldavian  [Moldovan] Republic ended with the signing of a statement in the  presence of representatives of the CSCE and the Russian  president, which speaks of the need to resolve all contentious  issues solely by means of talks and by peaceful means alone.  Mircea Snegur and Igor Smirnov agreed on the need to define the  state-legal status of the Dniester Region as well as the need  for a phased program to establish and implement state-legal  relations and delegate and demarcate the sides' powers.    The latest meeting at expert level is now in preparation.  But Mircea Snegur believes that the talks will nonetheless be  hard. Kishinev [Chisinau] is considering defining the status of  the Dniester Region within the framework of a single state.  Especially since the statement signed by the two presidents is  based on the principle of the unity and territorial integrity of  the Republic of Moldova. Tiraspol has not as yet revealed its  view of the state-legal status of its unrecognized republic.  But, in Mircea Snegur's opinion, the DMR wants more --  federalization or even confederalization. Incidentally, this  conclusion is prompted by the Dniester Moldavian Republic's  support for the idea of legalizing unrecognized states put  forward by Robert Kocharyan, chairman of the Nagorno-Karabakh  State Defense Committee.    It is also obvious that Russia's position will still  particularly influence the settlement of the Dniester problem.  Incidentally, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has learned that the latest ninth  round of Russian-Moldavian talks on the status of the Russian  Army in Moldavia will be held in Moscow 7-8 June 1994. As you  know, progress at these talks depends completely on Moldavia's  granting the Dniester Region state-legal status.</p>

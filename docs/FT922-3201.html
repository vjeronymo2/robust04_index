			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Short rates softer SHORT rates in the sterling cash market were slightly softer yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a shortage of only Pounds 100m in its morning operations. The overnight rate dropped to 9 1/2 per cent from yesterday's close of around 10 per cent, after the Bank announced the small shortage. It later dropped further to a low of 8 1/2 per cent, but closed at 9 1/4 per cent. 1-month sterling libor ended at 9 7/8 per cent from a previous close of 9 15/16 per cent. Everything from 2-month to 3-month sterling libor ended down  1/16 per cent at 9 15/16 per cent on the day. Traders said that the softening of rates was due to purely technical factors. However, the market appears to have shrugged off the temptation to be bearish about base rates after sterling dropped nearly 3/4 of a pfennig on the foreign exchange markets. One discount house dealer said he was surprised that longer term rates for sterling libor were softer following sterling's losses. Another trader said that the market was so dead yesterday that it would have been hard for any factor to move it significantly one way or the other. The market's attention is now focused on the big shortages that will arise in the next fortnight as the second quarter comes to an end. Yesterday, traders were positioning themselves for the much tighter credit conditions expected next week. 1-week and 2-week money was keenly bid, and short-dated paper was sold with the aim of buying it back in due course at higher rates. The market waited until the afternoon to take out the shortage. The Bank purchased Pounds 22m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 100m of Band-2 bank bills also at 9 7/8 per cent. Sterling futures were mostly unchanged. The September contract closed at 90.23, up one tick. This reflects the market's view that 3-month sterling libor in September will be at 9.77 per cent. December sterling ended the day unchanged at 90.48, reflecting the view that 3-month libor will be at 9.52 per cent by the end of the year. Some traders still see these figures as rather bearish over base rates, with the market barely discounting a  1/2 per cent cut between now and the end of the year.</p>

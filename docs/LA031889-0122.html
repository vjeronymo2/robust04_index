			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JURY URGES STUDY ON 24-HOUR USE OF COUNTY VEHICLES  </P> <P> The Orange County Grand Jury, concerned about the number of county employees  who drive county cars home at night, has recommended that the practice be  closely monitored and, where possible, eliminated to save money and reduce  liability.  </P> <P> More than 100 county employees use county cars, vans or pickup trucks to  commute on a daily basis, according to a grand jury report released this week.  About 12 of those employees live in Los Angeles or Riverside counties, and at  least one employee makes a daily 100-mile round trip in a county vehicle. The  report said the practice costs the county about $250,000 a year, too much  considering the county's current budget troubles.  </P> <P> James O. Lindberg, the grand jury foreman, said that although some use of  county vehicles for personal commuting may be in the county's best interest,  "it appears that, with county budgets so tight, considerable savings are  possible by limiting the use of county vehicles."  </P> <P> Orange County has a fleet of 1,300 vehicles operated by its 13,000 full-time  employees. About 100 of the vehicles are assigned to employees on a 24-hour  basis, 61 to Environmental Management Agency employees and 40 to Fire  Department employees.  </P> <P> Many of those who drive their vehicles home are top fire officials, public  works employees and building inspectors who must respond to emergencies or  drive from their homes directly to construction sites.  </P> <P> But the grand jury said county officials have made no attempt to assign  employees with take-home vehicles to jobs near their residences to reduce  driving distances and wear and tear on county cars.  </P> <P> Bill B. Wills, foreman pro tem of the grand jury who coordinated the vehicle  review, said the county should consider establishing a maximum commute distance  for those who drive county cars home. He also recommended that the county  prohibit any of its vehicles from being taken outside the county except on  official business. And he urged that the county establish an annual review of  which employees have take-home privileges for county vehicles.  </P> <P> "We believe that management in various county departments needs to take a  serious look at whether this practice is in the best interest of the taxpayer,"  Wills said. "It has been handled rather loosely, and that is of some concern to  us."  </P> <P> A county spokesman said the grand jury's report will be studied and the  recommended action taken under consideration.  </P></p>

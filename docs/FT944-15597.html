			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Mitsubishi to launch Dutch-made hatchback Mitsubishi Motors is to begin its first car production in Europe in the first half of next year at its joint venture plant in the Netherlands, Mr Hiroshi Ninomiya, president of Mitsubishi Motor Sales Europe, said last night. The company aims to achieve production of up to 100,000 Mitsubishi cars a year by 1997 at the Nedcar plant, which it owns jointly with Volvo, the Swedish carmaker, and the Dutch government, each holding a one-third stake. The partners are investing Fl 3.4bn (Dollars 1.9bn) in the project to modernise the former Volvo Car BV plant at Born in the Netherlands in order to create a total capacity to produce 200,000 cars a year, which will be shared equally by Mitsubishi and Volvo. Mr Ninomiya disclosed in a speech at the Birmingham motor show that Mitsubishi would initially launch from the Dutch plant a five-door hatchback car, code-named MX, between its existing Mitsubishi Lancer and Galant ranges in size. It is expected to be followed later by a four-door saloon version, and possibly an estate car. It will compete directly with rivals such as the Ford Mondeo and the Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier, as well as the European-built products of other Japanese carmakers such as the Nissan Primera and the Toyota Carina, both assembled in the UK. The new car will be unveiled at the Amsterdam motor show in January and will go on sale in continental European markets from mid-1995 and in the UK from November next year. The Volvo version of the new range, which is expected eventually to replace the current Dutch-built Volvo 400, will have a different exterior and interior styling and is expected to be unveiled in the autumn next year. Mitsubishi is following the same strategy as its Japanese competitors by choosing the large family car sector of the European car market for its first locally-built products in Europe. Mr Ninomiya said the local European content of the new Mitsubishi range would exceed 85 per cent. Purchases from components suppliers in Europe for the Mitsubishi car alone are expected to total more than Fl 1bn a year by the time output reaches 100,000 cars a year, the company said yesterday. More than 150 suppliers have already been selected in Europe, including some local European subsidiaries of Japanese components groups, such as Calsonic in the UK, which will supply radiators and cooling systems. Mitsubishi plans to import all its petrol engines (in 1.6 and 1.8 litre) and automatic gearboxes from Japan, but it is understood that it will buy a 1.9 litre diesel engine and all its manual gearboxes from Renault, the French carmaker. Mr Ninomiya said that Mitsubishi had drawn heavily on the latest Japanese production technology to modernise the Dutch plant, organised along the lines of its Mizushima plant in Japan. Mitsubishi said it planned initially to achieve around 20 hours per car assembly time at the Born plant, but this would be reduced later to 17 hours per car when full capacity was reached. It would take around 7 minutes to change the tools on the heavy stamping presses. The plant will include 305 robots. Around half of the Fl 3.4bn earmarked for the Nedcar project had been invested to date. Mr Ninomiya said Mitsubishi Motors, the third largest Japanese vehicle producer, was seeking a 5 per cent share of the global vehicle market by 2000. To achieve this goal it was aiming to raise its share of the domestic Japanese market from 12 to 15 per cent, to increase its share of the Asian and Asean market from 20 to 25 per cent and to gain a 2 per cent share of the combined European and US markets.</p>

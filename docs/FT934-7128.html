			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Plays to please You never can tell about new productions in advance, least of all a critic, but it seems that some remarkably promising performances are coming up. Take the Royal National Theatre where the two parts of Tony Kushner's Angels in America open this weekend. Part One, Millennium Approaches, has already been seen. Part Two, Perestroika, is new. This is serious stuff, brilliantly done, but not for the queasy. The RNT also has its lighter side, giving a third and final run to Alan Bennett's wonderfully staged adaptation of The Wind in the Willows from December 1. The Royal Shakespeare Company is coming on strong, too. Previews of the new production of Macbeth, with Derek Jacobi and Cheryl Campbell as the Macbeths, open on December 1, directed by Adrian Noble. Given the ticket sales for Noble's earlier production of Hamlet, book early. You can just catch another brilliant Hamlet at the Donmar Warehouse where the Prince is played as a much younger man than usual by Alan Cumming. It finishes at the end of this month, but the same actor is due to star in a revival of the musical Cabaret at the same place from December 9. A musical entertainment that looks promising is Piaf with Elaine Paige directed by Sir Peter Hall at the Piccadilly. Previews start on December 8. Of the longer runners, you must see David Mamet's Oleanna at the Duke of York's. It concerns illiberalism and sexual harassment in an American university. Everyone talks and argues about it afterwards, which is the supreme mark of a successful grown-up play. In a not dissimilar style, Harold Pinter's new play Moonlight shines more brightly now that it has moved from the Almeida to the Comedy. It runs only till the end of the year. Since I suspect it may be Pinter's valedictory, see it. There are two Noel Cowards. Tome Conti's enjoyable production of Present Laughter, in which Conti also stars, will end at the Globe at Christmas. Relative Values, starring Susan Hampshire, has just opened at the newly restored Savoy and, as Coward's last good play, provides a great deal of pleasure. Do not overlook one of the best English comedies of all time. Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer is playing at the Queen's with Donald Sinden and a splendid cast all round. This could be the biggest treat of the lot.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today in Rio de Janeiro, Bishop Luciano Mendes,  president of the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops, said  that President Itamar Franco is handling the crisis with the  judicial branch correctly. According to Mendes, the president  has been showing goodwill and he is seeking to reach an  agreement that does not harm the Brazilian people:    [Begin Mendes recording] Our expectation is that in such a  moment [words indistinct] generalized and reach a situation in  which the Federal Supreme Court, STF, would accept indications  about the collective agreement renewal date for payment of  salaries to its personnel; would give up interpreting the  provisional measure text as if it called for moving up the date  to convert salaries into the Real Value Unit, URV; and the  president would see his proposal accepted, as he expected. It is  expected of the president, however, that he recognizes the STF's  autonomy and authority. [end recording]    Despite disagreements between these government branches,  Mendes believes the two institutions will be strengthened by the  crisis and that democracy in our country will become more  consolidated.</p>

During the  get-together, leaders of the army, navy, air force, and armed  police force units briefed each other on progress they had made  in their work in the past year.    Last year, the army, navy, air force, and armed police force  units followed the principle for army development set by General  Secretary Jiang Zemin--politically up to standard, militarily  qualified, fine work style, strict discipline, and efficient  logistics service. They have carried forward the tradition  handed over by Red Army veterans, worked together with one heart  and one mind, and united with each other. They have performed  outstandingly in fulfilling military training, building  grass-roots organizations, safeguarding stability, fighting  natural disasters, and carrying out relief operations. Their  performance has been appreciated by Army headquarters.    Major General Ren Yonggui, member of the provincial party  committee standing committee and commander of the provincial  military district, addressed the get-together, airing his views  on how to further carry forward the army's glorious tradition,  build up the servicemen's good image, strengthen unity between  the Army and the government and between the Army and the people,  actively support local economic construction, and intensify and  enhance national defense.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ODD KICK RETURN PROPELS BEVERLY HILLS PAST HARVARD  </P> <P> Harvard High had not beaten archrival Beverly Hills since 1983 and had dropped  12 of the past 13 meetings with the Normans.  </P> <P> But this was supposed to be the year.  </P> <P> The Division VII Saracens entered Saturday's home game with a 2-0 record, and  the Division III Normans limped in at 0-2. Add to that the fact that Beverly  Hills had skipped two days of practice because of Rosh Hashanah, and the  outlook looked bright for the boys of Harvard.  </P> <P> However, all that prognostication didn't take into account a quirky kickoff  return that helped propel Beverly Hills to a 24-12 nonleague win at Harvard.  </P> <P> With Harvard leading, 6-3, early in the third quarter, Beverly Hills' Darren  Smith fielded a kickoff at his own 20, where he immediately fumbled. The ball  bounced 10 yards in front of him and through a swarm of about a dozen players.  Smith quickly appeared on the other side of the cluster, picked up the ball and  raced untouched for a touchdown and a 10-6 lead.  </P> <P> "That was a real deflater," Harvard Coach Gary Thran said. "Sometimes you're  faced with a situation that you just can't do anything about."  </P> <P> That helpless feeling continued as the Saracens watched Beverly Hills  quarterback Ziv Gottlieb connect for a pair of third-quarter touchdown passes  and a 24-6 lead.  </P> <P> Gottlieb, who completed 11 of 24 passes for 157 yards, hit David Saraf on a  49-yard scoring play and found tight end Carl Benedetti from six yards.  </P> <P> Harvard had taken the 6-3 lead on the first drive of the second half, when  Iheanyi Uwaezuoke caught a 32-yard touchdown pass from reserve quarterback Greg  Peters. Bobby Bell added a 33-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

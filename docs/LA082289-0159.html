			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CONVENTION ROLL CALLER, 72, RESIGNS  </P> <P> Dorothy Bush, who has called the roll of the states at every Democratic  National Convention since 1944, resigned today as the party's secretary.  </P> <P> Bush, 72, is familiar to convention watchers as the person who, since the 1944  convention that nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt, called on the state  delegations to announce their votes.  </P> <P> When she assumed the secretary's job at age 27, she was the youngest person to  hold the post and the first female. She is no relation to President Bush.  </P> <P> "What a great experience I have had -- serving with 17 chairmen and heaven  knows how many wonderful members and friends -- and through the administrations  of 10 presidents," Bush noted in a resignation letter to DNC Chairman Ron  Brown.  </P></p>

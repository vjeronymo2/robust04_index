Our  correspondent Izabella Ginor, who interviewed Posuvalyuk from  our studio, asked him about the results of his many meetings  with 'Arafat.    The Russian envoy said he conveyed to 'Arafat a letter from  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev which underscored the need to  pursue the talks and meet the commitment which the peace process  imposes on us. At the same time the letter underlined Russia's  commitment as a permanent member of the Security Council and a  superpower.    Posuvalyuk went on to say that as a superpower, Russia will  do everything within its power to implement the Security Council  resolution. This is what he spoke about with 'Arafat, as well  as about concrete issues such as 'Arafat's upcoming visit to  Moscow on 19 April.    Ginor asked Posuvalyuk whether after five meetings with  'Arafat in Tunis, and as a special Russian envoy to the Middle  East, he intends to visit Jerusalem as well. The Russian said  that five days ago he met Israel's ambassador to Moscow and  later Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir in Tunis.  Posuvalyuk told his Israeli interlocutors in no uncertain terms  that he wants to come to Israel soon in order to hold in-depth  talks about bilateral relations and Russia's intended role in  the Middle East. Posuvalyuk said he received favorable  reactions to his request and the only question remains that of  timing, seeing that Israel is on the eve of a holiday. He  stated, however, that he would like to come to Israel as soon as  possible.    The Russian envoy stressed Russia's expected role in the  area. He said Russia wants to play a quiet, constructive, and  creative role. Asked by Ginor whether his many meetings with  'Arafat do not indicate that Russia is coordinating its moves  with the PLO, Posuvalyuk was actually offended, saying it was a  rude question. He said that the PLO was an independent party to  the peace process and that Russia is one of the cosponsors of  the process. It is not a matter of coordination, rather of  reciprocal relations and a certain overlapping of aims and  practical missions.    Ginor asked Posuvalyuk if he solved with 'Arafat the issue  of  the international presence, which caused so many difficulties on  the path to resuming the talks. The Russian answered that the  issue was in principle dealt with in the Security Council  resolution and is now being discussed by all the sides. We will  have to find the optimal formula from among the many ideas  introduced. Posuvalyuk said in his opinion a compromise will be  found in the form of some kind of international observers. The  special Russian envoy believes these will be UN observers with a  finely-nuanced status and political equipment -- and other  equipment as well. Posuvalyuk emphasized that Russia is in  principle very interested in participating in this international  presence, whatever form it finally takes.    We asked the Russian envoy about the possibility of a  meeting  between Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin -- who is scheduled to  visit Moscow several days after 'Arafat. Posuvalyuk claimed  that so far there is no such meeting on the agenda.  Hypothetically, however, a summit between Rabin and 'Arafat --  in Moscow or elsewhere -- could directly contribute to the  success of the peace process.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] If nothing worthwhile comes out of this week's  written question-and-answer exchange between Mr Gerry Adams and  Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sinn Fein  will have gained a propaganda victory. There will be grounds  for accusing the Dublin government of folly, if not mischief, in  pressing Britain so hard to extend the written dialogue with the  Republicans.    For now, Sir Patrick's explanation -- that merely answering  questions does not represent the "clarification" which he and Mr  Major ruled out when Sinn Fein first responded to the Downing  Street Declaration -- seems narrowly tenable. The original  demand for "clarification" seemed to mean negotiation in all but  name -- an impression borne out by Mr Adams's refusal to say  exactly what he wanted -- while the IRA continued to exert  pressure by means of terrorism.    If Mr Adams is still merely playing for time, further  disingenuous inquiries will no doubt be forthcoming from Sinn  Fein, designed to inch the Government ever closer to the  negotiating table. The form of some of Sinn Fein's current  questions invites such suspicion. For instance, "What are the  means and within what time does Britain expect to see agreement  reached between all the Irish people?" is tantamount to  demanding a timetable for a united Ireland. On this and other  points, Mr Adams should be directed towards the relevant  passages of the Declaration. The Government cannot prudently go  further, in advance of a permanent IRA cease-fire.    There remains the possibility, however, that Britain's  uncompromising tactics have started to bear fruit. Sinn Fein  may at last realise that negotiation is unattainable without a  cease-fire. Answers to his questions may enable Mr Adams, who is  alleged to be among the Sinn Fein "peace party", to win over  some of the more militant IRA cadres without losing face. If  Sir Patrick is merely issuing prolix statements of the obvious,  thereby assisting Mr Adams to get off the hook on which he has  publicly impaled himself, the risk he is taking might yet prove  worthwhile.    Dublin's position is less straight-forward. By adding its  own voice to Mr Adams's request for answers from Sir Patrick,  the Irish government has chosen to vouch for the good faith of  this latest initiative. But the Irish government's agreement to  use its influence with Britain in this way imposes a duty to  apply equal pressure in the other direction. As we have said  before, Dublin's principal responsibility now is to use its  weight to educate and moderate Nationalist and Republican  sentiment, in Ireland and elsewhere, while not upsetting, Ulster  Unionist opinion. In the wake of Sir Patrick's replies, Dublin  must move to assure Irish and world opinion that Britain will  have done all it could reasonably be expected to do.</p>

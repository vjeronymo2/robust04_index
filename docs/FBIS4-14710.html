			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Appeal to the Abkhazian people from the movement "For a </F> Peaceful Abkhazia!" issued on 20 March; place not given: "We  Will Be Forced To Oppose Ardzinba's Regime With Weapons in Our  Hands!"]    [Text] Dear Compatriots!    The representatives of the movement "For a Peaceful  Abkhazia!" are appealing to you once again.    Our dear brothers and sisters! History will not forgive our  indifference and passivity in the face of the total catastrophe  threatening the small Abkhazian nation. Therefore, we appealed  to the UN secretary general, the president of the Russian  Federation, and the chairman of the Republic of Georgia  Parliament-head of state to adopt the most urgent and cardinal  measures for the most speedy peaceful settlement in Abkhazia.  In our appeal, we asked them to use all the levers at their  disposal to force Ardzinba and his grouping to engage in a  constructive dialogue, abandon their sick ambitions of which the  Abkhazian people and the representatives of other nations living  in Abkhazia have become hostages.    In our appeal, we warned that, if our voice was not heard,  we  would be forced to oppose the Ardzinba regime with weapons in  our hands because the fate of the Abkhazian people was in danger.    Unfortunately, no one, as yet, has responded to our appeal.  Therefore, we ask all those who hold dear the fate of our fine  motherland Abkhazia and the fate of our children: Help us so  that our voice may be heard by the authoritative leaders of  international organizations and the heads of states and social  movements who could contribute to the matter of the speediest  settlement of the conflict.    We appeal once more to all the inhabitants of Abkhazia, to  all who, by the will of fate, found themselves on Abkhazian land  with weapons in their hands: Enough bloodshed and violence!  Let the coming spring of 1994 be a spring of hope and peace!    Our appeal is not a cry of despair; it is a call from the  souls of people who realize that we all stand on the edge of the  abyss. We are ready to turn our weapons on those politicians who  have lost their sense of reality in order to prevent our people  from perishing.</p>

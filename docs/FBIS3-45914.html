			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondents Chang Sheng-tai (1728 5110 1486) </F> and Kuo Hung-Chin (6753 1347 3112): "In Seeking Reunification,  Mainland China Has Even Considered Changing National Name"]    [Text] Beijing, 17 Jan (LIEN HO PAO)--An official who has  participated in the CPC's policymaking on Taiwan affairs has  disclosed that the CPC has indeed considered changing its  national name for the sake of reunification if this is necessary.    This person who is chiefly consulted on Taiwan affairs by  the  CPC said: The "one country, two systems" pattern advanced by  Deng Xiaoping has always been the CPC's basic principle for  reunifying Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. However, regarding the  substantial contents of "one country, two systems," there is a  lot of room for discussion. Such questions as how the  government is to be composed and what the future national name  will be can be settled when the two sides of the Taiwan Strait  come together and talk. He cited Mao Zedong's joke that,  throughout his life, Mao Zedong was most unhappy about changing  the national name from the Republic of China to the PRC. This  person pointed out: The point the CPC sticks to is  "reunification." It also agrees to Taiwan's demand of "being  master of its own affairs." The only thing that cannot be  changed is that Taiwan cannot have independence or pursue the  existence of two separate countries.    This important policymaker pointed out: The CPC has indeed  studied specific questions regarding one country, two systems  including the question of a national name. But before the two  sides hold face-to-face talks, the CPC will never show its "one  country, two systems" hand, regarding the national name and form  of government, because the CPC maintains that once they have  shown their hand, the Taiwan authorities will not want to talk.  Therefore, although the CPC has some ideas about the "one  country, two systems," it will not publicize the specific  contents.    Concerning whether or not the CPC-proposed "one country, two  systems" principle will change in the future, this person did  not think that was possible. He said that "one country, two  systems" is already the CPC's bottom line for its reunification  policy and that any further concessions are out of the question.</p>

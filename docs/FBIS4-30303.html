			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Comrade Kim Chong-il is Beacon of Mankind and Symbol of </F> Anti-Imperialist Struggle" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Moscow, June 21 (KCNA) -- A.A. Rapin, secretary of  the Central Committee of the All-Union Bolshevik Communist  Party, had an interview with the KCNA correspondent in Moscow on  June 20 on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the start of  work by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the Central  Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK].    A.A. Rapin stressed:    Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great man of the world, is a symbol  of all the people who are against the scheme to establish  international order under the manipulation of the U.S.  imperialists, a beacon of mankind and an emblem of the  international anti-imperialist struggle.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's start of work at the  Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea 30 years ago  was a historical event of epochal significance in strengthening  and development of the WPK and in the development of the Korean  revolution.    The WPK has made a distinguished contribution to the  development on the international communist movement.    A clear example is that the WPK proposed to adopt the  "Pyongyang declaration" signed by more than 210 communist and  workers' parties and revolutionary and progressive parties of  the world.    The "Pyongyang declaration" is a banner of struggle and  victory which gives hope to human beings and arouses them to a  new struggle.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has made a great  contribution to the development of the international communist  movement by publishing many famous works including "The  historical lesson in building socialism and the general line of  our party," "On the fundamentals of revolutionary party  building" and "Abuses of socialism are intolerable."    His works solemnly declared that although socialism was  frustrated in the Soviet Union and some other countries, it  would not change the desire of the world people for their  liberation.    Works of Comrade Kim Chong-il were a powerful ideological  weapon which practically dealt a fatal blow at the bourgeois  propaganda campaign of the world.    Comrade Kim Chong-il, marshal of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea, is an outstanding military strategist and an  ever-victorious, iron-willed brilliant commander.    It is not accidental that the DPRK is fully ready to make a  decisive counter-attack on the imperialist adventurers under the  outstanding guidance of Comrade Marshal Kim Chong-il, supreme  commander of the Korean Peoples' Army, at the most difficult  time when the U.S. imperialists are scheming to isolate and  stifle the DPRK, a small country.    The imperialists dare not pounce upon the DPRK because of  the  iron will and unrivalled grit of Comrade Kim Chong-il.    We will actively propagandize achievements of the DPRK, the  wisdom of the guidance of the Korean leadership in particular.</p>

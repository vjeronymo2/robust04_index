			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Personal View: Case for a second tier The news of the probable demise of the USM - the London Stock Ex-change's inelegant name for its second-tier market - crept into the press recently with barely a whimper. Analysts were wheeled out to proclaim that the market had had its day, and that most companies on the Unlisted Securities Market ought now to move up to the main listed market. How short memories are. In the heady days of the 1980s the ability to raise equity capital on the USM at an early stage in a company's development was seen as one of the main factors in stimulating the growth of new enterprises. The London Stock Exchange created the USM primarily because it had been criticised for its poor record in encouraging small companies to raise risk capital. But it did so with mixed feelings. There is a fundamental contradiction between the objectives of those responsible for promoting the main listed market, who seek to prove that only companies of the highest standards are listed, and those responsible for promoting a second tier market, who have to accept that some companies might present a high risk to the potential investor. To have both markets run by the the stock exchange was therefore always likely to produce tensions. Not only were both markets run by the same exchange, they were run by the same department within that exchange. It was a fundamental error to give responsibility for both to the Quotations Department, which was always uneasy about the USM's lower listing standards. Despite the phenomenal growth of the second tier market during the mid-1980s, those responsible at that time for assessing whether it met the needs of industry were reaching some uncomfortable conclusions. The Quotations Department was so risk-averse that virtually no companies were admitted to the USM under the listing requirement for the financing of greenfield projects. This meant that in addition to the USM there continued to exist a market outside the exchange. It was the continued existence of an unregulated over-the-counter market outside the exchange and the perceived shortcomings of the USM that ultimately led to the creation of the Third Market by the exchange. But once again, the innate conservatism of the Quotations Department had the effect of strangling this infant at birth. With the introduction of the various EC listing directives, which narrowed the differences in the listing requirements of main and second tier markets, the exchange took the opportunity to close the Third Market altogether and to review the conditions for listing on the USM. It now appears that this review will conclude that there should be no difference between listing requirements on the USM and the main market. Hence it is probable that the USM will be closed down. The timing is dreadful. The growth in the number of companies coming on to the USM has closely mirrored the growth of the economy in general. Indeed, as the economy went into recession, the number of companies using the USM to raise capital nearly reached vanishing point. Now, with the economy apparently beginning to recover, it is vital to have in place a healthy second tier market to encourage the growth of new companies. The stock exchange will never be able to run a second tier market with enthusiasm. Its job, like that of the New York Stock Exchange, is to provide retail investors with a safe haven for their investments, and institutional investors with a liquid market for heavily traded securities. This role does not sit easily with that of providing a market for higher risk investments. As in the US, a second tier market run by a completely different body is needed. It is here that the regulatory problems arise. In many countries, the body responsible for setting the listing requirements (the 'listing authority' in the language of the EC) is the central regulator, such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In the UK, the 'listing authority' is none other than the stock exchange, which is not likely to make it easier for competing exchanges to list the shares of UK companies. One wonders whether the Office of Fair Trading has considered the anti-competitive nature of this arrangement. The lessons of this analysis are the following: the UK needs a second tier market, especially at a time when economic recovery is imminent; the stock exchange is not best equipped to provide this market; if we are to encourage competition among exchanges, and therefore the provision of a specialised and independent second tier market, then it is of the first importance that the role of 'listing authority' should pass from the stock exchange to the Securities and Investments Board. Let us hope that SlB chairman Andrew Large, in his current review of the regulatory infrastructure, takes this into consideration.

			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHWEST FIRES 3 PILOTS ACCUSED OF FLYING WHILE LEGALLY DRUNK  </P> <P> Northwest Airlines on Friday fired three pilots accused of flying while legally  intoxicated, saying the cockpit crew violated company rules by operating the  jetliner within 12 hours of drinking.  </P> <P> Each of the pilots on the 6:25 a.m. flight from Fargo, N. D., on March 8 had  blood-alcohol levels exceeding 0.04%, a violation of federal regulations, the  company said.  </P> <P> "Northwest pilots have established a reputation for airmanship and safety,"  spokesman Alan Muncaster said. "All of us at Northwest are now challenged to  win back our reputation for flight excellence."  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration had already revoked the pilots' licenses  after its own investigation showed that the cockpit crew boarded the flight  within eight hours of drinking, the federal limit. Northwest imposes a stricter  span of 12 hours.  </P> <P> Northwest Flight 650, carrying 91 passengers, landed safely at the  Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where the cockpit crew was  arrested.  </P> <P> Dismissed were Capt. Norman Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga.; 1st Officer Robert  Kirchner, 35, of Highland Ranch, Colo., and 2nd Officer Joseph Balzer, 34, of  Antioch, Tenn. None of the three have any previous alcohol or drug-related  incidents on their flying records, the company said.  </P> <P> The Air Line Pilots Assn., the union representing Northwest's 5,400 pilots and  about 36,600 other pilots, issued a statement Friday saying it has "no  tolerance whatsoever toward drugs or alcohol in the cockpit."  </P> <P> But the statement emphasized that the three pilots are entitled to a fair  hearing on the charges.  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board has scheduled an appeals hearing  before an administrative law judge April 3-6 for the three crew members.  </P></p>

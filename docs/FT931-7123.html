			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Hollywood script for actors in trade talks MR Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, yesterday attacked the EC for 'building barricades between them and us' while removing barriers between its member states. The US government must not 'cut and run' at the Uruguay Round trade talks, he said. Enraged by a number of EC directives governing broadcasting, satellites and rental rights, he said the EC is regulating 'every nook and cranny of the audio-visual landscape' to restrict US access to its market. The colourful former aide to President Lyndon Johnson warned that without full national treatment for US films and television programmes in the EC, 'we will, like Banquo's ghost, haunt the edges of the marketplace, our clamours for access and equity unheeded and unheard'.</p>

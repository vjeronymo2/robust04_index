			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Fishy deals all in a roe: Caviar may lose its cachet if producers do not act to control supplies In smoke-filled rooms in the Iranian port of Bandar Anzali this week, the talk between officials from Iran and four former Soviet republics was not about oil or arms, but of fish roe. Carving up the caviar market has become a political issue. The sturgeon may seem an unlikely subject for Opec-style negotiations, but when a large sturgeon can contain caviar equivalent in value to two Rolls-Royces, caviar-producing countries have decided they need to determine how much each is allowed to fish. The shiny black eggs tinged with gold, once the preserve of shahs and tsars, are still surrounded by mystique, prized not only for their delicate flavour but for their supposedly aphrodisiac qualities. Western importers fear, however, that caviar may be about to lose its cachet. Former Soviet republics, keen to earn hard currency, are threatening to increase their exports, thus flooding the market. An increase in smuggling has led to an influx of often substandard caviar into Europe. Officials from the five countries bordering the Caspian Sea - home to 90 per cent of the world's sturgeon - met this week to discuss the problem, although a report from Irna, the Iranian News Agency, that they had agreed to form a caviar 'cartel', seems to have been premature. Mr Rasoul Pousti, European representative of Shilat, the Iranian national fisheries company, in Frankfurt, said the results of the meeting were yet to be announced. Its aim was not to set up a cartel, but to co-ordinate marketing and deal with such problems as smuggling, over-fishing and pollution of the Caspian. But European dealers say some kind of agreement is urgently needed. 'The market is pretty much in disarray,' says Mr John Stas, managing director of WG White, the only UK agent for Russian caviar. 'A cartel agreement might at least mean we could source caviar from reliable people at sensible prices.' Two years ago, the Soviet Union and Iran, the only two countries bordering the Caspian, had an effective duopoly in the caviar market. The Soviet Union produced about 700 tonnes a year, much of it ending up on the tables of the Communist party elite or on sandwiches sold for a couple of roubles at venues such as the Bolshoi Theatre. Less than 100 tonnes were exported, all through Sovrybflot, the Soviet state fisheries agency. Iran produced 200 tonnes a year, exporting about 150 tonnes through the fisheries company, Shilat. The Soviet Union and Iran held informal negotiations each year to adjust the price, usually based on the dollar exchange rate. The break-up of the Soviet Union, however, means that five countries now border the Caspian, with the newly independent republics of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan joining Iran and Russia. The end of centralised control means fishing has become a free-for-all. The new republics are no longer content to sell caviar to Moscow for roubles. They want to market it themselves. The problem, however, is that if they all fulfilled their desired export amounts, the total would be about 300 tonnes  -bigger than the entire western market. Because the new republics have little experience of controlling fishing and regulating trade, large quantities of caviar are finding their way onto the Russian black market. From there it travels to Europe in the suitcases of eastern European tourists anxious to earn hard cash. French customs officers who stopped one coachload of Russian tourists last year found 200kg of caviar - market value roughly Dollars 80,000. 'The problem is wider than just people coming over with a little suitcase,' says Mr Pousti. 'People are trying to deal in caviar with no experience.' Spotting an opportunity, western entrepreneurs have also brought supplies into Europe, sometimes obtained from producers and other licensed exporters, sometimes from Russian gangsters. Many have found it difficult to resell the caviar. Mr Peter Rebeiz, president of Caviar House in Geneva, which imports about a third of the caviar sold in the west, says retailers and restaurants will only buy from trusted suppliers. 'There are about 65 tonnes of unsold caviar lying around between Amsterdam and Hamburg,' says Mr Rebeiz. 'Much of it is arriving in non-refrigerated trucks. By the time it gets here it practically walks by itself.' Caviar House has stopped importing caviar from the former Soviet republics, demanding that they agree export quotas, as well as take steps to regulate fishing and protect the environment in the Caspian, before it will buy more. Ironically, some of those still dealing with the new republics have difficulty obtaining caviar. WG White says that since the demise of Sovrybflot, the Russian authorities have issued export licences not to caviar producers, but to intermediary companies, which are often unable to guarantee supplies of the required quality. They are also quoting prices 30 to 50 per cent higher than last year. Mr Rebeiz believes, however, that the end of the Soviet monopoly may provide opportunities for the new republics. The three main types of caviar - Beluga, Sevruga and Osetrova - have subtle variations in taste and texture, according to the depth and temperature of the water the sturgeon inhabit. The emergence of the republics may lead to the development of a range of caviar brands from different parts of the Caspian, he says. It may take the republics several years to develop the marketing expertise, but there is money to be made in the west from the Caspian Sea's other form of black gold.</p>

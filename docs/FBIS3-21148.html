			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]  <H5>  The Scene Changes Day by Day </H5>   Previously he was the director of the Electronics Technology  Research Institute in the AIST Tsukuba Research Center of  Ibaraki Prefecture. After assuming office, he revealed his  impression that ``when I was in Tsukuba, I could sit and think  of things at my leisure. But here, I have to think on the run.  Since instant and correct decisions are required on the spot,  every day is very busy.'' But, it is promising that ``since I  can adapt to the environment, it is not painful. Rather, it is  fun to have the scene changing rapidly every day.''    Next year's estimated requirements for the MITI technology  and development budget total &yen;301.7 billion. ``Compared to  the overall severity, this is a rather fortunate decision for  us,'' this was 7.5% growth compared to this year. In the  industrial science and technology R&amp;D system which can also  be  called the eyeball of AIST, has become the plan to initiate five  new themes of leading research such as precision polymer  materials, high speed biological function construction  technology (time machine bio), next generation metal resources  production technology.    ``The themes were drawn together from the viewpoint that  while prior research issues are modulated, they are becoming  technology development to make a type of production systems  revolution.'' Accordingly, the details are rich in variety and  emphasize the beefing up and strengthening of basic creative  research.  <H5>  Bringing the World One Step Closer </H5>   Among other things, the leading research theme expected by  the chemical industry is ``precision polymer materials.'' This  aims at the establishment of original technology for a polymer  material to eliminate the disorder in chemical structure and  superstructure and will result in the basic technology to  develop the next generation of polymer materials. He has the  deep insight that ``quantum mechanics was studied thoroughly in  its golden age at the beginning of this century and at present  that is actually tied to technology. I think one of those is  this issue, and this is similar to bringing the world another  step closer.''  <H5>  International Contributions Are Also a Major Issue </H5>   Future issues are ``international contributions from the  aspects of science and technology'' along with ``driving R&amp;D  to  produce a sprout of a new technology to become the breakthrough  for industrial structural reform.'' Also, he also says ``I would  like to get on that track'' concerning research for ATRAM  technology (atomic and molecular limit operations technology)  started this year in industrial technology fusion research  institutes.    AIST shows dynamic change in recent years with the revision  of the existing project system such as the reorganization of  Tsukuba's research institutes and the big pro (Major industrial  technology R&amp;D) system.    ``These all go along with the flow of the world, that is my  view. I would like to be the helmsman so as not to mistake the  direction while docilely following the demands, movement, and  change in the natural environment of the world,'' he says,  assuming a natural stance.    On days off, he enjoys yacht cruising and driving. He says  that ``driving directly under the stars in an open car is the  best feeling.'' He was born in 1934 (Showa year 9) and hails  from Kanagawa Prefecture.</p>

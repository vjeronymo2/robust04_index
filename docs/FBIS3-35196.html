			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Parliament today unanimously condemned Pakistan's  continuing support to terrorism and subversion in Jammu and  Kashmir. In an identical resolution passed in both the houses,  it said attempts from any quarter to interfere in the internal  affairs of India will be met resolutely. The resolution  declared that India has the will and capacity to firmly counter  all designs against its unity, sovereignty, and territorial  integrity.    Reiterating that Jammu and Kashmir is and shall be an  integral part of India, the resolution said attempts to separate  the state from the rest of the country will be resisted by India  with all necessary means. The resolution demanded Pakistan to  vacate the occupied areas of Jammu and Kashmir.    Noting with deep concern Pakistan's role in training  terrorists and supply of weapons and funds to them, it said  Islamabad's sole purpose is to create disorder, disharmony, and  subversion in the valley. It called upon Pakistan to stop  forthwith its support to terrorism which is in violation of the  Simla Agreement. It said this is the root cause of tension  between the two countries.    Describing Pakistan's anti-India campaign as unacceptable  calumny and falsehood, the resolution expressed deep concern  over the highly provocative statement from Pakistan and said it  will only vitiate the atmosphere.    The resolution was moved by the speaker, Mr. Shivraj Patil,  in the Lok Sabha, and the chairman, Mr. K.R. Narayanan, in the  Rajya Sabha.</p>

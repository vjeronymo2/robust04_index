			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Voyager workstation saves desk space For a glimpse of future desktop computer design, look at Sun Microsystems' Voyager workstation, writes Louise Kehoe. It features a 12-in, tilting, active-matrix, colour, flat-panel display that can be folded against the vertical computer housing for storage. The unit takes up about one-third of the desk space of a traditional workstation and because of its small size and weight is expected to appeal to people in financial services, or field workers such as consultants, analysts or auditors. The display uses one-tenth of the power of a typical workstation and adds about Dollars 5,000 (Pounds 3,425) to the price. Sun: US, 415 960 1300.</p>

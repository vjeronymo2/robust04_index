			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] Television lovers in Shenzhen have been given three  days to tear down their illegal satellite dishes, an official  said yesterday. Chen Chongtian, deputy director of the special  economic zone's Bureau of Radio and Television, said all dish  owners, except for hotels with foreign guests and financial  companies, must pull down their dishes by the end of the week.    There has not yet been a decision to use force to implement  the six-month-old nationwide ban on private dishes, and  circumstances under which force might be deployed were "not yet  clear", Chen said.    However, the Public Security Bureau and the Bureau of State  Security in Shenzhen would play "coordinating" roles. The  bureau is aware of the location of 110 dishes in Shenzhen, some  of which are presumably legal. But some have been installed by  private individuals without permission, Chen said. "We're  calling on people to take the initiative. It would be best if  they took them down themselves," he said.    Notices were published in Shenzhen papers yesterday  announcing the crackdown. Chen said the uncontrolled dishes had  caused "flaws", notably the government's loss of control over  the watching of foreign programmes. "Some of those programmes  from Hong Kong and Taiwan have a bad effect on the masses," he  said.    "Violence and other evil depictions are not appropriate for  our national situation." Chen said that dishes make Shenzhen  look ugly and require more investment than cable television.  The city expected to finish building a 400 million renminbi  (HK$355m [Hong Kong dollars] ) cable television system by 1996  or 1997, which would reach 100,000 households. "Cable  television will replace satellite dishes," Chen said. "After the  system is built, we will decide which Hong Kong and Taiwan  programmes can be aired."    However, at least one satellite dish salesman in Shenzhen  was  already issuing instructions yesterday on how to get around the  threat of police inspectors roving the streets looking for  dishes.    "As long as they can't be seen from the street, then there  should be no problem," said the salesman, whose electronic  components store was set up with backing from the Shenzhen  government last year. "There's likely to be crackdowns in areas  where there is a concentration of dishes, but dishes which are  dispersed and hidden will be OK," the salesman said. The  Premier, Li Peng, announced a nationwide crackdown on private  satellite dishes last October 8, giving local governments six  month to implement the ban. Individuals found with unauthorised  dishes could be penalised up to Rmb5,000 [renminbi], while work  units faced Rmb50,000 fines.    Detailed regulations issued at a national ideological work  conference in February spelt out the strict conditions for  registering dishes and empowered local governments to "take  positive action" to pull down unlicensed dishes.    Beijing's Ministry of Radio, Film and Television is reported  to have extended the grace period for implementing the ban until  June. However, analysts say it would take many years to search  every hutong in China for the metal dishes, which are familiarly  known as "pot lids"</p>

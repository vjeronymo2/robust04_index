			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Arts: A superb 'Iolanta' - Concert As the orchestral funding fiasco rebounds on the Arts Council, the Royal Philharmonic, least favoured of the three orchestras under review, has boldly announced its new RPO Maryinsky-Kirov Series, under the artistic directorship of the Kirov's dynamic young chief, Valery Gergiev. Designed as a celebration of the cultural richness of St Petersburg, past and present, the series will have among its many attractions the concert performances of Russian operas little-known in the West; western music associated with the city, and works by contemporary Russian composers. Singers and instrumentalists will appear in a parallel recital series. The venture was launched at the Royal Albert Hall on Monday night with a deeply moving account of Tchaikovsky's last opera, the one-act Iolanta (1892). Nobody who heard this performance will ever again dismiss Iolanta. It is a fragile, achingly poignant piece in a category of its own, full of music of rapt beauty. The awakening - and cure - through love of Princess Iolanta, blind from birth, must have had allegorical significance for the tormented composer; equally, optimistic Russians today might find a parallel in their own recent artistic liberation. As we have come to expect, Gergiev went straight to the heart of the piece: the woodwind introduction, problematic to some ears, emerged fluidly sculpted. Throughout the evening every detail was in place, yet the music remained spontaneous and unfolded freely. This vocal feast assembled 10 Kirov singers on the platform. Galina Gorchakova, enchanting in the title role, caught in her shining soprano all the maidenly innocence. The suitors Robert (Sergey Leiferkus) and Vaudemont (Gegam Grigorian) - Covent Garden's Onegin and Lensky in the summer - established lively dialogue rare in concert performances. Leiferkus, mellifluous as always, focused every word, and Grigorian sang ardently: his tenor, strong in the Imperial Russian mould, poured out golden tone, filling the cavernous hall at the climax of his aria. Bulat Minzhilkiev's imposing bass strode nobly through the arching phrases of the King's aria; the rich-voiced mezzo Larissa Dyadkova sang warmly as Iolanta's nurse Martha. Though the Kirov is above all a great ensemble company, it is hard to resist singling out the smaller roles: Tatyana Kravtsova and Olga Korzhenskaya, as Iolanta's friends Brigitte and Laura, blended beautifully in their lullaby. Each singer (and the London Choral Society, doing their best with the Russian) gave full meaning to the text - which is just as well, since although almost half the programme book was devoted to a translation, the house lights were, perversely, turned down. A memorable evening: Iolanta features in Gergiev's recording plans for the Philips Kirov Edition, and is now impatiently awaited. Sponsored by Regent Hotel, London NW1</p>

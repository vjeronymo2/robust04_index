			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSTMODERN CHILDREN AND 'IN THE BEGINNING'  </P> <P> Multi-media exposure to science in all its forms, but especially to such fields  as paleontology which bear on the evolution controversy and astronomy which  generates its own godless cosmology, pushes kids into relativistic positions no  matter what their storybooks contain; and of course a lot of storybooks deal  with that kind of subject matter as well. My hunch is that books dealing with  creation myths would be a drop in the proverbial bucket.  </P> <P> To take this another step, isn't it probably true that we live in a secular,  relativist age largely because traditional forms of religious training have  simply failed the challenges posed by science? Most Sunday schools are still  highly traditional, my ecclesiastical friends tell me, and pretty dull. Also --  at least in many urban areas -- doesn't the sheer variety of religious and  other cultural life experiences in schools and neighborhoods push observant and  thoughtful children toward relativism? Of course I'm revealing my own biases,  but how can it be otherwise? Just about all frontier areas of scientific  research, and much else in the culture besides, seems pointed in that  direction.  </P> <P> GRANT BARNES  </P> <P> DIRECTOR  </P> <P> STANFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS  </P> <P> STANFORD  </P></p>

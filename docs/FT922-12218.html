			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Tough rules for Moscow's IMF safety net: Dollars 6bn rouble fund to be discussed in Washington next Sunday RUSSIA will have to meet tough monetary policy conditions if it is to obtain the planned Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.3bn) safety net for the rouble which is being prepared by the world's big industrialised countries. The Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund is part of the Dollars 24bn package of international financial assistance for Russia announced earlier this month. It will be one of the issues discussed by finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries when they next meet in Washington on Sunday. It will also be the main agenda item of another industrial country group - the Group of 10 - next Monday. It is planned that the G10 (which confusingly is made up of 11 industrial nations comprising the G7 plus the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Switzerland) should provide the funding for the stabilisation fund by activating a dormant IMF financial mechanism known as the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB). The Dollars 6bn rouble safety net would be established through an agreement between Russia and the International Monetary Fund and administered by the IMF. It is expected to take the form of a pledge of funds the IMF may draw on in case of need rather than of a loan. Some technical work has to be done on the stabilisation fund before the plan can be approved by G10 ministers. But according to one senior western monetary official, 'the real issue is whether the Russian government will be able to comply with the conditions'. Western capitals have shown some concern about the policies and activities of the Russian central bank, with doubts about whether it will refuse finance to bankrupt companies, and about its relations with the national banks of the other former Soviet republics. 'I don't think anybody is very comfortable with what is happening on the monetary side,' the official said. If the stabilisation fund gets off the ground, 'we will really be lending Russia some reserves. We have therefore got to get the proper conditionality.' European officials expect the IMF will need further GAB financing to meet its fast-growing obligations as a result of the liberalisation of eastern Europe and the membership of the former Soviet republics. The GAB in its present form dates back to 1983, when the G10 countries agreed to provide up to Dollars 24bn to help the IMF through liquidity shortages. It was envisaged as a support for the fund's efforts in dealing with the 1980s international debt crisis, but was not needed for this purpose. The facility was set up in 1962 to deal with monetary crises in the G10 nations and was used to fund the UK's borrowing from the IMF in the mid-1970s.</p>

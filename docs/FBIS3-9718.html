			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by J.B.L., E.K., E.Cz., K.Gr., and PAD: "Will the </F> Coalition Hold Out?"]    [Excerpts] President Lech Walesa finally rejected the  candidacy of Dariusz Rosati for deputy prime minister and  finance minister, which was submitted to him on Friday [25  March] morning by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. After holding  talks with Aleksander Kwasniewski, the prime minister and the  coalition still maintain this candidacy. If the president  officially maintains his stand, the dispute over Rosati will  turn into a dispute between the president and the governing  coalition.  <H5>  In the Morning in the Belweder </H5>   On Friday morning, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak submitted  to the president the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati for the post of  deputy prime minister and finance minister. During the  20-minute meeting, the prime minister's visit to Moscow as well  as personnel changes in the Finance Ministry were also discussed.    After the meeting, President's Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski  said that the president would not sign Dariusz Rosati's  nomination because he can see "a double risk. Mr. Rosati may  not know Polish reality well enough" due to his three-year stay  abroad, which may make it difficult for him to make economic  decisions, and his knowledge on the economy may to a  considerable degree "depend on secondhand information." The  other reason is "the affair of the Foreign Debt Service Fund.  The legal situation is not completed yet. Legal proceedings  are under way, the case has been started, and there may arise  relations that are unnecessary in this difficult situation in  which we have found ourselves."    Minister Drzycimski also said that the president believes  that the filling of the highest posts in the state calls for  great deliberation, and, in view of the doubts that have arisen,  he cannot accept this candidacy.    "The decision that Dariusz Rosati's candidacy will not be  accepted is irrevocable," Andrzej Drzycimski told RZECZPOSPOLITA  on Friday. On Monday, the president will forward a written  reply to Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's motion; however, the  document will not include any justification of the decision  because the Constitution does not impose such a duty. The  Belweder's spokesman did not rule out the possibility, however,  that, on the very same day, a meeting may be held between the  president and the prime minister. "Nevertheless, it is  impossible for the president to change his mind. The coalition  should agree on a new candidate for deputy prime minister and  finance minister."    Walesa's spokesman emphasized that propaganda pressure was  exerted on the president. "It was completely forgotten that, in  line with the Constitution, he does not have to confirm such a  candidacy because it is the president who is responsible for  making the decision, which may in the future turn out to be  erroneous."  <H5>  The Coalition Is Adamant and Waiting </H5>   "For us, it is not a matter of prestige or having our own  man  in the government; it has to be a person who will implement the  government's economic program and the budget," said Aleksander  Kwasniewski. "We should act efficiently and wisely; I cannot  understand how one can delay making decisions and, not having  any arguments against, disagree to such a candidacy." He said  that the arguments that delay the decision on the appointment or  that make it impossible were false and wrong. He confirmed that  the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] had not withdrawn the  candidacy of Dariusz Rosati because, "if an outstanding  specialist is not a good candidate, who is a good one"?    After an hour's meeting with Waldemar Pawlak, Kwasniewski  officially declared that the prime minister maintained the  candidacy of Dariusz Rosati because he believes he is an expert,  well-prepared and competent enough to become responsible for the  economic issues in the government. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Between Coalition and President </H5>   Now that the coalition has worked out a common stand, the  prime minister is waiting for an official reply from the  president. If he maintains his stand, "we will witness a new  stage of the political situation," said Kwasniewski. However,  it will no longer be an internal affair of the coalition but an  affair between the coalition and the president. According to  Drzycimski, by rejecting the presidential bill concerning the  Constitution, it was the coalition that opened a new chapter in  relations with the Belweder. Now the SLD leader would like the  president to lose because of Rosati.    "We must try to reach agreement. Now, if the president  decides on such a war, we will have to think about whether the  president's powers are not too great. There are no regulations  that cannot be changed, including the Constitution," said Marek  Borowski.    Commenting on Friday evening on the stand taken by the prime  minister, Drzycimski said: "He maintains it because such are the  coalition agreements; however, if the president has rejected  this nomination, they just do not have another possibility.  They must look for a new candidate."    In line with Kwasniewski's words, Dariusz Rosati is at the  coalition's disposal, and he will not make any hasty decision.  However, in a statement for the television show "Panorama," the  deputy prime minister candidate admitted that he would still  like to talk with the prime minister and the SLD leader and that  he did not rule out the possibility of withdrawing his  candidacy. As he left the Office of the Council of Ministers,  Aleksander Kwasniewski went to the airport, from where he left  for Budapest--with a delay caused by current events.    "The prolonging of the absence of the person at the post of  coordinator of the economy is a bad sign for it," evaluates  Polish Peasant Party [PSL] Deputy Janusz Piechocinski, "because  many important laws and decisions are waiting to be dealt with."  <H5>  The Recall of Modzelewski </H5>   The prime minister informed the president that he had  dismissed Witold Modzelewski, secretary of state in the Finance  Ministry (who has been in the post since Marek Borowski ran the  ministry), and appointed PSL Deputy Jan Kubik secretary of  state. He is a deputy for the first time. He works in the  Budget Committee and is the director of the Tax Office in  Krakow. According to SLD deputies, this change was not  consulted with the SLD. Kubik himself did not know about the  nomination.    Witold Modzelewski told us that the prime minister had  suggested that he return to the post of under secretary of state  (to which he was promoted by Jan Olszewski) and explained that  the change was caused by the fact that, in line with coalition  agreements, the PSL should have its own man in the ministry  leadership. Modzelewski added that he had not received a  written recall and that he had not yet decided whether he would  accept the offer and stay in the ministry.    Aleksander Kwasniewski did not want to comment on this  decision on Friday. He said that making changes in the Finance  Ministry when the deputy prime minister and the ministry's head  is not there was not a very good action. He merely admitted  that, in line with the principle of joint responsibility,  whenever the minister comes from one coalition party, the other  grouping should have its own representative in the ministry's  leadership.    According to Marek Borowski, the prime minister's decision  is  contrary to the coalition agreement. Both PSL and SLD deputies  evaluate that personnel changes in the Finance Ministry that are  not consulted with the SLD will force the SLD to react to them  and will cause friction within the coalition.    In the evening, the prime minister presented Modzelewski  with  the nomination act to the post of under secretary of state in  the Finance Ministry.  <H5>  Budget Still Open? </H5>   Asked whether in the present situation we should expect the  president to approve the state budget, Drzycimski replied: It is  still open. However, by doing what he did in the Rosati case,  the president gave a certain signal.    "There are no reasons that the budget should not be signed,"  claims Kwasniewski. "There exists something that must be called  responsibility for the state, a desire to stabilize the  situation in the country. Now, we should really expect such  behavior from the president. I am not saying this to cause a  dispute with the president but to appeal to him for  consideration." [passage omitted]  <H5>  The Last Accent </H5>   Late in the evening, after the Sejm session was completed,  the SLD Club convened at a meeting that was closed to the press.  The deputies maintained their support for Rosati's candidacy,  expressed approval for the firm stance taken by the prime  minister, and stated that the activity of the president would  have a destabilizing effect on the state. According to them,  the crisis that has arisen, which is not an internal crisis of  the coalition, and the stand taken by Lech Walesa compel them to  reconsider the SLD's behavior toward Lech Walesa.    "This forces us to take a closer look at the president's  activities and at his powers provided by the Small  Constitution," said Zbigniew Siemiatkowski. Thus, the deputies  entirely backed the stand taken earlier by Marek Borowski. The  club's members decided that it was necessary to hold an SLD  session very soon in order to discuss the new strategy of the  grouping. The leftist politicians unofficially mentioned the  constitutional possibility concerning the president's  responsibility for activities aimed at destabilizing the state.  [passage omitted]</p>

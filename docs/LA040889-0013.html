			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GENTLEMEN, START YOUR SAILBOATS  </P> <P> Having loved Jim Murray's work since my dad introduced me to it more than 30  years ago, I am temporarily saddened by his suggestion that New York Supreme  Court Justice Carmen Ciparick's decision on the America's Cup was anything but  brilliant and daring.  </P> <P> One need only read the chronology of events to understand the unsportsmanlike  conduct of the defenders.  </P> <P> When gentlemen accept the terms of a duel, it is not general practice to have  one armed with a derringer and the other with a submachine gun.  </P> <P> But who said we were talking about gentlemen?  </P> <P> RON HOLDER  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

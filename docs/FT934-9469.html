			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: WHO smoking target attacked A 10 per cent reduction in smoking, urged by the World Health Organisation, would lead many tobacco-producing countries in the developing world to rely more heavily on international aid, according to a report published yesterday. The report, entitled Tobacco Trade or Aid?, by the International Tobacco Growers' Association, examines the impact of a hypothetical fall in demand of 10 per cent by 1995 on the economies of six developing countries. The association promotes the interests of tobacco-growing organisations around the world, including those from the US and Canada as well as Latin America and Africa. It concludes that the six countries - Brazil, Bulgaria, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Zimbabwe - would suffer a collective loss of nearly Dollars 120m from a fall in export volumes of more than 59,000 tonnes. Malawi and Zimbabwe depend most heavily on tobacco for foreign exchange. Malawi's tobacco exports last year accounted for 59 per cent of total exports and contributed 16.7 per cent of gross domestic product. The loss of 10 per cent of projected tobacco export earnings in 1995 would be equivalent to 6 per cent of the aid it received in 1991, the report says. For Zimbabwe, the potential loss of Dollars 41m in foreign exchange would represent the equivalent of 25.7 per cent of its 1992 balance of payments deficit, and more than half the country's spending on social security and welfare. Pointing to the WHO's objective of a fall of more than 10 per cent in smoking in at least 20 per cent of its member states by 1995, compared with 1988, the report attacks what it calls 'a new imperialism'. 'Denied the dignity of contributing to their own development through foreign exchange earnings from tobacco, all the countries profiled in the present study and many other would. . . become more dependent on the largesse of the aid donor community,' it says. Last year the association published a report arguing that there were no sustainable alternative crops that would achieve the same level of earnings for most tobacco farmers. The Overseas Development Administration in London said yesterday it was looking at ways of helping developing countries find sustainable alternatives to tobacco. Since 1991, ODA policy has been to refuse to fund or support projects in the tobacco sector. Tobacco Trade or Aid? ITGA, PO Box 125, Forest Row, East Sussex RH18 5FA, England.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Deficit deepens at troubled Elkem as dividend omitted ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, yesterday revealed sharply increased net losses in 1992, and warned it would omit its dividend payment for the third year running. Net losses last year rose to NKr616m (Dollars 89m) from NKr443m in 1991 while sales fell by NKr514m to NKr7.3bn. Elkem said its main markets continued to be plagued by weak demand, high levels of exports of metals and alloys from China and eastern Europe, and over-capacity. 'The company considers that there are no reasons to expect significant changes in the market situation in 1993,' Elkem warned further. Group operating costs were cut by NKr63m to NKr6.99m but the company pledged to continue cost-cutting efforts. The number of employees was cut by 679 045 last year. Elkem said cost reduction measures announced in the second half of 1992, including a further cut in its workforce and renegotiation of raw materials contracts, would have a positive effect in 1993. The company charged accounts with a NKr125m loss on Elkem Technology and NKr86m for restructuring. However, the charges were offset by a NKr214m gain on the sales of assets and a NKr50m tax reduction. Elkem's shareholdings in associated companies yielded net losses of NKr76m in 1992 against profits of NKr58m previously. Net interest expenses rose to NKr431m from NKr416m in 1991. Elkem said it suffered foreign currency losses on debt of NKr33m in the fourth quarter. Finance expenses rose to NKr511m from NKr421m in 1991. 'Financial costs were also affected by the high level of interest rates in domestic money markets in the fourth quarter.' Elkem said its financial base had been strengthened in the fourth quarter by NKr580m raised from a share issue, gains from assets sales and the establishment of a NKr550m credit facility.</p>

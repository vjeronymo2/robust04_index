			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Unions go on holiday - Ballot Box The profile of Britain's union leaders in the election campaign has been low to the point of invisibility. Indeed, some of the leaders of organised labour have been taking the opportunity to take holidays before, as they hope, returning to share power with a Labour government. Bill Jordan, the president of the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU), has just returned from a week in the Canary Islands with his wife. Meanwhile, a group of 10 senior officials from the AEU, the GMB general union and the TGWU general union have just set off for a short golfing holiday in Portugal. In spite of the TUC's unprecedented forgetfulness about formally endorsing the Labour party, one or two union leaders have been quietly doing their bit to get the vote out in their own unions. John Edmonds, leader of the GMB, Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of Nupe, the public services union, and Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU, have been the most active. But the leaders of the proudly independent AEU have been behind their desks working quite normally - at least when they are not on holiday.</p>

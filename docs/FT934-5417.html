			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Levitt - integrity can never be relative Sir, The Levitt case raises the question of the role of integrity in financial affairs. An individual's integrity is important in all business dealings, but nowhere more so than in financial services where the repercussion of having a rotten apple in the barrel can affect such large sums of money and hurt so wide a range of victims. The greatest hurt to victims occurs when a financial services company fails and is not able to meet its liabilities or compensate for past misfeasance. Firms fail for one or a combination of two reasons - over-trading or dishonesty. Hopefully, the action now taken by regulatory authorities in monitoring the trading and capital requirements of firms means that the chances of a financial services company failing through over-trading are much reduced. However, there still remains the danger of dishonesty, when an individual's integrity gives way to greed or fear. It is recognition of the vital importance of integrity in financial dealings that the Securities Institute has as the first of its two main purposes the maintenance and strengthening of standards of integrity. It is in recognition of the importance of this purpose, and of the institute's second purpose of promoting competence and training, that the institute has received overwhelming support from individual practitioners in financial services and their firms since it was founded in March 1991. A member of the public dealing with a member of the institute knows that he is dealing with a professional whose integrity and competence is recognised by his peers. It would be a sad day for the City and for the future of financial services in the UK if it were ever thought that 'small' lapses of integrity are excusable and in a different category from other forms of dishonesty. Surely integrity, like pregnancy, is not relative? An individual who lacks integrity in 'small' matters is unlikely to resist temptation if and when he is really put to the test in 'large' matters. 'Borrowing' money from a pension fund and lying to a regulator are both failures of integrity, and it is not clear that the latter is less serious than the former. Graham Ross Russell, chairman, Securities Institute, Centurion House, 24 Monument Street, London EC3R 8AJ From Mr Richard McManus. Sir, As the self-confessed fraudster Mr Levitt declares himself 'a great believer in British justice' ('City anger at community service order for Levitt', November 27) there must be many of us who are questioning our own beliefs. Mr Justice Laws asserts that 186 hours community service is 'commensurate' with the crime that Mr Levitt committed but the same cannot be said for the squandering of millions of pounds from the strained public purse in a futile three-year prosecution and costly trial. One cannot help feeling that the money could have been better spent directly on a host of worthy projects aimed at improving the lot of those in need of support from the community. It is indeed possible that Mr Levitt may have accepted his onerous sentence without the Serious Fraud Office and members of the legal profession labouring quite so long. Aside from the specifics of this case it does seem foolhardy to indulge in long-winded investigations and prosecution when the main result may be to demonstrate publicly to prospective criminals that they have little to fear from the vagaries of the British justice system if they are brought to book. Is it possible both to deter wrongdoers and leave the judiciary complete discretion in sentencing? Richard McManus, First Europe, 44 Upham Park Road, London W4 1PG</p>

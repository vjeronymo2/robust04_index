			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: African Lakes High interest rates in Zimbabwe and Malawi affected the results of African Lakes Corporation, which announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 929,961 for the year to September 30 1993, compared with profits of Pounds 1.28m restated in accordance with FRS 3. Profits last time include a Pounds 542,813 profit on property sales. The company, which has interests in motor trading, agriculture, mining, engineering and computer supplies, said the impact of economic problems in Malawi had been worse than expected and operations there, traditionally the strongest contributor to second half profits, had suffered badly. Turnover fell to Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 50.5m) generating operating profits of Pounds 530,219 (Pounds 1.52m). Losses per share were 13.04p (4.27p earnings) and a nominal dividend of 0.5p (2p) is proposed.</p>

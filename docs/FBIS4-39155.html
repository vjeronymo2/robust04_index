			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pilat in the "Crimea" column: </F> "Parliament Confronts the President. Those Who Have Brought  Meshkov to Power Are Not Content With His New Policy" --  "Postscript" by Aleksandr Anin]    [Text] It was reported earlier that the Crimean parliament  has rejected President Yuriy Meshkov's request to grant him  additional powers. Following are some details of that session.    At the very start of the resumed parliament session Crimean  President Yuriy Meshkov moved to include in the agenda the  question "On the Results of the 27 March 1994 Poll of Crimean  Republic Citizens: On According Presidential Edicts the Power  of Laws on Matters Which Temporarily Are Not Regulated by the  Legislation of the Crimean Republic." Deputy Leonid Grach spoke  up immediately: "This contradicts the constitution of Crimea on  the inadmissibility of delegating powers from one branch of  power to another." Deputy Boris Kizilov noted, "It is not clear  yet who summed up the results of the poll and how," (the poll  results were summed up by the president's team without the  participation of the Crimean Central Election Commission --  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA), "and therefore the poll results do not  have legal force." Deputy Vasiliy Kiselev pointed out that many  of Yuriy Meshkov's edicts have been issued in gross violation of  the Crimean republic's constitution, continuing, "Any usurpation  of power is illegal, the constitution says. Until we have  changed this provision of the Constitution, we cannot grant the  president such powers."    Speaking one after another, deputies, with rare exception,  maintained that they can tackle any questions and that there is  no need to grant the president additional powers. Mikhail  Kukushkin said, "All actions by the president are reminiscent of  an election fever. He is trying to prod the deputies to climb  on top an armored car again."    In the end, the issue was taken off the agenda. Therefore,  in spite of the fact that the majority of deputies were elected  from the Rossiya bloc, which, incidentally, brought Yuriy  Meshkov to power, there is no agreement between him and  parliament. Observers believe that confrontation will only grow  in the future.    P.S. In supporting Yuriy Meshkov in presidential elections,  the Rossiya bloc expected that its representatives would get key  posts in the Cabinet of Ministers. Meshkov, however, invited  Muscovite Yevgeniy Saburov to head the government, who in turn  brought a Moscow team along to Simferopol.    Rossiya and the Impeks-55 commercial and financial group  behind it could probably agree with this if they knew exactly  that in the upcoming privatization they would retain the supreme  right to control land and real estate on the peninsula.    But the fact is that no one is sure that the Saburov team  will not fertilize Crimean privatization with Russian capital.  Rather, there is a certitude to the contrary: As soon as  Yevgeniy Saburov came to Simferopol, he said that he favors  broad participation of foreign money in Crimea's economy.    Today, having finally appreciated what Saburov meant by  "foreign," yesterday's presidential support group would like to  get rid of the visiting premier -- and the sooner, the better.  By its latest demarche parliament warns Yuriy Meshkov, as it  were, about the possible consequences he would face if he  continues to keep his Moscow protege afloat.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Knyazkov and Vasiliy Fatigarov: "Skrunda: </F> The Supersecret Facility of World Renown"; "Garrison Life"]    [Text] At one time the radar station located in the  small Latvian post of Skrunda was considered a supersecret  facility. Today, thanks to the ups and downs of Russian-Latvian  negotiations, its renown is all but scandalous. But it has  already been decided that the radar station will operate for  another 4 years, and 18 months will be devoted to disassembly of  the equipment. But behind the "technical aspect of the  question," the high contracting sides have somehow entirely  forgotten about the Skrunda garrison, the service members who to  this day regularly go to work at the radar.    The unit commander, Lt-Col Aleksandr Nikitin, met us at the  staff building. He looked exhausted. They night before a piece  of equipment had gone down, and he had to rush all over the  place so that everything would be normal by morning. You see,  despite the political situation, the radar "garrison" continues  to perform its assigned mission. Alert duty is pulled daily by 4  crews on 12-hour shifts.    Before, serving at Skrunda was considered a privilege,  mainly  because of the comfortable geographic location of the garrison,  the availability of housing, and convenient transportation to  major cities. And topflight specialists served here. Even today  practically 90 percent of personnel have an academic education.    Meanwhile, once at inter-government negotiations, seeking to  "demilitarize" the facility, Latvia asked Russia to replace the  military specialists who maintained the radar with civilian  ones. But later Latvia was to learn that this proposal was  unrealistic. Specialists of this type are trained only in  military VUZ [military institutes of higher learning], but even  after graduation it takes at least two years before a young  officer is allowed on alert duty. Even then, as the unit  commander explained, at first he has the skills only for a few  operations. But specialists such as Lt-Cols Viktor Mikhaylov,  Leonid Zhukov, Valentin Churkin, Pyotr Samorodov, and Majors  Pyotr Palamarchuk and Viktor Dedoriv can tell even from the  behavior of the apparatus where they should look for or even  where they should expect a defect. They're the ones who keep it  all going.    Incidentally, in the period of breakup of the Union, many  specialists from the station went into the armies of the newly  formed sovereign states, mainly Ukraine. Thus it turned out that  the unit was manned by about 60-70 percent with men from that  republic. This is explained quite easily by the fact that radar  specialists were trained at Kharkov and Zhitomir. "Some of them  didn't care for the Ukrainian Army, and tried to return," Lt-Col  Aleksandr Nikitin recalled, "but the command figures that for  these people there is no turning back."    Now only the most reliable remain to work at the facility.  And besides alert duty, they still have to protect the military  camp, an territory of 42 hectares. Even the wives and children  of the officers have joined the ranks, so to speak. This was  forced largely by the absence of replacements of compulsory  service troops for two years.    We spoke with two nice women in military uniform, the  Ryzhikovs, mother and daughter. The officer's wife, Larisa  Sergeyevna, is a PFC, and works as an expediter at the  communications center, while her daughter Larisa is a private  and radio telegraph operator. They like the service. "We feel a  real army kinship!" In addition, the unit command has tried not  only to resolve problems involving the training of female  specialists, but also to maximally settle day-to-day problems.  We were told by the unit psychologist, Lt-Col Sergey Pakhomov,  "There is a kindergarten, grade school, club, music school, and  the children's Russian folk ensemble "Kuderyshki" operating in  the garrison."    In each of the 10 residential buildings for officers, small,  cozy food stores have opened their doors. A joint  Russian-Latvian enterprise created on the basis of the military  store provides the wares. But then, the freshest dairy products  can also be purchased at the garrison KPP [traffic regulating  point] from residents of local villages.    It is too bad that we did not manage to see our  interlocutors  at their combat posts. On orders from Moscow, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  journalists were not allowed near the operating radar  "Dnestr-M." But we did visit the new one, the "Daryal." It is a  sad sight, an abandoned, first-class military facility. It is  hard to realize that life will not pulse after all in the heart  of this mighty, nearly hundred-meter high building. And how much  manpower and resources are still needed to disassemble it all!    "We missed our chance to come to an agreement on the fate of  the radar" the officers escorting us said with one voice. "The  decision about mothballing and disassembly should have been made  in 1991-1992, when there were contract organizations and  builders here."    Well, that's life. It remains only to repeat that the  outmoded station "Dnestr-M" in Skrunda will keep working for  another 4 years, and then the entire Commonwealth of Independent  States, Russia included, will be without the means of detecting  attacking missiles on this flank. It is possible to restore the  former degree of protection only by spending new, enormous sums.  But you know, it all might have been different if we had shown  political far-sightedness back then.</p>

Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious. They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Women who consume adequate amounts of folate daily throughout their childbearing years may reduce their risk of having a child with a birth defect of the brain and spinal cord. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious. They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Women who have had a child with a spinal cord birth defect should consult a physician before becoming pregnant. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Women who take steps to ensure that their folate intake is adequate throughout their childbearing years may reduce their risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious. They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in citrus fruits and juices, dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products such as breads, rice, and pasta, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Women who take steps to ensure that their folate intake is at least 400 mcg daily throughout their childbearing years may reduce their risk of having a child with spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that, while not widespread, are very serious. These birth defects can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, including citrus fruits and juices, vegetables, including dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, including breads, rice, and pasta, fortified cereals, or from a supplement. Women who have had a pregnancy affected with a neural tube defect should consult a physician before becoming pregnant. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Some women who consume the Daily Value of folate (400 mcg) throughout their childbearing years may reduce their risk of having a child affected with spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that, while not widespread, are very serious. These birth defects can have many causes. Women of childbearing age should choose well-balanced diets that include 2 to 4 servings per day of fruits (including citrus fruits and juices), 3 to 5 servings of vegetables (including dark green leafy vegetables and legumes), 6 to 11 servings of enriched grain products (such as breads, rice, and pasta) or fortified cereals throughout their childbearing years.

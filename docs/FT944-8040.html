			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Local authorities cast doubt on the accuracy of truancy figures The accuracy of the truancy figures for England released by the government was called into question yesterday by a number of local education authorities. Manchester, top of the truancy table for secondary schools and, for the second year running, home to the 'worst' school in England, said yesterday that up to 11,000 pupils had been omitted from the government's calculations. A similar problem occurred last year. The authority said nearly a third of its schools had failed to return absenteeism figures to the government. As a result the validity of the tables was in doubt. The government recorded a total of 48,566 pupils of compulsory school age in Manchester, but according to the authority the actual figure is just under 60,000. The authority said: 'We do recognise that Manchester does have a problem with truancy, but we are taking active steps to deal with it both within the local education authority and on an individual school basis. 'However, the overall picture presented by the tables is very misleading.' The authority stressed that of the 11,000 pupils not included in the table there were 'some very good schools that would have had a very good record on attendance'. The local education authority for Kensington and Chelsea, placed second to Manchester in the secondary school truancy table, also criticised the accuracy of the government's calculations. It said that its figure for the percentage of half days missed by secondary school pupils without authorisation - a key truancy measure - was out by nearly a quarter. Kensington and Chelsea said yesterday that the correct figure was 2.8 per cent, not 3.6 per cent as recorded in the government's table. According to the authority the mistake was due to one of its schools having filled in a form incorrectly. Mr Mike Stoten, head of education for Kensington and Chelsea, said: 'The department has admitted it has got the wrong number in its booklet, but they are being bloody-minded and are refusing to change it.' Officials at the Department for Education said the authority should blame itself for not having checked through its submission properly. An official said: 'It will certainly learn a lesson for next year.' Tower Hamlets, another of the worst placed authorities, also suggested that the government's figures differed from the ones its schools had submitted. The authority said: 'These things are just so complicated it is not surprising that cock-ups occur.' However, most of the individual schools badly placed in the truancy league were willing to admit to having attendance problems. The two worst schools, Ellen Wilkinson High School in Manchester and Agnes Stewart High School in Leeds, both recorded a truancy rate of 30 per cent. Mrs Yvonne Kneen, headteacher of Ellen Wilkinson, said that in spite of a number of initiatives to reduce truancy it would take a long time for the school to solve the problem. She believes it is mainly a function of the disadvantaged backgrounds of most of the school's pupils, who live in inner-city Manchester. The school has taken on a special school liaison teacher, whose role is to check on children who have a poor attendance record. Some of the school's governors have been involved in searching the local shopping centre for absent pupils and the local police have been patrolling nearby streets in unmarked cars.</p>

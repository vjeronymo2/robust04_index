			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP, JAZZ;  </P> <P> NEWTON IN A DISNEY-DEEP ROMP  </P> <P> The saucer-shaped room goes black. There is a blaring fanfare, a flurry of  motion in the darkness. Something big is coming, something Wayne Newton.  </P> <P> Suddenly a looming, black-garbed presence is illuminated in a stab of white. A  shriek rises from 2,000 throats: Aaiiieeee! This man has no soul!  </P> <P>  Just kidding. They were actually screams of love, as Newton brought Las Vegas  to Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre on Saturday. The two-hour-plus show showcased a  highly likable entertainer, with a still-youthful tenor voice that's  serviceable, if not nearly on a par in character or ability with those of Vegas  greats Sinatra, Elvis and Tom Jones. And even when Newton's act seemed to be a  self-parody, there was no mistaking his genuine affection for his audience.  </P> <P> But Newton must be a born celebrity, because it's hard to see what he ever did  to become one. Unlike Elvis and other talents whose originality was deep-fried  by the Vegas showrooms, Newton never was that unique an artist. That showed in  his shtick-stuffed performance, which -- aside from his '60s potatoes "Danke  Schoen" and "Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast" -- was a Disney-deep romp through  the work of Presley, Sam Cooke and others. Included was a version of "Bridge  Over Troubled Water" so smarmy, slick and disco-ized that it could have put  Paul Simon into his grave and made him spin.JIM WASHBURN  </P></p>

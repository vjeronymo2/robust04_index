			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Suharto family a driving force at Lamborghini Lamborghini, once the pride of Italy's sports car manufacturers, is taking the fast lane to the East. A consortium of businessmen from Malaysia and Indonesia are putting the finishing touches to a deal believed to be worth in the region of USDollars 40m giving them full control of the Lamborghini marque. Hit by the recession and a fall off in orders in the luxury sports car market, Lamborghini has been struggling for several years to keep production going. Since the late 1980s Lamborghini has been controlled by Chrysler of the US. Lamborghini's new owners have an interesting pedigree. Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, the youngest son of Indonesia's President Suharto, has a 50 per cent stake in Megatech, a Bermuda registered company which is taking control of Lamborghini. The remaining shareholders in the enterprise are Mycom, a listed Malaysian gaming and property company, Koperasi Polis DiRaja, the Malaysian police investment fund, and Mr Setiawan Djody, an Indonesian entrepreneur who controls the country's Setdco group of companies. Exactly what the consortium intends to do with Lamborghini is not clear. Mycom says it likely that the engine technology of Lamborghini will be used to develop commercial vehicles in Indonesia. However, industry analysts say Mycom is more interested in forming a business alliance with the younger Suharto, a person of considerable influence in the world of Indonesian business. The Suharto children are a considerable force in the fast expanding vehicle market in Indonesia. A company controlled by a daughter of President Suharto recently entered into an agreement with Malaysian interests to import the Malaysian made Proton car into Indonesia. Another son of the Indonesian president controls one of the country's biggest vehicle assembly operations.</p>

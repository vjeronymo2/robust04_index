			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandur Marinov, chairman of the </F> Bulgarian Socialist Party Sofia (BSP) City Organization, by  Teodora Encheva; place and date not given: "41st BSP Congress  Was Rigidly Staged"]    [Text] [Encheva] Mr. Marinov, were you definitely  defeated by Zhan Videnov?    [Marinov] (Laughing) I do not think your question is  precise. There was no duel between me and Zhan Videnov even from  the formal point of view. The contest simply did not take  place. It was not allowed.    [Encheva] But you yourself opened the duel.    [Marinov] On the contrary, such an impression was  deliberately created to use it as a pretext of staging an attack  against myself and my colleagues from the Sofia organization. I  would like to say that I am rather concerned with the artificial  lack of alternatives. This is something that does not speak  well of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], because the party  did not do the necessary for having a normal, nonviolent contest  at the congress. This was a consequence of the congress' spirit.  The real problems were evaded and there was a desire to proceed  in a smooth manner, occasionally, amidst staged applause.  Personally, I use very cautiously the concept "definitely," and  view ironically any attempt to speak on behalf of history.    [Encheva] Who was the stage director at the congress?    [Marinov] The old leadership. This was a skillfully  manipulated congress, which returns us very much to the past.  everything was reduced to resolving the personnel issue.  However, the critical discussion should not have been  eliminated. I am disappointed, because I thought that the  changes in the BSP are irreversible.    There was a strict staging of the statements. The principle  of giving the floor in accordance to the order of requesting it,  was not observed. There was an extensive preliminary campaign  in the media, including our party organ, which had the task of  creating a negative attitude toward certain organizations and  people, and then there was the entire technical organization of  the congress itself.    [Encheva] Why were you the only candidate against Videnov?  What happened to Yanaki Stoilov, Nikolay Kamov, Georgi  Purvanov....    [Marinov] Well, I suppose that when certain people saw what  happens, they lost their desire to compete.    [Encheva] Desire or....    [Marinov] So to speak.    [Encheva] What do you want now from the BSP?    [Marinov] I want a program clarity, a clear face, and less  general and evasive phrases. Second, I want a decisive rather  that a simulated orientation toward new elections. In this  sphere we again are carried away by the wave of strong words.  Third, I want to expand democracy in the party -- only thus  would it be possible to expand its influence and allow its  cadres to develop their potential. Unfortunately, according to  the charter this is impossible. I cannot understand why my  proposal to allow the municipal organizations to nominate the  candidates for National Assembly membership was not accepted.    [Encheva] Do you still think that the elections will take  place this fall?    [Marinov] I already have my doubts. I am afraid that the  elections are a flag that is being waved for different reasons.  I would be a great disaster for the BSP if it finds itself at  the rear end of the events, and is forcibly brought to the  election polling stations. However, there still is a great  chance that there will be elections in the fall, not because  someone wants them, but because those are the objective  tendencies. It would be very bad, let me repeat, very bad, if  the impression is created that the BSP is afraid of elections.  I am afraid that such an impression has already been created.    [Encheva] Nevertheless, why did you not allow yourself to  be elected as a member of the BSP Supreme Council?    [Marinov] I refused to be a delegate of the Sofia  organization. Frankly, I sensed the prevailing spirit and  deliberately assumed a risk hoping that an absurd situation will  emerge, which will indicate the real situation.    [Encheva] Do you think that this was a personal defeat?    [Marinov] I consider this to be an injustice. Life has  taught me to endure defeats, but I have difficulties in  swallowing injustice. I do not think that political rating is  something fleeting that emerges and disappears suddenly.  However, my cause was just and most of my benevolent comrades  will appreciate this.    Personally, I did not expect that so many unworthy means  would be used in such a scope. What can I do, this is  democracy.... (laughing)    [Encheva] Do you feel betrayed?    [Marinov] No. I am sorry that most of the delegates did not  understand what happened.    [Encheva] You did not have a team, is this what you mean?    [Marinov] I did not have organized support because I did not  need a conspiracy. However, I had the support of a large part  of the Sofia organization and other regions.    [Encheva] I did not understand what do you call the division  in the BSP.    [Marinov] Look, the question is whose interests are being  defended through politics. Obviously, certain internal and  external economic factors have their influence, and our  differences constantly increase. I do not say that those  differences could be completely eliminated, but it should be  clear what prompts our political steps.    Today we should have a much more active social policy -- but  you see what happens.    I think that the ideas of general-democratic reforms are  rather a cover, because it is clear that the reforms have a  socioeconomic contents.    [Encheva] Will you head an ideological current within the  BSP?    [Marinov] My views coincide with the main ideas vested in  the BSP draft program, prepared by the Strategic Research  Center. I would make the step you mention if the adoption of  the program is prevented. Obviously, an ideological and  political division will emerge then in the BSP.    [Encheva] The referendum on the program will be after 9  September. Will you wait passively until then?    [Marinov] First, we have to elaborate the draft.    I am afraid that we will have to overcome a serious  resistance and attempts to change it in such a way that it would  lose its authentic ideas. It should be clearly explained to the  party what is the meaning of the referendum.    [Encheva] Do you trust Videnov as a chairman?    [Marinov] I cannot answer this question unequivocally.    [Encheva] This is prompted by your emotions, right?    [Marinov] He is the legitimate chairman, and I observe the  party charter. However, confidence is something much greater  than that.</p>

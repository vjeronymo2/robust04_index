			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 7 (CTK) -- After consultation with  the Foreign, Defense and Interior Ministries, the Ministry of  Industry and Trade's Licensing Authority has turned down a  request by the RDP Group, a company uniting weapons industries,  for a license to enter the Iranian market.    Industry and Trade Ministry spokesman Kamil Cermak said the  RDP Group's general director had asked the ministry to consider  the possibility of its exporting technology to Iran for the  repair of T-72 tanks. Not one of the ministries which the law  says have to declare their feelings on the issuing of a license  were positive about it.    Ilja Mazanek, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's  section for the Middle East and Northern Africa, told CTK on  Wednesday that the Czech Republic did not export any arms to  Iran at present. The authorities would only issue licenses for  the export of weapons to Iran in the future if it was in the  Czech Republic's interest, he added. In the export of weapons  the Czech Republic will adhere to international agreements and  subject each individual order to severe scrutiny.    Mazanek stressed that no United Nations Security Council  sanctions had been imposed on Iran as was the case with Libya or  Iraq. However, he admitted that Iran was one of the "sensitive"  areas, and that this would be taken into account when  potentially "problematic" supplies were being considered. These  were above all weapons, but also components for nuclear power  stations.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Lu Mu (7627 3668) from the "In-Depth </F> Discussion on Chinese Economic Efficiency" Column: "A Study on  Investment Benefits"]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- Over the last 40 years  up to 1993, China spent several hundred billion yuan in fixed  asset investment. During those years, China started up more  than 10,000 large and medium-sized basic construction projects,  of which 5,000 were completed and put into operation. What  about their economic efficiency? To prepare this article, I  discussed the problem with many management personnel and  investment experts. They all said it would be very difficult to  explain the problem in a few words.    Experts divided the economic benefits of fixed asset  investment into projected benefits, construction benefits, and  final benefits. Projected benefits refer to a process through  which experts check the possibility of the success of an  investment project from the stage of decisionmaking, design,  completion, and commissioning of the said investment project.  To determine construction benefits, one needs to check the  extent of cost-saving (quality included) during construction of  the investment project, as there is only input and no output  during the construction period. Final benefits are the most  important, because investment results are finally reflected in  economic benefits following the commissioning of a project.  Investment results are also reflected in whether the invested  amount can be recouped ahead of schedule or on schedule and by  the increase in the value of capital.    Based on the division of projected, construction, and final  benefits, and as far as the state's major and medium-sized  projects are concerned, we can say that most of the decisions on  building these projects were correct; construction of most of  them was successful; their projected benefits were good or  excellent; and they have played a positive role in the  development of China's economy. Among them was the "156"  project which was carried out many years ago under the First  Five-Year Plan. Among recent cases were a number of state key  projects including the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex, Gezhou  Dam, Beijing-Guangzhou Double-Track Railway,  Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway, and Yangpu Bridge. Not only  were their projected benefits good, but their construction and  final benefits were also satisfactory.    However, wrong decisions and poor construction planning  indeed contributed to many failed projects. Heavy losses begin  with the completion of flawed projects. In one case, a newly  built port was unable to handle oil because none was available.  The result: The port was left idle most of the time. In  another case, some railways were built to transport local coal,  but as none was available by the time they were completed,  additional railways had to be constructed to transport other  provinces' coal. One locality spent $36 million on importing a  set of equipment to produce methyl alcohol; but, because of the  excess local production capacity for methyl alcohol and because  there was no buyer for this equipment, it was left idle and  became a heap of scrap metal.    Regarding construction benefits, there were cases of cost  overruns -- I am not talking about a 10 or 20 percent cost  overrun but overruns of 100-200 percent. There were also many  cases of behind-schedule and poor-quality projects. Due to  various reasons, the final benefits of many projects were poor.  This resulted in a failure to repay investment loans and the  inability to recoup the investment amount. What are the reasons  behind poor economic benefits?    "This is a complex and long-standing problem," remarked one  person involved in investment planning. He said the problems  behind poor economic benefits for some investment projects are  not new; they are age-old problems which have been discussed  again and again. They include: The scrambling to set up  investment projects; "feasibility reports" which tend to become  "approval reports;" disregard for project appraisal  consultation; failure to follow the procedures governing basic  construction projects; and bid rigging. Some investment experts  added the following reasons: Flip-flop decisions on investment  projects; emphasis on extensive forms of enlarged production;  negligence of intensive forms of enlarged production;  concentration on oversupplied goods production to the neglect of  production of goods in short supply; emphasis on small-scale  projects to the neglect of large-scale projects; overhastiness  in starting up projects; and the tendency to go slow on start-up  projects.    We have to admit that a micro-investment project tends to be  affected and restrained by the macroeconomic environment.  "Fondness for big projects" and "excessive investment" are the  direct reasons that cause poor economic benefits for some  investment projects.    What are the adverse effects of the excessive investment  scale?    When many construction projects are plagued with the problem  of fund supply, the state is forced to issue inordinate amounts  of money on the market. Even if the state issues a large amount  of money on the market, there is no certainty that it can meet  the fund requirements of many construction projects. If funds  are unavailable, the progress of the project will be affected,  completion will be delayed, and construction benefits will be  adversely affected.    Fixed asset investment not only requires funds but also  materials. An overly extended investment scale will lead to  steel, cement, and glass shortages. When all rush to buy up  materials, prices will surely rise, which will then trigger  inflation.    There is an objective law behind the scale of investment  which does not change with changes in the people's will. The  objective law dictates that construction scale be commensurate  with national strength. Every year, a country may only draw a  portion from the GDP or from the national income to invest in  fixed assets that will not produce output within a short period.  How big should this portion be? That depends on the  availability of the funds at the time. All in all, when the  investment rate climbs up to a certain degree, it is bound to  fall to seek a balance in supply and demand. Otherwise, national  economic development will be affected. Therefore, maintaining a  proper investment rate, extending the cycle of fluctuation as  long as possible, reducing the fluctuation rate, and avoiding  "flip-flops," are the keys to raising investment benefits, and  to bringing about a sustained and healthy development of the  national economy.    Some experts of the State Statistical Bureau believe that  the proper annual investment rate for China is between 30 and 32  percent. A researcher of the Economics Research Center of the  State Planning Commission has said practice since the start of  reform and opening up shows that strains and even imbalance will  happen in various sectors of the national economy if the annual  investment rate exceeds 30 percent and the investment rate of  state-owned units exceeds 20 percent.    The construction of projects is separated from their  productive operations, and the investment management system  deals with the former only. As a result, people seek only to  have a project approved, built, and completed, and they do not  care about final benefits. This is another direct cause for  poor economic efficiency of some investment projects.    Under the "one-continuous-line" investment management system  over the last several dozen years, the management of an  investment project, particularly a state investment project,  ends after it is checked and accepted upon completion. A  leading group is responsible for the preparation, designing,  engineering, and completion of a major project (large or  medium-sized); and then, another leading group will be in charge  of its productive operation.    Such an investment management system, known as the "project  before enterprise" system, objectively separates project  construction from its productive operation, while the two should  be integrated as one. All the shortcomings of such a practice  have been shown today. Because of the separation, the project  designers and builders usually do not consider the needs of  enterprise production and operation. When the enterprise  manager encounters a problem, he usually uses "inherent  shortcomings" as an excuse to shirk his responsibility.  Something unusual happens in connection with investment -- for  a construction project which costs more than 50 million yuan,  the budget is projected at only 49.9 million yuan so that it  will be easier to get approval; and after it is approved and  construction starts, people's enthusiasm drastically cools down  and they do not care about its progress at all. Some people  think that what is important is to get the project approved and  the funds appropriated; after all, only the state is affected by  profit or loss.    These phenomena show that the old investment management  system objectively separates anticipated benefits from  engineering efficiency and final benefits, and seriously ignores  the pursuit of final benefits and other objectives.</p>

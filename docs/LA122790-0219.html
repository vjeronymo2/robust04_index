			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> REDSKINS ASKED TO CHANGE NAME  </P> <P> If the National Football League really is serious about civil rights and racial  issues, it should force the Washington Redskins to pick a new team name, the  president of a Phoenix Bible college says.  </P> <P> "If the NFL were really motivated by ethnic concerns, why would they have a  team called the Redskins?" asks Dave Moore, president of the American Indian  Bible College.  </P> <P> "What if some other team came into the league and decided to call themselves  the Blackskins or the Yellowskins?"  </P> <P> Moore wrote to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, asking the league to find a new  name for the Redskins in light of the NFL's threat to pull the 1993 Super Bowl  out of Arizona because voters rejected a paid Martin Luther King holiday.  </P> <P> Both NFL and Redskins officials brushed off the suggestion, saying they have no  intention of changing the name because it is "a tradition."  </P> <P> "Team nicknames often are a celebration of American folklore," NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello said.  </P></p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Microsoft faces fresh investigation THE anti-trust division of the US Justice Department is to review documents relating to the business practices of Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, following the failure of the Federal Trade Commission to agree on the case after a three-and-a-half year investigation. The move represents a setback for Microsoft because it had appeared that the FTC was hopelessly deadlocked on the issue and that the investigation might soon end. The company declined to comment. The review also moves the issue into the political arena and could test the Clinton administration's tougher stance on anti-trust enforcement. If the Justice Department finds evidence of anti-competitive activity, it will have to decide whether the public interest is served by taking action against one of the most successful high technology companies in the US. The Justice Department will review the thousands of documents amassed by the FTC. Microsoft's competitors allege that the company has attempted to raise false concerns among customers that its Windows program does not work properly with operating system programs sold by competitors. Microsoft has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.</p>

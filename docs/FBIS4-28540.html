			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- The House of Councillors is  expected to approve the government's long-overdue fiscal 1994  budget as soon as June 24, five days before the current Diet  session ends, parliamentary sources said Friday [10 June].    The prospect arose after the upper house's budget committee  agreed earlier in the day to hold a public hearing June 20 on  the 73 trillion yen budget for the fiscal year which started  April 1.    The House of Representatives passed the budget Wednesday.</p>

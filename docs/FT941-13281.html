			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Menvier-Swain shares fall 30p after warning Shares in Menvier-Swain Group fell by 30p to 250p after the emergency lighting and fire alarms company warned that its second-half results might be influenced by recession in some continental European markets. Pre-tax profits advanced 28 per cent to Pounds 4.1m in the six months to October 31, while sales increased by 35 per cent to Pounds 33.8m. Mr Roy McDowell, chairman, said the UK businesses were expected to perform well in the second half. Overall, he was confident that the full-year result would be an improvement over last year. Having weathered recession in the UK, Mr McDowell said he was now pleased to report increases in both sales and profits for the UK emergency lighting and fire alarm companies. 'In the security market, Westminster performed strongly, but Menvier Security had a disappointing first half with sales taking longer to increase than originally expected. Transmould, our Irish subsidiary, performed strongly and is now a significant contributor to group profits.' He said the group was now seeing for the first time recessionary effects in some markets in continental Europe, 'although not to the extent that we saw two years ago in the UK.' Mr Roger Fletcher, chief executive, said a Pounds 200,000 loss in Germany reflected delays in introducing new, UK-manufactured products and post-acquisition rationalisation costs. There were no signs of recession in France, but cost-cutting by a leading competitor in emergency lighting had reduced margins. Earnings rose to 5.6p (4.9p). In raising the dividend to 1.3p from a restated 1.1p, directors said they had taken into account current trading conditions and a desire to increase the proportion of the total paid at the interim stage. COMMENT The share price fell sharply partly because the figures were a little below expectations and partly because they had enjoyed a sharp run-up ahead of the announcement. Analysts revised their full-year forecasts from just over Pounds 10m to about Pounds 9.5m, but seem satisfied that these numbers were caused by a combination of specific problems, rather than a deeper failure of the group's expansionary strategy in Europe. The shares are on a prospective multiple of 19.5, a 13 per cent premium to the market. That is justified by the group's track record in growing profits through recession, but buyers at this level will be looking for long-term growth rather than immediate outperformance.</p>

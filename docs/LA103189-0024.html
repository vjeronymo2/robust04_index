			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH FREEWAY  </P> <P> The Times' editorial "A Gap That, Sadly, Must Be Filled" (Oct. 18) sounds like  crocodile tears for the residents of South Pasadena and El Sereno, shed by the  people living to the north of them. Why are people in inner areas always asked  to sacrifice for the convenience of people in the outer areas?  </P> <P> It is not that the residents of the impacted communities are unwilling to have  people from other areas passing through -- just that they do it in a more  civilized manner. The residents have made it clear that they would support rail  freight instead of trucks, and light rail for commuters instead of highway  lanes for cars.  </P> <P> The editorial builds the best possible case for the link, but the case is  inherently weak. How could this link not generate additional traffic? Whether  or not more growth will occur around the gap is irrelevant. The trips originate  in the hinterlands where growth is occurring; the freeway link would stimulate  further growth to generate the trips to more than fill the new freeway link.  </P> <P> Even the idea that free-flowing traffic generates less pollution is fanciful.  </P> <P> Inclusion of mass transit in plans for the freeway should be recognized for  what it is: a sugar coating for a bitter pill. A real mass transit solution  would omit the freeway.  </P> <P> The Times has an excellent record of support for endangered species, but the  freeway is a dinosaur that has caused enough problems already. Extinction is a  fitting end.  </P> <P> ED DUNCAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

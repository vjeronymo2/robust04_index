			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Risk control helps Kredietbank rise 15% Kredietbank, one of Belgium's largest private banks, yesterday said a programme of diversification and risk control had helped it to boost profits by 15.1 per cent last year. Total consolidated net profit for 1993 was BFr9.8bn (Dollars 269m), up from BFr8.5bn the previous year. The board has proposed a dividend of BFr200 per share, up from BFr185 per share in 1992. Kredietbank said the growth in profits, which was broadly in line with market expectations, had occurred even though its operations in the Belgium business sector had been hit by falling demand for credit and a rising level of write-offs during the past year. 'The worst recession since the second world war . . . and an unfavourable situation between short and long-term interest rates led to weak domestic demand for credit, an appreciable increase in write-downs for credit to Belgium businesses and great pressure on the interest rate margin,' the bank said. However, this had been largely offset by an expansion in international lending and home loans. Meanwhile, customers' deposits had risen by 15.3 per cent in 1993 to BFr1.4bn. Most of the growth was due to an expansion of time deposits and savings certificates.</p>

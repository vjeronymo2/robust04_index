			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Nomura investor sues executives A SHAREHOLDER of Nomura Securities yesterday filed a suit against its executives for losses incurred in allegedly improper sales of its investment products. Corporate executives are facing a rush of lawsuits after changes to the Commercial Code eased costs for shareholder litigants. Earlier, shareholders of Hazama construction company filed an action against its executives for Y99m (Pounds 620,000). Executives at Janome, a sewing machine maker, are also being sued. Mr Nobuo Kameda is demanding that 58 Nomura directors, including former executives, pay Y23.5bn in damages to the brokerage house. He claims they are responsible for the brokerage's compensation to investors of losses from US mortgage backed securities. Nomura posted Y22.5bn in special losses due to compensation payments made to investors claiming risks in buying the products were not properly explained by Nomura sales staff. It is uncertain how far courts will back shareholders.</p>

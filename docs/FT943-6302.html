			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / UK Company News: New dealing regulations have little impact The new insider dealing regulations which came into force on March 1 have had little impact on the way companies communicate with the City, according to a survey published today. The new rules, and related advice from the Stock Exchange, were seen as threatening cherished practices such as the 'brokers' lunch'. However, three quarters of the companies surveyed said they had not changed their attitude to the use of brokers' lunches and only 14 per cent had altered their approach to analysts' briefings. But half said they had changed their opinion on what constituted important information that should be communicated through the Stock Exchange. Mr Jonathan Gillen, managing director of Focus Communications, which conducted the survey, said: 'The Act would appear to have had little or no effect. In reality the virtuous are still self-policing just as before. The perception that it might create a new attitude towards shareholder relations seems to have been overstated.' The survey showed that the new rules had created a good deal of confusion among companies. More than three quarters admitted they were vague or unclear as to the implications for analysts' meetings and only half were confident they knew the implications for conducting a takeover. 'There appears to be considerable potential for someone to transgress the rules by mistake,' said Mr Gillen. The SE's suggestion that companies issue quarterly trading statements has not proved popular. Only 12 per cent of companies said they would do so with a further 20 per cent considering it. But 25 per cent said they would consider an announcement if brokers' estimates were out of line with current trading. The sample consisted of the top 350 UK companies and a further 150 smaller companies, with replies received from 177. See Lex</p>

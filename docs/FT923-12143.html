			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Norsk Data returns to black but chief resigns NORSK Data, the Norwegian mini-computer group, yesterday reported a return to profits for the first half of 1992 and announced the surprise resignation of its chief executive. The company said that Mr Erik Engebretsen, who is both president and chief executive, was resigning to take up a management post in September with Color Line, the Norwegian ferry operator. For the six months to end-June, Norsk Data posted a profit of NKr4m (Dollars 696,000) before tax and after extraordinary items, against a NKr257m loss in the corresponding period of 1991. Operating revenue fell 33 per cent to NKr640m but the company said that turnover adjusted for divestments was in line with that of last year's six-month period. Detailed half-year figures are expected to be published in late August. During the last three years, Mr Engebretsen has conducted a significant down-sizing operation, including restructuring the group's subsidiaries, a wide range of divestments and staff reductions. The board sought yesterday to play down Mr Engebretsen's resignation. Mr Terje Mikalsen, board chairman, said the board was very satisfied with his management during the turbulent restructuring process. Mr Tor Alfheim, who is to replace Mr Engebretsen, was closely involved with the restructuring as vice-president. Mr Engebretsen will remain a non-executive member of Norsk Data's board. He said that he had completed his job to restructure the company and that it was gratifying for him to leave Norsk Data in profit. Norsk Data, once considered a Scandinavian wonder stock, has seen its Oslo share price plunge from a high of NKr300 in 1985 to its current level of around NKr2.50. The group equity-to-debt ratio is currently 3 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE ETHICS PANEL PROBING DURENBERGER'S PAID APPEARANCES  </P> <P> The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating 113 paid appearances by Sen. Dave  Durenberger (R-Minn.) to determine whether he violated limits on outside income  in 1985-86, according to a letter from the panel released Friday.  </P> <P> The letter to Durenberger, required under the panel's rules, provided  additional details of its investigation into the lawmaker's controversial book  contract and other dealings.  </P> <P> For instance, the panel had not previously disclosed how many paid  book-promotion appearances by Durenberger were under investigation. Other newly  released information provided details on travel reimbursements, a campaign  check possibly converted to personal use, book-promotion speeches in the U.S.  Capitol and gifts of limousine service.  </P> <P> The committee voted last week to hold trial-like proceedings to determine  whether Senate rules had been violated by Durenberger, or whether any of his  actions should be referred to the Justice Department for a criminal  investigation. The panel's letter to the senator was a formal notice of the  action and a statement of possible violations.  </P> <P> Durenberger said after receiving the letter: "I will continue to cooperate  fully with the committee and will present evidence demonstrating that there was  no intent on my part to violate or circumvent Senate rules."  </P> <P> The panel wrote Durenberger that "you may have violated" two separate laws on  outside-income limits "through an arrangement with your publisher, Piranha  Press."  </P> <P> Under an arrangement that has been widely publicized, the committee said that  Durenberger charged businesses, associations and other organizations an  appearance fee, as senators usually do when speaking in their official capacity  as lawmakers.  </P> <P> But Durenberger has said that the appearances under investigation were part of  a deal he made with his publisher to promote books he had written on health and  defense issues. He has contended that the fees earned should not have counted  toward the Senate's outside-earnings limitations.  </P> <P> Some of the organizations have said that they considered the appearances  standard speeches by a senator and that the books were not mentioned.  </P> <P> The panel told Durenberger he turned over his fees to the publisher, "in  exchange for which you received $100,000" from Piranha.  </P> <P> The committee letter said Durenberger "may have violated" Senate rules -- and  the Ethics In Government Act -- "by failing to disclose in a timely fashion"  the travel-expense reimbursements he received from 43 of the appearances. The  panel previously had not disclosed the number of reimbursements under  investigation.  </P> <P> Durenberger amended his financial disclosure forms last July to include the  reimbursement data.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) directs the Secretary to allow, upon request by U.S. citizens engaged in a specific activity (other than commercial fishing) in a specified geographical region, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine mammals, if certain findings are made and regulations are issued. Under the MMPA, the term ``taking'' means to harass, hunt, capture or kill.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permission may be granted for periods up to 5 years if the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for public comment, that the taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s) of marine mammals and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock(s) for subsistence uses. In addition, the Secretary must prescribe regulations that include permissible methods of taking and other means effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the species and its habitat, and on the availability of the species for subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds and areas of similar significance. The regulations must include requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1986, the MMPA and the Endangered Species Act (ESA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543) were amended to allow incidental takings of depleted, endangered, or threatened marine mammals. Before the 1986 amendments, section 101(a)(5) applied only to non-depleted marine mammals, and the more restrictive provisions of the MMPA prevailed, which meant that an incidental take of endangered or depleted marine mammals could not be allowed even if the anticipated take would result in only negligible impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 13, 1993, NMFS received an application from the Navy for a Letter of Authorization (LOA) under section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA and 50 CFR 228.6, that would allow the unintentional take of small numbers of pinnipeds and cetaceans for a period of 5 years, commencing February 1994, incidental to a wide variety of military projects involving the underwater detonation of conventional explosives in the offshore waters of the OSTR of the NAWC, off Pt. Mugu, Ventura County, CA, seaward of the Channel Islands. This application was made available for public review on June 7, 1993 (58 FR 31944). NMFS requested comments, information and suggestions concerning the request and the structure and content of the regulations governing the take. The comment period closed on July 7, 1993. The application was subsequently modified by letter on September 2, 1993 to request an incidental take for two additional species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the Navy describes its proposed activities under the ``Live Fire'' testing program mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act (10 U.S.C. 139), ships and critical components or systems constructed for the Navy must undergo shock tests prior to service with the fleet to determine the integrity of the structure and electronic systems that are vital to the overall function and performance of the vessel and its crew under wartime combat conditions. This is especially true when a new class of ship is constructed. The new ship must be subjected to a ``near-miss'' underwater explosion while its crew tracks airborne and waterborne targets in the area. These tests help the Navy identify weaknesses in the ship's design early in the construction of a new class of ship, which, when corrected, enhance the survivability of the ship, its systems, and most importantly, its crew. The design corrections and improvements are then applied to all follow-on ships of that class.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The shock trial is a complicated combat simulation that requires the participation of several Navy aircraft and ships. Their purpose is to challenge the shock trial ship's tracking and communications systems after the detonation. To ensure the safety of commercial aircraft and vessels, the Navy must conduct these trials in an area where they can maintain control of air and sea space while the trial is being conducted. In addition, the site must be close to the repair facilities, should the ship become disabled. Under normal conditions, for Navy ships homeported on the west coast, the designated site is the OSTR, which is under the jurisdiction of the NAWC. The Navy anticipates that on an annual basis, no more than 10 projects involving underwater explosions will be conducted under the requested LOA (Table 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

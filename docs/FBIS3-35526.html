			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to PLO Executive </F> Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on Israeli Affairs, by Qol  Yisra'el correspondent Ziyad Halabi; place not given -- live or  recorded]    [Text] [Halabi] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, PLO Executive Committee  chairman's adviser, you spoke with Yasir 'Arafat on the phone  this morning about the mass killings in Hebron. Was Yasir  'Arafat aware of the details, and what is the PLO's official  reaction?    [Al-Tibi] Brother President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]  briefed me on the details this morning. He is in contact with  the relatives of the victims in Hebron, and he has been informed  about the details and the massacre that took place at Ibrahimi  Mosque in Hebron. After the telephone call, I spoke with  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. We are watching the  situation, and visiting our wounded in the hospitals. This is  an odious and vile crime carried out by a settler, whom they say  is a doctor from Qiryat Arba'. We cannot accept the story that  he is a psychopath, as some try to portray him to us.    [Halabi] Dr. al-Tibi, in your opinion what is the solution?    [Al-Tibi] The solution is to immediately disarm these  settlers. If the Israeli Army and police, who supposedly are  responsible for security, cannot provide security to the citizen  who carries out his daily activities and prayers, then the  United Nations can do this. The solution is to expedite the  withdrawal of the Israeli Army. The solution is to disarm the  settlers. The solution lies in international protection,  because it has been proven that the Israeli Army cannot protect  defenseless Palestinians. Some of the Palestinians who were  martyred today were martyred by the bullets of the Israeli Army.  This is the climax. It does not suffice that a settler opens  fire in an indiscriminate manner, resulting in a massacre in the  Ibrahimi Mosque, but the Armed forces too, instead of protecting  the Palestinians, opened fire and killed at least four  Palestinians. What is needed is international protection for the  defenseless Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories.    [Halabi] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, has PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat  told you to convey any message to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin  and the Israeli Government in this respect?    [Al-Tibi] As I told you, I spoke with whom I should speak at  the highest level within the Israeli Government. They know the  PLO's stand and demands, not to mention that President 'Arafat  has called for the need to have international protection. There  could be a need to convene the UN Security Council.    [Halabi] Dr. al-Tibi, in your opinion what impact will this  painful incident have on the Palestinians in general?    [Al-Tibi] The Palestinians have been suffering and have  expressed doubts during the past week. But, today, the pain is  general, and sorrow overwhelms all the occupied Palestinian  territories, inside and outside the Green Line. Mourning has  been announced, as you know. The Palestinians must feel that  there is some change. As yet, the Palestinian citizen has not  sensed that changes have taken place on the ground. On the  contrary, things are getting worse. We tirelessly work to  expedite the conclusion of the peace agreement so such crimes by  the settlers cannot take place and to end the tribulations of  the two people, the Palestinian and Israeli people.    [Halabi] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, thank you.    [Al-Tibi] Thank you.</p>

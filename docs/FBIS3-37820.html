			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Suleyman Demirel, president of Turkey, by </F> Dmitriy Kulik, date not given: "Suleyman Demirel: `I Have  Elevated Democracy to the Level of Poetry'" -- first three  paragraphs are introduction]    [Text] Ankara -- Suleyman Demirel is well known throughout  the world today. He has been elected prime minister seven  times, twice he has been ousted by the military, but history  restores everything to its rightful place and last year he  became president of our neighbor, Turkey.    His path to the top was as long and arduous as Turkey's path  to democracy and economic prosperity. The irony is that it is  his name specifically which for millions of Turks is synonymous  with democracy (although Demirel translated means "iron hand").    His residence today is the sumptuous "Pink House" (that is  the nickname given to the president's palace because of the  gaudy color of the stone with which it is finished). It is  difficult to gain access to this building even for local  journalists -- he has no time for interviews. However he made  an exception for us -- Demirel has always paid close attention  to Russia and, as it turned out, he knows our newspaper well.    [Kulik] The leaders of many former republics of the USSR  regard Turkey not only as an "older brother" who will help them  in difficult times but also as a "father," in the belief that he  will not only bring up his poor children but will also give them  a start in "adult life." Do people in those countries not  overexaggerate the role of Turkey, which has a host of economic  problems of its own, a complex political situation, and vast  debts?    [Demirel] We consider it our political and moral duty to  help the newly independent Turkic republics to strengthen their  statehood, overcome their economic problems, and enter the  market.    Our relations are based on equality of rights. That is why  there is no question of an "older" or "younger brother." Turkey  has signed more than 200 agreements with those countries in the  spheres of the economy, culture, education, communications,  transport, technical assistance, and banking. Ankara has  granted credits totaling $935 million. In all, taken together  with humanitarian and technical assistance, these countries have  received $1,200 million.    Last year and already this year around 10,000 students from  the Central Asian republics and Azerbaijan have come to Turkey  to study thanks to an "educational link program" that has been  devised.    We are also cooperating in air transport. Flights, including  charter flights, have begun between Baku, Tashkent, Bishkek,  Almaty, Ashgabat, and Istanbul. We have given those countries  technical help to improve radio and satellite communications.  They will now be able to link up with the rest of the world via  Turkey.    [Kulik] The creation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation  [BSEC] organization was received with great enthusiasm,  although with the passage of time interest in this organization  has gradually begun to wane. Does this mean that the BSEC has  not lived up to the hopes of politicians and businessmen? What  specifically is Turkey doing to develop regional cooperation?    [Demirel] I do not share the view that interest in the BSEC  has waned. It is working fully -- which is confirmed by the  number of joint decisions and technical meetings.    Moreover, the interest of third parties can be confirmed by  the increase in the number of requests for "observer status"  from various states or nongovernmental organizations. As you  already know, I am sure, Poland, Tunisia, Israel, Slovakia, and  Egypt have already been given that status within the BSEC. The  same status has been given to the organization's council created  by commercial associations from the member countries. The  International Black Sea Club has been created. The progress  achieved with the framework of the BSEC may be considered  outstanding. Its structural organization has been completed and  the transition to the level of implementing specific projects  has been made. Cooperation in the telecommunications sphere is  developing particulary actively.    [Kulik] Islamic fundamentalism is worrying the whole world  today. Does that problem exist in Turkey? How do you regard it?    [Demirel] To be frank, it is hard to understand how world  publc opinion can be worried about the activation of Islamic  fundamentalism. After all, in former Yugoslavia and especially  on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina it is the Muslims who  have been subjected to attack. It is they essentially who are  suffering genocide. More than 1 million people in Azerbaijan  have become refugees in their own country. And it is against  that background that the whole world is for some reason talking  about Islamic fundamentalism.    On the contrary, it is the Muslims who are presently in a  defensive position. That must be clearly seen.    Islamic fundamentalism in the eighties was a kind of  reaction  by the populations of various Muslim countries to the lack of  democracy and to pressure from the authoriies. But if we look  at things from today's perspective, we will see that even the  most radical Islamic tendencies of that period which entered the  leadership of certain countries have substantially moderated  their position.    In the nineties the situation began to develop differently.  A new world order is being formed in the process of which a  host of problems which have accumulated since World War I have  surfaced. In such an uncertain atmosphere, religiosity,  micronationalism, a hostile attitude to foreigners, and other  harmful tendencies have begun to prevail in various regions. It  is because the world community did not prevent them in time that  we now have the present situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    There is no need to speak of fundamentalism in Turkey: We  do not have such a problem. Yes, of course, there are  individual fundamentalists or fairly small and uninfluential  groups of that kind. But you can encounter that anywhere in the  world. But the overwhelming majority of Turks are implacable  toward fundamentalism. The fact is that Turkey has quite  considerable experience in the sphere of democracy and law -- we  have accepted them as a way of life.... Go out into the streets  and talk with Turks there and you will see that for yourself.    [Kulik] Last year Turkish officials were heard to say a  number of times that the "Kurdish Workers' Party [PKK] would be  finished off before 1994." Indeed, Ankara did conduct a number  of successful operations against Kurdish militants both in  Turkey itself and in Europe. However, the strength of the PKK  has not diminished, the struggle goes on, and people continue to  die. Do you still believe that this organization must be fought  by strong-arm methods alone? What is the way out of the present  situation?    [Demirel] I do not believe that anyone said: "The PKK will  be finished off...." I am sure that they were talking about an  effective and successful campaign against that terrorist  organization and the weakening of it, which has been achieved.    Turkey is constantly trying to resolve this problem on the  basis of the norms of a democratic, rule-of-law state. We are  opposed to the destruction of the country and our villages,  attacks on border posts and police stations, and the murder of  people, indiscriminate murder furthermore -- of children, women,  men, civilians or military, young or old. And Turkey's measures  in response to all this are constitutional: We are protecing  our democratic regime by the methods of that democratic regime.  I do not think that there are any other means of combatting  terrorism.    It would be a mistake to think that it is only people of  Kurdish origin who are members of the terrorist PKK. In Turkey  all people are "first class" citizens. Incidentally, there are  more Kurds in western Turkey than in the southeast (that is  where the war against the PKK is particularly fierce -- author's  note). They live as they please and where they please, they  work where they want to work. And our task is to protect them  from the PKK, a terrorist organzation which engages in  racketeering, drug smuggling, and other illegal activity.    [Kulik] The Cold War has ended, but Turkey retains its  former military concept and there are NATO basis still on its  territory. Do you think that it is still necessary to preserve  this situation?    [Demirel] I do not believe that there is any reason to fear  this in Moscow. There is an agreement on friendship and  cooperation between Russia and Turkey which I myself signed in  1992.    [Kulik] Since you have raised the subject, incidentally, do  you not rule out cooperation in the military sphere?    [Demirel] Turkey is a part of NATO. If that organization's  policy and doctrine allow such cooperation then of course it is  possible. But we are already collaborating in the military  sphere by buying your military hardware. There are  consultations between our generals, the Russian defense minister  has visited Turkey....    Russia is no longer our enemy. We have formed good  relations.    [Kulik] Sometimes the Turkish reforms are called almost an  "economic miracle." There is also an opinion that it was only  the army, when it held power in Turkey, which ensured stability  and prepared the ground for successful political and economic  transformations. As a president and a politican who has  suffered from the army a number of times, what do you think  about that?    [Demirel] The involvement of the military in politics is the  oldest thing in the world. But sooner or later people always  come to the conclusion that power must be civilian. Where the  army is under the leadership of civilians, there you get  democracy. Where the military run everything, there you get  fascism.    The army cannot prepare the country for democracy. The  people must prepare themselves for democracy which cannot  develop "in silence." That is why I shall never agree with the  leading role of the army in reforms.    [Kulik] How do you view the results of the parliamentary  elections in Russia? Will they influence Russian-Turkish  relations?    [Demirel] The elections in Russia are, of course, entirely  Russia's domestic affair. They are a reflection of the Russian  people's political will. These were the first free elections in  Russia and approved the new post-communist constitution. I am  confident that the process of reforms, which are so tumultuous  in your country, will continue.    As for our bilateral relations, I would like to note that we  perceive Mr. Zhirinovskiy's statements with apprehension.  However, we do not believe that the many centuries old  Russian-Turkish relations can be swayed by such utterances.    [Kulik] You are a well-known politician of world stature.  Much is said and written about you. But how would Suleyman  Demirel describe himself -- as a man and a citizen?    [Demirel] I have been serving my state and my people for 40  years now, first as a technocrat, then as a politician. I first  became involved in political activity to establish the supremacy  of the people's will because my ideal was that of a happy,  prosperous, and democratic Turkey built "from scratch." I am  constantly working to achieve that ideal today.    I have elevated democracy to the level of my own poetry and  I  have always fought for it even at the most difficult times. I  derive my determination here from the determination of the  Turkish people.    If you look at the past 30 years of the Turkish Republic,  you  will see that the people have always been with me. I believe  that I worked quite hard to ensable us to achieve the level of  democracy and economic strength that we have today.    Of course, only the people can assess politicans and their  actions. That is why I feel pride in and admiration for our  people who have always rendered me my due.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Hugo Boss improves 26% to DM35.4m HUGO BOSS, the men's fashion company which is based in southern Germany, last year recovered some of its poise with a 26 per cent rise in net profits to DM35.4m (Dollars 21.5m). This was in spite of a write-down of DM24m on its loss-making US business. Turnover of Boss, controlled by the Marzotto concern of Italy, was 8 per cent higher at DM997m. Business grew faster in Germany than abroad, the company said. The company said that Mr Rene Jaggi, who has said he would step down as head of the Adidas sports shoe and clothing group at the end of this year, would not become Boss's new chief executive. It said talks with the Swiss-born Mr Jaggi had ended, but gave no reason. Boss is headed by the brothers Uwe and Jochen Holy, who have contracts until 1994, but have said they would leave earlier if necessary. Yesterday they stated that the company's business had improved further in the first quarter of 1992. Steps had been taken to cut the US losses and Boss should be able to achieve profits this year similar to those of 1991.</p>

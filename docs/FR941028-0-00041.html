			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, the Act is equally specific in establishing a mandated role for the Federal government to oversee the States in the implementation of their State regulatory programs. See sections 201(c)(1); 503; 504; 505; and 521 of the Act. Thus, to the extent that the proposed rules and the final rules adopted today envision the exercise of Federal oversight, such a role is responsive to the provisions of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, while the proposed rule and the final rule, modified and renumbered as &sect;773.25, will be compared and discussed in more detail below in this preamble, it is appropriate to offer some responses at this point since these critical comments refer to the issue of relationships between governments. These comments invoke issues of State primacy. Contrary to commenters' assertions, the rules in question allocate responsibility in a manner which is supportive of, and consistent with, State primacy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For instance, the final rule provides that a State regulatory authority which issues a violation has responsibility, subject to OSM oversight, for identifying the ownership and control relationships of the violation. See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(1)(iii). The State regulatory authority which issues a violation has the greatest interest, among those regulatory authorities with an interest in the ownership and control relationships of that violation, in seeing that the persons responsible for the violation abate the violation. Such abatement directly improves the environmental quality of the State which issues the violation. Accordingly, the State which issued a violation should have the first opportunity, subject to Federal oversight, to identify the owners or controllers of the violation. Well before OSM made its proposals in September, 1991, which form the basis for today's final rules, both SMCRA and Federal regulations recognized that a violation had to be corrected to the satisfaction of the agency that has jurisdiction over the violation, before a permit could be issued by a regulatory authority. See section 510(c) of SMCRA; 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, today's final provisions further recognize the relative access to ownership and control information that the interested regulatory authorities have at each stage of the process. The regulatory authority which issued the violation is in the best position to investigate and to develop all of the relevant facts about the violation, including the identification of those responsible for the violation. The violation was committed within the jurisdiction of the regulatory authority which issued the violation. That regulatory authority has access to the actors on the ground at the surface coal mining operation and would be able to question them to identify ownership and control information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A similar analysis can be offered in support of affording the agency before which an application is pending responsibility for identifying the ownership and control of the application. This regulatory authority has the applicant before it and can inquire of the applicant directly with respect to any ownership and control information contained in the application. Thus, the regulatory authority before which an application is pending has responsibility, subject to Federal oversight, to decide the ownership and control relationships of the application. See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(1)(i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A regulatory authority which has issued a permit has ongoing authority for the permittee's surface coal mining operations on the permitted site. Thus, this regulatory authority has responsibility, subject to Federal oversight, to decide the ownership and control relationships of the permit. See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(1)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, OSM recognizes that the industry commenters are deeply troubled by any use of the AVS in the permit application process and any application of OSM's ownership or control rules as contained at 30 CFR 773.5 and 773.15(b)(1). Nevertheless, OSM has accepted the mandate of Congress to develop and implement the AVS because ``the AVS is essential to effective enforcement of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [SMCRA].'' See Report of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate Report No. 103&hyph;114, at page 47 (July 28, 1993). Thus, the allocation of responsibilities for the various regulatory authorities contained in the proposed rules and the final rules adopted today also attempt to reflect the pragmatic realities of implementing a national computer system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once a decision has been made to go forward with a national computer system to aid the enforcement of section 510(c) of SMCRA, certain pragmatic realities must be recognized. First, information will be coming to the computer system from many sources. As each State regulatory authority analyzes ownership and control information contained in permit applications and reports such information to AVS, such information is incorporated into AVS. A national computer system requires centralized management and maintenance to assure the accuracy and consistency of information. Centralized management provides a focus of responsibility when inaccuracies or technical problems are identified. Accordingly, the Federal government, acting through OSM, has responsibility for such system management. At the same time, the States are primary actors in the permit application process and critically important actors in the development and the support of AVS. With respect to AVS, the States play a critical role in using the computer system as an information resource in the permit application process and in supplying information to AVS gleaned from the permit application process and other research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

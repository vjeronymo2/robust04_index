			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNOCENTS AT HOME;  </P> <P> BACK HOME A FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT REDISCOVERS AMERICA BY MORT ROSENBLUM  (WILLIAM MORROW: $19.95; 447 PP.; 0-688-07780-3);  </P> <P> THE LOST CONTINENT TRAVELS IN SMALL-TOWN AMERICA BY BILL BRYSON (HARPER &amp;  ROW: $19.95; 283 PP.; 0-06-016158-2)  </P> <P> Like the proverbial vacation slide shows inflicted on polite dinner guests,  travel books run the peculiar danger of tedium in recounting minor adventures  and mishaps that may excite an author but are capable of putting the reader to  sleep. These two books by Americans -- come home after years abroad to take the  nation's pulse -- hold our attention with clever, grabby prose but fail to  cover much new terrain.  </P> <P> Both are written by gifted American journalists; Mort Rosenblum, author of  "Back Home," is a Paris-based correspondent for the Associated Press, and Bill  Bryson, author of "The Lost Continent," is a humor and travel writer who lives  in Yorkshire, England. The books have much in common. Both men wander the Lower  48 alone, searching for America's soul, trying to find (and read) meaning into  old motels and chance encounters with policemen, waitresses and store clerks.  Bryson sets out from his hometown of Des Moines, Iowa, in an aging Chevy  Chevette, on loan from his mother, looking for what he terms "the perfect  town." Rosenblum travels mostly by rental car, starting his multilegged journey  in New York City, which he playfully dubs "The Big Fruit."  </P> <P> Both visit Gatlinburg, Tenn., and are appalled by its crass commercialism and  tacky kitsch. Both savor Savannah, Ga., where the downtown, "frozen in a  perpetual 1959," says Bryson, remains a desirable place to live. Both tour the  Deep South only to come away with the startling conclusion that -- hold onto  your hats -- racial prejudice has not yet vanished. What's more, each man seeks  out the tourist traps, as if to plumb the depths of the American character one  must first pay homage to its celebrity icons. We see Elvis Presley's boyhood  home in Tupelo, Miss.; Mark Twain's boyhood home in Hannibal, Mo., and Dolly  Parton's Dollywood Amusement Park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn.  </P> <P> Rosenblum is the more serious of the two writers, attempting to follow in the  footsteps of Alexis de Tocqueville and produce a commentary on the state of the  nation in the late 1980s. The resulting book is a lively montage, into which  the author laces original reportage, travelogue whimsy and information from  sources as disparate as the Department of Defense and Spy magazine, along with  ruminations on what ails America. Along the way, he picks the brains of family  and friends, like the M.I.T. sociologist who is also his cousin's husband, and  fellow journalists from around the world, now returned home.  </P> <P> "America is no longer a melting pot," writes Rosenblum. "It is a stir-fry wok.  Whatever new ingredients are added to the rest, each retains its particular  flavor and shape. But a certain uniformity is cooked in, giving us common  characteristics, standards and frames of reference."  </P> <P> Rosenblum's own frame of reference is that of '60s-vintage liberal who,  returning for his first serious visit after a two-decade absence, seems  startled at the country's failures and often disappointed that things are no  longer as they were -- or as they are now in France or the 145 foreign  countries from which he has filed dispatches. Rosenblum takes note of, and  takes on, such betes noires as the reign of "corporate martial law" in America,  the ruling principle of greed on Wall Street, white poverty in Appalachia and  our growing dependence on illegal drugs. But on his wide canvas, he seems  determined to paint only gloomy shades.  </P> <P> His perceptions run the gamut from the trenchant to the hackneyed. "The only  phrase in America heard more often than 'Have a nice day,' is 'the bottom  line,' " he writes, in an example of the latter. After the fashion of H. L.  Mencken, Rosenblum relishes his role as curmudgeon (and even calls himself  one), using the book as a forum to sound off on pet peeves, such as the  anti-smoking campaign that has gripped America. He appears seriously troubled  by the emergence of what he terms "health fascists," and, like a debater  championing a losing cause, summons up dubious studies that would seem to  dispute the dangers of passive smoking.  </P> <P> Indeed, even his visit to the Arizona Daily Star -- his old paper in his  hometown of Tucson -- proves to be a "sobering" experience. "I had left a smoky  newsroom of clattering black typewriters, where a battered old-timer from  Chicago sneaked hits from a bottle of Jim Beam in the darkroom. I came back to  a carpeted salon of eerie green computer screens and respectful young reporters  nibbling trail mix. . . . The trash barrels that had smoldered when confused  with ashtrays all were lined in clear plastic Baggies. There were no ashtrays  at all. Funny world. In a newsroom in Warsaw you could not write what you  wanted. But you could smoke a cigarette."  </P> <P> It would appear that Rosenblum's objectivity has been stricken by an acute case  of nostalgia. While railing against the scrub-nosed reporters who are in it for  the paycheck -- not the glory, as in the good old days, by gum -- Rosenblum  fails to consider the underlying conditions for these changes. The standard of  living for the young has declined since the late '60s. Money is tighter; a  paycheck must stretch farther. And, could our health consciousness be born of  the declining health of the planet? He doesn't make the connection.  </P> <P> Rosenblum is at his best when he arrives at a new place with an open mind and  allows himself to be vulnerable. In one especially moving encounter, he strikes  up an acquaintance with a Pennsylvania Dutch man, who confides his distaste for  being on constant display. "Saying good-bye, I asked Mike if I could photograph  him with his daughter," he writes. "He looked pained, caught between courtesy  and disapproval of yet another jerk with a camera. 'You can take it from across  the road, but I won't pose for you,' he said. I apologized for even suggesting  it. And I wished I were dead." What works here is that Rosenblum has joined  hands with the Americans he's analyzing. No longer the foreign correspondent  from on high, he admits to wanting what they want, which is a slice of the past  in a world overdosed on change.  </P> <P> Bill Bryson's "The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America" bears no  relation to the sort of thoughtful travel writing that was so masterfully  rendered earlier this year by V.S. Naipaul in his book, "A Turn in the South."  To say Bryson has explored America's small towns is like equating the character  development of "The Beverly Hillbillies" with "The Sound and the Fury."  </P> <P> Though Bryson uses a search for the perfect small town as a pretext for his  "travels," in fact, his book is merely a forum for the put-down humor so  popular these days -- sometimes funny, often adolescent. Usually he picks on  sitting-duck targets.  </P> <P> "K-Marts are always full of the sort of people who give their children names  that rhyme: Lonnie, Donnie, Ronnie, Connie, Bonnie. . . . Every woman there has  at least four children and they all look as if they have been fathered by a  different man. The woman always weighs 250 pounds. She is always walloping a  child and bawling, 'If you don't behave, Ronnie, I'm not gonna bring you back  here no more!' "  </P> <P> He takes on the Southern accent. "The average Southerner has speech patterns of  someone slipping in and out of consciousness. I can change my shoes and socks  faster than most people in Mississippi can speak a sentence. Living there would  drive me crazy. Slowly." He calls Iowa "a dump." Of Missouri, the "Show Me  State," Bryson wonders if they didn't really mean: "Show Me the Way to Any  Other State."  </P> <P> Yes, there's something funny in this put-down humor, but there's also something  amiss: a detachment and dehumanization that fails to reach beyond stereotype.  Bryson ever gets out of his car. The few times he does, he never interacts with  anyone. The people he encounters are invariably dim-witted, 250-pound foils,  walking opportunities to demonstrate his facility with the one-liner potshot.  </P> <P> No doubt there is much to bemoan and much to ridicule on the American  landscape. But, for my money, I'd rather see some digging -- even in line at  K-Mart.  </P></p>

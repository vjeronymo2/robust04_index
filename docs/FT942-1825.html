			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;G legal battle back in high court The legal battle over the terms of the Lloyds Bank Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society returns to the high court today, in the final stage of the initial challenge to the bid by the Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator. The judgment earlier this month from Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, that C&amp;G could not pay cash to investors who had been members for less than two years will be formally issued as a declaration of the court. The precise terms of the ruling are critically important for C&amp;G as it looks at how the offer could be restructured in a way which would bring it inside the law. The society will want to be sure that there is no prospect that a revised offer could meet a legal obstacle. Restructuring the offer to investing members may prove an easier task than to devising an alternative to the planned offer of Pounds 500 in cash to borrowing members of the society, who must also vote for the deal if it is to go ahead. If C&amp;G decides to appeal against the judgment, it will do so swiftly, in order to reduce the risk of threatening the timetable already set out for the Lloyds' takeover.</p>

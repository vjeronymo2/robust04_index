			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Stronger pound dispels concerns about gilt prices A SHARP rise in sterling against the D-Mark helped lift UK government bond prices yesterday, temporarily dispelling concern that gilts might have peaked. Gilts were stronger along the yield curve, although they held gains better at the long-dated end. Ten-year gilt futures for September opened at 108 5/32 and rose more than half a point before easing to close a net  3/32 higher on the day. Sterling's gains, prompted by the view that the UK is a safe haven from the turmoil within the European exchange rate mechanism, disguised some of the doubt creeping into the market ahead of tomorrow's Pounds 3.25bn gilts auction. Continued support for the market at all levels was matched by sellers, particularly later in the day when prices retreated in the face of profit-taking. Although the buyers remain, there are fundamental political worries ahead of the Christchurch parliamentary by-election. Dealers were watching the level of sterling against the D-Mark with interest, saying that if the pound was perceived to be overvalued investors would sell it back and that weakness could not come at a worse time for the gilt auction. Much depends on the outcome of the CBI industrial trends survey due today. If that shows any inflationary trends, that could hit the market. REGIONAL cost-of-living figures in Germany pointed to a year-on-year rise in inflation from 4.1 per cent to 4.3 per cent. However, the markets decided that the Bundesbank would have to cut interest rates to save the ERM, and bund prices were firm yesterday, although the bund futures for September eased to close 9 pfennigs higher at 96.27. Nevertheless, there was a general shift from last week's view that the Bundesbank would be unable to ease to a consensus that it would have to reduce the upper level Lombard rate and the discount rate, which sets the floor for German lending, if the ERM is to survive. FRENCH bond futures opened at 120.36 and shot up to 120.60 as investors decided that whichever way Germany falls at its Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, France will have to slash rates to rescue its faltering economy. However, the contract slipped back and closed marginally lower on the day, as did five and 10-year cash bonds after the early enthusiasm gave dealers a chance to take profits. OAT September futures ended at 120.24. AMONG the high yielding countries, Italian government bonds tested their historic high as the lira rebounded against the D-Mark. Italian September bond futures hit a high of 104.82 and closed 0.31 up on the day at 104.42. Spanish debt prices were easier ahead of an auction of three-year, five-year and 10-year paper later this week. Portuguese bonds slipped back after the central bank raised its one-day lending rate by 2.5 points to 14.5 per cent. US TREASURY prices rebounded from early losses yesterday to end higher as dealers covered their short positions ahead of this week's auctions of new government securities. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 105, yielding 6.679 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 7/8 , to yield 4.175 per cent. The dominant influence on the market yesterday was supply considerations. The Treasury is due to sell Dollars 16bn in two-year notes today, and another Dollars 11bn in five-year notes tomorrow. Much of the activity during the day involved dealers preparing their positions for that new supply. There was little else to affect business. The day's only economic news - a 1.9 per cent rise in June existing home sales - was bearish for bonds, but the extent of the gain was insufficient to trouble prices. SALOMON Brothers bid to buy an undisclosed amount of Polish Treasury bills at a primary auction yesterday, becoming the first foreign investor to enter the market, Reuter reports from Warsaw. 'This is the first foreign investor in the bills. This should be just the beginning of greater interest, even though the amount they bid for was rather small,' said a ministry official. Poland sold 2,300bn zlotys of Treasury bills at its weekly auction.</p>

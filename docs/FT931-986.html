			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Prospects improve for Bosnian peace talks progress PROSPECTS for a breakthrough in the see-sawing Bosnian peace talks improved last night after the Moslem president of Bosnia, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, promised to sign a key part of the package drawn up by international mediators. The sudden improvement in the atmosphere of the talks, which only 24 hours earlier had seemed close to collapse, came as the situation on the ground in Bosnia took a turn for the worse. Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy head of the United Nations Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia (Unprofor), told a news conference in Belgrade that the eastern Bosnian Moslem town of Srebrenica, which has been under siege for the past 11 months, could fall to the Bosnian Serbs within days. 'There are clear indications that the Bosnian Serb army has not just strategic, but territorial ambitions in the whole area,' Mr Thornberry said. The signal that serious progress at last appeared to have been made at the negotiations in New York, chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, was given by the announcement that a plenary session of the conference would be held later in the day. The meeting, later postponed for some hours to give Mr Izetbegovic time to consult his government colleagues in Sarajevo, would be the first face-to-face meeting between the leaders of the warring parties during the current round of talks. It followed several hours of intensive negotiations on Wednesday night between Mr Izetbegovic and Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, who is the only one of the three protagonists to have signed all three parts of the proposed peace agreement. During their meeting, the Moslem and Croat leaders agreed a number of minor changes to the map of the 10 provinces into which Bosnia would be divided under the Vance-Owen proposals. They also agreed to amendments to a fourth document, the interim arrangements which will cover the period between the conclusion of a settlement and the holding of elections. Important as the Moslem and Croat acceptance of the peace plan would be, it would not be workable without the signature of Dr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, who has been held responsible by western governments for most of the atrocities committed in Bosnia. Yet the mediators had no illusions that Dr Karadzic, who was on the point of returning home earlier this week after they had chided him for his negative attitude, was any nearer to putting his name to an agreement. According to Lord Owen, his position was far removed from that of the other participants and he was still hoping to create an independent Bosnian Serb state, which could eventually merge with a greater Serbia. Mr Fred Eckhard, the conference spokesman, nevertheless described the latest developments in New York as 'a sudden turn for the better'.</p>

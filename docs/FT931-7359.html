			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / German inflation turns downwards: Figures raise hopes of another Bundesbank cut in interest rates WEST GERMAN inflation has turned downwards again, encouraging fresh speculation that the Bundesbank may further reduce lead interest rates as early as next Thursday. Preliminary figures from two key states, published yesterday, show the rate of consumer price increases has slowed from 4.4 per cent in January to around the 4.2 per cent forecast by most economists. Coupled with the unexpected contraction in money supply growth in January and German industry's accelerating plunge into recession, the news could encourage the central bankers to reduce rates further. Conditions for more cuts have improved since the Bundesbank's surprise reductions earlier this month. On February 4, after further tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism, it reduced the discount rate by 0.25 of a point to 8 per cent and the internationally sensitive Lombard rate by half a point to 9 per cent. Since then Germany's public sector unions have accepted a 3 per cent pay increase for this year, sending a clear signal that pay-driven inflation is coming under control. Following last week's news that last year's rapid growth in the M3 money supply measure had not only slowed but fallen in January, economists have revised their forecasts and believe M3 will stay within the Bundesbank's target range for the rest of this year. Political pressure on the bank is also continuing to protect the core of the European monetary system by helping to protect the French franc. Mr Ulrich Cartellieri, a director of the Deutsche Bank, yesterday stressed the importance of defending the franc while at the same proceeding with an orderly reduction in interest rates. At each successive meeting the central bank council had come under increased market pressure to reduce lending rates significantly, he wrote in an article in Die Zeit. The principal obstacles in the way of marked reductions remain inflation and lingering doubts about the government's ability to deliver swingeing public spending cuts and reduce the national deficit. The Bundesbank wants the annual rate of consumer price increases down to 2 per cent, but the hard core of inflation, represented by rents and the cost of services, is still not under control. Yesterday's figures from Bavaria, where inflation is down to 4.2 per cent compared with 4.4 per cent in January, showed the cost of rents and services still rising at 6.2 per cent and 7.6 per cent. These two factors account for more than 43 per cent of all consumer spending. Inflation in North-Rhine Westphalia, meanwhile, dropped from 4.2 per cent to 4 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRASH FEE PROPOSAL DRAWS A PROTEST  </P> <P> All I am is a local homeowner who is fed up with taxes. The property tax and  city tax on all utilities is enough. No new trash fee. Other cities around us  are not taxed with both a trash fee on their water bill and a city tax on all  their utilities, including water.  </P> <P> The property tax, utility taxes and all other taxes, including this new trash  pickup fee, all go into the city general fund.  </P> <P> For years the general fund has paid the trash pickup costs, so why do we need  this trash pickup fee? Perhaps it is to free this money that was formerly for  trash pickup to now be used for some other purposes.  </P> <P> JERRY FALABELLA  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "No Big Deal"] </F>   [Text] Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah is  obviously not going to Damascus to express his condolences to  President al-Asad. They are not friends, and condolences can be  sent in a telegram that will travel the same indirect way he and  his friends were to travel to Damascus -- through a third  country and bearing no Israeli markings. The Solan  Communications Company would gladly do this service for him,  even for free.    In his trip, Darawshah wished to make a political move that  would seem like a Syrian gesture toward Israel. I am afraid,  however, that his trick will yield just the opposite result.  The main Syrian condition was that the delegation be made of  strictly "our Arab brothers." In other words, al-Asad wants a  Jew-free delegation. In doing so, he made the same mistake he  made in Geneva when he prevented the participation of Israeli  reporters in his joint news conference with President Clinton.  We said then and we say today: This is no way to win the  Israelis' hearts.    The wise guys will ask: Did you ask to travel to Damascus to  express condolences? Well, the answer is no. Nevertheless,  over the past weeks and months, some of the most prominent  Israeli reporters have asked to be received by him. I told  Darawshah last week that I am willing to convert to Islam if  only he promised to take me with him. "Next time perhaps," he  said with a smile.    This, however, is not the point. The point is that not only  journalists, but also the president of Israel, and mainly the  prime minister and seniors on his behalf have repeatedly asked  through every possible channel to meet with al-Asad or his  trustee to discuss ways to secure peace at the highest possible  levels. Al-Asad has refused and is refusing even now, after the  summit with Clinton. He simply does not want, or is unable, to  make himself stand face to face with Israeli Jews; not even to  receive the Golan Heights back.    He missed opportunities before Geneva; he missed one in  Geneva; and he is doing it again now. He invited the delegation  of Israeli Arabs at a very late date (the 40 days of mourning  are nearly over), under humiliating traveling conditions,  without Israeli passports, not through the al-Qunaytirah but via  a third country, and under a series of restrictions on the  issues they may and may not discuss with him. Even the American  anti-Semitic clubs have at least one token Jew, for appearance  sakes. Darawshah's delegation will not even include a symbolic  Jew.    The problem has always been, and still is, al-Asad's lack of  understanding for the Israeli mentality and psychology. Now,  when we are conducting peace negotiations and there is a little  opening of goodwill for concessions on Israel's part, childish  excuses to talk to al-Asad are not required. In fact, he has a  standing offer to meet Rabin or a senior envoy on his behalf and  close a deal on the principles of the nature of the agreement  they will sign. Al- Asad does not have too much time, and he is  not as sophisticated as is often believed. If he does not hurry  up, the status quo will continue and many, perhaps even Rabin,  will sigh with relief. Instead of using this shortcut, al-Asad  is wasting valuable time instructing his envoy in Washington not  to discuss security arrangements or the nature of peace, only  withdrawal: Pull out first, then we will talk of peace and  security arrangements.    This waste of time is particularly intolerable now, when  terror against Israelis is becoming more brutal every day. The  more appalling killings are committed and the more funerals take  place, the less the public will support making concessions in  return for peace. We might reach a point at which the Israelis  will ask themselves: If terror continues despite our  willingness to give up the territories, why not keep them?    The security arrangements and or personal security are the  magic keys for peace. In this fragile time it is particularly  important to repel the skepticism that has started crawling into  our hearts. The ping pong games that led to the breakthrough in  U.S.-PRC relations do not suit the Middle East pace. It is  important that a central figure such as al-Asad use big words in  talking to us. He should flood us with words of peace and with  gestures. After all, it serves him as well -- we have the  goods. It is with us, Jews, that he has to make peace, not with  the Arabs. Darawshah's delegation will make no difference, or  as Rabin reportedly said: No big deal.</p>

This NRP demand was presented during a  tour of the valley today. According to them, Palestinians are  establishing settlements in the valley so as to endanger the  Jewish majority there. Our territories correspondent Amir Hay  reports:    The amazing revelation made by NRP leaders in the course of  their tour of the Jordan Rift Valley was that Arab settlements  are being established without permits. About 500 people have  recently settled down in improvised structures in the al-Jiftliq  area, and several hundred other families squatted in the area,  in the words of the Jewish residents, establishing three more  such centers. They arrived mostly from the Tubas and Janin  areas. [passage omitted]    In less than three days, the Arab residents managed to set  up  an improvised mosque on the site. Jordan Valley residents claim  that a 20-percent rise in unauthorized Arab settlement has been  registered since the PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles was  signed. [passage omitted]</p>

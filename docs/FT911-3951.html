			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / ERM Part Two, or Virtue Unrewarded There was a time when Britain's entry into the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) could be satisfyingly rationalised in terms of 17th century drama. Former chancellor Nigel Lawson, with abundant locks and wayward monetary habits, was clearly the cavalier of the piece; Margaret Thatcher, the shocked puritan dame; and John Major, the roundhead from Huntingdon, the hero who led the charge for anti-inflationary virtue. Unfortunately, something has gone wrong with the denouement. Not only is monetary virtue largely unrewarded at the opinion polls in the run-up to the local elections in May, but Mr Major's puritan credentials (and educational qualifications) are being questioned. Worse, vice has triumphed within the semi-fixed exchange rate system itself. As my colleague Anthony Harris pointed out here last week, the D-Mark threatens to join the French franc at the bottom of the currency grid, while the high-inflation cavaliers - Britain, Italy and Spain - are seeing their currencies propelled powerfully upwards. Where is the discipline, or rather virtue, in the system now? The conundrum is not entirely new. And since many have difficulty grasping why the natural order in this morality play has been turned upside down it will do no harm to recapitulate some recent history. Last summer, when Mr Major was busily talking up sterling before Britain's entry into the ERM, it was widely recognised that putting cavaliers into a club run by puritans would result in a transitional problem. As long as the Bundesbank was perceived as a guarantor of price stability for the system as a whole, international investors would flock to the currencies of the weaker countries on the basis that the reduction or elimination of currency risk made their higher interest rates attractive. The weak would thus come under pressure to relax monetary policy prematurely. But ultimately, after a blip or two, interest rates across the system could be expected to converge, in the same way that French and German rates had done, as a preliminary to wider economic convergence. The underlying assumption was that convergence would take place around a German norm. That assumption suddenly looks more shaky in the light of turbulence in the Soviet Union, huge unemployment in the former East Germany, the mother of German fiscal deficits and a strong dollar. Even last year there was some worry that the Bundesbank's anti-inflationary zeal might be diluted on the way to European monetary union (EMU). Now there is an added internal threat arising from the battle over the composition of the Bundesbank's council. Some fear that presidents of the new Lander banks in the east will be more susceptible to political pressure for looser monetary policy and that, if Bundesbank president Karl Otto Pohl fails to win support from Chancellor Kohl for his plan for a smaller council, the influence of the men from Frankfurt will be weakened. In short, the market has a nasty suspicion that convergence might come about as much from the German rate of inflation moving up as the other members' moving down. The resulting pressure on the D-Mark helps explain why the British have been able to reduce interest rates four times in two months and why any further rise in German rates is unlikely to be followed by the rest of the ERM. But that does not mean that the system no longer exerts any discipline. The dramatic rise in Britain's unemployment figures last week suggests that employers have grasped that the disparity between Britain's high unit wage costs and much lower costs in Germany can no longer be addressed through devaluation. Exchange rate discipline is thus being built into expectations, though in a tragically one-sided way. Workers no more look at the ERM grid when they bargain over pay than they looked at sterling M3 in the monetarist experiment of the early 1980s (when the money supply was actually a more misleading indicator of the stance of policy than the exchange rate is now). The other discipline that was not present in the early 1980s, or indeed earlier, was that of high, positive real rates of interest, which are now universal across the ERM. For over-borrowed British property companies that cannot restore profitability by sacking workers because they have no workers to sack, that implies that their finances will continue to deteriorate even if the property market stabilises. They and other heavy corporate borrowers are in a debt trap from which inflation no longer provides the exit that it did after the crash of the mid-1970s. The escape routes have also been closed at a national level, most notably for Italy. A peculiarity of the Italian economy has been that Italy's penchant for high public spending has been financed much less by personal taxation, for which the citizens have a formidable aversion, than by borrowing; and the public sector's IOUs have been absorbed by an exceptionally thrifty personal sector on which the government was able to impose negative real returns thanks to exchange controls. There was a certain efficiency to the arrangement, in that Italy avoided the high tax collection costs incurred by other countries. But it depended heavily on the inflation tax continuing to reduce or eliminate real borrowing costs. Now that has gone; the public sector's outstanding debt is larger than the country's own GNP; and there are additional problems with wage indexation. Small wonder Moody's, the rating agency, has just put Italy's triple A debt rating under review. The irony in this particular commedia is that Italy should have been in the forefront of the drive for EMU when the state of its public finances poses one of the biggest obstacles to achieving EMU. But such ambivalence is the essence of dramatic tension. The curious thing is that the authors of the wider European monetary piece have no notion of how the inner contradictions of the ERM and EMU will be resolved in the final act. All we know for certain is that Karl Otto Pohl is the one undisputed roundhead in the drama. Can he hold the line when the cavaliers come over the hill?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- Mass rallies are being  held across the northern half of Korea to denounce the criminal  dumping of nuclear waste by the South Korean rulers.    At a mass rally held in Wonsan, a port city of culture and  recreation on the East Coast, on April 23, the speakers said  that the South Korean rulers had dumped into the sea nuclear  waste amounting to 11,000 trillion becquerels, heavily  destroying resources and causing women to give birth to deformed  babies.    They bitterly condemned nuclear waste dumping as an  anti-national, anti-human criminal act which can be committed  only by those indifferent to the existence of the nation and  heedless of international law.    The speakers at a mass rally held in Nampo, a port city on  the West Coast, on April 26 said that the Korean people would  never tolerate the heinous crimes of the Kim Yong-sam group  reducing even the seas to a nuclear dumping ground, not  contented with covering the whole land of the South with nuclear  weapons of outside forces.    They stressed that all the compatriots at home and abroad  will wage a more vigorous anti-U.S., anti-war, anti-nuke  struggle to check nuclear waste dumping by the South Korean  puppet clique and make the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free,  peace zone without the danger of war.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland plan to  cooperate in the production and purchase of arms in order to cut  defense costs and ensure the survival of their respective  national arms industries.    Nordic defense ministers meeting in Denmark today expect a  preliminary agreement on arms cooperation will be signed at  their next meeting in Sweden in June.    Norway and Denmark are members of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, NATO, while Sweden and Finland are neutral. Close  defense cooperation between the four would have been unthinkable  only a few years ago. But the end of the Cold War, Sweden and  Finland's agreement to join NATO's Partnership for Peace  program, and Sweden, Norway, and Finland's applications to join  Denmark in the European Union, have paved the way for them to  extend the traditionally close Nordic cooperation in most areas  to the defense sector as well.</p>

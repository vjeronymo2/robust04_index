			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 18 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "Agreement has been  reached with Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev on  scrapping the proposal to set up the Eurasian Union,"  Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov, on his first visit to  Japan, told a news conference in Tokyo today.    The president expressed the view that the idea to set up the  Eurasian Union was no more than a "populist slogan". "If we are  unable to enforce real economic integration between CIS  countries, how can one talk about setting up the Eurasian  Union?" he said. Islam Karimov stressed the importance of the  creation of the CIS, noting that "without the Commonwealth, the  breakup of the former USSR could have resulted in the start of  civil war" in several republics.    Speaking about NATO's Partnership for Peace program, the  president made it clear that Tashkent does not intend to hurry  in deciding whether to join it. "We are now studying the  issue," Islam Karimov said. He noted that Uzbekistan is  consulting with Russia on the issue of joining the NATO program.  "We have good understanding with Russia on the matter," the  president said.</p>

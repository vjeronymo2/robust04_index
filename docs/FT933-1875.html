			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Senior PLO leader shot dead in Gaza GUNMEN killed a leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation mainstream Fatah faction in the Gaza Strip yesterday, AP reports from Gaza. The shooting came during a rally celebrating the recent agreement between Israel and the PLO, hospital officials said. It was the first assassination since the PLO and Israel signed an agreement September 13, handing over Gaza and Jericho to Palestinian self-rule within four months. Mohammed Abu Shaban, 35, was shot dead as he left the rally, Arab reports said. Two cars filled with masked men forced his car off the road and killed down in a hail of bullets when he stepped out to see what was happening. Leaders of Palestinian groups opposing the agreement have vowed to sabotage it by violence, and have threatened the life of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader. But Arab reports said Abu Shaban might have been the victim of rivals within his own Fatah group, rather than Moslem fundamentalists opposing the accord. Abu Shaban, who led the political committee in Gaza advising the Palestinian negotiators to the 23-month-old Middle East peace talks, was a popular figure known for his charity work in the area. Since the PLO-Israeli agreement was announced two weeks ago, he led the organisation of pro-agreement rallies.</p>

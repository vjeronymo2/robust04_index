			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / People: Queens Moat picks finance director Queens Moat Houses, the European hotels chain whose shares have been suspended since March pending a fundamental restructuring of Pounds 1bn of debt, has found a new finance director. Andrew de Poidevin, like the new chief executive, Andrew Coppel, has been acting as a consultant at Queens Moat since April. The appointment will bring together the same team that was at the helm when the mini-conglomerate, Sale Tilney, went into receivership early this year; the two executives worked together in the corporate finance department at Morgan Grenfell. De Poidevin then went to the corporate finance department of Prudential Bache before spending more than 18 months as finance director at Sale Tilney. His appointment is understood to have been supported by the creditor banks. Coppel announced the appointment at a gloom-laden annual general meeting at which no additional information was given on the progress of the refinancing and restructuring, though he said that the process of putting Queens Moat back on to a sound footing would take up to three years. Shareholders were almost universally dismayed that John Bairstow, the company founder under whose chairmanship the company grew rapidly and then crashed, was not available to face their wrath after his resignation last week. Coppel said a new UK hotels division had already been formed and would put much greater marketing focus into UK operations. Business in the hotels had been hit by the financial problems but stability had been restored; occupancy rates had begun to pick up. Shareholders at the AGM - which will be reconvened once the 1992 accounts are available - approved the increase in Queen's Moat's borrowing limits to Pounds 2bn, thereby removing the link between debt limit and the shrinking asset base. Coppel could not say when the suspension of dealings in Queens Moat shares would be lifted.</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ORTEGA CALLS A CEASE-FIRE;  </P> <P> PRESSES FOR CONTRAS TO DISBAND  </P> <P> President Daniel Ortega today ordered a unilateral halt to all offensive  military operations and said the U.S.-supported Contra rebels should disband so  Nicaragua can peacefully change governments.  </P> <P> Late Tuesday, President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro also told the  Honduras-based rebels to lay down their weapons immediately.  </P> <P> "The causes of the civil war in Nicaragua have disappeared. There is no reason  for more war," the leader of the National Opposition Union said in a radio  address.  </P> <P> In a statement issued by his press office, Ortega said the unilateral halt to  military activity is aimed at encouraging the 10,000 Contras to demobilize  quickly and quietly.  </P> <P> Ortega also urged the Honduran government to dismantle Contra base camps near  the Nicaraguan border and asked the Bush Administration to end all U.S. aid to  them.  </P> <P> In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told lawmakers today that  conditions for the Contras' safe repatriation were "rapidly being created."  </P> <P> He acknowledged the bitterness arising from the prolonged guerrilla war but  said: "This issue can be resolved, and we think it will be resolved. The war is  over in Nicaragua."  </P> <P> The Contra war against the Sandinistas, who came to power in a July, 1979,  revolution, has claimed 30,000 lives. The rebels' refusal to lay down arms has  been an obstacle to regional peace initiatives.  </P> <P> In Honduras today, rebel spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said the Contras had  informed Chamorro's UNO that they hope to meet soon about disbanding, although  they would prefer to remain a fighting force to ensure that Ortega steps aside.  </P> <P> "Without us here, there is no one to insist that Ortega step down," he said.  "But under the right conditions, we would demobilize sooner."  </P> <P> Honduran President Leonardo Callejas this week said the opposition's victory in  democratic elections in Nicaragua means that the Contras should leave promptly.  </P> <P> He acknowledged that Nicaragua is "in a period of political transition" but  said, "The insurgent forces of the Nicaraguan counterrevolution should not  continue on our national territory."  </P> <P> The Sandinistas and the Contras had agreed on a cease-fire in early 1988, which  was later extended. But the Sandinistas lifted it last Nov. 1, after a spate of  Contra attacks.  </P> <P> The war, and the accompanying economic devastation, played a large part in  popular discontent and contributed to the Sandinistas' election defeat.  </P> <P> Five Central American presidents called last August for dismantling the rebels,  but the Contras had been able to resist such moves because Washington  maintained humanitarian aid until the elections.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has said it will soon lift its economic sanctions  against Nicaragua and grant financial aid to the new government.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Havana's first official comment on the Sandinista defeat, Cuban  Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez today said the defeat of the Marxist  Sandinista's "hurt . . . but does not humble" Cuba.  </P></p>

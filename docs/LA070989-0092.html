The building is 60% leased, with  anchor tenants including Hartford Insurance Co., Live Entertainment Inc. and  Southern California Savings.  </P> <P> The new structure is the second and final phase of Sherman Plaza. A tree-lined  courtyard links the building to the four-story, 125,000-square-foot Sherman  Plaza East office complex that was built as the first phase in 1982.  </P> <P> Both buildings were developed by Van Nuys-based Nagel Construction Co. The  Nadel Partnership of Santa Monica designed the two buildings, and Faulkner Co.  is exclusive leasing agent.  </P></p>

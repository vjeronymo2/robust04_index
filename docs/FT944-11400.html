			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / PRI elects candidate for Jalisco governor's race Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary party took an important step over the weekend in promised internal democratic reforms, when it elected its candidate for the governor's race in the state of Jalisco by secret vote in a convention of local party leaders, Damian Fraser reports from Mexico City. Mr Eugenio Ruiz Orozco, the senator-elect for the state, won the convention with more than 1,400 of the nearly 2,000 delegates present. He was backed by the most important factions within the party, and had been overwhelming favourite to win the nomination. However, the fact that four other candidates stood against Mr Ruiz in an internal poll of chosen delegates was considered an advance. In the past, the PRI's candidates for senior elective office have usually been picked in private by the president and a few senior party officials. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the incoming president who himself was hand-picked by President Carlos Salinas, has repeatedly pledged not to interfere in the nomination of the party's candidates, and to promote a democratic selection process. While there were few reports of anomalies in the vote-counting at the convention, supporters of the second-placed candidate claimed delegates from the workers' and peasants' sectors had been under pressure to vote for Mr Ruiz. There had also been complaints that delegate selection was biased in favour of the winning candidate. The state election in Jalisco is due in February next year, and is expected to be a tight race between the PRI and centre-right opposition.</p>

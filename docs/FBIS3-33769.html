In an interview with the newspaper AKHBAR AL-YAWM published  in Saturday's issue, al-Alfi said that terrorist acts in Egypt  are similar in the way the perpetrators are armed, the way bombs  are manufactured, and the way acts of sabotage and  assassinations are planned. [sentence as received] He added  that he saw things abroad that prove this. He explained that  this shows that terrorist schemes are not limited to Egypt but  are designed to harm all Arab countries.    The interior minister said that Egypt knows the identities  of  the countries that finance the terrorists but does not want to  reveal them so that the terrorists who are there now will not  escape.    Maj. Gen. al-Alfi stressed that the police are taking the  initiative rather than reacting to operations and are aborting  them before they can occur. He said the police have succeeded  fully in this task and that a new attempt to assassinate certain  public figures was uncovered and the criminal culprits were  arrested and referred to the Prosecutor's Office. He explained  that no public announcements will be made on this issue until  the trial begins.    The police recently thwarted plans to sabotage vital  installations and assassinate public figures during the  Christmas holidays and the Police Day celebrations. The  individuals involved were arrested.    The interior minister said the police have been equipped  with  modern equipment and that they depend on scientific planning,  sophisticated technology, and modern weapons.</p>

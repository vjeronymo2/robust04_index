At Monday's [7 February] session held by the Duma's Council  (which includes the speaker, his deputies and the leaders of all  factions), he said that the Duma must evaluate the situation in  the former Yugoslav republics based on conclusions made by its  official delegation, not on the impressions of "a tourist," even  if that tourist is the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party  faction, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.    On Wednesday Zhirinovskiy intends to brief the Duma on his  recent trip to Yugoslavia.    In the meantime the leader of the Russian Unity and Accord  faction in the Duma, Sergey Shakhray, told journalists on Monday  that the proposed bombing of Serb positions surrounding the  capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sarajevo, will lead to nothing.    The issue of bombing Serb positions by NATO aircraft was  raised following Saturday's explosion in Sarajevo's market place  in which 68 people were killed. Bosnian Muslims laid the blame  for the barbarous terrorist act on the Serbs.    "Bombardments cannot resolve such problems -- they can only  delay solution to the conflict," Shakhray pointed out. If the  situation is further aggravated and Serb positions around  Sarajevo are bombed, his faction will make an official statement  in the Duma, he said.</p>

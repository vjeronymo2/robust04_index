			<p>BFN     [Text] Dakar, 2 May (KNA/PANA) -- African countries should  show more determination in ending death and destruction in  Rwanda, that country's Planning Minister Augustin Ngirabatware  said yesterday.    He told the PAN-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY that his government  expected Africa to convene an emergency meeting asking the  Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to halt his military  assistance to the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF]. The front is  fighting the government for the control of the capital, Kigali.    Despite repeated denials from Kampala, the Kigali government  maintains the Ugandan Government has been supporting the front  since the beginning of the guerrilla war in October 1990.    Ngirabatware is in Dakar to deliver a message from the new  Rwanda head of state Theodore Sindikubwabo to the Senegalese  President Abdou Diouf. The envoy has delivered similar messages  to the leaders of Gabon and Togo.    We wish to conclude a ceasefire with the RPF. This is a  prerequisite to any discussion, he said. He said that the  crisis could only be solved through negotiations in Arusha  Tanzania, being brokered by Tanzanian President Ali Hassan  Mwinyi.</p>

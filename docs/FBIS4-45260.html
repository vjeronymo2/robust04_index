			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 31 May (EFE) -- Selim Valenzuela, the  most-wanted Chilean drug trafficker, was recaptured today after  he escaped on 28 May while being transported to prison from a  hospital.    The Chilean Government's television channel reported today  that Valenzuela was arrested again by police near Valparaiso,  the country's main port. Valparaiso is 125 km northwest of  Santiago.    The criminal paid $5,000 to the prison guards taking him  back  to prison after he underwent a medical checkup at a Valparaiso  hospital.    Valenzuela, who was detained on 11 March, allegedly has been  involved in a shipment of 40 kg of cocaine to Sweden in 1992, a  case in which two other Chileans have been sentenced to a  10-year prison term in Stockholm.</p>

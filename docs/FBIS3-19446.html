He was received at  Ankara's Esenboga Airport by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin.    In a statement at the airport, Cetin noted that the  friendship between Turkey and France is historical and is  becoming increasingly stronger. Pointing out that the visit  will give a new impetus to Turkish-French relations, Cetin said  that the talks will focus on measures to be adopted for the  further development of bilateral relations in the political,  economic, and defense industry fields. Cetin concluded by saying  that the work that must be done in order not to lose the current  momentum in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is nearing a solution,  will also be discussed with the visiting minister.    In his statement, Juppe declared that Turkey is an important  country, which is gaining weight and strength throughout the  world. The free trade union to be effected between Turkey and  the 12 European countries in 1995 demonstrates its economic  importance. Juppe said that France attaches great importance to  Turkey because it shares the same values with France especially  with regard to democracy, human rights, and the supremacy of  law. Pointing out that Turkey constitutes a factor of stability  in the region, the French minister remarked that a solution is  imminent concerning the problem in former Yugoslavia. In reply  to a question, Juppe explained that France is loyal to Turkey's  unity and integrity and opposes all acts of terrorism,  regardless of their origin.    Cetin hosted a dinner in honor of the visiting foreign  minister tonight.</p>

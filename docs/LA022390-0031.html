			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW: LASER DISC GAINING AS FAVORED FORMAT  </P> <P> The first two months of 1990 have found the laser video disc continuing to make  good on its 1989 gains. The predictions that video disc will replace  videocassette as the consumer format of choice in the 1990s are looking better  all the time.  </P> <P> Recent events:  </P> <P> * The simultaneous release this month of big pictures "Indiana Jones and the  Last Crusade," "Lethal Weapon 2" and "The Karate Kid III" on both videotape and  video disc. Previously, video disc debuts usually followed videocassettes by a  month or two. Early February also saw the video disc version of "Batman." This  software explosion may encourage more people to invest in the newer, less  expensive video disc/compact disc/CD-V combination players.  </P> <P> * Panasonic, the second-largest supplier of VCRs, has decided to get into the  video disc-machine market. The company displayed two models at the Winter  Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January, and those models may  be available to the U.S. public as early as June.  </P> <P> * Also demonstrated at the Winter CES was the prototype of a video-disc  recorder, the first of many that various manufacturers around the world are  developing. One of these may be marketed as early as fall of 1991. TERRY  ATKINSON  </P></p>

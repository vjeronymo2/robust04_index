Specifically, these requests are: (1) Southwestern Bell Corporation (SBC) Request for Permanent Waiver; (2) Bell Atlantic Enterprises International, Inc. (Bell Atlantic) Request for Rule Waiver; (3) US West Paging, Inc. (USWP) Request for Permanent Waiver; (4) RAM Mobile Data USA Limited (RMD) Request for Transfer of Control and Rule Waiver; (5) Cass Cable TV, Inc. (Cass Cable) Request for Rule Waiver; and (6) American Paging, Inc. (API) Request for Rule Waiver. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SBC, Bell Atlantic and USWP waiver requests stem from a 1992 Order that had terminated all conditional waivers of Section 90.603(c) that had been previously granted, but gave recipients of those waiver grants an opportunity to rejustify their waivers. See Order in PR Docket No. 86&hyph;3, 57 FR 53293, November 9, 1992, 7 FCC Rcd 6879 (1992). By the terms of the 1992 Order, SBC, Bell Atlantic, and USWP continue to hold SMR interests pending the resolution of their waiver rejustification requests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBC, Bell Atlantic and USWP maintain that a waiver is justified because the regulatory concerns underlying the wireline restriction are no longer justified. They further allege that a waiver is warranted because continued operation of their SMR systems would serve the public interest. In addition, Bell Atlantic states that a waiver is justified because its SMR systems serve markets outside of its parent's wireline areas. At a minimum, SBC requests the Commission to continue its waiver until the wireline prohibition is reexamined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, there are three other requests filed by RMD, Cass Cable and API. RMD and API each allege that a waiver is warranted because their innovative new service offerings would serve the public interest and are consistent with Commission policy. API further states that a waiver is justified because it will not be operating in any area where its parent holds wireline interests and will not be interconnecting with any parent-owned wireline. Cass Cable maintains that the concerns which prompted the Commission to restrict wireline ownership of SMR licenses are no longer operable or, in any case, do not apply to them. Cass Cable also agreed, if the Commission so requires, to forego SMR service in areas where its affiliate provides wireline service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We solicit comments on all aspects of the waiver requests filed by SMC, Bell Atlantic, USWP, RMD, Cass Cable, and API. Comments should be filed on or before May 20, 1994. Reply comments should be filed on or before June 3, 1994. Comments and reply comments should be addressed to: Rules Branch, Land Mobile and Microwave Division, Private Radio Bureau, room 5202, STP 1700A1, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.

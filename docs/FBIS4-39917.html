			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 0525 GMT on 11 June carries a three-minute report  over video in the Parliamentary Week program on Federation  Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko's recent two-week trip to  Latin America. The program includes an interview with Shumeyko  on the results of his trip. The date of the interview is not  given. Shumeyko is seen seated behind a desk. Shumeyko says:    "I would like to emphasize that the visit was, of course,  approved by President Boris Yeltsin and the Foreign Ministry at  every stage. In other words, it was a simple parliamentary  exchange worked out beforehand at the highest level.    "As to the issues we touched upon there -- and I had  meetings with presidents, foreign ministers, heads of both  chambers of parliament where a country had a two-chambered  parliament, and with business circles, banks and so on -- as to,  then, the whole range of issues we touched upon, they departed  considerably from the usual sort involved in interparliamentary  contacts.    "And the fact is that the geopolitical situation itself  obliges us to maintain contacts of this kind today. Latin  America is a traditional interest of the United States. That's  quite clear. But the fact is that the bipolar world model has  disappeared and the two superpowers no longer exist. They  remain great and strong powers, but they are no longer called  superpowers in the sense that they used to be. The blocs that  used to exist between them aren't there anymore. And the Third  World which used to be called the Third World has changed  completely. You and I saw that in Latin America where things  have changed totally.    "And so, although these are traditional zones of interest of  the United States, the United States market cannot handle all  the output they (the Latin American states) can produce today,  however much it would like to. The Latin American countries  have already shaken off their chains and are looking for  partners. We're looking for partners, too."</p>

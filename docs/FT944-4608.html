			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Windwards wary of US banana producer's offer of assistance Chiquita Brands International, a US producer of Latin American fruit, has offered to help exporters in the Windward Islands with the shipping and marketing of their bananas. The move is seen as an effort to reduce rising tensions over access to the European banana market. In a statement issued in Barbados, Chiquita said that with the Windward islands planning to go beyond production of the fruit and to market increasing quantities: 'Chiquita hopes it will have the opportunity to re-establish a relationship, this time directly with the Windward Islands banana industry, to provide the highest possible returns to growers.' The offer of assistance follows an investigation launched by the US trade representative into the European Union's banana import regime, which favours traditional producers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group, with which the EU has a trade treaty. Latin American producers, backed by the US, say the regime discriminates against other producers, mainly those in Latin America. The investigation was prompted by attacks on the EU regime by Chiquita and the Hawaiian Banana Industry Association. The charges have been dismissed by the Caribbean producers. Chiquita's statement offering to help the Windwards, signed by Mr Nelson Lees, vice president of the company, said it could increase the efficiency with which the islands' bananas were produced, shipped, marketed and sold in Europe. The company said it also wanted to provide technical assistance to the Windwards industry. Between 1986 and 1991 Chiquita had shipped Windward Islands bananas to Italy through an arrangement with Geest Industries, which markets the island group's bananas, the statement said. Initial reaction from the Windward Islands has been sceptical. 'The consistency and vehemence of the Latin American attacks on the Windward Islands banana industry, and the recent attempt by this very company to get the US trade representative to destroy the industry and the islands' economies, does not provide a basis for taking this offer seriously,' said one official in St Lucia. Chiquita claims that Caribbean and other ACP producers has misunderstood its complaint to the US government, which resulted in the investigation launched by the US trade representative. 'That filing is not intended to destroy the banana industry of the Windward Islands or any of the EU or ACP producing countries,' the statement said. 'In fact, Chiquita has invested millions of dollars in capital and technology in ACP and EU countries, and would like to more fully participate in these markets.'</p>

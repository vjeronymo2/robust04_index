Mr Mandela was  responding to questions at a media briefing in Bloemfontein on  Sunday morning, at which journalists asked him what the ANC  would do about alleged trouble at De Brug. Mr Mandela that he  requested a full briefing from MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe, Spear of  the Nation -- ANC armed wing commander Joe Modise, but that he  was confident that the joint command of the National  Peacekeeping Force would sort the problems out independently of  the ANC. He said he had full confidence in the NKPF leader,  Brigadier Gabriel Ramushwana, who had proved himself an able  leader on many occasions. Mr Mandela said he wanted all South  Africans to have confidence in the force, because it was there  to serve South Africa's people at a critical moment in their  history.</p>

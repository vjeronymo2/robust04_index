			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 21, 16-22 May </F> 94]    [Text] Ukraine's outstanding debt notwithstanding,  Turkmenistan resumed its natural gas supplies to Ukraine on 13  May in accordance with a 7 May agreement. Turkmen gas supplies  are said to have reached a daily average of 53 million cu. m.    According to Bogdan Babiy, chief engineer of Ukrgazprom's  dispatching service, Turkmen gas supplies during the early days  since their resumption exceeded 75 to 80 million cu. m. a day,  but presently have been temporarily reduced to 20 to 25 million  cu. m. a day.    According to the Ukrgazprom spokesperson, within the 13  through 20 May period Turkmenistan piped 377.5 million cu. m. of  natural gas to Ukraine, which was by 160.8 million cu. m. less  than the agreed figure.    The issue of Ukrainian indebtedness extinguishment remains  unsettled with charges for gas transit across Russia's territory  posing as a major problem.    The latter was supposed to be negotiated by the two  interested parties on 19 May, but the talks were postponed to 24  May.    However, on 19 May the Ukrainian side did have talks with  Russia's Gazprom officers, which focused on progress made in  extinguishing Ukraine's fuel indebtedness to Russia following a  scheme, which was adopted on 12 April 1994.    As of 22 May 1994, Ukraine's debt to Gazprom stood at about  600 million US dollars.    According to Mikhail Kovalko, chairman of the State  Committee  for oil and gas, non-payment by Ukrainian gas consumer  enterprises resulted in their aggregate debt to the tune of 15  trillion krb. (or about 300 million USD).    Enterprises under the Ministries of industry, engineering,  MIC [military industrial complex] and conversion, and the State  Committee for communal services and public utilities, are among  major fuel debtors, which the Ukrainian government has  repeatedly admonished for failing to repay their gas debts as  prescribed.    Speaking at a recent Cabinet session acting premier Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy threatened to apply extremely harsh measure to the  non-payer enterprises including terminated gas supplies,  bringing them to court of arbitration, etc. The government's  earlier resolution said, in particular, that responsibility for  any consequences, which might ensue from these measures, would  rest entirely with culprit enterprise managers.    According to Mr. Kovalko, on 19 May gas supplies were either  drastically curtailed or altogether suspended to as many as  1,300 state-run enterprises.    However, as Mr. Kovalko maintains, the enterprises are  supposed to cope with the gas debt repayment problem in a matter  of days, which will allow the State Committee for oil and gas to  significantly reduce its own indebtedness to Russia's Gazprom.    Incidentally, Mr. Kovalko is expected to top the VR  Committee  for Ukraine's fuel and power complex.    In the meantime, Russian natural gas flow to Ukraine has not  subsided with daily natural gas piping averaging over 585  million cu. m., according to Ukrgazprom, which is within the  agreed supply amounts. Over the 13 May through 20 period,  4,095.2 million cu. m. of Russian natural gas were piped to  Ukraine.    As Mr. Kovalko disclosed, stable Russian natural gas  supplies  and resumed Turkmen gas piping allowed Ukragazprom to start  piping the planned natural gas amounts to Ukraine's underground  storages to pool reserve stocks, since Ukraine's domestic  consumption of natural gas within the same period was 1,310.9  million cu. m. only with averaged daily consumption of about  187.27 million cu. m.    According to Mr. Kovalko, as of 20 May, about 2 b. cu. m. of  natural gas were piped into underground storaging facilities.  However, this is a meager fraction of the required 30 b. cu. m.  stock. Moreover, Ukrgazprom's action was belated in view of  lacking means to pay for imports, whereas the unsettled issue of  payment with both Russian and Turkmen natural gas exporters  makes the situation a shaky one and fraught with the danger of  gas supply discontinuance, maybe, without further notice.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Borden warns of losses in third quarter after charge Borden, the troubled US food group that last month agreed to a Dollars 2bn takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street investment firm, yesterday warned that it expected to report unquantified net losses for the third quarter after taking pre-tax charges of between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m. Borden's warning came as other parties continued to explore the possibility of launching an offer to rival KKR's agreed bid. Japonica Partners, a Rhode Island investment firm headed by Mr Paul Kazarian, said it was preparing a higher-value proposal for Borden shareholders and urged the company to halt further asset liquidations. About Dollars 95m of the quarter's charges arose because proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations were less than expected, Borden said. Another Dollars 50m was attributable to 'transaction fees and other expenses,' mostly the fees Borden has agreed to pay KKR in connection with the takeover. Borden said the third-quarter results would also include charges for the write-down of certain assets, although these would be offset by the reversal of an unused portion of the restructuring charges taken by the company last year. Some of that planned restructuring would not take place following the deal with KKR, Borden said. In last year's third quarter, the company reported net losses of Dollars 9.4m.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mercedes in Polish truck move Mercedes-Benz has indirectly stepped up its presence in the moribund Polish truck and bus industry following the signing of an initial agreement for the sale of Jelcz, the state-owned truck manufacturer to Sobieslaw Zasada Centrum (SZC) the local Mercedes-Benz dealer. The SZC offer to purchase 51 per cent of Poland's former biggest truck producer, which assembled only 820 vehicles at a loss of 135bn zlotys (Dollars 6m) last year, was accepted by the government after two years of desultory talks with Volvo's truck division. SZC agreed to invest 1,000bn zlotys in modernising the plant over the next six years, with funding from bank loans guaranteed by Daimler-Benz. SZC said: 'We want to put together a holding company controlling plants which are able to produce parts and possibly assemble a Mercedes vehicle in Poland when the German company is ready for such a decision.' The SZC move follows a Polish government decision last week to ban imports of used trucks aged over three years. This will make local producers such as SZC more competitive. Last year, SZC reported a 204bn zlotys net profit. It is planning a Warsaw stock market flotation combined with a new share issue to fund further investments in Poland's engineering sector. The new issue will give Mercedes, which kept a low profile during the Jelcz talks, a chance to take an equity stake in SZC. SZC already assemble medical vehicles and delivery vans at Glowno, a former vehicle refitting works near Lodz.</p>

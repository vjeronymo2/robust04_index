			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / US tries again on Haiti A military delegation will next week make another attempt to persuade Haiti's army and police leaders to accept the return of a United Nations mission paving the way for a return to democracy, writes George Graham. The delegation is being sent by the US, France, Canada and Venezuela, the 'four friends' who have taken the lead in the international community's response to the Haitian crisis. Although Clinton administration officials yesterday firmly denied newspaper reports that the US was on the point of abandoning efforts to restore ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to office, they acknowledge that, after the collapse of acting prime minister Robert Malval's attempt to call a new political conference, they have few ideas on how to speed the process, other than waiting for the oil embargo against Haiti to bite.</p>

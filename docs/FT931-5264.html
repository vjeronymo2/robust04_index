			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / The Long View: Breaking the banks IF YOU are a banker the hardest thing can be to live up to your image. When the Royal Bank of Scotland introduced, in these competitive times, a Pounds 400 a head staff bonus based upon the level of extra charges that could be squeezed out of customers, the bank seemed surprised that this was at odds with what the customers expected. That friendly bank manager is not just in a cupboard, he has long since taken early retirement, to be replaced by a financial product salesman. During the 1980s the cosy banking cartel was already collapsing but the monetary boom carried the UK's credit institutions up to wonderful but dangerous new peaks. The cost has subsequently become evident in huge bad debt provisions: thanks largely to this week's dreadful results from Barclays, aggregate provisions of the Big Four clearing banks have climbed to Pounds 5.8bn for 1992, against the already staggering Pounds 5.3bn for the previous year. Only during the past year or so has the size of the banking industry more or less stopped growing, as measured by the broadly-defined money supply, M4. Over the past year it has risen by 3.1 per cent; for the past two years it has grown only roughly in line with nominal national income. In the 1980s, however, M4 grew by 16 per cent a year, driven by deregulation, by a political desire to finance a huge expansion of home ownership through the short-term credit market, and by attempts to restrain the economy through high interest rates which diverted long-term savings into the banking system. Ten years ago M4 was numerically about 50 per cent as large as national income, today it is more than 80 per cent. Is this shift, as the Treasury has been inclined to argue, simply the natural result of deregulation, and therefore benign, or does it indicate a huge misallocation? The scale of the economic misdirection of the late 1980s in property and elsewhere, and the subsequent bad debt write-offs, would indeed suggest a large element of distortion. The collapse of some of the agents of this miscalculation, the banks, would seem appropriate. But because they are a protected species this is not allowed (and in countries like Norway and Sweden they are being propped up by the state). That much is common ground: collapsing banks would create still greater mayhem. But a more dangerous dogma is now being promoted by the monetarists, that the banking system must not even be allowed to shrink. The real money supply must keep growing if there is to be economic recovery. The already bloated banks must be kept expanding, somehow. Not even the banks appear to believe wholly in this doctrine. Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, has said, please, may the banks at least be allowed to opt out of small business lending, which has proved to be such a disaster? Unless, of course, the government would like to offer a subsidy . . . Indeed, it is hard to see how the banks and building societies can sustain their deposit volumes. The aggressive search for viable borrowers in the 1980s proved to be self-defeating. The company sector as a whole halted its net borrowing from banks back in 1990, and can now easily finance itself through the equity and bond markets. The overhang of debt-financed commercial property will gradually be mopped up by long-term corporate and institutional investors. The personal sector is the most overborrowed of all, and although household mortgage debt continues to rise slowly, most individual borrowers are keen to reduce their debt. This leaves the public sector as the banks' only saviour. The Americans, remember, have already taken the route of selling large quantities of public sector debt to their own banking system, to shore up their profits and balance-sheets (though even so broad money has contracted). But for this to happen in the UK there will need to be created a large gap between money market interest rates and the yields on two- to five-year securities. At present this gap is much too small. Money market rates would have to be cut to 4 per cent, in which case sterling would tumble, or alternatively there would have to be aggressive sales by the authorities of short-dated gilts at yields of about 7 1/2 per cent, in which case the stock market would be vulnerable, and the private sector would be damaged. In any event, if the power of the banks is left unchecked they will inevitably undertake a further damaging charge in some wrong direction or another. When the banking herd stampedes it is guaranteed to generate a self-fulfilling boom, then a self-destructive bust. Lord Alexander, chairman of NatWest, blamed the damage done to the banks by extreme economic cycles without drawing the lesson that the banks themselves were largely responsible for the economic overheating. The banks will not this time gallop into Third World debt or small company finance - history does not repeat itself so precisely. In fact the next danger area is likely to be insurance: the banks' involvement began with life insurance, but judging by the plans of Abbey National this week a move into general insurance underwriting may follow, including the self-insurance of mortgage indemnity risks. Do the banks understand these non-banking risks, given that they failed to comprehend the risks of property lending or small business finance? The banks should stick to their core business: processing simple financial transactions, dull though that may appear. Their non-executive directors should say so; otherwise, in a few years, they will all feel as embarrassed as the non-execs at Barclays have been this week. It is not just that your banker is sizing you up as an unsuspecting mug punter who can earn him bonuses. It is that respectable bankers in their dignified parlours repeatedly act as reckless gamblers. Those monetarist economists should draw the conclusion that a falling M4 might not be such a disaster after all.</p>

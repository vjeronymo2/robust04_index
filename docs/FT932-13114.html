			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Investing in a 'cocktail' - International bond funds SOME INVESTORS who want fixed incomes may well be looking beyond the UK. They could, for instance, be pessimistic about the outlook for gilt returns, believing the scope for further British interest rate cuts is limited and that the market will be flooded with a new supply of gilts. International bond funds deal in bonds issued by other governments and foreign corporations. Net sales funds totalled Pounds 191.9m last year, attesting to their popularity. The table, produced from Micropal, shows the 10 largest international bond unit trusts with one year-performance figures. Schroder's Global bond fund is one of the 10 largest in the sector, but lacks a one-year record and is not included. The largest is Mercury Asset Management's Global bond fund, which has grown to more than Pounds 252m since its launch in January 1991. Richard Royds, managing director of Mercury Fund Managers, says an international bond fund makes money for its investors in a 'cocktail' of ways. It should find a market that offers the prospect for capital growth; it should aim for a reasonable yield to provide income for investors; and it should make money out of currency trading. Investing in bonds denominated in a foreign currency does, of course, involve an extra layer of risk. If sterling rises against other currencies, the value of overseas bonds will fall in sterling terms. But sterling's decline late in 1992 means that the one-year performance figures shown in the table are higher than the investor would normally expect. The average growth rate for the sector was 21.2 per cent and the top 10 funds, listed by size, all either matched or beat the sector average - with the exception of Providence Capitol's Worldwide bond trust. It says the reason was its limited exposure to Japan, which pushed up the yield on the fund but, given the yen's strength, resulted in lower performance. At present, Mercury's Global bond fund is split geographically between 28 per cent in gilts, 27 per cent in Japan, 18 per cent in Spain, 12 per cent in France, 10 per cent in the US and 5 per cent in Australia. Royds says the Japanese exposure is a currency ploy, and US bonds are in favour because the company believes the dollar will strengthen against its present sterling level. Managers see European bonds as particularly attractive because interest rates, while higher on the Continent than the UK, are expected to fall. The slide towards lower rates has begun, with the recent cut in France, but has yet to extend to high-yielding European government bond markets such as Italy and Spain. Funds holding the high-yielding bond markets expect to make substantial capital gains as interest rates drop. Barclays Unicorn launched a European bond fund in January to take advantage of high real yields in Europe - with the hope of capital gain if/when German base rates are cut. Some funds aim solely to provide capital growth. Beckman International, with a yield of 3.3 per cent in the year to April 1, is an accumulator fund which re-invests income automatically to provide capital gains. Investors should not be seduced by high yields but should look at performance and charges. The standard fee is 5 per cent initial and 1 per cent annual. But there is a good deal of variation. Mercury, for instance, has lowered its initial charge temporarily from 5 per cent to 4 per cent until July. Its annual charge is 1 per cent. The initial charge on Barclays Unicorn European fund is 3.5 per cent and 0.75 per cent annual.

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / South America trade partners agree tariffs LEADERS of the four member countries of South America's Mercosur common market reached agreement yesterday on the trade pact's future external tariffs. At the end of their third summit, in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo, the presidents of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil decided on a common external tariff from 0 to 20 per cent that will come into force in January 1995. By then all internal trade barriers within the four countries should have been eliminated. Tariffs had become a contentious issue because countries were forced to compromise over different trade and industrial policies. The agreement gives Mercosur an important boost at a time when Brazil's economic and political problems and Argentina's decision in October to impose protectionist measures had brought the common market's future into doubt. The four agreed that a few products would be protected by a higher tariff of 35 per cent that would be gradually reduced over the subsequent six years.</p>

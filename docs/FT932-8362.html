			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Hanson improves to Pounds 507m - More than Pounds 8bn cash available for a big takeover bid HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday reported pre-tax profits slightly higher at Pounds 507m, compared with Pounds 500m, in the half year to March 31, after Pounds 47m of profits on disposals from discontinued operations and fixed assets. Trading profits rose from Pounds 449m to Pounds 465m on increased sales of Pounds 4.8bn (Pounds 4.17bn). The stronger dollar accounted for up to Pounds 30m of profits. Fully diluted earnings per share fell from 8.5p to 7.7p. The divided is held at 2.85p. The group's net debt more than doubled to Pounds 1.59bn, although more than Pounds 700m of the increase was due to the rise in the value of the dollar debt. Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said: 'With more than Pounds 8bn of cash we have the resources to write a mammoth cheque; if underperforming companies think Hanson is not in a position to do big takeovers they could be in for a nasty shock.' Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, the group's US arm, said while large acquisitions would continue to be part of the group's strategy the greatest potential for growth would come from 'continued capital investment in our businesses'. Capital expenditure rose from Pounds 110m to Pounds 144m. The tax charge increased from Pounds 87m to Pounds 134m. The US consumer businesses increased operating profits from Pounds 46m to Pounds 63m offseting a disappointing result from Peabody Coal, suffering from industrial action, which saw profits fall from Pounds 69m to Pounds 54m. Despite Cavenham Forest Industries' increased profits of Pounds 50m (Pounds 34m), the overall Pounds 3m increase in building products to Pounds 92m was less than expected because aggregates saw its profits fall from Pounds 14m to Pounds 2m. Group pre-tax profits included Pounds 20m profit on the sale of Weber Aircraft; Pounds 7m from selling half its stake in Wassall, the mini-conglomerate, and a further Pounds 20m from the granting of additional rights to Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management group, at landfill sites. COMMENT Notwithstanding Hanson's ability to write a big cheque, talk of the group's greatest potential coming from existing businesses and bolt-on acquisitions appears to underline the growing influence of the new mangement. If so, then Hanson must be judged by the profitability of its mainstream business. The best that can be said is that on balance the group performed credibly. While consumer businesses out-performed market expectations, building products fared worse. There remain nagging financial problems, such as the higher tax charge, the unwinding of its interest rate arbitrage position and net provisions of Pounds 144m. Recent changes in advance corporation tax and the fact that interest income fell by just Pounds 8m to Pounds 36m may indicate that some of those fears could be exaggerated. With forecast full year earnings of Pounds 1.15bn the shares - down 5 1/4 p to 237 3/4 p - are fairly priced on a prospective multiple of 13.6.</p>

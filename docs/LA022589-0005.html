			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI AND 'THE SATANIC VERSES'  </P> <P> We have been reading in our daily newspapers about Muslim fundamentalists  demanding that America ban "The Satanic Verses." It has only been a few months  since similar Christian fundamentalists were calling for the banning of the  movie "The Last Temptation of Christ" right here in California.  </P> <P> I think that both Christian fundamentalism and Muslim fundamentalism are two  sides of the same dangerous coin. If it were up to these religious experts on  everything, we would know nothing about real history, astronomy, organic  evolution, or rationalism.  </P> <P> ALAN ALBERT SNOW  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

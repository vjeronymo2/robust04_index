			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: House sold for less than value I sold a house to my daughter recently. The property was purchased in 1983 and lived in as the family home for five years. My wife and I then moved out of the house to another house, which I declared to be my main residence for mortgage tax relief. Our daughter continued to live in the house which she has just bought, sharing it with two other people and paying a rent to me which just paid for the mortgage. The purchase price in 1983 was Pounds 30,000; the valuation for the sale (last December) was Pounds 55,000; and the actual price taken for the house from my daughter was Pounds 40,000. The difference of Pounds 15,000 is, as far as we are concerned, a gift to our daughter. I do not imagine that I will have to pay much, if any, capital gains tax on the house. But I am not sure if there are any tax complications or liabilities on the Pounds 15,000. The solicitor who acted for you in the sale is, of course, best placed to guide you through the CGT labyrinth. To get a broad idea of the intricate and arbitrary rules, you could ask your tax office for the free leaflets CGT 4 (Owner-occupied houses) and CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction), but bear in mind that they are not up to date. You will be assessable to CGT on the sale as though you had sold the house at its full market value (by virtue of section 18 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (Transactions between connected persons)). But, in addition to the relief for the number of days during which it was your main residence, you should be entitled to relief for the same number of days during which it was let (by virtue of section 223 of the Chargeable Gains Act (Relief on disposal of private residence - amount of relief)), without double counting the final 1,096 days before the sale. As you will see, the calculation depends upon precise dates - but you might well have no CGT to pay. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

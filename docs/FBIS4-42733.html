			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "Sto.": "European Arms Agency Under </F> Consideration--Cooperation With France; `Restrictions Are Not  Being Circumvented'"]    [Text] Bonn, 24 May--The Federal Ministry of Defense wants  to create a European armament agency with comprehensive  jurisdiction, which is to decide on arms exports. The arms  industry in the European Union [EU] is to be linked more  closely; armament efforts are to be harmonized. The ministry  hopes to save money through joint procurement.    A working paper of the ministry states that such an EU  armament agency would make sense only if past and present  national jurisdictions were relinquished. In the words of a  spokesman, the paper reflects "initial thoughts" for  negotiations in the "Western European Armament Group" of the  Western European Union [WEU].    An EU armament agency with corresponding jurisdiction could  possibly circumvent the restrictive German export regulations.  However, on Tuesday [24 May] the Defense Ministry emphatically  pointed out that the aim of the consultations is "not a  loosening of arms export regulations." It is still completely  open how a joint EU arms export policy is to be shaped.    Negotiations in the WEU are to be concluded by fall. Since  the Maastricht Treaty, the WEU is an "integral component of  development in the EU" for defense policy questions. This  subject is reserved for direct cooperation of the EU governments.    In the view of the German Defense Ministry, the future EU  armament agency is to be based on "close defense policy  cooperation with France." This is to provide "the European  armament integration process with the necessary dynamism." The  paper states that EU members, which are seen to be hesitant on  this issue, initially should not be integrated, since a minimal  solution without relinquishment of national jurisdictions would  promise little success. Evidently the Federal Defense Ministry  assumes that Great Britain, with whom many cooperation  agreements exist, is not willing to give up the ultimate  national decision on questions of exports.    The position paper, worked out in the Defense Ministry,  proposes to amend Article 223 of the EC Treaty--which had not  been changed by the Maastricht Treaty--during the revision of  the Maastricht Treaty planned for 1996. With regard to present  rules on competition, the article states that "each member state  can take those measures which in its opinion are necessary to  preserve its essential security interests, as regards the  production of weapons, munitions, war materiel, or trade  therewith...." The Defense Ministry now proposes that the  armament agency advance the bundling of arms activities "through  a mutual waiver by countries willing to integrate to cite  Article 223 of the EC Treaty."    The Defense Ministry paper also states that, by establishing  a joint armament agency, jobs would have to be sacrificed. But  the productive German arms industry "overall will emerge as a  net gainer" from unimpeded competition.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investment Offshore Centres (3): Political problems thwart ambitions - Gibraltar / While officials, bankers and lawyers make an excellent case for the Rock as an international finance centre, Madriddoes its best to enforce isolation GIBRALTAR'S economic ambitions to become a significant player in the offshore banking business are indisputable. Just as apparent are the problems, which have nothing to do with finance, the British Crown Colony faces in its bid to achieve this ambition. The current situation, which has everything to do with politics, amounts to a cruel paradox derived from the fact that Gibraltar is not geographically offshore at all but linked by a narrow isthmus to Spain. This would not necessarily matter were it not for the fact that Madrid claims sovereignty over the Rock and therefore does everything within its power to deny it a viable independent future. The paradox is that while Gibraltar's officials and its banking and legal community make an excellent case for the Rock as an international finance centre, Madrid does its best to enforce isolation on the colony. Telecommunications with Spain are appalling, Spanish custom officials ensure interminable queues at the colony's frontier post with the mainland and Madrid's diplomatic manoeuvring in the EC has effectively reduced Gibraltar's regular air links with the outside world to trips to the United Kingdom. Such pressure has by no means prevented Gibraltar's success in building up its economic muscle and its purposeful entry into the offshore business. Gibraltar had four banks at start of the 1980s, 11 midway through that decade and now has 30, 10 of which have offshore banking divisions. Total bank assets stood at around Pounds 1bn three years ago and have now risen to more than Pounds 2.5bn. Some 9,000 companies were registered on the Rock four years ago and there are now more than 42,000. According to the Gibraltar government's calculations the Rock now has 2 per cent of the global offshore sector and the idea is to double this market quota in the near future. An international consultancy, hired by the Gibraltar government, is conducting an overall review of the policies required to place the Rock solidly on the offshore map. The offshore niche that the Rock has in its sights is emphatically located in Europe. Gibraltar sees itself as a tax efficient base for business in the EC. 'The Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the Isle of Man, Jersey and the rest share with us a relationship with the UK and have been in the offshore business longer and more successfully than us,' says Mr Joe Bassano, Gibraltar's chief minister. 'But none of them is a member of the EC like we are and that is the special advantage we can offer.' To the extreme irritation of the Spanish government which views the Rock either as a British colony or as an integral part of Spain but never an independent state, Mr Bassano likes to say that Gibraltar is 'de facto the 13th member of the Community'. Exempted, by its membership terms, from the EC's fiscal system, Gibraltar has a special jurisdiction, comparable to Luxembourg's and Dublin's, that affords specific offshore possibilities. Mr Michael Davidson, who runs Barclays Bank on the Rock, views Gibraltar's peculiar EC status as its main selling point: 'We are one of the three offshore centres within Europe and we are able therefore to sell fund management products throughout the Community.' Bankers in Jersey and Guernsey, in contrast, have to seek approval from the authorities in each member state before they can trade such products. There are additional pluses for the colony. 'There is more confidentiality in general banking services in Gibraltar than on the Isle of Man,' says Mr Jose Navarro, who runs the offshore banking divisions on the Rock for Spain's premier bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. 'We can offer here the same as Jersey but we can make it far more tailor-made.' Gibraltar sells itself as better equipped to deal with the EC and also as more receptive to the medium net worth individual. 'In Jersey I was solely interested in people with Pounds 20m,' says one banker who moved from the Channel Islands to the Rock. 'Here, if someone arrives with Pounds 1m, the red carpet is rolled out.' The attention that a Gibraltar-based bank will devote to its individual client is mirrored by the goodwill that the institution itself receives from a local government that is avidly encouraging the growth of the financial sector. 'If a bank is going to create five jobs in Gibraltar then it is very important to us,' says chief minister Bassano. 'A small investment elsewhere represents a big one here.' The review of Gibraltar's future as an offshore centre will focus on the Rock's opportunities to offer fiscal breaks. 'It would be unrealistic to believe that the EC will achieve total tax harmonisation,' says Mr William Penman Brown, a former Guernsey banker who was recently appointed the colony's Financial Services Commissioner. 'There will be little pockets like Luxembourg and ourselves who will able to give (tax) advantages.' It is unfortunate in this respect that the Spanish government should be seeking to close off precisely the fiscal loopholes afforded by offshore centres such as the Rock. Draft legislation that aims to tax non-resident property owners in Spain will hurt Gibraltar far more than other offshore centres because as Mr Penman Brown puts it 'Gibraltar has so many eggs in the Spanish basket'. A high proportion of the Rock-based companies created in recent years were formed by wealthy foreigners seeking to avoid the Spanish taxman when buying their Costa homes. In the meantime, Spanish hostility to Gibraltar's offshore pretensions effectively precludes the establishment on the Rock of meaningful corporate business. According to Mr J E Triay, one of the Rock's most respected and veteran lawyers, 'the influence of Spain is too great; Gibraltar cannot become an offshore centre if Spain does not want it to.' Put quite bluntly the long-term future of the Rock as a solid offshore centre requires a radical change in its present political status in order to accommodate Madrid. Ideally, Gibraltar should be to Spain what the Channel Islands are to the UK. But Gibraltarians, virtually unanimously, reject such a future.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (5): Santer departure ends log-jam / Review of the political scene The impending elevation of Mr Jacques Santer from prime minister to the presidency of the European Commission has given a much-needed injection of stimulation and vigour to a Luxembourg political scene which in recent years has been not so much sleepy as comatose. It is now just over 10 years since Mr Santer led his Christian Social People's Party (CSV) into coalition with the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP) of Mr Jacques Poos, the deputy premier and minister of foreign affairs. Through economic boom, downturn and recovery, through the European Single Act and the Maastricht treaty, and now through three general elections, the two leaders and their parties have been locked in a cosy embrace. So small was the impact of the latest election in June that the new government formed in July comprised the same people - five men and one woman from each party - who had been members of the outgoing administration. The only changes were the redistribution of a few portfolios and the promotion of a Socialist secretary of state to full minister. The election saw the CSV maintain its position as Luxembourg's biggest party  -a position it has enjoyed since the second world war, with 21 seats out of 60. The LSAP won 17 seats and the centrist opposition Democratic Party (DP) 12, while an alliance of Green parties and the populist ADR group won five each. Apart from a brief period immediately after the war, Luxembourg governments have been formed by the CSV in coalition with the LSAP and the DP on an alternating basis. The only exception was between 1974 and 1979 when a DP-LSAP government headed by Mr Gaston Thorn, later a European Commission president, pushed the CSV into a rare period of opposition. Today, though, the habit of alternation seems to have broken down. Not only is the present coalition now in its third five-year term - a record period - but its progress has been largely untroubled by squabbling between the two partners: previously a tradition, especially for so-called 'grand coalitions' between the socially conservative and economically moderate CSV and the left-leaning LSAP. Ten years of co-habitation has smoothed many of the ideological rough edges of the coalition, such as they exist. The fact that both coalition partners have close links with a wing of the trade union movement helps - Mr Jean Spautz, CSV interior minister, and Mr John Lahure, LSAP health minister, came into government from full-time union positions. But the political balance has been thrown into question since Mr Santer, 57, emerged as a compromise candidate to head the EU Commission after Britain's veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier. His departure for Brussels promises to spark a wholesale change across the political spectrum. Mr Santer's successor, subject to confirmation by a CSV party congress in December, will be Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, 39, the finance minister, who is the second-youngest member of the government. The youngest minister is Mr Alex Bodry, 36, the LSAP defence minister, who is himself widely tipped as a future leader of his own party if, as many observers believe, Mr Poos, 59, soon decides to call a halt to his ministerial career. And the opposition now has a young face since the DP reacted to its third consecutive election set-back by replacing Mr Charles Goerens, its president, with the popular and photogenic mayor of Luxembourg City, Mrs Lydie-Wurth Polfer, 42, on November 22. This development reflects the popular vote in June, which seemed to indicate desire for a change. Mr Santer won fewer personal votes than Mr Juncker in the European Parliament poll throughout the country, and he also trailed Mrs Wurth-Polfer in the central district vote for the national parliament. In the southern district, Mr Bodry came within a few hundred votes of his party leader. The CSV might just use the reshuffle entailed by Santer's departure to bring more young talent into government. New blood is sorely needed, for the CSV ministerial ranks have a somewhat jaded look. Mr Santer has been a member of the government for 17 years, Mr Fernand Boden has been family minister and Jean Spautz has been interior minister for 15 years, and Mr Marc Fischbach has been education minister for 10. For all his relative youth, Mr Juncker will shortly complete 12 years in office. That is the kind of problem the DP can only dream of. The party, which combines a liberal social philosophy with free-market economics, long played the same kind of pivotal role in government as Germany's Free Democrats. Since 1984, however, the party has found itself shut out of government by the grand coalition and - like the FDP - has struggled to offer a discernible alternative to rivals which are increasingly fighting over the centre ground. Mrs Wurth-Polfer now has the job of articulating and communicating a distinctive character and message for the DP - no easy task, but a crucial one. Few observers believe the party could survive a fourth election defeat, at least in its present form. One factor which has made life difficult for the traditional opposition is the rise of single-issue politics. This first made an impact in 1979 when the leader of the Enroles de Force, Luxembourgers conscripted into the German armed forces during the 1940-44 occupation, was elected to parliament in a (successful) bid to win better social security treatment. In 1989, a group calling itself the Five-Sixths Pensions Action Committee won four seats in the Chamber of Deputies on a platform consisting principally of a demand for the upgrading of private-sector pensions to match those of public employees, who on retirement receive five-sixths of their final salary. Despite efforts by the coalition to defuse the issue with new provisions for private-sector pensions, the group returned to the election fray this year, now calling itself the ADR (Action Committee for Democracy and Pension Justice), and won a fifth seat in parliament. The Greens, too, have benefited from dissatisfaction with the traditional parties, building up their parliamentary strength from two seats in 1984 to five this year despite turbulent internal politics which split the movement in two separate parties for 10 years. Environmental consciousness has grown strongly in Luxembourg over the past decade, and the party has benefited from controversial issues such as the nuclear power station at Cattenom, just over the French border. which helped the Greens win a first-ever seat in the European Parliament this year. The party, which is in the process of reuniting, has ambitions of entering the government in five years' time. The rise of the Greens, along with the collapse of the communist system in eastern Europe, also spelled the effective demise of Luxembourg's Communist Party, which as recently as the early 1970s had five members of parliament but lost its last remaining seat in June.</p>

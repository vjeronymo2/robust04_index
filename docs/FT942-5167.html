			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / International Company News: GMA launches ADollars 182m bid for Dominion An ADollars 182m (USDollars 130m) bid for Dominion Mining, the Australian gold producer, has been launched by Gold Mines of Australia, another Western Australia-based miner. GMA, which said it had picked up a 5.4 per cent stake through recent stock market purchases, plans to offer three of its own shares for every four Dominion shares. If the deal goes ahead, it would roughly double the size of GMA, which is currently capitalised at about ADollars 150m. GMA said this was one of the reasons for the bid. The greater size of the group would make it more attractive to investors. GMA was formed by the merger of three mining companies, Eastmet, Metana and Paragon Resources, and estimates that production will stand at about 100,000 ounces of gold in the year to June. Most of its current projects are in either Western Australia or New South Wales, and a new underground mine at the Youanmi project in Western Australia is due to come on stream in October. Dominion has been beset by concerns over its reserves and operating costs, and has suffered a bumpy earnings record in recent years.</p>

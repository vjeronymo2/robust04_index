			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BRADLEY GETS OK ON CAMPAIGN MONEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley can use $1.8 million in campaign money raised  prior to this calendar year, despite a state proposition prohibiting carrying  such funds forward, a judge ruled Monday.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin declared that Los Angeles city elections "have  been governed by more comprehensive and restrictive provisions than those  contained in Proposition 73 for the past four years." Thus, Lewin said, there  has been "an even playing field" for all candidates for the upcoming April 11  and June 6 elections.  </P> <P> City Councilman Nate Holden, challenging Bradley in the April 11 balloting, had  asked Lewin to reverse his earlier ruling that city elections are exempt from  Proposition 73, approved by the voters last year.  </P> <P> Holden, whose attorney contended that Proposition 73 required candidates to  start with a "clean slate" on Jan. 1, said he will not appeal the Monday  ruling.  </P> <P> Holden has estimated that he has raised more than $100,000 for his own mayoral  campaign.  </P></p>

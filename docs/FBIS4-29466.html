			<p>CSO     [Text] (Hanoi, 31 May--Takaaki Mizuno) According to  Vietnamese Government sources, Toyota Motor Corp. recently  exchanged memoranda with the Vietnam Engine Agricultural  Machinery Company (VEAM) of Vietnam, and has begun to study  commercializing the manufacture of autos in Vietnam. In Vietnam,  which is proceeding with opening up to foreigners, Mitsubishi  Motors Corp. announced that it had begun production of small  buses jointly with a Malaysian firm in May. Various U.S. and  European firms, such as Chrysler of the United States, are also  probing expansion. By Japan's largest firm, Toyota, embarking on  a study of commercialization, it appears that there will be  full-scale competition in expansion by various countries.    These memoranda were exchanged during a visit to Vietnam in  May by Toyota Director Akira Yokoi. A team will be created by  Toyota and VEAM, and they will survey prospects for the auto  industry in Vietnam for the period of the next 20 years up until  2015, and explore possibilities of expansion. They are scheduled  to compile it by August.    VEAM was inaugurated in 1990 under the jurisdiction of the  Vietnam Ministry of Heavy Industries. It is the country's  largest machinery manufacturer, embracing 12 diesel engine and  other factories. It has a record of technical cooperation with  Yanmar in engines for agricultural machinery. In the outlook of  the Vietnamese Government, it is estimated that the number of  autos possessed in Vietnam, which currently appears to be  200,000 cars, will increase to over 650,000 in the next 20 years.    Regarding the study of commercialization with VEAM, although  Toyota Motor considers that "nothing has been decided on  specifics (such as joint-venture production)," it is showing a  positive stance on early expansion, saying that "Vietnam is  moderate in size as a market compared to China."    Since Toyota opened resident offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi  Minh  City in July 1993, it has proceeded with collection of  information. The recent conclusion of memoranda means that the  investigation of possibilities for expansion has advanced one  step.    According to a private research institution knowledgeable  about the auto industry in Asia, VEAM "has experience in engine  and other parts manufacture, and also has facilities and  personnel."    However, the government agencies that have jurisdiction over  automakers in Vietnam are divided into the Ministry of  Transportation and Communications and Ministry of National  Defense, in addition to the Ministry of Heavy Industries which  presides over VEAM, and basic auto production cultivation policy  is not determined. For this reason, Toyota's policy is to await  the completion of the survey with VEAM and cautiously study  joint-venture parties and the time.</p>

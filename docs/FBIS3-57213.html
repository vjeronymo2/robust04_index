Due  to a lack of applications only five plots of land were  auctioned, all of them with the right to be leased for  enterprises, instead of the proposed 16, eight of which were  granted planning permission to build individual houses and eight  to build market infrastructure facilities. A UNIAN  correspondent was informed at the Commodities and Raw Materials  Exchange that only two plots were sold at the auction, 1,500 and  2,500 square meters in the city center for 700 and 800 million  karbovantsi respectively. They were sold at three times the  starting price. It is envisaged that in future such auctions  will be held regularly.    Asked by a UNIAN correspondent to comment on the course of  the auction, the head of the regional state administration,  People's Deputy Yevhen Kushnaryov, stated that privatizing land  by auctioning was quite ineffective because privatization  processes were "hounded out" to become a shadow phenomenon, and  were being carried out with official channels by semi-criminal  or openly criminal methods. In an exclusive interview with  another UNIAN correspondent, Leonid Vasylchenko, the president  of the United Commodities and Raw Materials Exchange, noted that  the auction was held in accordance with the legislation and no  violation of it was recorded.</p>

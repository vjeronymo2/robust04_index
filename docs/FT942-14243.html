			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Malted health drinks In the highly competitive food and drinks ingredients sector, flakes don't usually last. But for Edme, the malt and malted ingredients manufacturer, flakes have brought the company great success, and this year, a Queen's Award for export achievement. Mr David Bevan, managing director of Edme heads the Essex-based company which has increased its exports by 400 per cent in the past five years. Exports to more than 35 countries, predominantly in North America and Europe, accounted for one third of the company's Pounds 9m turnover in 1993. Edme was founded in 1884 along the River Stour at Mistley, Essex, and 120 employees still work on that 4.5-acre site today. Edme was incorporated into the Anglia Maltings Holdings group in 1972 and the company began expanding into markets in North America and Europe in the late 1980s. During the 1980s, the company bought the Tom Caxton brand of home brew kits from Colmans and the Sparklets company, which produces soda syphons for the drinks industry, from the British Oxygen Company. Now the company supplies barley malt extracts to the brewing, bakery and breakfast cereal industries, malt flours for the biscuit and bakery industries and produces a canning line for the production of home brew kits. Edme also manufactures malted wheat for the increasingly health conscious food industry and speciality syrup-based products for brewers. Although Edme is one of the smallest malt producing companies, it plans to move into Middle Eastern and Asian markets.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy Past form suggests the government likes to react to political troubles with a soothing cut in interest rates. That thought gripped both the foreign exchange and equity markets yesterday, especially given the favourable data on producer prices. Manufacturers' output prices are showing only a restrained response to sterling's exit from the ERM. while input prices are already feeling the benefit of its recent appreciation. A similarly positive message from the retail prices next week - which is to be expected anyway now there is no poll tax - might create an excuse for lower rates. It would be rash to assume the government will use it. The economy is stronger than it was at the time of January's surprise cut and interest rates are, of course, lower. Yesterday's consumer credit data show the recovery is taking hold, but the balance of payments is too fragile to sustain consumer-led growth for long. If there has to be a quick political response to the Newbury and local election results, it is more likely to take the form of a cabinet reshuffle than a cut in rates. A new chancellor would still confront old problems. Norman Lamont's last budget failed adequately to address the medium-term strains on the PSBR, while Newbury has increased the political obstacles in the way of reducing it. A further rate cut might in due course soften the blow of fiscal tightening. By steepening the yield curve, it would also facilitate the sale of gilts. But the PSBR would finally have to come under convincing control. Otherwise the markets may start to worry about the inflationary spectre and interest rates would be on their way up again.</p>

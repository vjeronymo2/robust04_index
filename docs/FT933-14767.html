			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shell set to cut jobs in N Sea oil SHELL UK is scaling down its North Sea oil drilling programme and cutting jobs in its exploration department by between 20 and 30 per cent. But the company yesterday denied this was a result of the government's planned changes to Petroleum Revenue Taxes. 'The PRT changes have underlined and given focus to what we were already looking at in the North Sea,' the company said. An earlier memorandum sent to Shell employees referred to the fact that the tax changes will increase exploration costs by a factor of four, emphasising the need for cost-cutting measures. Shell has already begun a worldwide campaign to trim costs in an effort to improve profitability at a time of low oil prices. The changes, which abolish tax relief on exploration drilling while cutting the tax rate for existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, are due to become law in about a month. Six senior Tory MPs yesterday tabled an amendment to to introduce a transition period of three years. Many oil companies have opposed the changes because they believe up to 30,000 job losses in the sector could result from the subsequent downturn in exploration drilling. But Shell has always publicly supported the changes by saying the reduction in drilling would be offset by an increase in development work. An official at Shell called the reference to PRT in the company's memo 'rather unfortunate', but said that the rest of the memo made clear the job cuts were due to long-term structural changes within the company. The cuts in Shell's 200-strong workforce in the exploration department will take place by the end of next year. The Treasury is believed to have contacted the company over its apparent change of tone over the PRT issue. The company stressed that its support for the new PRT rules was unchanged.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- The government has  decided to prepare multifaceted measures in response to North  Korea's reported withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA).    In this connection, the government will make an official  announcement on the issue Tuesday morning after convening a  committee to coordinate national unification and security  policy. The meeting is chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Yi  Hong-ku, who is also national unification minister.    The government will likely urge North Korea to rejoin the  IAEA and support international efforts to halt nuclear  proliferation, in the judgement that Pyongyang's withdrawal from  the agency is a direct refusal of international demands for  nuclear transparency.    A government official said Pyongyang's announcement of its  withdrawal from the IAEA could not be justified for any reason,  stressing that "North Korea could not avoid the corresponding  disadvantage unless it would abide by its duties as a member of  the international community."</p>

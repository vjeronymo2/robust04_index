			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> SEX ABUSE CASES ROCK THE AMERICAN CLERGY;  </P> <P> DISCLOSURES OF MISCONDUCT -- A PROBLEM HIDDEN FOR YEARS -- ARE ON THE RISE. AND  SOME DENOMINATIONS ARE DEVELOPING GUIDELINES FOR HANDLING OFFENSES.  </P> <P> Religious organizations increasingly are being rocked by sexual misconduct  among clergy, leading to embarrassing public disclosures and costly lawsuits  that have forced several churches into bankruptcy.  </P> <P> While the painful problem sometimes results in resignations or reassignments,  churches are facing allegations that they ignore warnings or, worse, attempt  cover-ups.  </P> <P> The latest scandal involves Roman Catholic Archbishop Eugene Marino. Church  officials acknowledged Thursday that he had resigned last month as head of the  Atlanta Archdiocese because of a two-year "intimate relationship" with Vicki R.  Long, a 27-year-old woman who once charged that another priest had fathered her  daughter.  </P> <P> As many as 2,000 cases of sexual abuse by clergy are pending in the courts,  according to insurance agents who specialize in church matters, and a new  specialty class of lawyers expert in suing, defending or counseling churches  regarding sexual misconduct has sprung up. Most insurers have quit issuing  coverage for such liabilities or have limited it.  </P> <P> "Today the number of credible sexual abuse and misconduct cases is astounding,"  said John F. Cleary, general counsel for the Church Mutual Insurance Co. of  Merill, Wis., which insures 46,000 churches.  </P> <P> "It has been a hidden problem for generations," acknowledged Evangelical  Lutheran Bishop Robert Keller of Spokane, Wash.  </P> <P> Sexual misconduct among clergy is less than within the population at large,  experts say, but ministers are often held to a higher moral standard.  </P> <P> Some denominations are developing guidelines for reporting and handling sex  offenses as well as helping the offenders in their ranks. Occasionally,  guidelines call for the church to pay for professional help for the victims.  </P> <P> Ministerial sex offenders come in all ages and range from the unknown to the  high profile.  </P> <P> The sex scandals of televangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart shocked the  Pentecostal and evangelical churches in the late 1980s. More recently, mainline  church leaders expressed dismay when the Rev. Allan Boesak, an anti-apartheid  leader who headed reformed churches worldwide, tearfully resigned his  pastorate, confessing to an extramarital affair with the niece of a former  South African Cabinet minister.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, from Bangor, Me., to Cleveland to Chicago to San Diego,  well-publicized ministerial misdeeds have scandalized the faithful.  </P> <P> A former Orange County priest who pleaded guilty in 1986 to molesting four  altar boys in his Huntington Beach parish recently violated a condition of his  parole by being with a New Mexico boy without another adult present. Father  Andrew Christian Andersen's parole was revoked and he is now in state prison  serving a six-year sentence.  </P> <P> The Milwaukee Synod of the The Milwaukee Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran  Church in America made headlines last year when four of its clergy were charged  with sexual misbehavior. And in an unusual clergy vs. clergy case in  Minneapolis, a woman Lutheran minister has filed suit against the male senior  pastor, alleging that he fired her after she complained about his sexual  advances.  </P> <P> A civil court judge in Dallas has ruled that a well-known United Methodist  minister "brutally attempted to strangle his wife" while he was having a secret  affair with another woman. The Rev. Walker Railey later tried to commit suicide  and the case remains under criminal investigation.  </P> <P> In Ventura, an Episcopal priest was recently sentenced to six years in state  prison for molesting a 7-year-old boy in his church office in 1985, and a  Hermosa Beach Greek Orthodox priest was sentenced last spring to nine years in  prison for molesting two teen-age boys belonging to the church youth group.  </P> <P> There are no national statistics on sexual misconduct by clergy. But based on  his 19 years as a confidential clergy counselor, one Presbyterian minister  estimates that about 10% of the nation's clergy have been or are engaged in  sexual misconduct ranging from harassment and "inappropriate touching" to  fornication, adultery and pedophilia. Surveys by United Methodists and Southern  Baptists have come to similar conclusions.  </P> <P> "Many . . . clergy don't realize how vulnerable and close to disaster they  are," said the Rev. G. Lloyd Rediger of Roseville, Minn., drawing on his 15,000  hours of experience counseling clergy for the Wisconsin Conference of Churches.  </P> <P> Psychologists who work with errant ministers say that the reasons for sexual  temptations are many, including the intimate relationships clergy often develop  with parishioners in counseling situations, a change in the nation's sexual  attitudes, divorce among clergy, changes in the family structure and lax  denominational disciplines.  </P> <P> Much of the publicity about clergy sexual misconduct has centered on the Roman  Catholic Church. This is not only because it is the nation's largest religious  organization, but also because it has the greatest number of institutions  serving children and youth.  </P> <P> The spotlight has often focused on allegations that church leaders have tried  -- often unsuccessfully -- to cover up the misdeeds.  </P> <P> "It's the Catholic Church's sexual Watergate," says Jason Berry of New Orleans,  a free-lance investigator who is writing a book about clergy sexual abuse and  who helped expose a sexual scandal involving priests in Louisiana six years  ago.  </P> <P> Nationally, Berry said, there have been at least 100 settlements by Catholic  authorities in the last six years amounting to somewhere between $100 million  and $300 million.  </P> <P> All too often, Berry asserted, "the essential moral and pastoral positions of  the church have been betrayed . . . by local bishops who have resorted to  strategies of concealment, sheltering priests and bunkering in behind defense  attorneys."  </P> <P> Sealed records and secret settlements only allow the offenders to continue  their patterns of abuse, Barry said. But he added: "In many instances,  attorneys bargain dollars for silence." However, Phillip Harris, a staff  attorney for the U.S. Catholic Conference, vigorously denied that the church  has engaged in cover-ups.  </P> <P> "To say there's a nationwide policy to pay for silence is not only unfair but  is a simplistic approach," Harris said. In many cases settled privately, he  added, a confidentiality order was imposed at the request of the victim or the  victim's family.  </P> <P> "I think that's appropriate," Harris declared. "You're talking about a problem  where it's very hard to get proof. In that kind of situation you don't want to  ruin the lives or reputations of anyone . . . . "  </P> <P> An attempt Thursday to reach officers of the National Conference of Catholic  Bishops for comment was unsuccessful.  </P> <P> The largest scandal of its kind in North American church history reverberated  throughout Canada last month when a church commission sternly rebuked  Archbishop Alphonsus Penney of Newfoundland for turning a blind eye toward the  illicit behavior of church workers. More than 30 priests, former priests and  religious brothers have been charged or convicted of molesting altar boys,  orphans and other children. Penney abruptly resigned, confessing the failure.  </P> <P> Other cases of pedophilia involving Catholic priests have come to light in  recent years in virtually every major U.S. city, including Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Jeff Anderson, a St. Paul, Minn., lawyer who specializes in prosecuting child  abuse cases, said he's aware of more than 300 claims of sexual misconduct  against Catholic priests -- he has handled 80 cases himself -- in 43 states.  Several well-known priests have been named in the charges.  </P> <P> In New York, Father Bruce Ritter, founder of Covenant House, the refuge for  runaways, was forced to resign after reports that he sexually abused some of  the organization's troubled youths. And in Washington, Father George A.  Stallings, the breakaway Catholic priest who a year ago formed the  Afro-American Imani Temple, has been accused of sexual relationships with  teen-agers.  </P> <P> Stallings has declined to answer when asked whether he had sex with boys, and  Ritter has denied enticing youths into sexual relations.  </P> <P> The case that first set the U.S. Catholic Church reeling surfaced in Louisiana  in 1984. Father Gilbert Gauthe was convicted a year later on 11 counts of  sexually abusing children. But his was only the most publicized of the cases in  the diocese that, in all, involved 21 church workers. Berry said the Lafayette  Diocese paid close to $20 million in compensation to victims and their  families.  </P> <P> A 100-page report sent in 1985 to every American bishop warned that if other  bishops and diocesan attorneys engaged in cover-ups similar to the one in  Lafayette, the church could face $1 billion in claims over the next decade. The  report recommended immediate counseling with afflicted families and removing  the priest to a competent medical facility. The paper was never formally  endorsed, although parts of it have been incorporated into diocesan guidelines.  </P> <P> Although many of the major Protestant bodies have adopted accountability rules  for clergy misconduct, the Catholic Church has yet to develop a national policy  on the subject. However, in the last several years many individual Catholic  dioceses -- including the Archdiocese of Los Angeles -- have adopted guidelines  that mandate the reporting of sex abuse incidents to both church and law  enforcement authorities.  </P> <P> Harris, the lawyer representing the U.S. Catholic bishops, said he thinks there  is now a "greater willingness within the church and society in general" to talk  about clergy sexual misconduct.  </P> <P> Part of that new openness is due to changes that make such conduct harder to  conceal.  </P> <P> Child abuse cases dating back as far as the 1950s are only recently coming to  light in litigation, according to Anderson, the St. Paul prosecutor.  </P> <P> "The public is increasingly feeling empowered and realizes these wrongs are  actionable," he explained.  </P> <P> Added Father Andrew Greeley, the well-known sociologist and author: "Parents  are no longer willing to hush up abuse of their children 'for the good of the  church.' "  </P> <P> Changes in the law make it easier for children to testify and state laws now  require child abuse to be reported.  </P> <P> Often, said Cleary, the church insurance lawyer, attorneys are able to persuade  courts to throw out the statute of limitations when considering child abuse  cases because the victims may repress the memory of the abuse for years.  </P> <P> While the number of reported cases of clergy misconduct has risen dramatically  in the last several years, many wonder if such abuse is actually greater now,  or if there is simply greater awareness of the problem and a stronger  determination to take action.  </P> <P> Experts differ. Dr. Fred S. Berlin, a psychiatrist who heads the Sexual  Disorders Clinic at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital, thinks it's partly an  increased recognition of a problem "that's always been there." But he also  points to the increased number of children in day care facilities operated by  religious organizations, which he believes increases their exposure to  potential molesters.  </P> <P> Some critics say the Catholic Church's insistence on celibacy for priests  increases sexual tensions. And Berry charges that a "promiscuous, gay  subculture rampant within clerical life is eroding the cornerstone of  celibacy."  </P> <P> But there seems to be no proven link between celibacy and pedophilia. Berlin  and other authorities say that sexual orientation directed toward children  apparently develops during childhood.  </P> <P> The Catholic Church operates several treatment centers with special programs  for pedophiles. Among the most prominent are St. Luke Institute outside  Washington and Villa Louis Martin in Jemez Springs, N. M.  </P> <P> Psychological screening of applicants is routinely done at Catholic seminaries.  But Msgr. Thomas Curry, vicar for priests in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles,  pointed out that no test is able to screen out pedophiles.  </P> <P> New guidelines adopted last year by the Los Angeles Archdiocese call for  accusations against a priest to be investigated as "quickly and thoroughly as  possible." But no action will be taken "on the basis of anonymous,  uncorroborated accusations." If there does appear to be a problem, the priest  is to be moved away until a full investigation is completed. At present, no  child molestation suits are pending against priests in the archdiocese, Curry  said.  </P> <P> At least four mainline Protestant denominations have adopted or are developing  national guidelines regarding clergy sexual misconduct. The Presbyterian  Church, for example, requires that whenever a pastor relocates, background  checks must be made on previous employment for at least the last five years.  Regional Presbyterian courts also have the power to investigate allegations  and, if necessary, discipline offenders.  </P> <P> Officials of most denominations agree that, at the very least, the offender's  next congregation should be fully informed of his or her misdeeds.  </P> <P> "I'd like these things not to be public," said Michael Schwartz, a layman who  heads the Washington-based Catholics for an Open Church. "But systematic  suppression of information protects the guilty -- not the innocent . . . .  There's a balance that has to be struck between protecting the image of the  church and protecting the integrity of the church."  </P></p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Upturn leaves big companies richer in cash The economic upturn has left large companies increasingly cash rich as a result of rising profits and a series of bond and share issues. In large non-manufacturing companies liquid assets reached their highest level for more than 15 years in June, according to official figures released yesterday. The findings are likely to boost City hopes that investment, which has lagged well behind the rest of the economic recovery, may pick up later this year. The Confederation of British Industry warned, however, that concerns about demand might still be depressing investment, in spite of the increasing availability of internal company finance. The Central Statistical Office said the liquidity ratio (current assets maturing in less than a year as a share of liabilities that must be repaid in less than a year) of large non-manufacturing companies at the end of June rose to a seasonally adjusted 178 per cent, sharply up from the 134 per cent of the previous June. In manufacturing the level was 127 per cent. This was fractionally down on three months before but well above the 97 per cent recorded at the end of June last year. Overall, the liquidity ratio of the UK's biggest companies was 147 per cent, unchanged on the previous quarter, which was the highest ratio recorded since the series started 10 years ago. The survey covers about three-quarters of the total net assets of the industrial and commercial sector. The CSO said yesterday that the most important reason for the rise in liquidity was that companies had made a series of bond and share issues in recent months against a background of rising profits and repayments of their bank debts. Mr Leo Doyle, economist with brokers Kleinwort Benson, said: 'These figures . . . show that companies can invest now without going into debt.' However, Ms Kate Barker, economist at the CBI, said that although investment was expected to pick up later this year, recent CBI surveys had indicated that many big companies remained cautious on investment and employment.</p>

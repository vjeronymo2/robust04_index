			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Unreliable benefit figures mask system's efficiency UNRELIABLE figures for the take-up of social security benefits up make it impossible to tell if there has been any improvement since the system was reformed five years ago, the Department of Social Security said yesterday. Government officials believe the first figures since the reforms of 1988 show no evidence of any significant change in take-up levels. But the department said different benefit rules and the poor quality of statistics meant comparisons were 'not meaningful'. The results are a setback for ministers who had hoped the reforms, intended to increase the targeting of benefits and make claiming easier, would lead to noticeable improvements. The figures took three years to compile - about 18 months longer than normal because of the backlog of work facing DSS statisticians. Plans for a new 'family resources survey' sponsored by the department should lead to more accurate figures later this decade. Yesterday's results show that in 1989, 90 per cent of available cash was claimed and that 80 per cent people entitled to income-related benefits claimed them. The discrepancy between the two figures is almost certainly because many non-claimants would have been entitled to only small amounts. For housing benefit, 83 per cent of those entitled to claim are estimated to have taken up the benefit - suggesting a slight rise on figures for 1987. Similarly, take-up figures for family credit suggest a small increase to about 57 per cent compared with the family income supplement it replaced. Take-up of income support, at about 75 per cent, apparently fell in comparison with its predecessor, supplementary benefit. The DSS, however, says the figures for income support are unreliable while estimates by the Policy Studies Institute, the independent research body, suggest a higher take-up of family credit than recorded in the department's estimates. Comparisons with the pre-reform regime are particularly difficult because statisticians cannot assume the same margin of error from year to year. However, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, yesterday described the take-up figures as encouragingly high.</p>

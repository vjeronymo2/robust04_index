			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 16/5/1994 -- The Bucharest  Court heard in the 16 May public session a part of the  defendants in the trial of the Dogmanov group standing charges  of drug traffic, forgery and use of forgery and traffic of  weapons and ammunition. The defendants, two of whom are  Colombian citizens, explained how they got acquainted abroad and  started the drug traffic connection. They managed as early as  1990 to bring several consignments of drugs in Romania, using,  among other things a marble table and 21 pictures. The last  consignment, containing about 100 kg cocaine, was concealed in  the pedestals of two statutes. The Romanian police managed to  trace them and arrested the whole connection, led by Romanian  Alexandru Sava Dogmanov. The defendants heard by the court  today pleaded guilty of a part of the offenses.</p>

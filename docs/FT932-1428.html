			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Aegis pays Pounds 3.62m compensation to former directors THREE FORMER directors of Aegis, the media-buying and planning group, received total compensation of Pounds 3.62m for their loss of jobs a year ago. The two biggest beneficiaries were Mr Charles Scott, former chairman, who received Pounds 2.25m and Mr David Reich, who got Pounds 1m. Mr Charles Stern, former finance director, received Pounds 370,000. Accounts for the 1992 year showed that directors' emoluments ballooned, reaching Pounds 2.3m against Pounds 1.64m, largely a result of pay increases but also because of boardroom upheavals which saw Mr Scott ousted in June 1992. As a result of his departure the board swelled to 15 for part of 1992. It is now back down to 12, half of those being non-executive positions. The wages bill also mushroomed in 1992, totalling Pounds 68.3m (Pounds 49.1m). Companies within the Aegis group have notched up two significant account wins in the last week. On Monday BBJ UK won Premier Brands. Last week HMS Carat, Aegis' operating company in Germany, captured Volkswagen's German media-buying account. The VAG group - of which Volkswagen is a part - spent DM160m (Pounds 64m) on advertising in Germany in 1992. Aegis could receive Dollars 3m (Pounds 2.6m) in gross revenues.</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRVINE;  </P> <P> ONE-STOP PERMIT PROGRAM TO OPEN  </P> <P> There's one-stop shopping, one-stop photo finishing and one-stop banking. Now  there's one-stop permit processing.  </P> <P> A ribbon-cutting on Wednesday will mark the official opening of Irvine's  program to "cut the red tape" out of permit processing. City officials say  construction and development permits, which typically take four to six months  to obtain, can now be snagged in "substantially less" time by using the new  One-Stop Permit Processing Center.  </P> <P> Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, City Manager Paul Brady Jr. and Bob Johnson, director  of community development, are among the expected guests at the ribbon-cutting.  The ceremony is planned at 2 p.m. in the Community Development Lobby of the  Irvine Civic Center, 1 Civic Center Plaza.  </P> <P> For information, call (714) 724-6000.  </P></p>

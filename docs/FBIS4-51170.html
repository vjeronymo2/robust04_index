			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Li  Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and chairman of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], said today that  reform will benefit the majority, but will not benefit all the  people at the same time or in the same way.    Li made these remarks while meeting with 95 national labor  models here.    On the occasion of the upcoming 1 May International Labor  Day, Li Ruihuan, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and  State Council, extended his festive greetings to Chinese  workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the laboring masses of all  nationalities.    For various reasons, he said, living standards of the staff  and masses of some departments have not improved remarkably.  Some have even encountered temporary difficulties. It is quite  natural for the party and government to show concern for them.    Li Ruihuan stated that the trade union serves as a bridge  linking the CPC with the masses of workers. Trade unions should  regard as their own duties safeguarding the interests of the  masses and helping workers resolve difficulties in livelihood,  frequently go deep into the realities of life, maintain close  ties with the masses, enthusiastically listen to the voice of  the masses, know what the masses are thinking, accurately and  promptly report the situation to the local party and government  departments, do their utmost to resolve difficulties for the  masses, meticulously do ideological work well, mitigate  contradictions, dispel sulky moods, and win the understanding  and support of the masses.    Li Ruihuan once again stressed that China's reform, opening  up, and modernization program has entered a new stage. China's  overall situation is characterized by "seizing the opportunity,  deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and  maintaining stability." He called on China's working class, the  CPC, and the Chinese Government to share a common fate, serve  this overall situation, do their own work well in a  down-to-earth manner, and give full play to their role as a  "vital force" in economic construction.</p>

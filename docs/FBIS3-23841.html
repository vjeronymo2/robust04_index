			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Morozov, president of the Vologda </F> Oblast Association of Industrial Enterprises and general manager  of PO Vologda Experimental Machinery Plant: "Where the  Government Is Leading Us Is a Big Secret"]    [Text] Our enterprise is one of those established to solve  the problems of the military-industrial complex. The percentage  of specialized state orders amounted in the association to 90  percent. Compare this with its present volume -- 15 percent --  and it becomes clear what kind of abrupt transformation leap the  collective has had to perform over the 3-year conversion period.    They did not act blindly, but according to a well-conceived  plan. They chose for themselves several strategic directions,  considering them priority ones for this period, and concentrated  the collective's labor and creative potential on them.    And just what was the result? In order to respond to this  question, let us analyze the situation which developed in  production in chronological order.    We began with the production of drives for machine-building  plants. It seemed worthwhile. The machine-tool builders of  Ivanovo, Ryazan, Gorkiy, Izhevsk, Votkinsk and a number of other  cities evaluated the worth of our products: the quality was not  below that of the best world models, while the prices were much  lower. We even went so far as to set up an SP [joint venture]  with one of the West German firms.    However, the new manufacturing line soon turned out to be  paralyzed: the customers did not have the money to pay for the  orders. The promising production was stopped.    A similar fate also befell the second conversion direction  --  the output of products for the agroindustrial complex and the  emerging private farming. At first, our mini-bakeries, bakers'  cabinets, equipment for making soft ice cream, mini-mills,  mini-curers and many other things, which we had managed to  master in short, record time frames, were a big success. But, as  the saying goes, the music soon stopped. Because of the  insolvency of the agrarians and also the disheartened farmers,  it became necessary to curtail this production as well.    Our hopes rested on goods closely resembling basic types of  products, but used for civilian purposes. There were binoculars  and telescopes with day and night vision, sights for hunting  rifles and the like. We also started producing mini-ATXs  [automatic telephone exchange] for office equipment. Special  plans were drawn up for the production of mini-GESs  [hydroelectric power stations] with up to 10 kilowatts of  capacity. Next would be mini-GESs with up to 50 kilowatts of  capacity. It need hardly be said how important this equipment is  for making up the energy shortage, especially on remote and  nearly inaccessible farms. Such an installation can even fully  supply a small village or farmstead. And on an ecologically  clean basis. A small river or brook is sufficient in order to  obtain the needed power. These products are especially promising  for Central Asia, where there are a lot of streams with a large  level difference. And orders for them began to come in. But  alas, even this direction was not fated to survive on the crest  of the reformers' experiments. The complicated political and,  later, financial relations with the Union's former republics  reduced to zilch the collective's highly promising plan.    No, no one will dare reproach us for inactivity or shirking  when faced with difficulties. Even after so many reverses, we  did not lose heart and continued to look for opportunities to  rescue the enterprise's economic structure. Literally over 9  months, we organized the production of complicated domestic  equipment -- microwave ovens, vegetable dehydrators and the  like. And we did this again on a world-class level -- since both  the technical base and the skill of the specialists made it  possible to achieve this.    However, the fanciers of "spillage and shrinkage" need not  be  alarmed: the new method was not fated to succeed. In any event,  even this development of ours did not receive financial support.  And thus, it was not developed further.    The circle, thus, is closed. It is becoming obvious that  even  ideas supported by serious marketing and solid technical  studies, essentially sensible and very profitable for the  national economy are not fated to be realized under current  conditions. Is it worth talking here about the shortcomings of  one enterprise or another, if enterprising initiative itself is  doomed to failure?    Unclaimed products worth 1.5 billion rubles are currently  sitting in our enterprise's warehouses. All of them are intended  for the civilian market. There is a demand for all of them. The  consumer lacks only one thing -- the means to pay for these  articles.    Naturally, this is driving the producers to their knees. The  average wage at our enterprise, despite the high technical and  professional level, is lower than that for Vologda Oblast. As a  result, an outflow of personnel has begun to show up. And those  who leave, as a rule, are not the worst. Of course, we are  trying by every means possible to check this alarming process.  We are introducing, for example, a contract wage rate system,  including even among the rank-and-file workers. We are setting  up personal merit salaries, especially for those who work on a  time-rate basis. But can the manager and the chief accountant  afford to pay a lot, if the enterprise does not have a plus  balance? Yet, any owner of a commercial shop can simply "draw" a  salary to protect his own "point," at a level exceeding that of  a plant by a factor of 3-4. Not everyone can resist this  temptation, especially if there is a family or children to  support.    What particularly alarms us are the unneeded areas which we  are now trying to rent out. But there is hardly much saved if,  during the so-called "special period," we are obliged to  maintain a specified potential. No one disputes the fact that  the defense industry is the defense industry. And it should hold  something in reserve. But why should these funds be added to the  production cost of the products, including civilian ones? They  need simply to be set aside.    What way out do we, the workers of the converted  enterprises,  see?    I will state it directly: no one is thinking about  retreating. It is clear that it is necessary to go forward. And  also along the path of the further development of strategic  directions, only now for peaceful products. Well, let us assume  that, jointly with the Podolsk plant, we set up production of  the Dialog Sewing Machine. This edge-overstitch machine is in  great demand. We are thinking about setting up another whole  series of production lines. It is quite possible that even the  enterprise itself will undergo changes in its organizational  structure. This will no longer be an association [obyedineniye],  but rather, for example, a holding company or a holding concern.  To put it briefly, we will try out and incorporate everything  which is more viable and which will produce a maximum output.  One thing is alarming in this connection: we do not know the  government's policy -- both in matters of conversion and in the  development of Russia's economy as a whole. Up till now,  priorities have not been set either for military doctrine or for  civilian directions.    Meanwhile, we, the commodity producers, are supposed to know  firmly, which course of economic activities is being supported  by the state, in which one it is possible to obtain help and  assistance and in which one only one's own forces can be counted  on. And if a labor collective selected for itself a priority  path for the development of the economic structure, it should be  confident that the state would not leave it to deal with  problems on its own.    Finally, it is necessary to explain clearly to people at the  highest level: what are the reforms we are carrying out --  problems which need to be solved or goals, toward which we need  to strive? For the time being, however, we are hearing only one  thing from the leaders of the government: they do not intend to  retreat from the reforms. But, after all, this says nothing at  all!    If we want to obtain from conversion not just broken-down  military-industrial complex enterprises, which is what is  happening now, but rather, technically advanced plants geared  toward the production of products which are the most advanced  and necessary for the national economy, then it is necessary to  steer this conversion into the appropriate channel and not let  it drift in accordance with the principle: sink or swim.</p>

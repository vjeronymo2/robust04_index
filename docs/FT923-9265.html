			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / National Savings cut will help societies THE CHANGES to National Savings products announced yesterday represent the third cut in returns by the government's retail savings arm since early May. The first change was in line with May's half-point cut in base rates. But although base rates have not been reduced since then, National Savings has made further cuts in the wake of strong lobbying from building societies. Last month the rate on the First Option bond, a new product designed for basic-rate taxpayers, was cut from 10.34 per cent gross to 9.67 per cent. Yesterday's cuts were by between 0.25 percentage points and 0.8 percentage points. The changes at National Savings mean basic-rate taxpayers can get a better - though variable - return at building societies. Last weekend Bristol &amp; West was offering a gross 10.45 per cent (net 7.8375 per cent) on holdings of more than Pounds 2,000. The guaranteed income bonds sold by insurance companies were offering basic-rate taxpayers fixed returns of up to 8.55 per cent over five years. The 37th issue of certificates, which paid 8 per cent a year tax-free if held for five years, has been withdrawn and will be replaced with the 38th issue, which will pay 7.5 per cent. The 38th issue will be available from today for those reinvesting matured certificates, and from August 24 for those investing new money. The holding limit for new purchases is only Pounds 5,000, compared with Pounds 7,500 for the 37th issue and Pounds 10,000 for the 36th issue. In line with the change to the certificates, the return on the yearly plan has been cut from 8 per cent to 7.5 per cent. There are also alterations to the rates on Capital Bonds which pay a fixed, but taxable, return. The Series D bonds, which paid 10.75 per cent per annum if held for five years, have been withdrawn. From August 24, Series E bonds will go on sale, offering 10 per cent. The effect is that basic-rate taxpayers will earn a net 7.5 per cent, the same as the tax-free rate on the 38th issue. Issue B of Children Bonus Bonds, which paid 10.9 per cent per annum tax-free if held for five years, has also been withdrawn. The new Issue C, on sale from August 24, will pay 10.1 per cent. The gross variable rates on income bonds and the investment account have been cut by 0.25 percentage points. Income bonds will pay 9 per cent gross and the investment account 8.25 per cent.</p>

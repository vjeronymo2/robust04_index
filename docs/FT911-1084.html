			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Paying for a wage rise with a promise  -ICI's offer of 14 per cent is in return for big changes at work A PAY RISE of 14 per cent is a lot to offer if you do not know exactly what you will get in return. Yet that, as well as a 36-hour working week, is what ICI, the UK chemicals group, is offering workers. In return, the company wants a promise of the biggest change in ICI's working practices in its 50 plants since the late 1960s. Mr Brian Armstrong, ICI's chief negotiator with unions, said: 'It is not just 14 per cent dolloped out. People are going to have to work for it.' The eight-page agreement, which would replace its 1969 precursor, is longer on vision than detail. It sets out only the broad principles of the changes workers would have to agree to before receiving an initial rise of 6 per cent and two subsequent 4 per cent payments. Leaders of the six unions representing ICI's 23,000 manual workers talk in bold terms of what such a deal means. Mr Fred Higgs, the lead negotiator for ICI manual unions, said: 'We have held the line for a number of years, but there is a general recognition that things must change.' The most important clauses cover the organisation of work, with all workers having to be 'willing to undertake work which they have the skill, capability and time to perform safely and effectively both individually and as members of work groups'. In practice, that is likely to break down skill demarcations between craft and process workers. The company envisages employees' working in flexible teams, not prevented from undertaking tasks by union membership or by work titles. Mr Armstrong said the company deliberately avoided spelling out specific changes because it wanted subsidiaries to be free to choose their preferred route. The safeguard is that ICI will pay the stages of the 14 per cent rise only when specific changes have been agreed and introduced. The ICI deal follows British manufacturing companies' practice for the past decade of paying extra money to secure new working practices. Lever Brothers, the detergents subsidiary of Unilever, has offered a staged 20 per cent rise, including an annual pay rise, for changes in working practices. ICI can ill afford to raise its costs unnecessarily. Recession and restructuring costs cut pre-tax profits by Pounds 560m to Pounds 977m in 1990 and Sir Denys Henderson, ICI chairman, has warned of possible job losses above the 4,000 announced last year. The initial pay and training costs of the changes will be higher than savings, but Mr Armstrong is confident that the changes will 'eventually' be self-financing through improved production efficiency. ICI's approach to employee relations was illustrated by the way the deal was negotiated nationally before talks at local plants. Rather than trying to curtail the influence of unions, ICI has retained a strong national negotiating structure with six manual unions. Mr Higgs says that ICI's commitment to unions has brought the company two benefits in its attempt to change working methods. The first has been the level of trust in negotiations. 'Many other companies would not get what ICI has got,' he said. The second benefit is that Mr Higgs believes unions will co-operate more within plants to ensure planned changes are implemented. 'The agreement is framed so there is virtually no restriction on the type of working arrangement that can be negotiated in plants,' he said. It remains to be seen how quickly and smoothly the changes can be introduced. One of the most delicate areas of negotiation will the ending of craft demarcations. The unions have agreed that the small craft unions will be allowed a veto of local measures. If the deal is agreed, its significance in industry as a whole is likely to be twofold. First, other companies may see the national union negotiating structure as not constituting a barrier to progress. Second, ICI's concession of a 36-hour week for manual workers by January 1993 (or a year after local changes are brought in, if that is later) will bring the next step below the 37-hour week clearly into view and might re-stimulate the efforts of engineering unions. Much depends on whether the long sought-after national agreement is first approved by workers in ballots and then achieves what the company hopes. Managers admit that the deal has been held back in some areas until now, but they emphasise that it might clear the way for a big step forward. Mr Armstrong said: 'It is not a question of moving from the Dark Ages to the 20th century. Some of our chemical plants match the best anywhere.' ICI will have to show clear benefits in the next few years if shareholders are to approve of its latest investment in workers.</p>

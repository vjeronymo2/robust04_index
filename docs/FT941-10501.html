			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Observer: Hearts and minds John Major's arrival in Leicester last night on the first of his promised meet-the-people tours has not put an end to No 10's bunker mentality. Desperate to boost morale ahead of the local elections, Major has invited half a dozen of the Tory party's top women activists for a tete-a-tete next month at Downing Street. But the distinguished guests have been told that it will not be an open session where any old gripe can be aired. Instead they are required to submit - in advance - two written questions. Major has promised to answer one question from each. The sort of treatment one might expect to be dished out to errant kids rather than party stalwarts.</p>

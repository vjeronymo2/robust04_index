			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / EC applicants seek to speed entry: Czechs, Poles and Hungarians to step up co-operation THE three central European countries of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland yesterday agreed to consider how their entry into the European Community could be co-ordinated. At the same time, Presidents Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, Lech Walesa of Poland, and Jozsef Antall of Hungary said they would step up economic, political and security cooperation as as to speed up entry into the EC. 'We agreed that we will apply to the European Community together  .. if we join our voices, our demands will be heard more strongly, than if we act individually,' said Mr Havel.

On the subject of greater European integration, the three presidents also agreed to promote the possibility of Japan becoming an associated member of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).

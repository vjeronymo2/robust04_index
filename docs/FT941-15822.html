			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Truck sales set to surge again The UK commercial vehicle industry has entered 1994 increasingly confident that recovery from its steepest post-war recession is well under way. This is despite a further market drop last year to one of the lowest levels since records began, and an 11.29 per cent year-on-year fall in the small- sales month of December. Registrations last month fell to 10,783 from a year-ago 12,155. But that was regarded as a 'blip' not indicative of underlying trends. Industry leaders say the 2.5 per cent fall in total new commercial vehicle registrations last year disguises strong second-half growth led by the heavy trucks sector. Van sector recovery remains hesitant. Truck registrations jumped by 15.78 per cent last year to 36,350. This was from 31,398, the lowest level for the sector on record and less than half peak levels reached in 1989. Mr David Gill, managing director of Leyland Daf Trucks, said that registrations in last year's second half were 30 per cent higher than in the same 1992 period. Truck market leader Iveco Ford and Leyland Daf are therefore forecasting further growth to up to 43,000 units this year. 'It could be even higher depending on the actual rate of economic growth,' according to Mr Gill. The collapse and rebirth of Leyland Daf truck and van operations at the start of the year has led to Iveco Ford emerging as the clear truck market leader, with a 22.34 per cent share of the market for trucks over 3.5 tonnes last year. However, Leyland Daf has begun recovering ground and finished the year some 6.5 percentage points behind. The market share taken by imports rose sharply as a result of the temporary market vacuum left by Leyland Daf, and the collapse of truck markets in Continental Europe which led manufacturers to 'target' the UK. In unit terms truck imports jumped by nearly one-half, with Scania of Sweden recording a nearly 60 per cent sales jump. In the panel vans sector, dominated by the Ford Transit, Leyland Daf Vans has begun a recovery. Its market share plunged into single figures during the receivership, but it recovered to take an 11.17 per cent share for the year, reaching just over 18 per cent in December.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                   HESITANT RECOVERY IN VANS SECTOR  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                            Volume    Volume      Share (%)   Share (%)                            (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Dec 93  Jan-Dec 92  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*              197,067    -2.05       100.00      100.00 Imports                     81,565   +11.63        41.39       36.32  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                       57,211    -7.86       100.00      100.00 Imports                     20,882   +36.72        36.50       24.60 Ford                        25,499   -10.89        44.57       46.09 Vauxhall (GM)               17,358    -9.95        30.34       30.70 Peugeot (incl.

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Shortfall of MEPs backing accession Expansion of the European Union to bring in Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway in January next year could now hinge on the votes of a score of former Italian communists in the European Parliament. Following the near collapse of the enlargement process over the now-settled row between Britain and its partners over EU voting rights, it is emerging that the European Parliament may not be able to muster the requisite votes on the accession treaty for entry to take place on time. Any setback in a tight timetable could further inhibit the, at best, lukewarm enthusiasm for Europe among the population of the four applicant countries, all of which must submit Union membership to referendum. The European Parliament has to approve the accession treaty by a majority of 260 of its 518 members on May 4 to keep to the timetable. After May the Strasbourg assembly dissolves for the June Euro-elections, and could not look again at enlargement until September at the earliest. This would derail the four newcomers' referendum plans. But senior officials at the parliament, after canvassing the main political blocs, have so far secured pledges of only 248 votes at best. Part of the problem is that about a quarter of MEPs rarely attend the parliament. Around half can expect to be replaced in June and, in May, many will be campaigning for re-election. The apparats of the two largest blocs, the 198-strong Socialist group and the Christian Democrats - numbering 162, including 32 British Conservatives  -are exerting strong pressure on their constituent parts to attend and to pass the enlargement. But on the latest calculations the Christian Democrats can only field 100 votes and the Socialists 109. Among the smaller groups, 22 liberals, 14 French Gaullists and Irish Fianna Fail members, and three rebel Greens bump the figure up to 248 - 12 short of a majority. The key lies, therefore, in the Socialist bloc where the only undecided group big enough is the 31-strong Italian Socialists which, following the implosion of the Italian Socialist party, in practical terms means the 20 MEPs of the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) or former communists. Belgian, Dutch, and some German and French Socialists - as well as some Christian Democrats from these countries - are refusing to back the enlargement because they want a 'deepening' of integration to accompany the Union's 'widening'. They are annoyed at the marginal concessions on voting rights made to the UK last month, which they argue will make EU decision-making, in which the parliament has a greater stake after Maastricht, more difficult. Even five of the 45 British Labour MEPs, ordered by their party leader Mr John Smith to support the enlargement, appear unlikely to vote Yes. This line-up could change, especially following intensive lobbying by Scandinavian and Austrian Socialist leaders this week. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish premier, and a phalanx of applicant country ministers will continue the lobbying in Strasbourg tomorrow.</p>

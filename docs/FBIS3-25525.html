The National Election Commission said opposition parties had  secured 17 of the 24 seats available in the second round, while  the pro-Eyadema Togolese People's Rally had won two, and  transitional Premier Joseph Koffigoh one. The results from four  remaining seats were not released.    The results meant that after two rounds of voting,  pro-opposition parties had won 39 seats, compared to 37 for  pro-Eyadema parties, holding out the prospect of an end to the  monopoly on power exercised by Eyadema since 1967.</p>

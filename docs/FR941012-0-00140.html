			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA agrees with this commenter that what is most important is that the design limits of the machine and winch not be exceeded. Therefore, OSHA has revised the wording of this provision to ensure that winching operations conducted with machines are performed within the design limitations of the machines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(5)(v) of the final rule requires that no line be moved unless the yarder operator has clearly received and understood the signal to do so. This provision also requires that when the yarder operator is in doubt, the operator must repeat the signal and wait for a confirming signal before moving any line. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. A similar provision also was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard and in various State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;14, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;20, 38J). OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that adequate communication is necessary for the safe movement of trees and logs. If the yarder operator begins moving the tree or log before the choker setter or chaser has moved to a safe location, the choker setter or chaser could be injured if struck or caught by a yarding line, carriage, or choker, or by the tree or log.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(5)(vi) of the final rule requires that the load shall not exceed the rated capacity of the pallet or other carrier. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. This provision is an outgrowth of the requirement that the rated capacity of machines shall not be exceeded. In order to prevent machines from rollovers and tipovers, it is also essential that loads on trailers not exceed the maximum capacity the trailer was designed to carry and the machine was designed to transport. If loads exceed the maximum capacity, the machine operator will be at greater risk of rollover or tipover. As discussed above, a significant number of fatalities have occurred in the logging industry due to rollover accidents. NIOSH reported that 80 logging employees were killed in machine rollover accidents from 1980&hyph;85 (Ex. 5&hyph;42). The State of Washington reported that 12 logging employees were killed in rollover accidents from 1977&hyph;83 (Ex. 4&hyph;129).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(5)(vii) of the final rule requires that towed equipment must be attached to the machine or vehicle in such a manner as to allow a 90 degree turn, to prevent overrunning of the towing machine or vehicle and to assure that the operator is always in control of the towed equipment. Towed equipment includes but is not limited to skid pans, pallets, arches and trailers. This provision parallels the proposed requirement. There were no comments opposing this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA's intention in this provision is two-fold. First, OSHA believes this provision is necessary to help reduce the potential for rollover of vehicles or machines that are moving equipment to various work sites. For example, a trailer carrying a maximum load could tip over or roll over and cause the towing machine or vehicle to roll over if the loaded trailer cannot make a full 90 degree turn. Second, this provision is necessary to help assure that material handling equipment is not overloaded. This provision must be viewed in conjunction with the requirement that loads must not exceed the rated capacity of the trailer or other carrier on which it is being towed. For example, when towed equipment exceeds the rated capacity of the towing trailer, it may overrun the towing machine or vehicle. When the rate capacity of the trailer is exceeded there is an increased likelihood that the operator may lose control over the towed equipment and an accident could result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(5)(viii) of the final rule requires that each yarding machine or vehicle, including its load, must be operated with safe clearance from all obstructions. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. There were no comments opposing this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(5)(ix) of the final rule requires that each yarded tree must be placed in a location that does not create a hazard for an employee and be placed in an orderly manner so that the trees are stable before other work, such as bucking or limbing, is commenced. The proposed rule required that trees yarded for bucking shall be safely located and stable before bucking is commenced. There were no comments opposing this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Central player in Japanese political drama Japan's political upheavals over the past month have been a painful yet exhilarating experience for Mr Shigeru Ito. He has spent most of that time attending meetings in smoke filled restaurants and government offices, 'watching history walk in front of my eyes'. Mr Ito, transport minister, confesses to taking the occasional cat-nap at the conference table, to make up for his hectic schedule allowing him only four to five hours of sleep per night. As top political theorist in the Social Democratic Party, the largest and most rebellious member of the governing seven-party coalition, Mr Ito has been a central figure in the stormiest days in Japanese politics. His party nearly destroyed the government's political reform plans last month and then, 10 days ago, forced Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, to shelve plans for a rise in sales tax, in a spectacular U-turn which obliged him to redesign Japan's largest ever economic pump-priming package. Mr Ito was at Socialist party headquarters with the party chairman and secretary general, when Mr Hosokawa called a televised press conference to announce his proposed tax increase in the early hours of February 3. 'I can only say it astounded us. It was such an abrupt thing,' said Mr Ito, whose party was elected on a pledge not to increase sales tax. The trio discussed tactics before going to bed at 3am. Mr Ito was in his ministerial office by 8am to clear up some routine business before he and the five other Socialists in Mr Hosokawa's cabinet called on the prime minister at 11am to protest. The meeting started calmly, as the Socialists explained that despite their election dogma, they could reluctantly compromise on tax if only Mr Hosokawa would first go through the usual consensus forming and consultation process. But the temperature unexpectedly rose when Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, stormed into the meeting room, scarlet with fury. The Socialists were astonished to learn that the tax announcement was also a surprise to Mr Takemura, who is supposed to be the prime ministers' closest assistant, as government spokesman. It took five days for Mr Hosokawa to change his mind on tax, during which 'there was a constant stream of extraordinary cabinet meetings. I felt as if there was no difference between night and day,' says Mr Ito. There have been moments of real distress for Mr Ito. He winces as he recalls how 17 Socialist members of the upper house crossed the floor to vote down the government's political reform bills last month, forcing Mr Hosokawa to make a compromise with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to get a majority for the plans. 'They are my long-standing friends and I feel personal pain that we now have to exclude them from the party. In the old days, the left and right wings of the party were free to advocate what they liked.' Now that the Socialists are in government, for the first time in 47 years, 'people who cannot follow party resolutions must be excluded,' he says. Despite Mr Hosokawa's tax furore, Mr Ito likes his straight talking style, a contrast to the elliptical pomposity of previous LDP prime ministers. 'He makes decisions fast and changes his mind just as fast. He doesn't really struggle over it. That is both good and bad,' says Mr Ito.' Maybe it's just the modern way.' Despite his new generation image, the prime minister also keeps a certain distance from his colleagues, attracting allegations of conceit from the Japanese press. 'When he listens to you, his expression does not change ..I went to his office the other day to say it was stupid to have a confrontation with the US. He just nodded,' says Mr Ito. Inadequate communication between the coalition members - including Mr Hosokawa - is also a factor in the recent political chaos, Mr Ito believes. He has an endearing practical solution in mind, which he plans to propose at a future cabinet meeting: the creation of a cabinet ministers' tea-room in the prime minister's residence. If the feudal lord agrees, those lengthy political wrangles should get shorter and less disagreeable.</p>

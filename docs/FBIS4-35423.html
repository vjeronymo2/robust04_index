			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman (Petra)--The segregation of sexes at swimming  pools and sports clubs came under scrutiny by the Lower House of  Parliament Sunday as deputies discussed the amended youth  welfare law, which was turned back to the House by the Upper  House of Parliament (the Senate) after several amendments were  introduced to it.    The House supported the stand of its judicial committee,  which insisted on preserving amendments introduced by the Lower  House to the Law.    A heated debate took place at the meeting over Clause C of  the law's Article 2, which was added by the Lower House,  stipulating that the Ministry of Youth shall segregate sexes at  swimming pools. The clause was deleted by the Upper House.    The House's Judiciary Committee insisted on maintaining the  clause in the law, saying sexual segregation in public swimming  pools "conforms with our Islamic values and the deeply-rooted  morals of our society."    With some deputies saying it was difficult to segregate the  sexes in private swimming pools or on the al-'Aqabah and the  Dead Sea beaches, others called for specifying which pools would  fall under the provisions of the law. They said that it was  possible to apply the article to the ministry's swimming pools,  while it was difficult to apply it to those of hotels, touristic  facilities and the al-'Aqabah and the Dead Sea beaches.    They said the law should not include swimming pools at  touristic areas since this might affect the tourism industry.    The House then approved the amended 1994 Civil Courts Law  after its Judiciary Committee introduced several amendments to  it. It commenced its debate of the amended Municipalities law,  which was sent back to it by the Senate, which introduced  several amendments to it. The House approved some of these  amendments but insisted on preserving others as they were passed  by it.</p>

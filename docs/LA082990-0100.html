			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GULF-RELATED GILT TRIP: GOLD FALLS AS PEACE CHANCES RISE  </P> <P> Disaster potentially averted in the Persian Gulf is translating into disaster  found for the long-moribund gold market, which staged a brief rally last week  only to nose-dive after Iraq's first peaceful overtures.  </P> <P> Gold prices on the New York Commodities Exchange continued to slide Tuesday,  losing $3.30 an ounce to close at $385. The metal's value plummeted Monday by  $27.  </P> <P> Silver prices also continued to drop, falling 0.8 cents to $4.84 an ounce.  Silver prices were off 33.9 cents Monday.  </P> <P> The massive drop this week reflected investors' belief that there is now less  chance of a war between the United States and Iraq, traders said Tuesday. In  the past several days, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has indicated a  willingness to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the Persian Gulf crisis and  has promised to release all women and children hostages held in Iraq and  Kuwait.  </P> <P> "The war premium has been blown," said John Nadler, vice president of precious  metals trading at Bank of America in San Francisco. "We have more or less  returned to the levels we saw prior to the Gulf crisis."  </P> <P> Indeed, the illusions of precious-metal traders -- who expect the value of gold  to soar in times of political and economic unrest -- are being shattered. Gold  is trading for a mere $10 more than its price before Iraq invaded Kuwait.  (Silver tends to trade in tandem with gold, but its value is sometimes  depressed by an abundant supply.)  </P> <P> Worse still, gold is worth less today than it was five years ago, making it one  of the worst investments of the decade.  </P> <P> Although the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen nearly 400 points from its  high this year, it is still up nearly 38% from 1986. Gold, meanwhile, is worth  about $10 an ounce less than it was in 1986.  </P> <P> Moreover, stock investors often earned dividends on their investments, while  gold investors generally had to pay someone to hold their ever-depreciating  bullion.  </P> <P> In addition, it is often costly to trade gold, particularly when it comes as  gold coins. Typically, investors pay 2% to 3% more for gold bullion than they  would be able to sell it for on the same day, traders said. However, this  so-called spread on gold coins can be higher, depending on the market and the  type of coin purchased. That adds further risk to an already volatile  investment.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, gold traders note that the metal has occasionally provided  gratifying returns. In 1980, for example, gold soared to $850 an ounce from  about $250 in 1978.  </P> <P> And those who purchased "numismatic" gold coins -- those that are rare enough  to have additional value for collectors -- have found their investment will  appreciate by 20% to 25% this year, regardless of the Persian Gulf situation,  said Keith Zaner. He is trends editor at Coin World, a trade publication  headquartered in Sidney, Ohio.  </P> <P> Some continue to hold out hope that the market for gold bullion will rally too.  The Persian Gulf crisis is not resolved, so war could still break out, sending  the price of gold soaring, Nadler said. Even if war is avoided, U.S. gold  prices should still rise on the basis of "fundamentals" -- such as high  interest rates, high inflation, a weak dollar and a generally souring U.S.  economy.  </P> <P> "We are probably going to continue to see gold prices coming back as inflation  rises," said Zaner. "But you can't act hastily. Investors have to look at gold  as a long-term investment."  </P> <P> Yet many analysts believe that the gold market is bound to languish for some  time, despite the weaker economy and volatile world situation.  </P> <P> Gold is the asset of last resort, meaning that people tend to flock to it only  when they see little hope for stocks, bonds and currency, said Joseph Wahed,  senior vice president and chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.  And these days, people are simply more confident about the world economy, about  the value of their own currencies and about their respective banking systems,  he said.  </P> <P> Moreover, today's economy, although weakening, is in much better shape than in  1980, when gold prices peaked. A decade ago, inflation was running at 12.5%  annually and 7% of the nation's workers were unemployed. Meanwhile, the prime  rate was hovering around 15.3%, according to the Federal Reserve, which made it  difficult for businesses to borrow and expand.  </P> <P> In contrast, inflation is now running at a 4.7% annual clip, the unemployment  rate is at 5.5% and the prime rate is at 10%.  </P></p>

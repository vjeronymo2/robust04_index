			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / The Mates Resignation: Lengthy saga damages Major THE AFFAIR of Mr Michael Mates was more than a boil that had to be lanced. There was a broader subtext about Mr John Major's style of government and his control over an increasingly fractious Conservative party. The resignation of the Northern Ireland minister leaves Mr Major weakened - not because of the importance of Mr Mates, but because of the impression of indecision that has pervaded around Downing Street. Mr Mates, in his resignation letter, portrayed a picture of a prime minister under pressure from the media and Tory MPs, The watch he sent Mr Asil Nadir, inscribed, 'don't let the buggers get you down', should, in retrospect, have been sent to the prime minister, Mr Mates wrote. 'You need and deserve the staunch support of the whole party,' he added. The majority view among Conservative MPs last night was that the embarrasment and damaging uncertainty might have been avoided if the prime minister had made clear earlier and beyond doubt whether he believed Mr Mates should go or stay. For the past week Downing Street has repeatedly maintained that the Northern Ireland minister was not guilty of a significant misdemeanour. The gift of a watch was a mistake 'but not a hanging offence'; the loan of a car was 'pretty trivial'. But when Mr Mates, with considerable political gumption, said he enjoyed the 'full confidence' of the prime minister, Downing Street refused to endorse his words. Little effort was made to stop reports of Mr Major happily leaving the final verdict to the last night's meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. Some Conservative MPs accused Mr Mates as trying to push the prime minister around. It is now clear that the 1922 Committee meeting would have been bitter and divisive. Most Conservative MPs were sure that Mr Mates's resignation was inevitable. Even his political allies saw the cumulative effect of a succession of newspaper revelations as corrosive. But there was evidence of last-minute lobbying by some of Mr Mates' friends. Accusations of 'dirty tricks' against the Northern Ireland minister gained ground - fuelled last night by the text of Mr Mates' resignation letter complaining of 'widely inaccurate' leaks. In the event, Mr Mates resigned four hours before the meeting started. His fate followed a familiar pattern. Since the election, Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, and Mr David Mellor, the former national heritage secretary, have also been victims of newspaper attacks, whispers of disquiet among Tory MPs, and then ignominious resignation. Last night some Tory MPs were prepared to attack the media for trying to dictate the composition of Mr Major's administration, for turning on ministers like a pack of wolves. The prime minister did not join them. 'Assault. I seen no assault,' he replied to one such Tory, rewriting the words of Nelson. He perhaps accepted that much of the blame for Mr Mates' downfall, and the fall-out on the Conservative party, lay at his door.</p>

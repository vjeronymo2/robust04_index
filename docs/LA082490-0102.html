			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS / PAIGE A. LEECH: NET GALS WILL TAKE A SWING AT A NATIONAL TITLE  </P> <P> The Net Gals became the first San Fernando Valley team to qualify for the  USTA/Volvo Team Tennis national championship after beating the Lomas Loonies of  north San Diego County, 3-2, in a sectional playoff final last weekend at Los  Caballeros Sports Village in Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> Since this Team Tennis league began nearly a decade ago, no Valley team --  men's or women's -- had advanced beyond sectional playoffs.  </P> <P> The 4.0-division Net Gals, composed of 14 area women ranging in age from 37 to  58, beat Ventura County, 5-0, and Orange County, 3-2, to advance to the  national championship.  </P> <P> In the sectional final, Heidi Broecking of the Net Gals defeated Karen Gray,  6-1, 6-2, in singles.  </P> <P> The Net Gals also scored doubles victories with the No. 1 team of Doreen  Goldberg and Edda Speisser, who defeated Sonia Meyers and Cynthia Thornton,  6-4, 6-4, and the No. 3 doubles team of Beverly Lever and Laura Pearl, who beat  Helen Bock and Jamie Gahara, 6-1, 7-5, to clinch the title.  </P> <P> Rita Minor, a member of the Net Gals and the Valley coordinator, said the  competition at the 4.0 level was tough.  </P> <P> "For these singles players to compete against these teams was just incredible,"  Minor said.  </P> <P> Minor said that most of the other 4.0 teams feature several younger players,  many of whom had played in college.  </P> <P> Other members of the team include captain Karen Gaffney, Myrna Craig, Val Hait,  Lily Reeves, Tina Clarfield, Patricia Harris, Edith Stefel, and June  Sugasawara.  </P> <P> The national championship matches, which will be played at the Double Tree  Resort in Palm Springs, Oct. 25-28, will feature 17 teams from the United  States and Puerto Rico.  </P> <P> Tournament winners: Roscoe Tanner and Yorgen Janson of Westlake Village  defeated the team of Dan Hanson and Tom Smith of Walnut, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, in the  men's 35-and-over doubles at the Mammoth Lakes Open Tournament last weekend.  </P> <P> Janson also made it to the singles final, but was defeated by Riverside's Dick  Johnsrud, 6-4, 7-5, in the men's 45-and-over division.  </P> <P> Tanner, 38, a Wimbledon finalist in 1979, prefers friendly competition to the  big-dollar tournaments of today.  </P> <P> "Fortunately, I learned tennis as a sport first," Tanner said. "To me, (the  Mammoth Lakes Open) was what tennis is all about -- no prize money, just a  bunch of tennis players who are interested in having a good time."  </P> <P> Fast serves: Valley tennis players had the chance to clock the speed of their  serves over the weekend at clinics in Studio City and Camarillo.  </P> <P> About 150 players showed for the Wilson/Eagle Tennis Fest at the Cabrillo  Racquet Club in Camarillo on Sunday afternoon to receive instruction and clock  their serves. Mark Ellis, 17, the No. 1 player at Camarillo High, had the  fastest serve of the day -- 118 m.p.h.  </P> <P> At Monday night's clinic at The Racquet Centre in Studio City, about 50 people  took part in the free instruction.  </P> <P> The Wilson and Eagle companies sponsor 72 similar events across the country,  donating $2,000 worth of merchandise a session to be used as prizes for  participants.  </P> <P> Junior Team Tennis: Of the six Southern California teams competing at this  weekend's Junior Team Tennis state championships, two are from the Cabrillo  Racquet Club.  </P> <P> The top six Southern California teams will meet the best from Northern  California at the Industry Hills Tennis Center on Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> Monique Allegre, Jessica Improta, Shera Wiegler, Jennifer Messmer, Arezoo  Jafroodi, Lisa Sunwoo and Stefany Wolfsohn make up the Cabrillo club's  15-and-under team. Members of the girls' 12-and under team are Rhi Potkey, Lulu  Oswald, Sarah Distad, Katie Messmer, Sally Distad and Shannon Higgins.  </P> <P> The Cabrillo Racquet Club is no newcomer to the state playoffs. The  12-and-under girls' team won the state title in 1988, and the boys' team  followed with a title of its own in 1989.  </P> <P> Clay court player: Mark Simon of North Hollywood will compete in the final  rounds of the 10th Southern California Clay Court Tournament in Irvine over the  weekend.  </P> <P> Simon, 15, who trains at The Racquet Centre in Studio City, is coming off a  championship victory in the 16-and-under Thousand Oaks Tournament last month.  </P> <P> Ventura tennis: The 26th Ventura County Tennis Championships are Saturday and  Sunday at the Pierpont Racquet Club in Ventura.  </P> <P> The championship is the eighth in a series of 14 events of the Ventura Grand  Prix.  </P></p>

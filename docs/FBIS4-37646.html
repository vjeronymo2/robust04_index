			<p>BFN     [Text] In its session yesterday the Supreme Administrative  Council [SAC], which was chaired by President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, approved the assignment to the private  sector of part of the tasks of the government sector,  particularly general and service tasks.    Under the approval, all ministries and government-affiliated  organizations, institutions and companies -- which are covered  by the law provided they are mentioned by name -- are given five  years to take steps to hand over general and service tasks to  the private sector.    Under the approval all sectors can hand over their service  tasks to cooperatives which have been set up with the  participation of government employees who have been made  redundant. They are to afford them the necessary cooperation  and give them priority when awarding contracts.</p>

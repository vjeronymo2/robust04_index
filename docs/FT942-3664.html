Lord Strathclyde reaffirmed, however, that the maintenance of a uniform postal rate, a universal service, and a nationwide network of services, was 'non-negotiable'. Lord Clinton-Davis, a Labour spokesman, said that public opposition to the privatisation of the Post Office had contributed to the government's dismal showing in the European elections and last week's crop of by-elections for seats in the House of Commons.

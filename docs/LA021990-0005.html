			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FERGUSON  </P> <P> It appears Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) thought defaming gays  might be a good way to help him get elected to the state Senate. Fortunately,  he was wrong (Part A, Feb. 7).  </P> <P> Although the group considered safe to pick on changes from time to time, this  was really just the same old bigotry all minorities experience. What does this  say about Ferguson?  </P> <P> Let his words speak for him, "I don't care about them, I'm a retired Marine. A  couple of ------ out there aren't going to scare me" (Part A, Feb. 4). Now,  fill in that blank with one of the epithets that hate-mongers apply to Jews, or  African Americans, or Americans of Hispanic, Irish, Italian or Asian descent  instead of his original homophobic slur, and read Ferguson's words again. Now  you know what kind of person Gil Ferguson is. He is a bigot.  </P> <P> MICHAEL SHERE  </P> <P> Chairperson, Response Committee  </P> <P> Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance  </P> <P> Against Defamation/Los Angeles  </P></p>

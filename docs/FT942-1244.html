			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Brown says all 50 states are winners under Gatt Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, yesterday stepped up the White House campaign to steer the world trade pact through Congress, stating that all 50 US states would be winners under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Reuter reports from Washington. In a co-ordinated campaign, the treasury department released its own pro-Gatt study, repackaging the trade pact as nothing less than a tax cut. 'The reduction in trade barriers resulting from the Uruguay Round will lead to the expansion of trade and increased market opportunities abroad for every US state,' Mr Brown said. The commerce department, the voice for business in the administration, released 50 reports breaking down the US export picture both state by state and sector by sector. The Gatt agreement is due to come into force next year, providing Congress signs on. 'It would be worse than an embarrassment in having completed successful efforts to break the gridlock ..and not be one of the first countries to ratify it,' Mr Brown said. 'We're committed to achieving that goal this year.' Seeking to prevent delays, the White House has stepped up its lobbying campaign, painting the treaty as part and parcel of President Clinton's job creation programme. 'All states, localities and US industry is demonstrably helped by expanding market opportunities abroad,' Mr Brown said, adding that exports have risen dramatically over the past seven years, and forecasting that the trend would accelerate as more commercial barriers crumble. 'Nearly two-thirds of the 50 states, 32 in all, increased export sales of merchandise by Dollars 1bn or more (in the seven-year period). Clearly Gatt is a major economic plan for long-term US economic growth and stability,' said Mr Brown. Ordinary Americans too should feel the benefits, according to the treasury analysis. As of last year, 39 states now export more than Dollars 1bn worth of merchandise a year, he said. The biggest percentage gains in raised exports are being achieved by states such as Nebraska, South Dakota, Vermont and New Mexico. However the biggest gains in dollar terms are still the largest exporters, California, Texas, Washington state, New York, Ohio and Illinois.</p>

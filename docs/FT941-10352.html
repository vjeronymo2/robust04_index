			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Inkatha to miss deadline for all-race election The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party last night appeared to have chosen the path of resistance to April's all-race elections, after talks between right-wing groups, the African National Congress and the government ended in failure. Inkatha officials said the party would almost certainly allow Saturday's deadline for the registration of political parties to pass, meaning they could not legally contest the poll, unless the country's Electoral Act is changed to extend the deadline, a possibility being considered by the government. But the white right wing indicated it was prepared to continue talking, and might register provisionally, to keep its negotiating options open. This raises the prospect of a split in the conservative Freedom Alliance, which groups Inkatha with the Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front) and the black homeland of Bophuthatswana, over the issue of electoral participation. South African business leaders will today travel to the KwaZulu capital Ulundi to make a final attempt to persuade Inkatha Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi not to boycott the poll. But their mission appears doomed to almost certain failure. Chief Buthelezi has made clear he will not take part in elections unless his constitutional demands are met; there was no sign last night that the ANC would agree to his demand that regional autonomy should be entrenched, not only in the 1993 'interim' constitution, but in the final constitution to be written by a constituent assembly elected in April.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, served  notice in a letter to colleagues that he will oppose addition of special tax  breaks for selected individuals or businesses to any legislation written by the  panel this year. It has been almost routine for years for members of the  Finance and House Ways and Means committees to attach amendments benefiting one  or two individuals or businesses to general tax bills. The beneficiaries were  seldom named in the bills. The practice was all but abandoned in 1988,  apparently because of the public outcry that followed inclusion of special  breaks in the 1986 tax overhaul.  </P></p>

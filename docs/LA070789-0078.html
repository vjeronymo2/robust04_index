			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> YANKEES DON'T NEED BREAK AFTER BEATING TIGERS  </P> <P> The New York Yankees may not want to see the All-Star break. After struggling  for half a season, they seem finally ready to make a run at the Baltimore  Orioles.  </P> <P> Until recently, the Yankees have had mostly rough times. There have been  numerous roster changes, slumps by stars such as Don Mattingly and pitching  problems.  </P> <P> Almost the only constant has been Steve Sax. The former Dodger, who signed with  the Yankees as a free agent, has been a steady, sometimes outstanding,  performer. He has done his part to keep the Yankees afloat.  </P> <P> Sax celebrated his selection to the American League All-Star team by hitting a  sacrifice fly in the 11th inning Thursday in New York to give the Yankees a 6-5  victory over the Detroit Tigers.  </P> <P> It was the third victory in a row for the Yankees and put them over .500 for  the first time in nearly two months.  </P> <P> With the Orioles losing at Toronto, the New York cut Baltimore's lead in the  East to 5 1/2 games.  </P> <P> The woeful Tigers, who have lost four in a row, had taken their third lead of  the game in the top of the inning when Lou Whitaker hit his 18th home run. But  Jesse Barfield homered off Mike Henneman (5-2), an All-Star selection, to tie  it again.  </P> <P> Mike Pagliarulo hit a bloop double to keep the rally going. A sacrifice and two  intentional walks brought up Sax, a .319 hitter. Sax delivered a line drive to  left field, and it was all over.  </P> <P> "This was one of the biggest games of the year," Sax said. "There was something  different about it. It was kind of out there for either team to grab.  </P> <P> "We are showing signs of being ready to make a move. While I'm honored to be  selected for Tuesday's game, it isn't coming at a good time for us. We finally  have some momentum."  </P> <P> Sax, who had four hits in Wednesday's win over the Tigers, is 14 for 28 against  Detroit this season.  </P> <P> It was the seventh straight loss for the Tigers at Yankee Stadium.  </P> <P> Manager Sparky Anderson, seemingly accepting the fact that this season isn't  going to get better for his cellar club, tried to be philosophical.  </P> <P> "When you're losing," he said, "things go against you and things pile up."  </P> <P> Toronto 4, Baltimore 1 -- Fred McGriff, somewhat miffed that he wasn't chosen  for the All-Star game, took it out on the Orioles at Toronto.  </P> <P> McGriff hit a three-run home run, his 20th homer, off Jeff Ballard in the third  inning to end the Orioles' three-game winning streak and give Todd Stottlemyre  his first victory.  </P> <P> Stottlemyre, who has lost four games, gave up four hits and struck out five in  six innings.  </P> <P> Reliever Duane Ward got the last nine outs for the Blue Jays, six on  strikeouts.  </P> <P> Oakland 3, Kansas City 1 -- Mike Moore, chosen for the All-Star Game for the  first time, showed the Royals why he deserved the honor in the game at Oakland.  </P> <P> The big right-hander struck out 12 and gave up only four hits in seven innings  to improve his record to 11-5. The Royals, who battered Oakland pitching for 22  runs in the previous two games, did not get a hit until two were out in the  fifth.  </P> <P> Moore struck out Bo Jackson with two out in the sixth and fanned Bill Buckner  in a similar situation in the seventh.  </P> <P> Mark McGwire drove in two runs for the Athletics and has 55 for the season.  </P> <P> Todd Burns pitched the last two innings and didn't give up a hit. However, a  walk to Jackson in the eighth led to the Royals' only run. Burns earned his  sixth save.  </P> <P> Boston 5, Milwaukee 4 -- Mike Boddicker retired the first 15 Brewers at Boston,  then couldn't get out of the sixth inning.  </P> <P> Glenn Braggs opened the sixth with a hit to end the string, and Boddicker (6-7)  had to be bailed out by Wes Gardner after giving up two runs with just one out.  </P> <P> Wade Boggs went three for three for the Red Sox. He is six for eight in the  last two games and has raised his average to .330.  </P> <P> "I'll take the win," Boddicker said. "I wasn't even thinking no-hitter. I'm  going to give up hits. There's not much chance I'll throw a no-hitter."  </P> <P> Seattle 7, Minnesota 5 -- After going 0 for 33 in games when they trailed after  seven innings, the Mariners pulled one out at Seattle.  </P> <P> Darnell Coles hit a two-run single off Jeff Reardon in the eighth inning, and  Seattle overcame a 5-4 deficit.  </P> <P> Mike Jackson won it in relief and Mike Schooler earned his 20th save in 23  opportunities.  </P> <P> Kent Hrbek hit a three-run homer for the Twins.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Tzvi Bar'el: "What Counts Is That They Were </F> Legally Elected"]    [Text] President Mubarak, King Husayn, King Fahd, the  presidents of the five Muslim republics in the former USSR, and  Yasir 'Arafat have a problem. National Security Adviser Anthony  Lake recently issued a new dictum, whereby the U.S.  administration would be prepared to cooperate with radical  Muslim regimes as long as these were elected in democratic  elections.    Although Lake and his aides did not use the words  "fundamentalist regimes," they were primarily referring to  extremist regimes rather than countries such as Saudi Arabia  which has long been embraced by the United States. Lake did not  specify the characteristics which would meet U.S. criteria,  which led to a great deal of confusion in several Arab countries.    "I guess they mean well, but somehow they manage to hurt  their friends," says an Egyptian official. "At a time when  Egypt is beginning to prove its ability to fight fundamentalist  terror, the United States displays an incomprehensible tilt  toward extremist elements. What should President Mubarak infer  from such a policy? Should he call off the elections for fear  that the extremists might score more votes? Is that a signal to  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in Israel to undermine the  PLO's authority and to count on the support of the United States  when it is elected?"    A White House official explained that the United States was  getting ready for a possible scenario in Algeria, whereby the  Islamic Salvation Front topples the regime (or, at least becomes  a prominent part of it) if and when new elections are held. At  present, such a possibility seems the only way to end the daily  killings (a total of 700 fatalities since March) and to maintain  some kind of order in a country that on the verge of general  collapse.    Hence, in view of its experience with Iran, the United  States  decided to build a positive policy toward the regime it foresees  as rising to power in Algeria. However, this would seem to  provide a solution to one part of the Arab world and pose a  serious problem to another part of it.    On the face of it, the new policy would seem to contain some  logic, or at least a wish to secure U.S. interests. There is no  Arab country that does not have to cope with, is not governed  by, or does not share power with extreme Islamic elements to  some extent or another. On one end of the scale lies Iran, on  the other lie Syria and Iraq, and in the middle lie Jordan,  Lebanon, Egypt, the Gulf states, the five Muslim republics in  Central Asia; in fact, every Arab country with institutions that  bear romantic names and shoot innocent people in the name of  Islam.    How long can undemocratic regimes curb religious opposition  movements which are seeking to install a worldwide Muslim regime  but are in the meantime prepared to make do with wrecking the  current regimes? Is the United States prepared to come to the  aid of every regime seeking to eliminate its religious  opposition? Is that possible? These questions featured  prominently in various debates held by the U.S. Administration,  which was anxious about the possibility that Iran, Sudan, and  soon Algeria may be joined by other countries which will not  just burn local law books but also the U.S. flag.    U.S. Administration officials realized that if such a  scenario came true the United States might be left without any  allies in parts of the Middle East and Central Asia, and it is  against this background that the new policy announced by the  national security adviser can be understood. What remains  unknown is the conditions the U.S. Administration set for  supporting extreme Muslim regimes.    If the administration intends to support only those Islamic  regimes elected in democratic elections it is deluding itself on  at least two counts. The only Arab country that has ever held  democratic elections is Yemen, which is currently experiencing a  tough war and where the tanks will probably determine who will  rise to power. All other Arab countries may call their  elections democratic, but it is their rulers who determine how  democratic the elections or their regimes are. If  fundamentalist regimes rise to power, they will most probably  follow the Afghan model, which is partially being implemented in  Algeria: street fights, guerrilla warfare, sweeping the poor  classes, eliminating the intelligentsia, splitting the army, and  ultimately seizing power.    The second count is even worse. The administration need only  check the results of democratic elections in most African  countries and in those Arab countries that hold some kind of  elections to conclude that democratic elections do not guarantee  democratic regimes. The U.S. Administration actually made clear  that only legitimate regimes, however ruthless and corrupt they  may be, will enjoy U.S. support. The caveat of democratic  elections was merely designed to give a guise of legitimacy to  the continued U.S. relations with and support of such countries.    Arab regimes, at least those considered pro-Western, have  reason to be upset by this U.S. policy; the Americans have  reason to worry that such long-term policy might destroy U.S.  interests any time down the line.</p>

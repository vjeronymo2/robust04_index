			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Manchester City leaps 68% MR Peter Swales, who is currently embroiled in an increasingly acrimonious battle for control of Manchester City, said yesterday that no formal proposals had been received regarding an offer for the Premier league club. Mr Swales, chairman of the club, had earlier claimed that other unnamed buyers were keen to acquire the club in opposition to the consortium set up by Mr Francis Lee, a former player. The statement accompanied the club's results for the 12 months to May 31 which showed pre-tax profits ahead 68 per cent from Pounds 632,000 to Pounds 1.06m. Turnover increased from Pounds 8.97m to Pounds 10.1m. The outcome was struck after net expenditure on players of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 200,000). Net assets amounted to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 2.8m) although the figure takes no account of any valuation of the players or the full value of the stadium. The shares are dealt under Rule 535.2.</p>

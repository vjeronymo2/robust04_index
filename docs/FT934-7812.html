			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Youngs bolstered by interest rate cuts LOWER INTEREST rates helped Young &amp; Co's Brewery, the south London-based real ale brewer, report a 5 per cent increase in interim profits. Despite reduced turnover of Pounds 36.1m (Pounds 37.4m), reflecting difficult trading conditions - there were no signs of recovery, the company said - the pre-tax line for the six months to September 25 edged ahead to Pounds 2.58m, against Pounds 2.45m, struck after gains of Pounds 23,712 on asset sales. Interest payable dropped to Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 1.7m). Heavy interest charges have held back the group's growth in the 1990s as it funded the purchase of new pubs and expanded into hotels. Export markets showed signs of improvement. The US side was doing 'very well', the company said. A substantial drive into Hong Kong and China would begin soon, initially with the group's lager brands. The UK, in contrast, continued to suffer from recession. The introduction of Oatmeal Stout into some 60 outlets, however, had performed 'beyond expectations'. The product developed an 'enormous following' in the US following its introduction there in 1989 and a more general release into the group's UK estate was anticipated. After tax of Pounds 901,464 (Pounds 808,826) earnings per 50p share emerged at 12.52p, up from 12.27p last time. The interim dividend goes up 0.25p to 7.25p.</p>

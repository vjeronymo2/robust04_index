"Such practices deprive consumers from freedom to choose,"  an  official at the agency said.    In the face of a shortfall in last year's rice crop because  of the cool and rainy summer, Japan early this year began to  sell foreign rice imported from Thailand and China either mixed  with domestic rice or separately.    But some retailers and wholesalers are requiring customers  to  buy domestic and foreign rice as a set, since long-grain rice  imported from Thailand is unpopular with Japanese consumers, who  favor medium and short-grain rice as a food staple.</p>

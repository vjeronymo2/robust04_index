Our correspondent has prepared a report on the  operation carried out by the Turkish Air Force in northern Iraq,  during which some bombs fell on two border villages of our  country, killing and wounding some of our compatriots:    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Following the incident,  meetings were held between Iranian and Turkish diplomatic  officials. In a telephone conversation with Foreign Minister Dr.  'Ali Akbar Velayati, the Turkish foreign minister expressed his  regret over this incident and dispatched a team of experts to  the area, including some officials from the Turkish Foreign  Ministry and the joint headquarters of the Turkish Armed Forces,  to investigate the matter.    After two days of investigation and inquiry in the area,  this  team announced the results of its survey yesterday. The head of  the Turkish delegation confirmed that shrapnel found in the  Iranian border areas was from the Turkish cluster bombs used by  the Turkish Air Force last Friday. A statement was signed by  the two sides and named The Report of the Joint Inquiry  Commission. We interviewed 'Ala'eddin Borujerdi, the deputy  foreign minister for Asia and Oceania, regarding this incident  and the repercussions of such occurrences on reciprocal  relations, which you will now hear:    [Borujerdi] All evidence points to the fact--especially in  view of the large number of fighter planes that participated in  these operations and the close proximity of the PKK [Workers'  Party of Kurdistan] centers on Iraqi territory to our  villages--that there was no definite intent to attack our  territory. We have signed a statement because the rockets and  bombs fell on our soil and the Turkish side has repeatedly  expressed its extreme regret during the past two days.    Turkish officials have announced that they are willing to  compensate for the losses, which is quite natural. I believe  that with the cooperation of the two sides, we will be able to  attain results. This incident is a source of immense regret for  all. Foreign Ministry officials express their condolences to the  families of the victims. We hope that we can defend our  national interests with regard to this incident.    [Correspondent] What kind of bad effects can such incidents  have on bilateral relations?    [Borujerdi] It is natural that negative incidents can have  concomitant deleterious effects. It is important that such  incidents be prevented in the future. I have clearly brought  this up with the Turkish ambassador. We have officially  requested of the Turkish Government that if they carry out any  military operations in the future they should do so after  careful study so that there is no encroachment on our soil.

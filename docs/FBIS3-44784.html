Mr. Hata, who is  also Foreign Minister, arrives in the Chinese capital on  Saturday and will leave for home on Sunday.    Diplomats in Tokyo and Beijing said Mr. Hata would convey  the  wish of the Government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to  further improve relations with China. They said Tokyo was  anxious to expand its share of the Chinese market, given signs  of an improvement in Sino-European and Sino-American ties.    Apart from his host, Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian  Qichen, Mr. Hata is expected to meet Mr. Zhu, President Jiang  Zemin and Premier Li Peng.    Diplomats in Tokyo said that apart from bilateral issues,  Mr.  Hata would focus on security on the Korean peninsula,  Sino-American ties, China's entry into the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade, and Japan's investment in China.    "Hata, perhaps the most powerful figure in the Hosokawa  Cabinet, has been forced to limit his visit to a little more  than 24 hours because of political problems back home," a source  in Tokyo said. "President Jiang and Premier Li are expected to  see him even though Chinese leaders usually do not meet visitors  over the weekend."    The source said Mr. Zhu would probably accept the invitation  and make a trip to Tokyo later this year. Tokyo is very eager  for Mr. Zhu to visit the country, as he is seen as a key  politician in the post-Deng Xiaoping era.    Western diplomats in Beijing discounted recent reports in  the  Japanese press about a forthcoming visit to Tokyo by Mr. Jiang.  They said there was little chance such a visit would take place,  because Mr. Jiang had already visited Japan in mid-1992 as party  General Secretary.    Chinese diplomatic sources said that during the Hata visit,  Beijing might raise the issue of the fourth round of yen loans,  even though the third round is not due to expire till 1995.  Tokyo would be hard put to give a definitive reply, given  Japan's aid commitment to a number of other countries, they said.</p>

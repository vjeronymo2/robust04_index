			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Norilsk Industrial Managers: "A Giant on Its </F> Knees Can No Longer Shoulder Burden"]    [Text] Anatoliy Artemenko, deputy chairman of the  Federation of Taymyr Trade Unions Executive Committee:    The combine's industrial production fell by 25 percent last  year alone. In order to bring the workforce into conformity with  production volumes, we have to lay off approximately 37,000  people. To this we must add 30,000 retirees who are condemned to  live in the Norilsk industrial zone because they don't have  enough money to move back to the "mainland." As a result of the  Gaydar reform, the money they had saved for retirement or for a  rainy day became worthless overnight. After all, the cost of  living in the North is much higher than in the country's central  regions.    They have all become hostages to the North.    Anatoliy Gluskin, member of the combine's council of  labor collectives:    The Norilsk Nickel Concern, of which our combine is a part,  the Krasnoyarsk Nonferrous Metals Plant, and two enterprises on  the Kola Peninsula were once known as the flagship of the  ferrous metals industry. There is no other combine in Russia  like it. We accounted for up to 90 percent of all nickel and  cobalt, 30 percent of all copper, and 50 percent of world  extraction of platinum and platinoids. But now the question of  the Norilsk Combine's very survival has arisen.    The combine was always extremely profitable. Our profit  margin was triple that of the gold-mining industry. We export  100,000 tonnes of nickel. But the problem is that 40 percent of  our exports are intercepted by Moscow. Precious metals are also  a total state monopoly. That's hundreds of millions of dollars  more. At the same time, we experience constant delays in getting  paid. And the banks are imposing more and more penalties for  late payments.    People came to Norilsk to earn money. A man, a heart  patient,  comes up to me and says that the doctor has ordered him to  return to the "mainland" immediately. Otherwise he won't  survive. He had 23,000 rubles in his savings account. Three  years ago, he could have bought himself an apartment and a car.  Today that money isn't even enough to buy a ticket to Moscow.    We are like voluntary prisoners.    Boris Degtyarev, chairman of the Norilsk Design  Institute's trade union:    We been making the rounds of government offices in Moscow  for  a week now. We tell officials that the North is a big place,  with 11 million people. There are dozens and hundreds of  enterprises there. But there are only a handful like the Norilsk  Combine. We tell them that in order for the law on the North to  be effective, there has to be a system of priorities as to who  should be helped first.    If necessary, production has to be cut back. Some of the  people who lose their jobs have to have a guaranteed opportunity  to move to inhabited areas. What are the region's other unique  characteristics? The Ukrainian diaspora alone accounts for 15  percent of the total population. These people became unwanted  overnight. How can a person return today to Ukraine or  Kazakhstan, for example? Every republic has its own laws. An  intergovernmental agreement is needed here. These people worked  for Russia too, and so Russia must play a part in providing  their pensions. That's one thing.    Second, there has to be strict implementation of the  government decrees that have been adopted. The government  recently issued a decree that seems pretty good at first  glance--"On Appropriating Interest-Free Subsidies for Housing  Construction." But again, government officials, without  consulting Northerners but sitting in their offices in Moscow  with no knowledge of our unique situation, wrote that you can  obtain the subsidies only by quitting your job in the North and  moving to the place where you intend to live. That's laughable.  Who is going to give you a loan in a region that is itself eking  out a semi-impoverished existence?    Gennadiy Bondarenko, chairman of the Metallurgists  Trade Union:    When the collective sent us to Moscow, people hoped that we  would be able to air our problems at the state level. We were  able to see Shakhray only on the sixth day. He heard us out  attentively and then turned us over to his aides. They, in turn,  sent us to the State Duma, and there we were told to see the  regional deputies faction. And that's all we've been able to do  so far.    Aleksandr Danilov, chairman of the Oktyabr Mine council  of labor collectives:    Today's difficulties are the result of old mistakes. The  basic cause is that the social infrastructure is too big. Some  263,000 workers and office employees live in the Norilsk  industrial region. Of them, 126,000 are employed by the Norilsk  Combine. Of those 126,000 employees, 45,000 are our basic work  force--the miners and metallurgists. So it turns out that  137,000 are people whose salaries are paid from the budget. They  even outnumber the combine's employees.    The combine cannot support such a large number of people, if  only because production volumes are certain to drop. Fifty  percent of everything that is shipped into the territory is paid  for with hard currency and proceeds from the sale of metal  produced by the combine.    Most of our output is sold by the state. We are permitted to  sell our products only within the country. We were among the  first 10 of the second 100 enterprises that acquired licenses to  sell their own output.    In conclusion, it can be said that there is no effective  state program to develop the Norilsk industrial zone.</p>

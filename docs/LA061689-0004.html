			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DEALING WITH MISS ETHEL'  </P> <P> I read Al Martinez's column quite frequently and usually like what he writes.  </P> <P> However, his "Dealing With Miss Ethel" upset me and I have a feeling I'm not  the only one.  </P> <P> I am (for the last 12 years) one of the those "Miss Ethels." I give my time as  a volunteer working in a hospital gift shop and I think all of us who do this  kind of work deserve praise.  </P> <P> So most of us are about 70 and over and perhaps our eyesight isn't the best any  more. We still give of our time and of ourselves.  </P> <P> I think you did "Miss Ethel" and all the rest of us a great injustice.  </P> <P> HELEN MEDAK  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

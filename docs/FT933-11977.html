			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Letter: Child care tax proposal illogical Sir, Victoria Tomlinson is out of order in her complaints that (a) the cost of a training course for her nanny is not tax-deductible and (b) the cost of a nanny is not tax-deductible (Letters, July 16). Rightly or wrongly, much other training, for example business school courses, is not tax deductible. It would be wrong for a nanny's training to be made an exception. Making the costs of child-care tax-deductible would effectively penalise parents who earn little and parents who give up work (and therefore earnings) to care for their children. The parents who would benefit most from making child-care tax deductible are richer ones who do not want to look after their children. Ms Tomlinson complains that she cannot run her business without child care. Just because you cannot work without something does not mean it should be tax deductible. On that basis, for example, transport to and from place of work should be tax deductible. If the state wishes to contribute more towards child care it should increase child benefit (which should, incidentally, be taxable on the caring parent, usually the first name on the child benefit book). This leaves choice in the hands of the parents as to the form of care (lower income because you do it yourself/care at work/care close to home etc). It also means that parents under most pressure - particularly single parents on low incomes - would be helped most. Making place-of-work child care tax deductible was logically the wrong approach.

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Court ruling puts Bofors case in doubt AN INDIAN court ruling yesterday virtually quashed the investigation into the Rs14.5bn (Pounds 256m) Bofors scandal after government agencies failed to establish that the Swedish arms company had bribed the Indian government to secure a big order in 1987. The Delhi high court, in a 115-page judgment, quashed the complaint filed against Mr Win Chadha, then Bofors Indian agent, and granted reprieves to 13 others, including Mr Martin Ardbo, former president of Bofors, and Mr G P Hinduja, a British businessman of Indian origin. The ruling also quashes requests by a special judge in 1990 to Switzerland and Sweden seeking co-operation in the investigation. The judgment noted that the Central Bureau of Investigation had failed to name a single bureaucrat or politician as an accused in the case, 31 months into the inquiry. Allowing a petition filed by Mr Chadha, the court held the investigation could 'not be allowed to continue' against Mr Chadha 'on the basis of surmises and conjectures'. The high court judgment comes at a time when the Geneva cantonal court was to pronounce its crucial verdict on the Indian government's request for access to information on Swiss bank accounts, which would reveal the names of the beneficiaries, if any, of the alleged bribes. Authorised signatories of the six frozen Swiss accounts have strongly opposed the Indian government's plea, citing Swiss secrecy laws. The Geneva court, which was to pronounce its judgment 'any day now' would probably withhold it, according to the bureau. The high court's judgment will damage the investigations abroad, bureau officials feared, but they say they will continue. The bureau will appeal to the Indian Supreme Court against the lower court's judgment 'as early as possible'. The Supreme Court is now legally bound to give the Dubai-based Mr Chadha a hearing before disposing of the bureau's petition. Opposition leaders expressed scepticism that the Bofors inquiry would ever be fruitfully concluded with a Congress government in power. Mr George Fernandes, former cabinet minister and leader of the Janata Dal, whose party had promised to punish those involved in the Bofors scandal, said the judgment was 'a direct challenge to the Supreme Court'.</p>

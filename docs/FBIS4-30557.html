			<p>BFN     [Text] There is a growing demand that the government  should set target figures to narrow the price gap between Japan  and other countries and to "reduce domestic prices to half." In  this regard, the Economic Planning Agency [EPA] is assuming a  negative stand. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata also showed his  strong will to set target figures. But, many EPA officials are  of the view that "since prices are determined by market  mechanisms, including relations between demand and supply, it is  difficult to set targets for the future" (according to a senior  EPA official). Under such a circumstance, in which the people  are increasingly calling for a revision of the price difference,  the EPA, whose role is to keep an eye on prices, just cannot  publicly oppose the idea of setting such goals. Therefore, it  seems that the EPA is in anguish.    Revision of the price gap became a policy task of the Hata  administration in lieu of a "plan to double actual income,"  which was introduced in late May. The prime minister submitted  the plan to double actual income with an aim to lower prices of  goods 20-30 percent. However, the plan has fallen through  because the EPA opposed the idea of setting goals for lowering  prices. At that time, the prime minister instructed the EPA to  buckle down to the task of narrowing the price gap between Japan  and other countries. The EPA was also determined to study actual  measures to revise the differences at a meeting of the Price  Stabilization Policy Council (an advisory organ to the prime  minister), which is composed of representatives of each economic  sphere.    On the other hand, at the Administrative Reform Council  Promotion Council working-level meeting held early this month,  the prime minister explained his positive view of setting  medium-range target figures for narrowing the price gap. At the  meeting, attendees expressed their views, saying: "We should  aim at reducing price differences to half in five years and  publicly announce this goal." It became such that "Numerical  targets," which the EPA tried to annihilate, emerged under  another form.    The EPA is positive about mapping out measures to revise  Japan's traditional business practices, which are causes of the  price gap, and improve industrial productivity. However, it is  against the idea of introducing concrete numerical targets.    Economists, who work in the private sector, criticized the  plan to double the actual income, saying it is "unrealistic."  It seems that the EPA does not have influential supporters as  far as the issue of setting targets for revising the price gap  is concerned. The government started to map out measures to  revise the price gap by holding a general meeting of the Price  Stabilization Policy Council. However, it seems that heated  debate will be held at this meeting too over the issue of  setting target figures.</p>

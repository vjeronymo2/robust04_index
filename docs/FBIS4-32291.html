			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jana Havligerova and Tomas Marek: "Problems </F> Being Experienced by Banks Are Reaching Deeper Than Errors in  Management"]    [Text] After two banks collapsed financially, the  nervousness of the public is palpable at every step. The failure  of the Credit and Industrial Bank of Prague and the subsequent  closing of the Bohemia Bank brought about defensive reflexes  within society; the confidence of the populace in the entire  system is melting away like ice in the summer sun.    The nervousness is currently concentrated upon the so-called  small banks, which are those that have recently come into being  and whose basic worth is about 1 billion korunas [Kc] or beneath  that level. On the other hand, large institutions are perceived  as being safe and secure.    Except that this is also a matter for discussion. Not even  the giant posthumous children of the monopolistic financial  system that existed under the socialist economy are in "as cozy  a situation" as it may seem. Recently, reports reached the  public regarding some of their heavy mistakes--for example, the  payment of a forged check for Kc60 million by the Bank of  Commerce and a mistake involving precious gemstones that,  provided it is confirmed, could cost the Investment and Postal  Bank Kc500 million. Experience indicates that only a fraction of  what goes on in the banks ever reaches the public eye.  Accordingly, one cannot only figure that even the large  institutions engage in failed ventures, but also that there will  very likely be more such ventures than have currently become  known.    The current lack of confidence in small banks is, moreover,  nurtured by uncertain reports regarding their uncertain  financial situation. And so a single exemplary case is  sufficient. And two failures within the short period of six  months--that is simply too much. And what today's published  report regarding the difficulties being experienced by the AB  Bank will be cannot even be estimated.    For purposes of confidence in the system, it is immaterial  that both cases--the Bohemia and the Credit and Industrial  Bank--are special cases and do not have a whole lot in common  with pure banking. In the case of the Credit and Industrial  Bank, this is obviously a matter of fraudulent activity to  benefit selected clients of the institution; in the case of the  Bohemia Bank, the culprit was illegal foreign operations by part  of the management of the firm.    The Czech National Bank has hardened conditions for doing  business in the industry in recent months. It increased its  oversight over individual institutions, imposed higher standards  that banking houses must meet. Thanks to this move, six  institutions are now under heightened control--the Czech  National Bank assigns them tasks and makes recommendations to  their management teams and compels them to strengthen the  financial position of their bank.    When the business boom began in 1990 and in the subsequent  years, it turned out that the large institutions were far too  cumbersome, do not know how to expand their services with  sufficient speed, and are proving ineffective in terms of  distributing their resources--in other words, lending money  where there is an interest in such loans. And small and medium  business entrepreneurs were interested. There was more demand  for loans, which exceeded the supply of available money. In  other words, the large corporations were not striving in any way  to attract this clientele. The market reacted in a natural  way--small and medium-size banks began to come into being.    However, since that time, the situation has changed. The  supply of money has increased and is probably even greater than  the demand for new credits today. The large banks were also  faced with tough competition--a number of enterprises that had a  reputation and good plans turned their backs on them and their  high interest rates. They either borrowed money abroad or issued  bonds. The large banks began to find that the world is not only  colored a rosy pink and had to begin paying attention even to  those clients whom the black-garbed sheriffs never even allowed  in the building before. Of course, this is contributing to the  worries of the small banks--in order to succeed, they must lower  their loan rates. And this is precisely a problem for them.    When the small banks needed money for credits, they were  compelled to acquire primary resources, the best of which were  time deposits from the populace and from enterprises. And  persuading a customer to deposit money precisely with their  institution meant paying higher interest rates than were being  paid by the large institutions.    In other words, the small banks were offering better  conditions for depositing money, and, consequently, on the other  hand, they also made more costly loans. As the interest of the  large institutions is expanding, so the operating room of the  smaller ones is shrinking--and the fact that they apparently  have more pleasant personnel, are more flexible, etc. does not  alter much in this situation. The fundamental economic rule of  price will have its way.    Thus, the small banks have no choice but to rapidly become  larger. Many are working arduously at this task--never before  have there been so many reports regarding increases in basic  worth that have followed each other so rapidly as has been the  case in recent months. But that will not be enough. The Czech  National Bank, which is guarding the health of the banking  sector, knows very well that the structure of the financial  institutions is unsuitable and is planning to bring about a  change in the structure through new regulations. And so there  will clearly soon be a wave of mergers and fusions involving the  smaller banking houses. Overall, perhaps the number of banks  will shrink, but this is not a pity. For this price, the  financial institutions will buy back the confidence of the  population, which they had lost in part.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL KIND OF SCHOOLING;  </P> <P> L.A. UNIFIED PROGRAMS HELP STUDENTS DEVELOP SELF-ESTEEM AND MOTIVATION  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District is offering many programs during the  current school year that are designed to motivate, educate and train students  -- from the very young through adulthood. Here are just a few of the programs  offered in the nation's second-largest school system.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aid for Homeless Students  </P> <P> PURPOSE: The Coeur D'Alene Avenue Elementary School in Venice offers  approximately 70 homeless students extra medical and psychological services, as  well as a counselor who works mainly with parents to help them obtain social  services. The program also offers computer-assisted instruction in reading and  writing.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A $70,000 grant from the Greater Los Angeles Partnership for the  Homeless, a private nonprofit agency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Basic Skills and Pre-Employment Class  </P> <P> PURPOSE: The district offers pre-employment training -- including work to beef  up basic education skills -- through an elective, credit class for  approximately 125 students planning to get jobs after completing high school.  Students work and attend classes simultaneously so the two experiences can be  integrated. The program is coordinated with the Summer Youth Employment Program  at Banning, Van Nuys, Fremont, Dorsey and Belmont High Schools.  </P> <P> FUNDING: $357,030 in federal funds under the Job Training Partnership Act  (JTPA).  </P> <P> </P> <P> L.A.'s BEST  </P> <P> PURPOSE: Better Educated Students for Tomorrow is an after-school education and  child-care program that began in 1988 at 10 schools, with three teachers and  teacher's aides running the programs at each of the schools. The program was  expanded in 1989 to include 15 schools, offering 3,000 elementary students a  chance to learn and play in safety during after-school hours. In 1989, two new  components were added: Four parents, who are longstanding community members,  have recently been added at three of the 15 schools to encourage more parent  participation and attract more students; and approximately 60 college students  from three California State University branches are tutoring fifth- and sixth  graders at seven of the schools. Some college students will volunteer, some  will be paid $15 per week and others will receive class credits. Five new  schools will be added in September, bringing the number in the program to 20.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A two-year, $2-million grant from the Los Angeles Community  Redevelopment Agency and a $500,000 grant from the Kaiser Permanente  Foundation. California State Universities will pay the salaries of the students  who tutor and will absorb some administrative costs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> College-Bound Students  </P> <P> PURPOSE: In this program, which is based at Montague Street School, 54 fifth-  and sixth-grade minority students are encouraged to develop the skills, values  and attitudes they will need to succeed in college. Students and their parents  participate in field trips to local college campuses, and students receive  T-shirts that identify them as "Kollege-Bound Kids."  </P> <P> FUNDING: A $2,222 grant from the California Educational Initiatives Fund  (CEIF).  </P> <P> </P> <P> DARE After-School Alternative Program  </P> <P> PURPOSE: An offshoot of the nationally known DARE program, which began in 1983  as a tough anti-drug curriculum in the classroom and is now used in every  elementary and junior high school and more than half of the high schools in Los  Angeles. In the expanded, after-school DARE program, Muir Junior High School  students are participating in a nationwide pilot program designed to enhance  personal and social skills as well as to increase students' pride in  themselves, their school and community. After school, students participate in  sports, a modeling club, a video production club, drill team and a singing  group called "DARE Up With Life." The program also provides field trips for  cultural and educational enrichment. These students are not required to  maintain the "C" average that is required of other students who participate in  after-school sports.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A grant from the Nancy Reagan Foundation for $36,392.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FATHERS  </P> <P> PURPOSE: Twenty-five youths, ages 16 to -21, who are married or unmarried  fathers, are trained for full-time employment in jobs that provide opportunity  for advancement and help them understand parental responsibilities. Basic  skills and parenting/family life classes are held at the Crenshaw-Dorsey  Community Adult School. The Youth Intervention Program in South-Central Los  Angeles also will provide training in cabinetmaking, scaffolding construction,  computer literacy, computer repair and running a small business. The program's  full name is Fathers, Academics, Technology, Health, Economics, Responsibility  and Success.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A $60,000 JTPA grant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Listen and Learn  </P> <P> PURPOSE: Students can phone in and hear prerecorded messages on drug abuse  prevention, self-esteem and the value of education. On the line are celebrities  such as Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser, the Lakers' Michael Cooper, Raiders  tackle Bob Golic and disc jockey Rick Dees. There is also a homework hot line  staffed by 13 college students from 3:30 to 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday.  Assistance information or help with personal problems is available 24 hours a  day, seven days a week at (213) 250-4555 and (818) 548-9111.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A $350,000 three-year grant from Great American Bank.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Part-Time Jobs Program  </P> <P> PURPOSE: Through the Los Angeles Youth Service Academy project, the city  arranges jobs in the Department of Recreation and Parks for 1,000 students who  are at risk of dropping out. This project offers clerical, custodial and  computer programming positions, as well as work in carpentry, gardening and  sports officiating. The students, ages 14-20, who are recommended for the  program by counselors at 49 high schools, are required to be enrolled in a high  school or a regional occupation center where vocational training is part of the  curriculum. This project is scheduled to begin in late March.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A $5-million donation from the Department of Water and Power for the  first year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pre-Genesis Program  </P> <P> PURPOSE: Think of it as a head start for high schoolers. The purpose of this  program is to help 180 youths improve their basic reading and employment skills  so they can qualify for the Genesis program, which is designed to keep youths  from dropping out. Students in Genesis are required to maintain a 2.5  grade-point average and have a 90% attendance record at school during their  senior year. Priority for enrollment in the pre-Genesis program is given to  11th-grade students who are behind in graduation credits, read below grade  level and have had little or no work experience. The Pre-Genesis program  operates at Locke, Lincoln, Garfield, Roosevelt, Manual Arts and Jefferson high  schools.  </P> <P> FUNDING: $380,000 in federal funds through the JTPA.  </P> <P> </P> <P> School Safety Program  </P> <P> PURPOSE: This program is designed to reduce campus disruptions at two schools.  At Jordan High School, students are trained as peer counselors skilled in  conflict management and resolution. Virgil Junior High School's program  includes crime awareness training for community members and production of a  crime prevention video by the students. Approximately 2,700 students -- nearly  two-thirds of the total student body of the two schools -- are expected to have  participated by the end of the school year.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A $10,000 grant -- $5,000 each for Jordon and Virgil -- from the  California School/Law Enforcement Partnership, a joint effort of the California  State Department of Education and attorney general's office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vision for Architecture  </P> <P> PURPOSE: This effort, with the full name of Student Vision for  Architecture/Built Environment Education Program, provides approximately 600  first- through ninth-graders at 21 schools instruction from a teacher and a  professional architect.

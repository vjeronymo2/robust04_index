			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 19 May (NA) -- Today, members of  the Health Committee of the Chamber of Deputies rejected the  pressure being applied by U.S. Ambassador to Argentina James  Cheek, seeking to force a rapid approval of the Pharmaceutical  Patents Law.    The diplomat met with congressmen. After the meeting, he  again directly threatened Argentina with trade sanctions because  Congress is delaying the debate of the bill.    Thus, Cheek formulated three similar warnings in less than  24  hours in what appears to be a clear offensive to get the bill  approved before the last day of June. [passage omitted]    Radical Civic Union Ernesto Algaba told journalists  accredited to Congress that the deputies will not accept "any  pressure or threat from the United States." Algaba once again  conditioned any debate to an agreement within the terms agreed  during the GATT round of talks.    He believes this agreement could be ready within 90 days for  approval by Congress, and if this were to be fulfilled, "our  bloc is willing to debate the patents law, which we oppose in  its current version."    The meeting was informal because it was held at the office  of  Santa Fe Province Deputy Horacio Usandizaga and not at the  Health Committee offices. [passage omitted]    Radical congressmen Algaba said the proposed goals "are  difficult to achieve." Deputy Alejandro Armendriz added:  "Congressional schedules must be respected, without any external  pressure, so we can improve the law pertaining to this important  matter."    Despite all these assertions, Ambassador Cheek left his  first  meeting with the Radical congressmen in a very happy mood.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Saga and Statoil plan assets swap programme Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest independent oil group, and Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday announced details of a planned asset swap programme designed to facilitate a NKr40bn (Dollars 6.1bn) development of three gas fields in the Norwegian Sea. The two companies signed a letter of intent covering the complex arrangement, with the aim of completing a detailed purchase and sales agreement on November 1. Saga confirmed it would take over operational responsibility for Statoil's North Sea Fenris oil field and Statoil would buy 15 per cent of Saga's 50 per cent shareholding in the field, increasing its Fenris stake to 35 per cent. The company will take over 10 per cent in two exploration licences in the Fenris area. Saga will also acquire from the state a 7 per cent interest in each of the two licences comprising the Smoerbukk and Smoerbukk South gas fields. This transaction will need parliamentary approval. In return, Statoil will acquire two Saga shareholdings, of 5 per cent and 0.625 per cent, in the Norwegian Sea Heidrun oil field. Statoil will also take over the operation of Saga's Midgard gas field. Midgard, Smoerbukk and Smoerbukk South are situated in Haltenbanken off the coast of mid-Norway. 'This is a pioneer agreement which is very important for the two companies . . . and for the development of Haltenbanken,' said Mr Harald Norvik, chief executive of Statoil. 'I think we will see more and more of these deals in future.' The joint Haltenbanken development will compete with North Sea fields to supply continental Europe with natural gas.</p>

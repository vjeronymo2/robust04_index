			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Turbulence in the spring air: The prime minister's resignation is a step backwards for Japanese politics Mr Morihiro Hosokawa was joking when he told his companions over dinner a few days ago that he would like to resign as Japanese prime minister. He wanted, it was said, to enjoy the cherry blossom in bloom all over Tokyo. Shortly afterwards, Mr Hosokawa politely denied he had said any such thing. But he gave the jest a sad ending yesterday by apologising for the inconvenience he was causing and offering his resignation, the final U-turn of an increasingly erratic eight-month-old administration. The gentlemanly Mr Hosokawa's decision was prompted not by indiscretion over his meal of eels, but by his disinclination to fight the allegations of financial impropriety made against him by an aggressive opposition Liberal Democratic party. His resignation could open a new round of political realignment as parties jostle for position ahead of a general election which could, in this unstable climate, come at any moment. It also represents a step backwards for Japanese politics. It deals a symbolic blow to the campaign - against old-style money politics and for a more open style of democracy - on which Mr Hosokawa was elected last summer, bringing an end to 38 years of LDP rule. Mr Hosokawa's downfall also marks a resurgence in the LDP's power. The opposition knows well, from its own painful experience, that being labelled corrupt is a liability. Now the party has turned that weapon against Mr Hosokawa. The LDP lost the election mainly because of its reputation as the master of financial corruption, through its involvement in some of Japan's best known scandals, culminating in the recent arrest of a former LDP construction minister on bribery charges. Mr Hosokawa has withdrawn, rather than be similarly tainted. 'I must clarify my responsibility as a reformist leader,' he explained to his bewildered coalition colleagues yesterday, prompting an astonished 10-minute silence in the meeting room. The surprise was understandable. Mr Hosokawa was in a fix, but a relatively mild one by Japanese political standards. The LDP was blocking the current year's budget until he disproved allegations that he had wrongly borrowed Y100m (Pounds 650,000) from a parcel delivery company for a personal political campaign and tried to cover up a share purchase for tax reasons. It was a standard tactic, used to bring down an LDP prime minister, Mr Noboru Takeshita, five years ago. As a result of the LDP's allegations, and a series of embarrassing policy U-turns, Mr Hosokawa's popularity had fallen from about 70 per cent last year, a postwar high for a Japanese prime minister, to less than 50 per cent last month. Yet Mr Hosokawa was still far more popular than previous LDP prime ministers in similar fixes. His cabinet had a firm majority in parliament. It might have been able to hold out until an election, probably early next year, under the new electoral system. The change, from multi-seat constituencies to a mixture of single seats and proportional representation, was agreed as part of the package of political reforms that has been the Hosokawa government's biggest achievement. The LDP, by contrast, has weak support, with only 15 per cent in the latest opinion poll by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper. Had he the stomach for a fight, Mr Hosokawa could have battled on. 'He may not have been able to bear the situation any more,' says Mr Testsuro Murofushi, political commentator of the Asahi Shimbun daily paper. The lesson is that Japanese politics is still no place for idealistic gentlemen, even after recent changes. The old structure, founded on seniority, behind-the-scenes influence and cash, has weakened but not fallen. Mr Hosokawa, the scion of a feudal clan, was ill-prepared for playing a game run by bruisers with little sympathy for his aristocratic ways. Until last summer, he had never held a seat in the lower house of parliament, let alone a ministerial job. He made his reputation as governor of Kumamoto prefecture. He was only chosen as prime minister as part of a deal by Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom strategist, to hold together the diverse members of the seven-party coalition, stretching from Buddhist-backed right to extreme left. 'Mr Hosokawa was a puppet,' says Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo - a thought that must have occurred to Mr Hosokawa several times during his administration. Rebellious coalition allies forced him to scrap several important initiatives, including a rise in consumption taxes and a cabinet reshuffle. Mr Hosokawa appeared relatively untroubled by these political setbacks. But the allegations against his personal financial honesty were different. The final blow appears to have been Mr Hosokawa's own discovery that his problems went deeper than the affairs raised by the LDP. He uncovered a legal problem relating to investments made on his behalf by an 'old personal friend'. Who that friend is and how much cash was involved was the second hottest subject for speculation in Tokyo last night - after the identity of Mr Hosokawa's successor. The task the alliance parties face in choosing a new prime minister is considerable. Mr Hosokawa's position as leader of a small, centre-right party, the Japan New party, allowed him to play the honest broker between the coalition's conflicting members. Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, is seen as a front runner, because he has the support of his own Japan Renewal party, the second largest coalition member, of Komeito, the clean government party, and the implicit acceptance of the moderate wing of the Social Democratic party, the largest group in the alliance. He is the only cabinet member with previous ministerial experience - at the agriculture and finance ministries. However, Mr Hata is not a certain bet. His patron and joint founder of the JRP, Mr Ozawa, is a fierce rival of another important coalition figure, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, head of the New Harbinger party. Mr Ozawa and Mr Takemura may find it hard to agree. If, as is possible, coalition leaders fail to agree on a successor to Mr Hosokawa, they will be forced to call a general election. That would open the way for the LDP, despite its low showing in the polls, to try to form a coalition government. Another possibility is for Mr Ozawa to offer the prime ministership to Mr Michio Watanabe, a former foreign minister, who leads a pro-reform faction in the LDP. The Socialists and Mr Takemura would leave the existing government coalition if the Watanabe faction defected to it. That would leave two large groupings in Japanese politics - a centre-right coalition in government and a centre-left group in opposition. It must be cold comfort for Mr Hosokawa that he can leave the horse trading to others and watch cherry blossom to his satisfaction. According to last night's weather forecast, the blooms will fall in the next few days - a reminder of the fragility of Japanese governments.</p>

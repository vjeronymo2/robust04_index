			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No sign of revolution in US healthcare Sir, 'Revolution' seems a terribly strong word with which to headline Michael Prowse's report on the proposed US healthcare reforms ('Healthcare revolution is nigh: Will Clinton's plan mean cheap care or a free lunch?' September 10). The trickle of leaks may now have become a torrent, but the ideas are little different from those suggested well before Hillary Clinton's task force was set up. Interestingly, the two most radical ideas to have come from America recently appear to have been dismissed. The Oregon plan accepted that rationing of health care was universal and inevitable however it was disguised. Under that scheme individual diseases and treatments were paired up, and each condition/treatment pair was rated by cost and its effectiveness in improving quality of life. These pairs were ranked in order of descending cost-effectiveness and a cut-off point, determined by the budget available, was set. The aim was to eliminate expensive treatments for minor ailments, and, more controversially, ineffective treatments for serious illnesses. More recently, economists John Goodman and Gerald Musgrave (also noted by Michael Prowse in his column, 'A contrary view on healthcare', August 23) pointed out how little market forces apply when healthcare is bought by an employer or the government. Their suggestion was to eliminate insurance for minor conditions, so re-introducing market-based price and consumption controls for the majority of treatments. More serious illnesses would be covered by insurance, but that cover would be purchased by the individual rather than his or her employer, and again some link between consumption, risk and cost would be introduced.

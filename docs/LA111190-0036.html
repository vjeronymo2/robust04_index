			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: SILENCE IS NOT NECESSARILY GOLDEN  </P> <P> Men who walk around like they have a mouthful of Novocain have always been  admired and respected for it. The moody, silent type is the goal of every woman  who lusts . . . for Brando or Bronson, for Eastwood or Redford. All these sex  symbols have to do is to sit there and stare, and imagination writes the  dialogue for them.  </P> <P> On the screen, it's great. In real life, it's the pits. A man who does not talk  eventually can drive you crazy. Talking with some husbands and fathers is like  an evening of sound bites.  </P> <P> "What do you want for dinner?"  </P> <P> "I don't care."  </P> <P> "I want you to speak to your son."  </P> <P> "What about?"  </P> <P> "Talk to me."  </P> <P> "What do you want me to say?"  </P> <P> "Do you love me?"  </P> <P> "What a question."  </P> <P> I think men have romanticized this image for so long, they're beginning to  believe that silence presents them as mysterious and deep. They don't answer  phones. They don't waste breath talking to recordings. They don't gossip. They  never hear rumors. In fact, they never know anything until it is on the 6  o'clock news.  </P> <P> If I was that quiet, my husband would put a mirror near my lips to make sure I  was breathing.  </P> <P> The basic difference between the social interaction of the sexes can best be  described by a phone call that comes into your home. If it's for your husband,  he will respond, "Yeah? No kidding! That's astounding. I don't believe it! Have  you told anyone else? You've got to hang tough. Talk to you later."  </P> <P> When you ask, "Who was that?" he says, "Nobody." When you ask, "What happened  to nobody?" he replies, "Nothing."  </P> <P> I can go into a roadside restroom for five minutes and come out with 200 miles  of nonstop conversation about it. I know who was in there, what they said about  road conditions, restaurants, their kids, their gas mileage and their financial  statement.  </P> <P> In a world where communication is state of the art, I worry about the silent  types. However, the other day I heard a voice and realized my husband was  talking to himself.  </P> <P> What a waste. He should have confided in someone who listens.  </P></p>

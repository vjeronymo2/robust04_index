			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE CAN MAKE SOME BIG MONEY, BUT HE'D PROBABLY PAY FOR IT  </P> <P> Mike Tyson, after describing how he would dispose of scheduled opponent Carl  (the Truth) Williams and proposed opponents Evander Holyfield and George  Foreman, said: "I will whip Tony Mandarich's tail, also. Oh, yes, I would love  to make him suffer. He is a big man. I would love to make him cry."  </P> <P> Would Mandarich be wise to take such a match, even for $10 million?.  </P> <P> "Yes," Dave Kindred of the Atlanta Journal writes. "For that much money he can  get a private room, 24-hour nursing, a heart pump and a very nice neck brace.  Accepting certain limitations, he has a chance to live a meaningful life."  </P> <P> Add Mandarich: According to USA Today, a radio station in Antigo, Wis., had a  weekend fund-raiser to help the Green Bay Packers sign Mandarich, their No. 1  draft choice. Mandarich is asking for $1.8 million. The fund-raiser netted  $13.98.  </P> <P> Add Tyson: Says Matt Baranski, who has worked the corner in most of Tyson's  fights but was in Holyfield's corner when the two squared off in a sparring  session at the 1984 Olympic trials: "Evander did very well with Mike. It could  have gone either way. But now, Mike will knock him out. I've seen Holyfield,  and he's too easy to hit."  </P> <P> Add Baranski: He no longer works for Tyson, having been cut adrift when Tyson  fired trainer Kevin Rooney, but he told the Albany (N.Y.) Times Union: "I was  told that Mike still says I'm his main man. We were always good friends. I  never interfered with his private life. Mike is a very intelligent kid, but  some of the things he has done have given me second thoughts."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What title was at stake in the Sugar Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns  fight?  </P> <P> Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: Bud Grant, on how he learned about discipline playing  for Paul Brown at Great Lakes Naval Station during World War II: "One day a  player who had been drinking showed up for practice. Coach Brown ordered him  back to his barracks, and when the guy got there, they already had his orders  ready, shipping him to the South Pacific. From that day on, the rest of us were  afraid to sneeze."  </P> <P> It ain't bluegrass: When Rick Pitino signed a reported seven-year, $5.7-million  contract with the University of Kentucky, it ended speculation that he was  using Kentucky to squeeze more money out of the New York Knicks.  </P> <P> Wrote Paul Daugherty of the Cincinnati Post: "Pitino couldn't make that kind of  money anywhere else and still be called Coach. And anyone who drives a Mercedes  on an annual income of $35,000, as Pitino did a decade ago at Boston  University, appreciates the color of money."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: The World Boxing Council super-middleweight title, which was  held by Leonard and retained by him, by virtue of the draw.  </P> <P> Quotebook: San Diego Padre Manager Jack McKeon, asked the name of a recently  born granddaughter: "They haven't decided. She's the baby to be named later."  </P></p>

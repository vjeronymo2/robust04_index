			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Johannes Ngcobo and Billy Paddock] </F>   [Text] The peace plan being finalised by President F.W. de  Klerk and ANC [African National Congress] President Nelson  Mandela is believed to include the withdrawal of the SAP's  [South African Police] internal stability unit from all East  Rand townships tomorrow and the eviction of hostel residents  without permits.    ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] deputy  secretary-general Obed Bapela disclosed these details at the  funeral of an ANC self-defence unit member in Katlehong  yesterday. Two people were shot and injured at the funeral.    De Klerk and Mandela met yesterday to finalise the plan but  could not complete the task and scheduled further meetings.  Spokesmen refused to disclose details until a final agreement  was reached. However, De Klerk said proposals included boosting  security force manpower and the SADF's [South African Defense  Force] role and addressing socio-economic problems, such as  housing and education. All parties which had a bearing on  violence had to be consulted, including the Inkatha Freedom  Party.    Bapela said the ANC had met East Rand self-defence units and  they had agreed that policemen would not be targets. He urged  the community to welcome the SADF. The ANC had demanded  photographs of all internal stability unit members so they could  be excluded from the police force.</p>

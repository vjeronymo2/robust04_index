			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Patten predicts new constitution BRITAIN'S constitution and institutions face fundamental change by the turn of the century, according to a study published today. In the study by the European Policy Forum, a free-market think tank, Mr John Patten, education secretary, says the Citizen's Charter has started a rolling programme of constitutional reform which will introduce a new constitutional settlement by 2000. Mr Patten says the government's approach is to introduce new ways of running the country on a step-by-step basis. This involves: Giving citizens 'real rather than paper rights' through the Citizen's Charter. Encouraging active participation in the way things are run at local level. Changes to the criminal and civil justice systems to ensure a just outcome. The restructuring of local government to 'reflect local needs and sentiments'. He says the result of the government's approach is a growing body of clearly defined rights. This process renders 'civil rights less liable to sudden change or collapse than is the case when they derive from the vague provisions of a written document, when one particular interpretation by a few jurists can nullify everything at a stroke', Mr Patten says. Mr Frank Vibert, director of the forum, says change in the British system of government is inevitable and radical reforms are needed to revive a machinery of government, which is under pressure from the need to be more effective in setting the European agenda. Mr Vibert proposes drawing ministers from outside parliament and direct or indirect elections to the Lords. Modernising British Government, European Policy Forum, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1.

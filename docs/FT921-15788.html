			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Ravenscraig complex set for closure BRITISH STEEL is today expected to announce the closure of the its steelmaking complex at Ravenscraig in Scotland. Last night the Labour party reacted with fury to the disclosure that British Steel is to close the last blast furnace at the plant, near Motherwell, Strathclyde, in nine months' time with the loss of 1,250 jobs. The plant has been progressively run down over the past year, following the closure of its hot strip rolling mill. Since then Ravenscraig has only made steel slabs to sell on the open market and supply to other British Steel plants. The closure comes as part of a cost-cutting drive at the company, which has suffered steep falls in profits in the face of increasing competition from imports in a declining UK market. In November, British Steel reported half-yearly profits down from Pounds 307m to Pounds 19m. Closure of the plant would mean the virtual end of steelmaking in Scotland, leaving British Steel with little more than the plate mill at Dalzell which is adjacent to Ravenscraig. The company said last year it hoped to replace Dalzell in the next few years with a new plant on Teesside. The closure of Ravenscraig would provoke a furious political row involving the government and in particular Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary. Last night Labour politicians were accusing British Steel of reneging on a commitment it gave before its privatisation in 1987 that it would continue steelmaking at Ravenscraig until 1994. The pledge was, however, 'subject to commercial considerations.' Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said early closure would be a 'betrayal' by the company and the government. The shutdown of Ravenscraig would suggest that British Steel's trading position and market prospects are worse than had been thought. It also suggests that it believes it can satisfy demand from the Port Talbot and Llanwern plants. With the pledge to retain steelmaking at Ravenscraig, British Steel said that if it were to close the steelmaking facilities it 'would consider, on a commercial basis, any wholly private sector offer for those facilities as an alternative to closure'. Politicians are now likely to insist that the company honours that pledge. Mr Bill Miller, chairman of Strathclyde region's economic development committee and a leading campaigner for Ravenscraig, said that Mr Lang now had no option but to resign. British Steel confirmed yesterday that 219 jobs would be cut at the Shotton steel finishing plant in Clwyd by the end of the year. Another 139 jobs are being axed at Port Talbot steel works.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent J.V. Boo: "U.S. President Forced </F> To Insist on Resolute Foreign Policy"]    [Text] New York -- Worried by continual drops in opinion  polls, President Clinton started a campaign to convince U.S.  citizens and the rest of the world that his foreign policy is  resolute and transparent. The Americans are complaining about  growing confusion with regard to Bosnia, Haiti, North Korea,  China, and Rwanda....    Over the past weeks, there have been numerous -- though  inefficient -- attempts to present the new Defense Secretary  William Perry as an expert on the world's situation, while  Christopher is still waiting for a brilliant move to gain  prestige as secretary of state. Quite often the State  Department and the Pentagon announce divergent positions.    Support for Clinton's foreign policy has been continually  dropping since January. Two weeks ago the alarm went off, when  the negative score (41 percent) was higher than the positive one  (40 percent). After months of contradictory statements on  Bosnia and North Korea, public opinion has become infected with  the same skepticism about Clinton's leadership in foreign policy  that is already dominating many foreign capitals.    During a special news conference by satellite with  correspondents of different countries, the President tried to  restore his image before his allies and enemies, but the meeting  served more to vent personal frustration about the attacks than  to reassure foreign capitals with regard to the firmness of the  U.S. leader. Visibly irritated by a question from a CNN  correspondent in Sarajevo, Clinton stated that "there are no  continuous about-faces in my policy on Bosnia, and I have been  much more active in this area than my predecessor."    He admitted though that he "had underestimated the  difficulty  of creating a coalition and reaching agreements within NATO,"  but he found comfort in remembering that John F. Kennedy, his  favorite predecessor, had also discovered that "international  problems are more difficult than they seem."    On the domestic level, Clinton's problem is that the  Americans want results and, too often, fast results. Under  these circumstances, the humiliations accumulated in Bosnia, the  incapability to subdue the military in Haiti, and the absolute  passivity with regard to the crisis in Rwanda are being  translated into deep discomfort with regard to the tenant of the  White House.</p>

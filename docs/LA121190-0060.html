			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'SUPPER': HEAVY ON THE CLICHES  </P> <P> The Open Gate Theatre -- a talented, multicultural group of musicians, dancers  and performance artists -- has seen sharper days. In an amateurish evening at  the First Congregational Church in Pasadena on Saturday, the company dredged up  many of the prevailing cliches of contemporary performance art.  </P> <P> Rika Ohara's "Shelter IV 1/2: The Last Supper," the featured work on the bill,  continued the artist's ongoing exploration of "awaiting nuclear destruction in  a glass shelter the size of the Berlin Olympic Stadium."  </P> <P> In a series of black and white tableaux, a huge gauze-draped cross in the  background, four performers (Ohara, Carol Cetrone, DeEn Swayden and Will  Salmon) writhed, twitched and convulsed in slow motion in their chairs. As  minimalist- and Balinese-flavored music played and abstract slides were  superimposed on the back wall, Maria Bodmann, Cliff DeArment and John Payne  completed the environment.  </P> <P> "An Epitaph for Man," a text by Yukio Mishima, was read on a voice-over by  Willy Bagot. Full of aphorisms about the failings of humankind, it reduced  Ohara's clean images to the familiar sentimentality of so many after-the-bomb  artworks of the past decade.  </P> <P> Billed as a work in progress, Ohara's performance nonetheless evinced a  professionalism woefully absent from the three brief solos also on the program:  a woman-breaks-free dance by Dagmar Stanec; an embarrassing text-based duo  recounting anecdotes about racism by MA Bell and Margo Palluchi; and Will  Salmon's amusingly simian, if self-indulgent, "Tree Dance."

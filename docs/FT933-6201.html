			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Docile candidates fail to fire Singapore's voters AFTER a campaign remarkable only for its lack of political vigour, Singapore goes to the polls today to elect a president. Mr Ong Teng Cheong, a leading light in the governing People's Action Party (PAP), who resigned as deputy prime minister to run for president, is favourite to become Singapore's first elected president. Mr Ong is opposed by Mr Chua Kim Yeow, a former banker and senior government official. Two critics of the government were declared ineligible to stand for president under a law which, in effect, rules out all but senior members of Singapore's establishment. Both Mr Ong and Mr Chua have led low-key campaigns which have generated little excitement. In a final televised election address, Mr Ong rejected criticism that he would be a tool of the PAP as president. 'Some people still ask if my long association with the PAP will stop me from acting independently,' said Mr Ong. 'The answer is No. My loyalty, first and foremost, is to the people of Singapore.' Mr Chua has shyly admitted that he was pressured into standing for president because the government wanted a contest. But Mr Chua did cause a small political spark in his election address by saying that the absence of an effective opposition in Singapore was worrying many people. 'The PAP dominates the government and the legislature,' said Mr Chua. 'Do you want the PAP to dominate the presidency as well?' Singapore's new president will have some executive powers, including a veto on government spending of the country's USDollars 46bn reserves.</p>

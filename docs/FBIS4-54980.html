			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] At the proposal of the government,  President Vaclav Havel has appointed three officers of the Czech  Army to the rank of first general. On this occasion he  delivered a speech marking the 49th anniversary of liberation  from fascism. We now present the full version of this address.    [Begin Havel recording] Gentlemen, veterans, esteemed fellow  citizens! Voices pointing to various possible external dangers  and demanding that politicians should pay more attention to the  security of our state and to a faster building of a system of  security ties with the democratic world are beginning to appear  in our part of the world and from time to time even in our  country.    These voices, even though they may often be out of  proportion  to the situation, do nevertheless, testify to a certain fact.  They are evidence of a certain disquiet, of a feeling of  uncertainty, and of concerns that four years after renewing its  independence, our comparatively small country, which is moreover  situated in an exposed position, is still finding itself in too  much of a vacuum, because its belonging to the West has still  not been properly, or if your like, institutionally, confirmed.  By adopting a cautious approach, by having an aversion to  changes and fear of new things, the West allegedly keeps  showering on us uncertain promises rather than tangible deeds  and our politicians are allegedly accepting this situation with  too much ease. I am not going to evaluate now to what degree  these opinions are or are not justified. I will rather  concentrate on bringing to your attention what we ourselves must  do if we wish to reinforce our own certainties.    The appropriate international talks aimed at our speedy and  firm incorporation into the political, economic, and security  structures of the democratic world are being conducted almost on  a daily basis. Perhaps they could be conducted with an even  greater urgency. But this approach itself is far from being  enough. I think it is far more important that we, as a society,  are capable of expressing through concrete deeds our  willingness, will, and courage to both defend our own freedom  and independence and to participate in the joint international  defense of democratic values anywhere where they are being  trampled on.    The point is that no one will give us any security  guarantees  unless he is sure that we ourselves are capable of defending our  country and, at the same time, we take on the broader  responsibility we are demanding from others.    An international alliance is not and cannot be based on a  unilateral action, which means that the task of one side is to  render all-round help, while others are here to be helped. In  other words, we ourselves must not refuse to take risks and make  sacrifices and at the same time, ask others to run risks and  make sacrifices because of us. The advantages of freedom,  independence, and development cannot be enjoyed while  responsibility for their defense is delegated to others.    I think that our modern history offers quite a lot of  evidence of the fact that freedom is not a gift that is fought  for and that is later handed out by the powerful of this world,  but that only he, who himself is working toward winning and  defending it is able to win or defend it. [passage omitted]    Thanks to the entire set of historical circumstances we  fortunately did not have to wage an armed struggle to liberate  ourselves from Communism. But this does not at all mean that  all has been taken care of forever and that we do not need to  worry about our security any more. Unfortunately, we do not,  and will hardly ever live in such an ideal world. After all,  the will to get involved in the struggle for justice and peace  demonstrated by our units in the Persian Gulf and in the former  Yugoslavia has given a considerable boost to the respect our  state enjoys on the international arena today. [(passage  omitted]    Today, the day when we recall the end of the Second World  War, I greet on behalf of all my fellow citizens our war  veterans. I greet those present in this hall and all other  veterans, including those living abroad. I greet them as people  to whom we owe our present freedom, I greet them as people who  should be an inspiration for our entire army. In appointing new  generals today, I am guided by the conviction that they are  aware of this example and that their work will enhance the  credibility of our army.    The great changes that have taken place in our army in the  recent years testify to the loyalty and professional attitude of  career soldiers. I believe that our army will successfully  continue the work that has begun. The credibility of our  republic, or in other words, the credibility of all of us,  depends to a considerable degree on its loyalty and credibility.  Providing our army is ready to defend at any time the values we  enjoy today, and providing this readiness is based on the  general support by society, the society that is aware that evil  must be fought even with arms, we do not have to fear for our  security and we do not have to fear that in case we are  threatened, others will fail to show their solidarity for us.  Gentlemen, I congratulate you on your appointment. War  veterans, thank you. [end recording]</p>

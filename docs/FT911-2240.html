			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: GM and Ford post heavy losses as recession bites THE SEVERE slump in US automobile demand was underscored yesterday when General Motors and Ford, the two leading American manufacturers, reported heavy first-quarter losses. Ford warned the US recession would make it difficult for the company to earn a profit in 1991. However, while Ford produced figures worse than analysts' expectations, GM's losses were not as great as Wall Street had feared. GM's performance in Europe was also markedly better than Ford's. GM announced a loss of Dollars 461m, or 78 cents a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 619m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, in the same period last year. Revenues dipped from Dollars 30.1bn to Dollars 29.2bn. But GM's figures were flattered by two non-recurring items: a Dollars 403m gain on the sale of its New York office building and a Dollars 303m accounting change. Excluding these, the company suffered a net loss of Dollars 1.17bn, but even that was better than analysts forecasts of losses as high as Dollars 1.8bn. Ford reported a loss of Dollars 884m on revenues of Dollars 21.3bn, against earnings last year of Dollars 506m on revenues of Dollars 23.6bn. That compared with Wall Street loss forecasts ranging from Dollars 625m to Dollars 800m. The US motor industry is suffering from a slump in domestic demand at a time of severe manufacturing overcapacity, exacerbated by the rapid build-up of Japanese manufacturing plants in the country. Producers have slashed prices to move stock and the Big Three US companies - GM, Ford and Chrysler - are implementing cost-saving programmes. Both GM and Ford forecast a gradual economic recovery in the US, but Ford said it was unlikely the company would be profitable for the second quarter and would probably record a loss for the full-year. Over the past year GM and Ford's US problems have been partly offset by strong performances in the European market, but that is weakening. This was reflected at Ford, which said its overseas operations lost Dollars 208m in the quarter, against earnings of Dollars 155m a year ago. In the US, Ford's automotive operations lost Dollars 947m, against earnings of Dollars 160m. GM said its overseas profitability was strong, helped by record earnings in Europe.</p>

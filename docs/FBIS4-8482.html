			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andreas Schwarz report: "Romanian Declaration for NATO; </F> Vienna Is Eastern Europe's `Ally' in European Union"]    [Text] Vienna -- Romania is preparing for membership of  NATO, albeit in the distant future. Romanian Foreign Minister  Teodor Melescanu, who paid a 24-hour visit to Vienna and met  with the foreign minister and the chancellor, said in an  interview with DIE PRESSE: "In a transitional period, the  so-called `Partnership for Peace' is important for states that  want to become NATO members, this is quite certain. One cannot  go to bed as a Warsaw Pact member and wake up as a NATO partner."    "Moreover, we know exactly that a larger NATO would be  regarded as a threat in certain Russian circles and an important  part of the military establishment." This will not be the case  with Partnership for Peace, to which Russia has also been  invited, Melescanu said. He explicitly stressed that Russia does  not have any right whatsoever to veto entries into NATO.    Regarding nationalism in Russia, Melescanu is not dismayed  at  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy -- "he is only a person" -- but at the  support for this course. This has to be counteracted by  strengthening the democratic elements.    Romania itself is striving for entry into the European Union  [EU], the foreign minister announced. However, it will only  apply when the association agreement with Romania has been  ratified by all the EU states, seven of which have not yet done  this. "I only tackle things that have reasonably realistic  chances of success," Melescanu said. After the present round of  accession, the enlargement of the EU will probably be postponed  for some time. However, when Austria is in the EU, the Eastern  European states will have an "ally in Brussels."    "Violence cannot solve a conflict, it can only influence it  in one or another direction. Only negotiations can solve it."  In this way, Melescanu commented on the NATO air strikes  against Serbian positions in Gorazde. If detente, the  abandonment of fighting in favor of negotiations are a  consequence, the action can also be regarded as a success, he  said.    NATO's threats finally also led to something like a  cease-fire in Sarajevo. "Any pressure is important and has to  be welcomed, one only has to calculate the consequences."    Have the international community of states made mistakes in  dealing with the Yugoslav conflict over the past two years? It  is easy to judge afterward, but it was altogether a "period of  missed opportunities," the Romanian foreign minister said. He  mentioned as an example the proposal that Slovenia and Croatia  made to Serbia to form a loose federation, which was rejected by  Serbia. Europe tried to do its best, but it always lagged  behind developments. Europe's mistake was that it was not quick  and determined enough.    Melescanu does not want to say whether an early threat of  force would have prevented some developments. It might have  also had negative consequences. However, pressure in all forms  that are permitted and agreed upon in the UN Charter is one of  the most important things to solve a conflict.    At present, he is "moderately optimistic" regarding the  Yugoslav conflict"; at any rate, a positive development can be  noticed: for example, the Croats' agreement with the Muslims,  the negotiations of the Krajina Serbs with Croatia; now it is  important "also to involve the Serbs again."    Why did Romania receive Slobodan Milosevic, head of state of  an internationally outlawed country, with all honors and in a  remarkably cordial way last week? "Let us say: We received him  because it is important to talk to everyone," the Romanian  minister said to tone this down. However, Franjo Tudjman has  been received before -- "with all honors," as Melescanu stressed  now -- and a friendship treaty was concluded with Croatia.  Bosnia's Izetbegovic will come next week.    Why is a friendship agreement with the rest of Yugoslavia,  which is outlawed by the UN, being developed? "It is being  prepared," but it will only come into force after the ending of  the UN sanctions, he said.</p>

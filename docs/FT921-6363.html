			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (1): A swathe through the investment jungle - Foreword CONSUMERS HAVE a tough battle when dealing with the financial services sector. All too often they are offered products that they do not understand by people whose motives they have every right to suspect. It is often hard to tell whether the investment on offer is designed to boost the wealth of the consumer, or to line the pocket of the salesmen. A classic example is the way in which consumers are sold life assurance-based savings products, which may offer good value if held for 15 or 25 years but are highly inflexible. A Securities and Investments Board study found that up to 45 per cent of such policies are abandoned in the first two years, with resulting abysmal returns to the policyholder. One reason why so many of these policies are sold is that they bring substantial commission to salesmen. Even someone who is called an 'independent' financial adviser is not necessarily unbiased; he or she has a natural incentive to recommend those products which pay the highest commission. In such circumstances, newspapers are often seen as a crucial source of independent information for the saver. But it is impossible, in the space available to a daily newspaper, to cover all the topics in which a financial consumer may be interested. Inevitably, a reader must take pot luck each week on whether his own field is covered. This A-Z is designed to help fill that gap. Within these pages, there should be several articles which will appeal to every consumer. The jargon of the financial services world - from annuities to zero-coupon shares - is explained. But as well as specialist topics, there are articles of a more general interest. For example, how are the banks and building societies competing against each other to attract customers? How can a husband and wife most efficiently organise their finances? What is the current state of the mortgage market? As you work your way through the guide, you should find that one subject will lead to another. Those who turn to F for fixed rate investments might be intrigued to know more about G for gilts. Anyone who reads L for life insurance may find their thoughts drifting to the issue of wills and inheritance tax (a subject duly covered under W). As befits what we know of Financial Times readers, there is a strong focus on equity investments. We include a guide to the art of picking 'cheap' shares, known in the jargon as value investing. Other articles focus on yields, dividends, and unit and investment trusts. Of course, even this guide cannot be comprehensive, but we hope it will be a useful work of reference and information for the saver and investor.</p>

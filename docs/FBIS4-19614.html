			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mia Doornaert: "Defiant Serbs"] </F>   [Text] Shots have been fired in Sarajevo again. The  shelling was part of the defiant response by Bosnian Serb  fighters to the NATO action in Gorazde. The Bosnian Serbs have  since also held UN blue helmets hostage, shelled Tuzla airport,  which is under UN control, and launched attacks on Gorazde,  officially designated by the United Nations as a "safe" Muslim  enclave.    Opponents of any form of military support for peace  diplomacy  can take the Serbian response as proof that they were right and  claim that military action leads to more and not less violence.    Such reasoning takes little account of two years of war  misery in Bosnia. For almost two years the European Union [EU],  the United Nations, the countries which have sent blue helmets  to Bosnia, have limited themselves to talk and negotiation. The  EU and UN resolutions were not backed up by any credible threat,  the blue helmets provided no deterrent. The success of "peace  diplomacy" has been far from impressive. The single ultimatum  regarding Sarajevo produced more results than the endless rounds  of talks in Geneva.    A mistake has certainly been made with respect to Gorazde.  Not by launching air strikes against the Serbian troops who  were in the process of overrunning this Muslim town, but by  doing so too late, when the possibility of producing a  "Sarajevo" effect was lost.    The bungling over Gorazde once again shows how necessary it  is to achieve the right mix of diplomacy and deterrence, in  order to use the latter in the interest of the former. By  allowing doubts to exist regarding the commitment of the UN and  NATO, the peace process has again been thrown out the window.    In the meantime, the taking of blue helmets as hostages in  Bosnia by the Serbs, and their shelling of safe havens, once  again places a large question mark over UN peace missions in  areas of conflict.    The unclear nature of the mandate under which peacekeeping  troops are sent into areas where there is no peace to keep, the  slow UN decisionmaking process, the abiding by rules which have  nothing to do with the situation in the field -- all these  elements threaten to seriously undermine the credibility of UN  operations. Bosnia, Rwanda, Somalia are the most flagrant  examples.    In Bosnia it had long been clear that sending in blue  helmets  was more of an excuse for failing to get seriously involved with  the problem than a remedy. The blue helmets had to look on  powerless at the misery of war, and became targets themselves.  But their very presence was used as an argument for not taking  stronger action against the aggressors, for fear of reprisals  against the blue helmets. If the UN peacekeeping troops thus  become part of the problem in an area of conflict rather than  part of the solution, then peacekeeping is clearly due for new  rules and a more decisive and preventive approach.    In the meantime, the United States and Russia, which have  played the leading roles in the peace process in Bosnia, must  ensure that the Bosnian Serbs respect UN troops and resolutions,  and thus restore interest in a peaceful solution.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 24 May (XINHUA) -- According to the China  Satellite Launch Tracking and Control Department: The accident  of the meteorological satellite, the "Fengyun II," will not  affect China's plan of launching satellites for foreign  countries. Chinese authorities, after consulting with the  Hughes Aircraft Corporation of the United States, have decided  to proceed with the original plans of launching the three  foreign satellites -- the "Asiasat I," the "Asiasat II," and the  "Optus B3" -- during the second half of the year.</p>

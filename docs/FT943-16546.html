			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Rail dispute The dispute between Railtrack and the RMT rail union has been characterised by bafflingly complex arguments over pay and, at times, almost farcical misunderstandings between the two sides. But this is not an amusing trip down industrial memory lane. It is a deeply damaging conflict for rail privatisation and for the standing of Railtrack and must be resolved before it escalates. Managerial foot-dragging and the unfortunate timing of last year's 1.5 per cent public sector pay limit caused legitimate grievances over signalling staff pay to fester for too long. That does not excuse RMT's hasty use of the strike weapon, especially when Railtrack had made clear its basic sympathy with the signal staff case. The relative ease with which the strike has been bypassed by commuters and freight users ought to be a reminder that  -regardless of the ownership regime - railway staff are in a fight for their jobs against other modes of transport. If the RMT executive were to decide at its meeting today to escalate the dispute (though there are some welcome indications that the union's negotiators may resist any serious escalation of the conflict), the company and the government would have no choice but to challenge the union's monopoly power on the railways and try to keep the trains running without its members. It should never have come to this. The rather technical differences between the two sides on modernising the pay structure could easily have been fudged, without conceding any important principle. The fact that the differences have instead been exacerbated suggests either that Railtrack has been looking for a fight or that a culture clash between old British Rail hands and outsiders has led to crossed wires inside the organisation. The government does not seem to have helped. Hitherto its public sector pay bill freeze has been interpreted with appropriate flexibility and seems to be meeting remarkably little resistance. The 3 per cent increases recommended by some of the Pay Review Bodies were not baulked at by the government and it has even made clear that savings on running costs can be used to boost pay bills. Railtrack should have been left to negotiate alone. That, after all, is part of the point of privatisation. The pay increases announced on Friday by Railtrack form the basis of a fair settlement. The fact that the offer as it now stands will leave one-quarter of signal staff considerably worse off should not be an obstacle. It is part of the price of a fairer pay system. But Railtrack needs to spell out in more detail how it will compensate the relief signal staff affected. Alternatively, given the very high turnover of relief staff it could announce that the new terms apply only to new recruits and those on existing rates can keep them until they give up the job.</p>

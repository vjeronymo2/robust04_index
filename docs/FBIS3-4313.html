			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Hongtao (0491 3163 3447) ] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Senior  Colonel Si Jiuyi, deputy to the National People's Congress and  commander of the Yunnan Province Armed Police Corps, revealed at  an exclusive interview with our staff reporter today that, in  1993, the armed police and public security authorities in Yunnan  cracked a total of over 4,000 drug cases, 27 of which were cases  of armed drug trafficking; seized five metric tons of heroin and  opium; and arrested over 6,000 criminals, among whom 473 were  sentenced to death.    Si Jiuyi said: The drug problem is still very serious in  Yunnan, as the temptation of money has encouraged large numbers  of offenders to take the risk. The incidence of drug  trafficking is showing an upward trend, and the following new  developments have been observed.    An increase in major drug trafficking cases. After making  some money, drug traffickers tend to try making colossal profits  by engaging in transactions involving 100 kg, 200 kg, or even  larger quantities of narcotics.    -- A steady growth in armed drug trafficking. Because they  are aware of the consequences they will face after being  arrested, drug traffickers often fiercely resist the armed  police. Last year, Yunnan police seized a total of 33 military  firearms, 13 other firearms, and 50 hand grenades.    -- Progressively better organized means of trafficking. Drug  trafficking using cars and motorcycles is no longer a novelty.  Criminals use mobile phones and walkie-talkies to communicate  with one another and transport drugs through such methods as  relaying or sending traffickers and drugs separately.    -- The increase in sources of drugs. Drugs used to only come  from Burma's Golden Triangle, but now they are infiltrating into  China from Laos and Vietnam. Last year, Yunnan's border towns  Honghe and Wenshan cracked over 200 drug cases originating from  Laos and Vietnam.    The increase of drug traffickers from other provinces. Last  year, Yunnan police arrested nearly 900 drug traffickers from  other provinces, and the scope of areas they came from increased  from 22 provinces and autonomous regions in the previous year to  27 provinces and autonomous regions. Most active were drug  traffickers from Sichuan, Zhejiang, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, and  Xinjiang.    Senior Colonel Si Jiuyi explained that the antinarcotic work  is currently in a very difficult stage. As Yunnan borders on  Vietnam, Burma, and Laos, the residents in the border areas  share customs and languages with those three countries, and the  border markers are not very clear, thus posing enormous  difficulty for antinarcotic operations. Drug traffickers tend  to be desperadoes. They even have such slogans as "You can  execute me, but my future generations will benefit" or "I may  stay in jail for a while, but I will enjoy prosperity for the  rest of my life." Criminal organizations give pensions to the  families of arrested or executed drug traffickers. Another  problem is that antinarcotic operations are short of funds and  manpower and suffer from backward equipment. In one case, a  drug-fighting unit leader had to chase a criminal by bicycle.  In the end, the criminal got away in a car.    Si Jiuyi said: Drugs from Yunnan harm not only Yunnan, but  also the entire country. The antinarcotic work is of vital  importance. No matter how difficult it is, we must not let drugs  and firearms flow inland. By adopting the tactic of blocking on  the first front, investigating on the second front, and  intercepting on the third front and by relying on the support of  the masses, Yunnan armed police forces have been able to conduct  a stern crackdown on drug crimes and can bring about a steady  increase in the number of cases cracked over the years. Many  armed policemen have proved themselves to be valiant fighters,  have rendered meritorious services, and have received awards.  Two of China's 10 Young People of the Year are antinarcotic  heroes from Yunnan. Si Jiuyi also revealed that over 20  soldiers from the Yunnan armed police forces laid down their  lives in antinarcotic battles over the past few years.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Bank dealings smooth INTERBANK operations in the UK proceeded very smoothly, with the liquidity shortage largely taken out at the earliest opportunity, writes Peter John. This was in contrast to Monday when most of the shortage remained outstanding until the end of the day. And the ease of yesterday's dealing prompted suggestions that the Bank of England might have exerted its influence by persuading some of the clearing banks to part with bills. The Bank of England offered the money market an early round of assistance after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.9bn, which was later revised up to Pounds 2.1bn. Among factors affecting the position were the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official hands which drained Pounds 1.35bn from the system, bills for repurchase by the market which took out Pounds 743m and Exchequer transactions which removed Pounds 55m. Offsetting these, a fall in note circulation added Pounds 115m and bankers' balances above target contributed Pounds 150m. The Bank of England provided Pounds 1.65bn of early assistance, buying bills for resale to the market on November 22 at 5 29/32 per cent, and gave an additional Pounds 125m in the morning. This was followed by a further Pounds 198m of assistance in the afternoon, bringing total help for the day to Pounds 1.973bn. Short sterling took no cue from money supply figures which added to evidence that consumer spending is driving economic recovery in the UK. The rise in M0 - cash in circulation - to a seasonally adjusted 5.4 per cent in the year to October was very much as expected and most dealers were waiting for the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin later in the day. The futures contract for December traded within a tight range and was two basis points higher at 94.44 at the official close, but fell back later. Euromark futures were firmer as an announcement that the Bundesbank's repo today would be at a variable rate gave hope that it would fall slightly from its current 6.40 per cent. That hope was further encouraged by German industrial output data which showed that the economy was still very weak. The Euromark contract for December hit a high of 93.87 before ending two basis points up at 93.82. The French short-term interest rate contract settled two basis points lower at 93.60.</p>

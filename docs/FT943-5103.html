			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Blair to pick spokesman Mr Tony Blair is planning to appoint a high-profile media spokesman to beef up Labour's public relations team as he tightens his grip on the party's policies and organisation. The appointment follows the announcement that Mr Larry Whitty, Labour's general secretary for nine years, is to take up a new post as the party's European co-ordinator. It marks a break with the restrained approach of the late John Smith, the former Labour leader, who left media relations largely to the party headquarters' press office. The last Labour leader to have a personal media spokesman was Mr Neil Kinnock, who resigned in 1992. Mr Blair is said to believe that a spokesman appointed specifically to relay his views on current issues will help sharpen Labour's image in the run-up to the next election. The division of responsibilities will also allow the headquarters' public relations machine, headed by Mr David Hill, to concentrate on policy issues and planning campaigns. Mr Blair is understood to have approached several prominent journalists with Labour sympathies since his election as leader in July, and an announcement is expected shortly. The appointment is part of Mr Blair's attempt to refocus Labour's organisational machine on campaigning, communications and rebuilding the party's declining membership. The party has gained several thousand new members since Mr Blair's election as leader in July. Mr Whitty is expected to be replaced by Mr Tom Sawyer, a senior official of Unison, the public sector union, and a long-standing ally of Mr Blair.</p>

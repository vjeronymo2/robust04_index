			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Hume leads elaborate procession to the US: The need for careful post-ceasefire choreography It has been choreographed more carefully than a bourgeois wedding. The post-ceasefire procession to Washington by Northern Ireland's leading politicians is being accompanied by an attention to detail that would do the most assiduous mother-of-the-bride proud. These diplomatic niceties may seem tiresome. But they have the virtue of giving observers a way of assessing where the main participants in the Northern Ireland peace process stand in the US administration's eyes. This is particularly welcome since it is not clear what tangible rewards the politicians will achieve from their journeys. The most important guest is Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. This unmatched status is his reward for painstakingly building contacts on Capitol Hill over a period of 20 years and for his strenuous efforts to keep Northern Ireland high on the political agenda. It is significant that he was the first of the Ulster retinue to arrive. He was also granted an audience with President Bill Clinton during his meeting with Mr Al Gore, vice-president, on Tuesday. Whether his request for duty-free entry to the US for some goods made in Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Irish Republic will bear fruit remains to be seen. Other honoured guests are the Ulster Unionist party delegation who arrived in Mr Hume's slipstream. They too were granted a meeting with Mr Gore as well as with senior administration officials. Earlier this week Mr David Trimble, the UUP MP for Upper Bann, offered an insight into the delegation's agenda, saying: 'Our concern is to ensure that the pressures of domestic American politics do not intrude into our affairs.' Mr Adams, due to arrive in the US shortly, is the black sheep who is likely to be kept away from the top table. The Sinn Fein president, who is expected to meet members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate foreign relations committee, will attempt to build on the propaganda success of his trip to New York earlier this year, visiting at least 10 US cities. His visit is set partially to coincide with the presence in the US of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. According to the Foreign Office, Mr Hurd will make sure he gets the opportunity to 'put on the record' the government's views on the way ahead. At present the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, is the aggrieved relative who could not bring himself to attend the ceremony. This may change, however. There are definite signs of a thaw in the party's chilly relations with London after Mr John Major's promise of a referendum within Ulster on the outcome of political talks on the province's future. DUP officials acknowledged yesterday that Mr Paisley - currently in Canada - had received invitations to visit the US later this year and emphasised that he travels there frequently on private business.</p>

They were the first to reach for their  weapons. Their artillery pounds the city virtually every day.  Scarcely a day goes by without more victims falling because of  the civil war.    But every time a shot hits home, and the international  community is forced to make a move, these same Serb leaders  scream their innocence like the murdered victims and point to  the Muslims as the guilty ones. Then mention is once again made  of the "fundamentalism" that from time to time scores a direct  hit against its own side in order to keep international sympathy  for its cause warm.    Nobody can rule out with 100 percent certainty that there is  not some Muslim commander who is tempted to work out such a  devilishly Machiavellian plan, but if Radovan Karadzic and the  other Serb leaders want to be absolved once and for all of all  blame and "unjust accusations," then there is a simple solution  open to them: They can withdraw their heavy artillery from  around the city. Then the international community can translate  its cries of indignation into deeds: It can reinforce the UN  troops on the ground so that they can supervise a demilitarized  zone around the city in order to prevent the "balance" between  these Serbs and the Bosnian Government Army from being broken up  too suddenly. If that were to happen there, or on other fronts,  it would lead to fresh outbreaks of violence.    The rescue of Sarajevo -- even if it is a temporary and  local  solution -- could give new impetus to peace talks for all of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, but anyone who believes that the Bosnian  Serbs will give up their siege without a struggle must still  believe in Santa Claus. All the parties in the Yugoslav  conflict still place their exclusive trust in the power derived  from weapons.    For this reason, there was a great deal to be said for the  French proposal to put an ultimatum to the guilty parties in  this and other concrete cases. That is a step toward  escalation, and the people who take such action should be well  aware of the dangers it entails. However there is an awfully  great chance that the Bosnian parties will themselves initiate  this escalation, and will do so directly at a higher and just as  dangerous a level -- at least internationally.    So far the international community has been piling one  blunder on top of another. Or better put: Time after time it  has missed the boat when opportunities to have a positive  influence on the conflict presented themselves. That was  already the case before the weapons started doing the talking in  Slovenia and Croatia, and before the situation in Bosnia turned  into war.    Since the outside world does not seem capable of following a  sufficiently preventative policy, it will be forced -- sooner or  later -- to reach for military threats. That is the price of  the present comfort and detachment. The stronger Russian  nationalism grows, the weaker becomes the West's grip on the  Serbs. And this is happening at a time when in other places in  the Balkans new conflicts could break out at any time which  would immediately plunge the entire region into flames.</p>

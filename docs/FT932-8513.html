			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Allied policy divisions widen THE world's main powers, already in disarray over their Bosnian policy after the recent European tour of Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, yesterday appeared to be heading for a serious rift. The US set the alarm bells ringing on Monday night by stating that it would not attend a foreign ministers' meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday, as proposed by Moscow. That meeting, which will not now take place, had been called by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, with the specific purpose of discussing the latest Russian proposals for a stage-by-stage implementation of the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia. Washington's reason: that it was not yet ready to discuss joint steps by the international community in Bosnia because of continuing differences over what action should be taken, merely underlines the seriousness of the disagreements. Though no different from those that existed before Mr Christopher's European tour, they have been reiterated with some precision over the past 48 hours. Deep US scepticism about the workability of the Vance-Owen plan, is coupled with a conviction that some kind of military action against the Bosnian Serbs is now required. This contrasts with the view of the European Community and Russia that the international peace plan must remain the basis of a settlement and that military action would undermine humanitarian relief efforts and endanger European peacekeeping forces already on the spot. Mr Christopher told the House of Representatives yesterday that he considered the Vance-Owen plan could not be implemented in its present form, given the Bosnian Serbs' opposition to it. And while the administration had no intention of acting alone, it would continue to press for lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems. At the same time, the EC put out a statement in Brussels that it remained fully committed to the Vance-Owen plan. In the eyes of the US's European allies pressure should be applied mainly in the form of a complete blockade of supplies to the Bosnian Serbs, with the exception of food and medicines. The EC countries have been encouraged by the stated willingness of President Slobodan Milosevic to seal Serbia's frontier with Bosnia, though it is far from clear how effective the Serbian measures will be in practice. The Russians have not spelled out in detail their ideas about a stage-by-stage implementation of the Vance-Owen plan, which might be impossible to carry out as long as the fighting continued. But Mr Kozyrev said yesterday that Presidents Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, whom he had seen earlier in the day, had both shown willingness to implement the peace plan. The French, meanwhile, have taken the Russians at their word, suggesting that both the US and Russia should send ground troops to Bosnia to help protect Moslem safe areas set up by the UN. Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, said in an interview that, while France could not provide more than the 5,000 troops it already has in Bosnia, it wanted the big powers 'to relieve our efforts'. However, the proposal seems most unlikely to get off the ground, given that neither the US nor Russia have shown any inclination to contribute any ground troops. For the Bosnian Serbs, the rift between the main members of the Security Council has come as a welcome respite, just as they appeared to have been forced against the wall by international pressures.</p>

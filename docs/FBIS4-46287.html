			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rafiq al-Zayn from Beirut] </F>   [Text] A few months before the convening of the  organizational conference to elect the secretary general, the  Shura Council, and the Political Bureau, Hizballah began to  witness a violent struggle over its leadership and future.  While Hasan Nasrallah is preparing lists of names of new  officials to lead a corrective movement under his command, and  also preparing to send the names to Tehran to get its blessings,  Subhi al-Tufayli, backed by the radical Iranian wing, is  exerting efforts to carry out a coup. What is Nasrallah's plan  for the "new Hizballah" and how is al-Tufayli working to prevent  the current secretary general from renewing his term and from  joining the peace process at the expense of the resistance?    "The battle will be crucial and decisive. We should begin to  prepare for it from now." With this, a senior Hizballah  official commented on the questions posed by some Hizballah  leaders on the reasons of opening the file of the  "organizational conference" more than seven months before the  date of convening the conference, something which prtends the  dangers of a real "bone-breaking" battle from which the party  itself, in its current shape, might not emerge safe.    Observers believe that a crucial battle has begun to rage  behind the scenes in Hizballah, heralding a true war, that will  be witnessed by the organizational conference scheduled to be  held early next year, on the identity and personality of the new  secretary general and the members of the Shura Council and the  Political Bureau.    The current secretary general, Mr. Hasan Nasrallah, has  already begun his battle and is preparing to wage it with all  his strength. However, signs indicate that Nasrallah's future  battle will not be easy and will witness a very fierce conflict  that has been surfacing for sometime, namely, an inter-Lebanese  conflict and another inter-Iranian conflict that plays a  decisive role in determining the future of Hizballah.    Several months before the date of convening that "historic  conference," the Lebanese part of Hizballah seems to be captive  to three leaderships:    A current led by Hasan Nasrallah;    A current led by former Secretary General Shaykh Subhi al-  Tufayli, who counts on the support of Political Bureau member  Shaykh Khadr Tulays;    A current led by Deputy Shaykh Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyid.    So far, Nasrallah's current seems to be the strongest. It is  enjoying the Iranian regime's support, particularly the  "pigeons" current in Tehran, led by President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani. He is also the brother of Hajj Mahmud and  the Shura Council speaker. In return, al-Tufayli enjoys the  support of the radical current in Iran, which is led by former  Interior Minister Ayatollah Mohtashemi who also counts on the  support of Mehdi Karrubi and Ahmed Khomeyni. The final decision  will be made by leader 'Ali Khamene'i if he decides to settle  the situation in favor of the extremists.    Shaykh Ibrahim al-Sayyid, who is leading a "liberal"  current,  seems to be the weakest, especially since this is a strange  approach to Hizballah. Despite this, Mr. Nasrallah was shocked  and surprised when someone told him that Deputy Ibrahim Amin  al-Sayyid wants to nominate himself for the secretary general  post, especially since the star of al-Sayyid began to overshadow  that of Nasrallah. This is why Nasrallah's reaction was very  swift. He began to launch a campaign against al-Sayyid and to  accuse him of opening channels with the Lebanese Government and  of cooperating with Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, and later,  al-Sayyid pretended to be attacking and criticizing al-Hariri's  government, according to Nasrallah's accusations.    Information emphasizes that Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli began  his  preparations early for this confrontation. For several months,  al-Tufayli has been holding meetings with the Hizballah members  and officials in charge of areas who have the right to vote at  the conference, and, thus, the right to elect a secretary  general. These meetings were meant to draw support and "expose  the schemes" Hasan Nasrallah is trying to peddle in Hizballah's  cellars.    In his private meetings, al-Tufayli asserted to those close  to him that Nasrallah has returned to the game of trickery and  promises in an attempt to deflate the party's internal  opposition. In this regard, it was noted that he once again  tried to appease deputy al- Hajj Muhammad Yaghi and Shaykh  Muhammad Yazbik, members of the party's Shura Council, and other  Political Bureau members.    Shaykh al-Tufayli recently began to set up special  institutions such as media and security offices, and appointed  advisers and assistants. He also held meetings with Arab  fundamentalist personalities, including groups belonging to the  "Egyptian Jihad" organization in the Harat Hurayk neighborhood  of Beirut with the aim of expanding his alliances by appeasing  the Arab fundamentalist groups in Lebanon, particularly in the  al-Biqa' area.    However, those close to the current secretary general assert  that he will remain in his post and will run for a new term in  the coming conference. These people indicate that Nasrallah is  now focusing his efforts on consolidating his position, working  out basic points, and preparing the next program in order to  successfully join the conference, particularly on the level of  the party's new political rhetoric and defining its positions on  urgent regional and international issues such as the  "Gaza-Jericho" agreement and what is taking place in Yemen.    In the prior preparations for his new, yet old, position,  Nasrallah even formed both a new party Shura commission and a  Political Bureau body. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has learned that the  first draft of Hizballah's next Shura Council contains known  names, including deputy al-Hajj Muhammad Hunaysh, deputy al-Hajj  Muhammad Yaghi, al-Hajj Khalil Harb, Fu'ad Shakar, Shaykh  Muhammad Yazbik, Shaykh Nabil Qaduq, and Hashim Safiyy-al-Din in  addition to a group of Hizballah officials.    The draft of the Political Bureau's body was prepared to be  a  qualitative stride which Nasrallah would make. It has been  learned that he would try to appoint al-Hajj 'Abd-al-Halim 'Atwi  as official in charge of the Political Bureau, while keeping  'Ammar al-Musawi as deputy head, with Abu-Sa'id al-Khansa',  Nawwaf al-Musawi, Shaykh Tawfiq al-Miqdad, Shaykh Zuhayr Kinj,  deputy Khadr Tulays (if he agrees), al-Hajj Mustafa Qamar,  Shaykh Husayn Kurani, Shaykh Hatim Abu-Diyah, and others, as  members.    Nasrallah began to put the final touches on the two drafts  before sending two copies of them to the Iranian leadership for  the final opinion, remarks, and blessing. Nasrallah believes  that, in the next phase, priority should be given to  consolidating the party's status and internal structure,  especially in view of the current regional and international  arrangements, so that the party will be able to confront these  conditions--particularly the disarming of the resistance--that  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has set in his  shuttle tours.    In fact, Hizballah is now gravely concerned on various  levels  over passing safely through the phase of [Middle East] peace.  There is a consensus that the party would pay a price for any  breakthrough in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations, and that the  party is convinced that destroying its military machine, as a  minimum, is the most prominent U.S.-Israeli condition.  Nasrallah is also well aware that there will be no role for  resistance, and, thus, his military role after the achievement  of peace. This will definitely weaken the party, diminish its  luster, and perhaps terminate it if it does not begin to  reconsider its calculations and adapt to the developments.    In this regard, knowledgeable sources say that Nasrallah has  for a while been assessing the situation, and that he is  currently focusing his effort on moving the party into a new  phase which would enable it to remain on political map in  Lebanon within a democratic framework. Nasrallah is planning to  take advantage of the expected developments to enable Hizballah  to remain strong in the Lebanese political arena, being in  possession of huge financial resources supplied by its  investments and the institutions and companies that it has  established.    Evidently, the power struggle within Hizballah today  revolves  around these expected developments and ways of dealing with the  next phase. In this regard, it has been noted that Nasrallah's  opponents are taking advantage of Nasrallah's move toward a  "corrective movement" to launch a fierce campaign against him.  Thus, they take every chance to charge the present secretary  general of leading the party to the peace settlement, and that  all his efforts and moves are part of an attempt to enter the  "stage of Israeli peace even at the expense of the resistance."  They indicate that Nasrallah's course is in agreement with the  line of Iranian President Rafsajani, who has been attempting to  establish--and may have already established--secret relations  and contacts with the Americans and their allies in the region.  Those opponents go so far as to accuse the secretary general of  working to change the party's bylaws and amend certain posts to  modify the Hizballah bylaws following the fashion of leftist  Western parties.    Nasrallah's opponents say that his cards and intentions were  exposed during the previous organizational congress through the  game of deception he played against a number of the Shura  Council following his false promises.    The question is: Will Hizballah escape the dangers of an  internal split, or will it become like the other parties divided  into several wings? Those who have access to what is taking  place inside the party have noticed that Shaykh Subhi  al-Tufayli's moves and trends are supported on the regional  level and that he has become strong in this phase. He has money  and men and he was able to exploit the resentment created  against the Lebanese regime during the airport bridge incident.  He also exploited the issue of Hizballah's handing over of a  number of those wanted by the Lebanese state for carrying arms  during the al-Quds Day demonstration on the last Friday of  Ramadan.    Hasan Nasrallah or Subhi al-Tufayli?    The battle has not been decided yet because the future of  Hizballah will be decided in Tehran, the source of financial  support and the higher political tutelage. And whether the  decision will be in favor of Nasrallah's corrective movement or  al-Tufayli's coup is linked with deciding the matter between the  moderate current and the radical extremist current in Iran, with  deciding the new Iranian policy on the Middle East, and with the  final stand vis-a-vis the peace process. New surprises will  appear before next year. Until then, the battle will continue  within the Lebanese Hizballah Party. It seems so through the  meetings and preparations carried out by every party. It also  appears that the situation will escalate in the coming months.</p>

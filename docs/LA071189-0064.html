			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLDBERG ELECTED TO HEAD SCHOOL BOARD ON A 6-1 VOTE  </P> <P> Despite predictions of more peaceful times for the nation's second-largest  school district, Jackie Goldberg was elected president of the Los Angeles Board  of Education in a 6-1 vote Monday that showed some scars from the May teachers'  strike still remain.  </P> <P> At first, a celebratory mood marked the board's annual reorganization meeting  and inauguration for two reelected members and one newcomer, Mark Slavkin. But  the mood quickly turned tense as Rita Walters sharply criticized Goldberg and  refused to join the rest of the board in naming Goldberg president for the next  year.  </P> <P> Walters denounced a plan pushed by Goldberg to restructure salaries so that  teachers could earn as much as administrators with similar qualifications. That  would "punish" administrators, Walters charged. A task force is supposed to  study the issue later this year.  </P> <P> "Out of that concern for the total morale of this district, I cannot support  Miss Goldberg this morning," said Walters, who represents South-Central Los  Angeles and, as a result of last month's elections, is now part of a minority  faction on the board viewed as unfriendly to the teachers union.  </P> <P> A recent move by some principals to unionize shows that the district pays too  much attention to the teachers union, Walters said. She reiterated her  opposition to budget cuts made to help finance the 24% pay raises for teachers  called for in the three-year contract that ended the nine-day strike.  </P> <P> Goldberg later told reporters that Walters' comments represented "an enormous  misunderstanding of what I'm about" but said she and Walters could still work  together. Goldberg also said she would fight United Teachers-Los Angeles if a  union action hurt students but added that such an event was unlikely.  </P> <P> Last month, principals were given the same pay increases as teachers, but the  board argued bitterly before giving a 16% raise over two years to top  administrators. Goldberg favored raises for principals but not administrators.  </P> <P> The board presidency, which carries few special powers, usually is rotated  among senior board members, and election is often unanimous. Goldberg, who  considers herself the most liberal member of the seven-member board, is in her  second term representing Hollywood, downtown and the Wilshire corridor area.  </P> <P> Goldberg, 44, once taught in the Compton school district and now works for a  literacy program in Los Angeles. Her 14-year-old son attends a Los Angeles  district high school.  </P> <P> In a formal speech made Monday with her mother, a retired teacher, at her side,  Goldberg said she will push the district to become "more student centered."  </P> <P> She said she would like the board to concentrate on improvements in bilingual  education and programs for students in the first four years of schooling, along  with cutting the drop-out rate and creating "shared decision-making" councils  at all district schools. The councils -- composed of teachers, administrators  and parents -- will have a say over scheduling and discipline, among other  things, and their formation was a key issue in the strike.  </P> <P> As president, Goldberg succeeds Roberta Weintraub, the East San Fernando Valley  incumbent who gained a high profile during the strike. On the board for 10  years, Weintraub was sworn in Monday for a new four-year term.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Excuses  </P> <P> "There are no more excuses for any of us . . . ," Weintraub said. "This year,  we've got to see changes in the (student test) scores and changes in the  schools."  </P> <P> Also sworn in Monday were Julie Korenstein, the West San Fernando Valley  representative who won her first four-year term last month after serving on the  board for two years, and Slavkin, who defeated Westside incumbent Alan Gershman  in a bitterly fought race. The teachers union, trying to gain a friendly  majority on the board, had strongly supported Slavkin and Korenstein.  </P> <P> State Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) led Weintraub and Korenstein  through their oaths. Weintraub then gave the assemblywoman a large plaque,  bearing a school bell, in appreciation for Waters' help in mediating an end to  the teachers' strike. After he was sworn in by the board clerk, Slavkin said he  hoped for "a less acrimonious" environment on the board, although Walters  subsequent comments about Goldberg soon belied Slavkin's wishes.  </P> <P> At an outdoor reception afterward, teachers union Vice President Helen  Bernstein called Walters "a sad person and her comments made me sad."  </P> <P> At the board's first business meeting later in the day, further signs of  discord appeared. A central overseer panel for the school governing councils is  supposed to be formed by the end of the month, with half of its 24 members  appointed by the teachers union and the other half by the board. Monday's  agenda included a proposal to allow each board member to appoint a parent or  community member and the superintendent to appoint five other people.  </P> <P> The issue was postponed a week after Slavkin said he feared that the matter was  being moved too quickly and without enough discussion, and Walters said she  thought the proposed formula shortchanged parents.  </P></p>

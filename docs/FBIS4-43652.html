			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION news political editor] </F>   [Text] Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams today urged that  there should be no Republican tit-for-tat retaliation for the  Loughinisland massacre in which six Catholics died on Saturday  [18 June].    And he indicated that the long-awaited Sinn Fein response to  the Downing Street Declaration on peace for Northern Ireland  would be made within days.    Mr Adams was quoted on BBC Radio 4's The World at One as  calling for "calm and restraint" in the face of a "premeditated  attack aimed at deflecting those engaged in the peace process  from that process."    Earlier, he said: "Retaliation has never played a part in  the  IRA strategy." Such a notion had been proved to be totally wrong.    "Retaliation attacks ordinary Protestants and can play no  part in Republican strategy. I want to see an end to all armed  actions. I set my head and my face against any action similar  to this premeditated sectarian assault on people on the basis  that they were just Catholics."    Mr Adams said: "I would appeal to those I represent for calm  and restraint. This was a premeditated attack aimed to deflect  those engaged in the peace process from that process."    Asked if Sinn Fein would respond to the peace process in  the next couple of days, Mr Adams replied: "Absolutely. We will  not be deflected from our historic task by these actions. This  is the intention and the aim. We have already met on Saturday  and we had a positive meeting, a very good meeting, and are  reconvening within days."    He said they would be "democratising within our own  membership" their plans to push the peace process forward. He  promised that Sinn Fein would move "as speedily as possible."    Mr Adams added: "The IRA are not the only source of violence  here. What we need is all those armed factions, the British  army, allies and of course the IRA to be moved into  demilitarisation to enhance the peace process."    Mr Adams said: "This is the challenge facing us. We have  been reasonably successful in getting the main issues on the  agenda and focusing everyone -- the British Government, the  Dublin Government and the IRA as well as the Loyalists -- on the  need for peace. That is the challenge facing us and that is  what we will be doing. I hope the British Government has the  political will to move this situation on, and so we can all move  forward. Sinn Fein will not be found wanting," Mr Adams said.</p>

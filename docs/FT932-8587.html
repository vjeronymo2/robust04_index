			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: San Miguel lifted by lower costs LOWER interest charges enabled San Miguel, the Philippine food and beverage conglomerate to lift first-quarter profits to 617m pesos (Dollars 24.7m), Reuter reports from Manila. The 1993 first-quarter income was about 5 per cent higher than its year ago level of 589m pesos, the company said. Consolidated net sales firmed slightly to 13.6bn pesos from 13.4bn pesos. The company said a 34 per cent drop in interest costs as a result of declining interest rates helped it post higher profit in spite of lower income from operations. It was helped by an increased contribution from affiliates, particularly Nestle Philippines. San Miguel's income from operations eased 13 per cent to 1.3bn pesos in January to March largely as a result of a decline in sales volumes because of the effects of severe power shortages on the economy. The company said improved operating efficiencies, particularly in beer and soft drinks, cushioned the drop in sales volume.</p>

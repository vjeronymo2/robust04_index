			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Franc's new freedom fails to raise job hopes MOST French remain sceptical that last month's semi-float of European currencies gives Paris much scope to tackle the country's record unemployment, according to a Sofres poll to be published in Expansion magazine tomorrow. In what is the first French poll since the August 1 changes in the European monetary system to focus on policies, 53 per cent said they did not believe the widening of currency bands would allow France to start reversing the loss in jobs. Faith in monetary union also appears unshaken: 64 per cent believe the changes will merely delay a single currency; 12 per cent consider monetary union still on target, while 9 per cent think the project is dead.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Private creditors file debt suit against Brazil The Brazilian central bank has been named as a defendant in a suit by the Dart family of the US, Brazil's largest private creditor. The action, which was filed in New York on Tuesday, had been expected. It stems from the Dollars 49bn (Pounds 32bn) restructuring of Brazil's commercial bank debt in April. The Dart family, which holds about Dollars 1.4bn of Brazilian debt, was the only significant foreign creditor to reject the terms of the restructuring. It had threatened legal action against the deal on several occasions. The court papers show the Darts claiming Dollars 60m in interest payments which they allege fell due when the restructuring was completed but remain unpaid. Brazil does not dispute that some arrears are owed, but is pushing to negotiate further with the Darts and hopes they can be persuaded to join the restructuring package. The family is also seeking a court ruling of its right to 'accelerate' repayment of the total Dollars 1.4bn it holds. The Bank of Brazil, a commercial bank 51 per cent government-owned, was the only other significant creditor not to accept the restructuring, in relation to Dollars 1.6bn of debt. The Darts are claiming that the Bank of Brazil, as a government-controlled bank, is not an independent creditor. If the court agrees, the Darts will hold the required 50 per cent of the outstanding debt needed to call for an acceleration. A Brazilian government spokesman said the latest of several attempts to reach agreement with the Dart family over the restructuring had been made 15 days ago. The spokesman said the Darts' action would be defended 'vigorously", although the action did not imply that the latest offer would be withdrawn. The Brazilian government has 60 days to respond to the action.</p>

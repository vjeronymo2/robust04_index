			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metal prices rally from morning lows - Market report Base metals managed to move off their lows by the end of a generally uninspiring day's London Metal Exchange trading, although prices still finished lower. Three months delivery ALUMINIUM fluctuated around Dollars 1,300 a tonne for most of the afternoon, with speculative buying helping to prevent a serious downside move. COPPER never fully recovered from falling below a key chart level at Dollars 1,885, although the resulting stop-loss selling was not so heavy as to cause a serious breakdown. LEAD perked up during the final minutes of the after hours trading session, although it still ended Dollars 12 down. At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE lost nearly all the advance made in the morning on reports that the Brazilian government was prepared to help with the coffee sector's financing.

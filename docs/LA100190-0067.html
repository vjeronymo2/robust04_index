			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PATRIOTS HAVING TROUBLE ON THE FIELD, TOO;  </P> <P> AFC: O'BRIEN PASSES FOR 282 YARDS TO LEAD THE JETS TO 37-13 VICTORY OVER A TEAM  TRYING BLOCK OUT THE TURMOIL OVER SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES.  </P> <P> The black cloud over the New England Patriots got even darker Sunday.  </P> <P> A 37-13 rout by the New York Jets was piled on the turmoil over a female  reporter's claim she was sexually harassed by several Patriots players and  speculation that owner Victor Kiam was planning major management changes.  </P> <P> "It's tough to block it out," New England wide receiver Sammy Martin said.  </P> <P> But there was one bizarre bright spot for the Patriots: fewer than one-third of  the 36,724 spectators who filed into the stadium were still there to see the  dismal ending.  </P> <P> For the Jets, Ken O'Brien completed 19 of 29 passes for 282 yards and a  touchdown, Brad Baxter rushed for two touchdowns, Blair Thomas had his first  100-yard game, and Rob Moore caught nine passes for 175 yards, including a  69-yard score. Pat Leahy added field goals of 18, 24 and 46 yards.  </P> <P> It was easy for the Jets (2-2) to forget last Monday night's 30-7 loss to  Buffalo. It was impossible for the Patriots (1-3) to forget the uproar stemming  from the incident 13 days earlier involving Boston Herald reporter Lisa Olson.  </P> <P> The woes of New England mounted early as the Jets scored on their first  possession. Baxter's one-yard run capped an 11-play, 54-yard drive.  </P> <P> Baxter added a 28-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, making the score  31-6 after Michael Mayes' first NFL interception.  </P> <P> Four plays after Kyle Clifton intercepted a pass, Leahy kicked his 18-yard  field goal, increasing the margin to 34-6 with 1:36 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> After the first of Jason Staurovsky's two field goals, a 46-yarder, cut New  York's lead to 7-3, O'Brien and Moore hooked up on the 69-yard scoring play.  </P> <P> Staurovsky's 40-yard field goal made the score 14-6 with 5:48 left in the  second quarter. Leahy answered that with a 24-yarder.  </P> <P> The Jets got the ball back 1:22 before halftime. O'Brien threw a 36-yard  completion to Moore, taking the ball to the Patriots' 11. Three plays later,  Freeman McNeil's four-yard scoring run built the halftime lead to 24-6.  </P></p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Car makers to list prices for all of EC CAR MAKERS will have to publish comparative EC price-lists for selected new vehicles twice a year from next May, under a plan agreed with the European Commission. The plan - to be announced by the Commission next week - is aimed at helping consumers shop for car bargains across EC borders. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, believes it could also increase the pressure on manufacturers to bring EC car prices into line, and make it more difficult for car dealers to discriminate against foreign buyers. According to a survey published last month by Beuc, the European consumers' organisation, the price of certain new models can differ by more than 40 per cent between countries. Manufacturers point out that prices are mostly within the 12 per cent band recommended by the Commission. The Commission plan is not legally binding, but EC officials indicated yesterday that if car-makers do not co-operate they will risk losing their jealously guarded right to distribute cars through exclusive dealerships when the system comes up for review in mid-1995. Every manufacturer which sells cars in the Community will have to select a representative model from each part of its product range and publish the prices in 10 EC countries. The carmakers will also have to supply information about the price of five common options - anti-lock braking systems, air conditioning, right-hand drive, automatic gearbox and power steering - and details of warranty, roadside assistance options and delivery costs. Prices, published in May and November every year, will be shown both before and after tax, in Ecu and local currency. Comparative figures for Denmark and Greece - where car tax of more than 100 per cent distorts the selling price - will not be included. The Commission agreed to drop its original demand that manufacturers should supply information about all possible models and options on the grounds that it would be too time-consuming for manufacturers and confusing for consumers. Manufacturers are still likely to argue that realistic comparison is difficult because dealers in some countries are prepared to offer large discounts on the list price of certain models. However, they will also hope that by being more open about comparative prices they will stave off the abolition of their network of exclusive dealerships, which are exempt from normal EC competition rules until 1995. Sir Leon Brittan, who heralded the new price initiative in a speech to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in London last month, has recently taken action to end alleged abuses of the dealership system by Alfa Romeo and Citroen in Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>

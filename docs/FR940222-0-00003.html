			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A fourth commenter requests a change in the compliance time from 50 hours TIS to 180 days. This commenter believes that there will be a jam of airplanes in service shops, causing a possible parts shortage or forcing airplane owners/operators to utilize less qualified shops in order to meet the deadline. The FAA does not concur. Twin Commander has assured the FAA that there are adequate parts available for all repairs that could be required. In addition, the FAA has determined that there is an adequate number of certified maintenance shops available to accomplish the actions on all airplanes within the proposed compliance time. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A fifth commenter, the Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation, requests that the preamble of the proposal change to reflect that, of the 13 airplanes reported to have cracked spar caps, 12 were examined in detail and none had cracks exceeding the specified limits. The FAA concurs, and, because the entire preamble of the proposal is not repeated in the final rule action, the FAA is so noting this fact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of all available information including the comments referenced above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 439 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 168 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour (total labor cost of $9,240 per airplane). Parts cost approximately $1,300 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,627,060 ($10,540 per airplane). As previously discussed, 89 of the 439 affected airplanes have already accomplished the required actions. This reduces the cost impact of this AD upon U.S. operators from $4,627,060 to $3,689,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, if the required inspection reveals cracks or corrosion that exceeds a certain amount, replacing the spar cap will be required at a cost of approximately $100,000 per airplane, parts and labor included. An airplane affected by this AD could have a compliance cost as low as approximately $10,540 (labor + parts) if cracks or corrosion is not found during the inspection, and as high as approximately $110,540 (inspection and modification + spar cap replacement) if the operator replaces the spar cap. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on an expected average remaining operating life of 30 years per affected airplane, the annualized compliance cost would be: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If only inspecting the spar cap and wing rib at WS 39 and modifying at WS 39 are necessary: $10,540 &times; 0.8145 (capital recovery factor at a 7 percent interest rate) = $858 annualized cost; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A&bull;If replacing the spar cap is necessary: approximately $110,540 &times; 0.8145 (capital recovery factor at a 7 percent interest rate) = $9,003 annualized cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The required AD's from Dockets No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;26&hyph;AD (for Model 690B and No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;58 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD (for Models 685, 690, 690A, and 690B) will also affect certain airplanes included in this AD. The compliance costs of these other AD's will add to the cost discussed above. However, replacing the spar cap will only be required once, so the $100,000 replacement cost, if required, is a one-time action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 350 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by this AD that have not complied with Twin Commander SB No. 211, Revision 1, dated July 7, 1992, are owned according to the following breakdown: 60 by individuals, 2 by U.S. government agencies, 9 by states or local governments, and 279 by other entities. Twenty entities own more than one of the affected airplanes: one owns 7, one owns 5, another owns 4, and the other seventeen own 2 each. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

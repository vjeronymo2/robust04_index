			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In the western part of Rwanda,  which is under the control of the government forces, the arrival  of the French is welcomed with satisfaction. Jean Helen met  Jerome Bicamumpaka, the foreign minister of the Rwandan interim  government, in Gisenyi:    [Begin recording] [Bicamumpaka] Our government praises the  French initiative to mobilize the international community to  form an expedition force whose aim is to protect the threatened  Rwandan civilian population. We think that this operation falls  in line with the aim of establishing peace in Rwanda and  promoting a fair political compromise in Rwanda, which our  government has been trying to achieve for two and a half months  now. This operation will make an effective contribution to the  efforts aimed at establishing peace in Rwanda as soon as  possible.    If the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] once again refuses to  budge and cooperate with this force, we think this force should  have the means to make the RPF comply by force if necessary.    [Unidentified correspondent] That is to conduct itself as a  buffer force or deploy itself in RPF zones?    [Bicamumpaka] This force should absolutely be able to deploy  itself in both government and RPF zones because people under  threat are not only in our zone, but also in large numbers in  the RPF zone. [end recording] [passage omitted]    This intervention has given rise to mixed reactions in  Burundi, the neighboring country. The Burundian Foreign  Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo:    [Begin Ngendahayo recording] What its neighbor Burundi says  is that peace should be established in Rwanda and massacres  should be stopped. Concerning Operation Turquoise, Burundi has  never been officially consulted, either by France or by the two  belligerents. Now, in Burundi we say we have to observe strict  neutrality, that is as long as the two belligerents do not agree  on this French initiative, French troops and French military  equipment will not be allowed to transit through Burundi. But  we think that it is very important that everybody makes greater  efforts for peace and humanitarian aid for the sake of the  Rwandan people. [end recording]</p>

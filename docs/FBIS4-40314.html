			<p>BFN     [Text] In Chechnya the head of the opposition Provisional  Council has declared that the opposition in his republic does  not enjoy support from Moscow.    "Time will tell whom Moscow is going to deal with in the  future, Umar Avturkhanov told Interfax on Wednesday, but at the  moment political or economic support for the Chechen opposition  by Russia is out of the question."    He also denied reports that Ruslan Khasbulatov is the shadow  leader of the opposition and described them as groundless  inventions. "We ask him for advice in one way or other, because  he is also worried about the future of his people", Avturkhanov  said.    According to him, the delegation of the opposition began  talks with Russia with the hope of working out a draft bilateral  treaty and resolving several economic problems.    "We would want Russian federal government bodies to take the  Chechen question seriously, we want every official to know that  deciding about Chechen matters he decides about the Russian  state system", Avturkhanov said.</p>

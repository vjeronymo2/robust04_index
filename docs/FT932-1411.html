			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Memorial Service for Lord Ridley Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, and Gerald Malone, a deputy chairman, yesterday attended a memorial service for former cabinet minister Lord Ridley. Sir Norman later challenged Labour to disown Clive Soley, the MP who said Michael Heseltine met a Saudi prince before the 1992 election to discuss aid to the Tories. It was 'a baseless personal attack', Sir Norman said. Mr Heseltine is recovering from a heart attack. Report, Page 9</p>

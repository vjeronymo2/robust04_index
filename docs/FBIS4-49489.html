			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" by Tonny Chan] </F>   [Text] The government has brought in a senior Australian  official in what is being seen as an attempt to bolster the  traditional British style of the civil service against the  influence of China.    Australian civil servant John Hamilton is taking part in a  far-reaching overhaul of the bureaucracy.    His arrival comes as a battle rages between Britain and  China  over the loyalty of the territory's 180,000 civil servants in  the runup to China's takeover in 1997.    The overhaul, known as the Public Sector Reform (PSR)  program, will particularly affect civil servants with the  calibre to rise to the top of the service.    The government's top brass is said to be anxious that  mainland ethics and practices could become influential in the  civil service and take the place of the administrative culture  that is being built up to carry on after 1997.    The government has confirmed Mr Hamilton's appointment.    Before beginning his 13-month secondment on 10 January, Mr  Hamilton was assistant commissioner of the Australian Public  Service Commission for human resources management.    A government spokesman said Mr Hamilton was responsible for  "developing a systematic approach to performance appraisal,  training and career development" within the civil service and  was seconded for his solid human resource management background.    "Staff of the Civil Service Branch have previously visited  the Australian Public Service Commission," he said.    "(It was) considered the Australian experience in human  resource management would be a useful reference for Hong Kong in  the implementation of the PSR program."    A theme of the PSR is to recommend a civil service mechanism  that would uphold "human rights, openness and fairness".    A distinctive difference between Australia's public service  and that in Britain and Hong Kong is that in Australia, top  policy secretaries are employed on five-year contracts.    The [preceding word as published] enables them to forcefully  confront outside political pressure.    The Australian Consulate-General in Hong Kong said its  diplomats here were aware of Mr Hamilton's secondment, but its  press officer said she was unable to provide The Hongkong  Standard with further information.    The Australia Public Service Commission said simply that Mr  Hamilton's assignment was to look at Hong Kong's public service.    The Secretary for the Civil Service Michael Sze returned  from  a two-week visit to Australia on Sunday.    A local political columnist quoted sources as saying that he  had focused on how "fairness" was upheld in Australia's civil  service.    The theme of openness and fairness had been emphasised by  Governor Chris Patten in his rows with China.    A British parliamentary report recently called on the  government to form a human rights commission to keep a permanent  watch on human rights in the territory.    Beijing is worried Britain may use human rights to  internationalise Hong Kong after 1997. Members of the  Preliminary Working Committee sounded just such a warning on  Monday.    The territory's government vehemently denied the present  promotion mechanism in the civil service is unfair despite the  fact that Mr Hamilton has been asked to carry out a review.    A civil service spokesman also rejected the idea that  personal influence dominates the civil service promotion system.    He said there were clear guidelines including promotion  criteria specified in the civil service regulation which  promotion boards had to follow.    He said the boards comprised enough members from different  ranks to ensure that they fully understood the job requirement  and the candidates performance.    In cases within the jurisdiction of the Public Service  Commission, the boards recommendations had to be referred to the  commission for advice before they could be approved, he added.    "The system is a fair one and has adequate checks and  balances," the spokesman said.    He said the PSR program was aimed at improving the civil  service's efficiency and quality.</p>

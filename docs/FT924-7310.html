			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Barlow Rand hit by falling economy A SHARP deterioration in the South African economy during the second half of the year restricted earnings growth at Barlow Rand, the country's largest industrial company, to only 2 per cent in the year to September. Turnover rose by 10 per cent to R35.2bn (Dollars 11.78bn) from R32bn the year before, but the difficult trading conditions meant operating profits before interest advanced by only 5 per cent to R2.7bn from R2.6bn. Mr Warren Clewlow, chairman, described the year as 'difficult and challenging,' borne out by recent figures showing that the country's real gross domestic product fell at an annualised rate of 5.7 per cent during the September quarter. Barlows' annual turnover is equivalent to about 10 per cent of South African GDP. The sharp slowdown during the second half is evident in that earnings per share were 11 per cent up at the halfway mark, compared with 2 per cent for the year. The directors predicted in May that growth would slow during the second half. Looking at the group's divisional performance, the best performance came from food and pharmaceuticals despite the impact of the recession on consumer spending. Static volumes were offset by higher efficiencies and productivity gains. Mr Clewlow described business activity as 'severely depressed' in many of the sectors in the industry division, causing earnings to fall. Reunert performed strongly, and profits from information technology were up, but most of the wholly owned subsidiaries recorded lower profits. On the mineral resources side, earnings from continuing operations fell by 4 per cent - although Rand Mines' performance was not strictly comparable with 1991 - while Pretoria Portland Cement managed a marginal increase in earnings. Packaging subsidiary Nampak, the largest packaging company in the country, lifted pre-tax profits. Textiles group Romatex recovered from a poor 1991 to lift profits sharply. J. Bibby, the international arm of the group, produced 'satisfactory' results, a feature being the acquisition of the Caterpillar dealerships in Spain and Portugal. Taking into account the larger number of shares in issue following the issue of a scrip dividend in 1991, earnings per share rose by 2 per cent to 438 cents from 431 cents. The dividend for the year is being raised by 2 per cent to 173 cents a share from 170 cents.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / US Money and Credit: Treasury prices advance as inflation picture brightens AT 6.7 per cent, Treasury bond yields are once again close to their historical lows, and three factors are driving prices up and interest rates down. First, the inflation picture has brightened since the dark days of early 1993, when prices were rising at a rate of around 4 per cent per year. Recent data showed inflation slowing to nearer 3 per cent and all the latest indicators point to an economic recovery that should remain sluggish and relatively inflation-free. Second, the Federal Reserve has put on an excellent show of anti-inflationary fervour during the past two weeks. A series of well-placed, if occasionally clumsy, leaks may have enraged traditionalists at the Fed who prefer the central bank's policy positions to remain private, but they sent a clear and unequivocal message to the financial markets: the Fed stands ready to raise interest rates at the first hint of an upturn in inflation. Normally, the possibility of a Fed tightening would send bond yields sharply higher - and it did, earlier this month. But recently investors and dealers have come to take a more considered view of the Fed's unusually public musings. Now, they are relieved that the anti-inflation credibility of the Fed chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, has been restored. After all, it was only a few weeks ago the market was worrying that Mr Greenspan had become too familiar with the Clinton administration. Third, President Clinton's economic package continues to make its way through Congress and looks as if it will emerge with its central deficit-reducing features more or less intact. Admittedly, the bill only squeaked through the Senate on Thursday, thanks to the clinching vote of vice-president Gore - hardly a ringing endorsement of the President's economic policies. The Clinton package is important not only because it is the first serious attempt by the federal government to tackle its huge budget deficit. The economic plan is also expected to act initially as a brake on economic growth - something that even the Clinton administration admits is likely. This is good news for bond investors. Also, some analysts believe the package will ensure that interest rates remain low. Mr Maury Harris, chief economist at Wall Street securities house PaineWebber, is one of them. He believes the Fed will hold off from using higher interest rates to slow inflationary growth because tax rises and spending cuts will do the job for them. Mr Harris says: 'Considering the likelihood of a more restrictive fiscal policy in the form of higher taxes and some spending restraint, maintaining the 3 per cent Federal Funds rate probably will be the most sensible course of action for the central bank at its August and September meetings.' Moreover, 'if the tempo of reported economic activity and inflation picks up a bit in June from the very modest May pace, it would not make sense this year to try reigning in growth with higher interest rates when more taxes and some federal spending restraint are just around the corner.' Mr Harris need not worry, if the forecasts for this week's economic data are to be believed. Economists are predicting the May leading indicators and single-family home sales (both out tomorrow) will be flat or lower, that May manufacturing orders (Wednesday) will be down 0.8 per cent, and that June unemployment (Friday) will be 7.0 per cent, up from 6.9 per cent in May. If the economic forecasts prove correct and the Clinton package stays on schedule to be passed by Congress in August, then expect bond yields to come down further over the next few weeks, setting new record lows in the process.</p>

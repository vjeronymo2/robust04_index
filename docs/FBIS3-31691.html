			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Michal Strak, the head of the Council of Ministers  office, commenting on Lech Walesa's strong reaction to the  Sejm's rejection of the presential draft laws regarding the  so-called citizens' initiative on the Constitution, said that  the president's officials had prepared this initiative badly and  no one from the Belweder had discussed the draft with the Polish  Peasant Party's parliamentary floor group.    Strak was speaking at a news conference in Gdansk. Earlier,  Minister Strak held a meeting with students--members of the  Political Ideas Club [Klub Mysli Politycznej]. During this  meeting, he said, among other things, that his favorite hero was  General Kutuzov, who, he said, slept during political and  wartime debates but always woke up at the right moment.</p>

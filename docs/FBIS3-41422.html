Foreign and domestic studies show that airborne pollutants  from China account for 30 percent to 50 percent of the acid rain  that falls upon Korea and Japan, and Seoul signed environmental  protection pacts with Tokyo and Beijing in June and October last  year, respectively, to improve environmental cooperation with  its neighbors.    No Chae-sik, president of the Korea Environmental Technology  Research Institute, has proposed to President Kim Yong-sam that  there be strict examination of pollutants from China as research  by domestic and foreign scholars shows that China accounts for  30 percent of Korea's air pollution.    Sim Shang-ku, senior research scientist of the Environment  Research Center in the Korea Institute of Science and Technology  (KIST), says recent research by Japan's Central Research  Institute for Electric Power Industries shows that at least 50  percent of the materials causing acid rain in Japan are from  China.    The Japanese institute published the results of its research  on Chinese pollutants in November 1992. It traced the roots of  sulfureted ions, which cause acid rain, observed at 20 measuring  points in Japan and found that 50 percent of the ions were from  China, 15 percent from South Korea and the remainder from Japan.    Professor Kim Chong-uk of Seoul National University's  Graduate School of Environmental Study said in a paper last year  that the sulfurous acid gas produced in Beijing and two other  cities and 14 provinces on China's east coast has a great effect  on the Korean peninsula.    ``About 92 percent of the sulfurous acid gas from China  becomes acid rain while the remaining 8 percent affects the  earth in the form of gas,'' he wrote. ``Shandong and Liaoning  Provinces, where factories are clustered, especially affect this  peninsula very much.''    If the wind blows from China, the acidity of the rain  falling  on Paengnyong island off the west coast reaches PH 5.0, he said.    South Korea is studying exactly how much sulfurous acid gas  and acid rain is coming from China, and how much damage they  cause.    Seeking precise data, the National Institute of  Environmental  Research will begin a three-year examination of air pollutants  blown from China and acid rain, using planes, from spring.  [sentence as received]    Professor Yi Kyong-chae of Seoul City University says that  acid rain appeared only in Seoul and some industrial areas until  three to four years ago. But these days, acid rain also falls  in rural areas, including Kwangneung in Kyonggi Province and  west Kangwon Province.    ``Unless the government devises countermeasures against acid  rain caused by pollutants coming from China as soon as possible,  most of South Korea's pine trees will suffer irreparable  damage,'' Yi says.    The reason for China's acid rain is that 76 percent of its  total energy comes from burning coal, which contains a lot of  sulfur. In 1991, China discharged 16.22 million tons of  sulfurous acid gas into the atmosphere, about 15 times as much  as South Korea.    China made rapid economic progress in 1992 and 1993, and the  consumption of coal, of which it has an enormous amount, soared.    Seoul National University's Graduate School of Environmental  Study expects that until 2022, when China's per capita gross  national product (GNP) will reach 4,000 U.S. dollars, the amount  of sulfurous acid gas will keep increasing.    In contrast, the sulfurous acid gas generated in Korea has  been dropping since 1990, when desulfurization facilities and  clean energy were introduced by industry.    As time passes, the damage Korea suffers from Chinese  pollution will grow, according to researchers.    To reduce the pollution from China, the Environment Ministry  has held three Northeast Asian environment conferences, but  China appears reluctant to do anything about its emissions lest  economic growth suffer and says that it lacks the capital and  technology to deal with the problem.    In Europe, where 50 percent of airborne pollutants migrate  across national boundaries, 33 countries signed the convention  on transboundary air pollutants in 1979.    Canada and the United States concluded an agreement to  sharply reduce air pollutants causing acid rain in 1990.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Brothers' reunion is on the cards: A look at the progress that has been made towards healing a four-year-old rift THEY DIDN'T say yes and they didn't say no. But delegates to the annual conference of the Trades Union Congress made clear this week that they are ready to make at least some of the compromises necessary for the readmission of the EETPU electricians and thereby reunification of the trade union movement. The likelihood is that by the time they meet again next year, the EETPU will be back in the TUC and one of the most damaging splits in the labour movement will be over. Nevertheless, there are some tough negotiations ahead and it is just possible that the AEEU, formed last year through the merger of the EETPU and AEU engineering workers, engineers, will end up outside the TUC. The TUC general council resolution agreed merely to set up a framework for negotiations on the AEEU's affiliation. Several unions, including the Prison Officers' Association and the Ucatt construction workers, have strong grievances against the EETPU. The electricians have a long tradition of going their own way. Mr Paul Gallagher, their new general secretary, repeated yesterday that he has still to make up his mind about whether he will recommend affiliation to members next year. His executive colleagues at the AEU - the two former unions are still run largely as separate organisations - believe he wants to be back in the TUC club. Even so, he has frequently questioned whether it would be worth the AEEU paying the Pounds 1m TUC affiliation fees, and some actions he has sanctioned as general secretary seem to indicate indifference. Even after the EETPU merged with the AEU, it was involved in merger negotiations with Cabin Crew 89, infuriating the TGWU general workers, from which the airline workers in Cabin Crew 89 split three years ago. The merger talks were abandoned after the intervention of Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of both the AEU and AEEU. Mr Laird's attitude is that the EETPU must behave as if it were a TUC affiliate after the formation of the AEEU in May, and that means not taking members from other unions. The remaining obstacles to negotiations arise because of the EETPU's recruitment of other unions' members prior to the merger. Controversy over the issue which led to the EETPU's expulsion - failure to withdraw from two single-union deals - seems to have died down. More difficult is the issue of members of other unions the EETPU has recruited since its expulsion. The Prison Officers' Association reckons that it has lost about 200 members to the Prison Service Union, set up four years ago by former POA officials. Mr David Evans, POA general secretary, says the PSU undermines its negotiating position with the Home Office. 'We want our members back,' he says. Ucatt adopts a similar stance on former members recruited by the EETPU during the past year, after its decision to hire 12 Ucatt officials. Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt general secretary, estimates that there are at least 3,000 former members involved. 'The EETPU could not have recruited them if it had been in the TUC,' he says. 'We want the EETPU to dismantle its construction section and we want our members back.' In the coming negotiations, both the Bridlington arrangements, which cover inter-union disputes, and the government's proposed legal changes will work in the AEEU's favour. Even as presently constituted, the Bridlington arrangements cannot be used to force unions to hand over members to other organisations. However, the TUC has on some occasions told a union to cede members when it considers another union has a more legitimate claim to them. That is likely to become more difficult, perhaps impossible, after the government introduces legislation allowing individuals to join the union of their choice. Members excluded against their wishes may be able to take their case to an industrial tribunal. The legislation is unlikely to be in force before next April, however, when members of the AEEU are due to vote on TUC affiliation. Some unions will want at least some concessions from the EETPU. They may be unwilling to endorse a deal by which the electricians remain intact. Difficult though all these issues will be, the pressure for a deal is enormous and, theoretically, union leaders should have the skills to conclude one. As one general council member said this week: 'You have to remember that most of us made our reputations through our negotiating abilities.' The trouble is, that was also true in 1988 when the EETPU was expelled.</p>

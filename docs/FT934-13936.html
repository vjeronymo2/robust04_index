			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome advances The halting of supplies in Japan of Usevir, a herpes and shingles treatment that is the only licensed rival to Wellcome's Zovirax, added to positive sentiment surrounding the UK company. The suspension of Usevir, marketed by US group Bristol-Myers Squibb, came after the deaths of three patients. One analyst said that although it was only used in severe cases, as against the more generally used Zovirax, its troubles are bound to buoy the fortunes of both Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. And it will also further focus investors' eyes on Wellcome's conference in New Orleans at the end of this week during which the company will reveal test data for herpes treatment drug Valaciclovir - the rival to SmithKline's Famciclovir. Another boost for drugs stocks came via good results from US company Merck, thought to show a positive trend in the market. Wellcome rose 10 to 766p and SmithKline 'A' firmed 2 to 405p. Glaxo gained 12 at 681p and Medeva put on 4 at 123p. A smaller move came for Smith &amp; Nephew, which gained  3/4 at 138 1/4 p. However, the rise goes against a downward trend triggered by results a couple of months ago. Some of the investor interest in the tightly traded stock was put down to good results from US Surgical, which shares many of Smith &amp; Nephew's markets. Turnover in environmental services group Rentokil had risen to a hefty 76.7m shares by the close after SG Warburg, the company's broker, placed two large blocks of shares. Danish investment group Sophus Berendsen sold a block of 29m shares, reducing its stake to around 52 per cent, although it said it would not sell any more in the next year, while KG Anker-Petersen Will Trust sold 11m shares. Warburg was understood to have bought the stock at 202p and placed the majority of it with institutions at 204p. Rentokil settled a net 2 lighter at 209p. The wave of optimism for a cut in German interest rates brought a bounce to RMC and Redland. Interest in RMC may also benefit from a trip later this week for analysts and investors to some of its German operations. Forecasts remain positive in Germany for both companies irrespective of interest rate cuts, according to one analyst. While prospects for development in the west of the country may recede, they will be matched by opportunities in the east. RMC has a strong interest in Berlin which will be rewarded if the government's base is moved from Bonn. RMC moved ahead 10 to 816p and Redland added 16 at 545p. The buoyant Hong Kong equity market continued to benefit several stocks in the UK market. These included HSBC, which brushed aside news of a Pounds 172m court judgment against its merchant bank subsidiary Samuel Montagu. The shares closed 7 ahead at 763p. TSB put on 3 1/2 at 221 1/2 p, with Strauss Turnbull said to have recommended the stock. Water issues, among the best performers in recent sessions, were subject to mild profit-taking, Welsh Water receding 8 to 646p. NatWest reiterated its preference for the Recs over the waters, arguing that regulatory worries in the former were less and yield attractions better. The broker particularly likes South Wales, up 5 at 638p in a strong electricity sector. Weekend press comment inflamed more interest in the telecoms sector, Vodafone climbing 12 1/2 to 571 1/2 p and Cable and Wireless 7 to 974p. Fears of even worse news from construction and engineering group Trafalgar House when it reports figures in December led to a 9 per cent slide in the shares after it surprised the market with some disappointing news and a Pounds 400m convertible preference rights issue. Trafalgar not only announced its third cash call in the last two years, but also said there would be further property writedowns, and warned that full-year figures would be 'somewhat short' of current market expectations. Dealers rushed to sell the shares and they dropped 11 1/2 to 85p in heavy trading which brought volume of 16m. Among a welter of profits downgrades, Strauss Turnbull moved its estimate for the year to September 1993 from a loss of Pounds 65m to a deficit of Pounds 170m. Interest in Shell Transport was largely put down to the performance of Royal Dutch on foreign markets. The former's shares moved ahead 11 1/2 to 700 1/2 p in turnover of 3.6m. Standard &amp; Poor's reaffirmation of its rating on Lasmo had little effect on the shares, unchanged at 141p in healthy volume of 4.3m. S &amp; P similarly confirmed its rating on Enterprise Oil, which continues to enjoy market favour and appreciated 3 to 490p. In a dull leisure sector, Forte recovered last week's losses on the back of its well-received deal to manage the Ciga group of hotels. The shares improved 4 to 225p, although turnover was a below par 1.4m. Caterer Compass Group was hit by talk that rival Gardner Merchant was suggesting that tighter margins were being experienced in the industry. One seller sold 250,000 shares at around 569p. The stock closed 12 off at 570p. Euro Disney's announcement of 950 job losses and possible further management changes helped the shares edge forward 10 to 620p. Talk of good sales and firm margins again circulated around Marks and Spencer and the shares firmed a penny to 405p, with Hoare Govett lifting its current profits forecast from Pounds 825m to Pounds 860m. Speculation that next month's UK Budget would include defence cuts weakened related stocks. The day's casualties included engineering group Vickers, 4 cheaper at 152p, Vosper Thornycroft, also 4 lower, at 687p, and VSEL, which retreated 10 to 835p.</p>

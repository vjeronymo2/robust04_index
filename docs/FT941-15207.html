			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / West puts faith in central bank Western banks are relying on the Russian central bank to use its discretionary powers to spare them the worst effects of a presidential decree reversing the terms of their licences. Braving uncertainty over the rights of western banks in the wake of the decree, Citibank on Friday became the first to open a subsidiary in Moscow. Mr William Rhodes, Citicorp vice-chairman, said the bank planned to ask the central bank to endorse its decision. 'If there are any doubts, we will check with the central bank,' he said, confirming that this would include seeking direct permission for operations curtailed by the decree. By the end of this year Citibank plans to open another subsidiary in St Petersburg, the country's second city which has ambitions of taking over from Moscow as the Russian banking capital. The presidential decree, issued ahead of last month's parliamentary poll to appease Russian bankers who fear foreign competition, said that banks which had received full banking licences but which were more than 50 per cent western-owned, could not begin to serve Russian residents until January 1996. This, in theory, restricts them to offshore banking functions - such as those set out in the more limited licence granted to Bank Austria's Moscow branch. Last year the central bank gave full banking licences to a dozen western banks in its bid to attract investment and to improve the performance of its own banks by exposing them to competition and know-how. Dr Michael Franz, head of Bank Austria in Moscow, the first western branch in the Russian capital, vouches for the central bank's ability to assist western banks. He says the central bank has already used discretionary powers to allow him to undertake operations not set out in his original licence. He has, for example, been granted permission to take deposits from joint ventures, and recent central bank regulations allowing non-residents to open rouble bank accounts let him conduct operations in roubles, despite the stipulations of his licence.</p>

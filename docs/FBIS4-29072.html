			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yi Tong-sik from Beijing] </F>   [Text] The Chinese Government has released an official  statement that it is watching developments regarding North  Korea's withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA].    In an explanation of its government's position released 15  hours after North Korea declared its withdrawal from the IAEA,  the Chinese Foreign Ministry disclosed that North Korea did not  officially notify the Chinese Government, stressing that it is  watching with deep interest developments related to North  Korea's nuclear issue. Such a comment by the Chinese Government  hints that North Korea declared its withdrawal from the IAEA  without prior consultations with the Chinese and that China is  failing to establish a diplomatic response.    China's XINHUA News Agency only carried a brief report on  North Korea's statement 14 hours after Pyongyang issued the  statement, quoting North Korea's NODONG SINMUN.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Job-cutting charge hits Xerox XEROX, the US document processing group, yesterday reported a 61 per cent drop in fourth-quarter net income as it took a Dollars 175m pre-tax charge against earnings to cover the cost of cutting 2,500 white-collar jobs. The group reported net income of Dollars 91m, or 73 cents a share, compared with Dollars 235m, or Dollars 2.27, in the same period of 1990. Last year's figures included a Dollars 50m gain from the sale of its South Pacific operations and Dollars 12m of losses from discontinued operations. Revenues in the latest quarter dipped from Dollars 5bn to Dollars 4.9bn. Xerox announced the Dollars 175m charge in December, saying it would eliminate the jobs to create a more efficient, flatter, customer-responsive organisation. Revenues from its document processing business increased 3 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with 1990, excluding the South Pacific sale and currency translations. Fourth-quarter income was Dollars 188m, against Dollars 180m, excluding special items. The group's insurance and other financial service operations produced fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 47m, down from Dollars 68m a year ago. For 1991, Xerox reported net income of Dollars 454m, or 3.91 a share, compared with Dollars 235m, or Dollars 2.27 a share in 1990. Revenues totalled Dollars 17.8bn, compared with Dollars 18bn the previous year. Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, said Xerox had become a more customer-responsive organisation in 1991. It had also increased market share as sales of lower-end, less expensive office equipment continued to show good growth throughout the year. However, the weak economy had hit sales of higher-end products to larger customers. He said that despite a weak property and casualty insurance market, profits from financial services had been relatively stable.</p>

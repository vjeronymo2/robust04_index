			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Letter: Self-interest and ethics in long term Sir, Britain's new director of public prosecutions, Mrs Barbara Mills, tells us that low ethical standards in business will not generate long-term business advantage ('DPP chief suggests safeguards for companies', April 29). Mrs Mills is seeking to promote ethical behaviour through the fear of commercial retribution - much as Mr John Patten, the education secretary, recently offered the super-commercial consideration of divine retribution for bad social behaviour. This line of thinking tends to confuse the ethical with the self-interested. If a manufacturer refrains from selling elite torture equipment because he thinks his main conventional business would suffer, he is acting from self-interest. If the manufacturer avoids the torture business because he thinks it is wrong to harm people, then he is acting according to ethical principle. Grounding ethics in nothing but (long-term) self-interest would mean that, if profitability conditions changed, our manufacturer would be right to switch to torture equipment.

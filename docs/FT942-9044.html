			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / LDP to try to unseat Japanese government The likelihood of change of Japanese government this summer increased yesterday when the main opposition party confirmed it would seek to bring down the minority administration. Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic party, warned Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata he must resign or face a no-confidence vote as soon as the budget for this year clears parliament. The budget, delayed by an LDP boycott and the power struggle unleashed by last month's resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the former prime minister, is now expected to pass parliament by mid-July. Mr Kono's warning suggests for the first time that a previously undecided LDP is ready for an election. Until yesterday, the Social Democratic party, the second largest opposition group, was the only main party to call for an early poll. The SDP hopes to regain some of the seats it lost in last July's election, while the LDP seeks a comeback, after the end last summer of its 38 years in power. 'You should be fully aware that you do not have the mandate of the people. This abnormal state of affairs must be normalised,' said Mr Kono yesterday. The LDP and SDP together can easily outvote Mr Hata's five-party alliance. The government commands just over 190 votes in the 511-seat lower house. If he loses a no-confidence vote, Mr Hata must resign or call an election.</p>

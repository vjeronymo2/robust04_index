			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1990 BOOK PRIZE WINNER: POETRY;  </P> <P> ON JOHN CADDY'S 'THE COLOR OF MESABI BONES'  </P> <P> Iron birthed red, torn from the  </P> <P>  earth,  </P> <P> and miners and towns took its  </P> <P> colors and ways, reds of dust and  </P> <P>  rust,  </P> <P> of fresh blood and dried, of SCAB  </P> <P> slashed in paint across a store, of  </P> <P>  Indians  </P> <P> who would not disappear, of the  </P> <P>  Klan's fires,  </P> <P> Wobblies, union bombings, socialist  </P> <P>  Finns --  </P> <P> the only unred the blacklist.  </P> <P> John Caddy, here in the second stanza of his title poem, "The Color of Mesabi  Bones," (Milkweed Editions) gives a rich and grim description of the Mesabi  Range of his childhood. The Mesabi Range in northeastern Minnesota is a  100-mile string of mining towns about five miles apart from one another. The  common link between these towns, which led to their development, was iron-ore  mining. The color of bones found in the Mesabi Range is the color of leaching  iron ore. Red.  </P> <P> Sitting over coffee in a restaurant beneath his publisher's offices in  Minneapolis, John Caddy explains, "What is perhaps confusing is that the Mesabi  Range sits next to a mountain Range -- one of the oldest ranges in the east,  some three billion years old. The mountain range is called the Giant's Range.  Mesabi means 'sleeping giant,' and the name comes from the Ojibwa Indian tribe,  natives of the region."  </P> <P> There are no mountains along the Mesabi Range, only mining towns. It was in  Hibbing where John Caddy was born. (The Zimmermans had a hardware store in  Hibbing. Their son, Bob, who grew up with John Caddy, later changed his name to  Bob Dylan.)  </P> <P> Caddy is a third-generation native of the Mesabi Range, a descendant of  hard-rock miners from Cornwall. His father was a mining engineer. Caddy's  collection of poems is written from the experience of growing up in a tough  family in, at times, a very tough community, and in a harsh region. There is a  bittersweet appreciation for the place and the people of his youth that emerges  from his work.  </P> <P> There are poems and prose sketches about family: Grandma, Grandpa, a harsh  father looked upon in terror as "the Giant" who beats his bewildered son. The  boy perseveres. Perseverance comes naturally.  </P> <P> Caddy's poems revolve about his community in the Mesabi. "Mining towns have  always been either famine or . . . boom. Nothing in between. And when there's a  boom there's often a strike, which means famine again. Economic fortunes are  constantly ebbing," says Caddy reflectively.  </P> <P> A sense of history is gleaned through reading the collection. Wobblies were  members of the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World), a socialist movement  strong in the mining communities and the lumbering communities that felled the  forests before the miners stripped the land. (The derivation of the term  Wobblie given to me by a bartender in Minnesota is that the Chinese who worked  in lumbering and mining mumbled and mispronounced "workers of the world,"  transforming it into Wobblie.)  </P> <P> The Ku Klux Klan was active in Minnesota during Caddy's youth. In his poem  "Mine Town: Trick or Treat," Caddy writes of a young boy who secretly explores  the forbidden drawers of his grandmother's dresser and discovers the white  robes and hood of the Klan. The child ponders their purpose: "Sorcerer's robes,  costumes for grownups, magic -- imagines them at the Halloween party. Exciting  new pictures of Grandpa and Gram." When caught, he is admonished. The  experience signifies nothing to the child, but recalled years later, it brings  the stunning revelation of what the garments were.  </P> <P> One of the most touching pieces in the book, "The Travel Collection," tells the  story of a young boy who secretly collects free pamphlets through the mail from  tourism offices. In his room, he pores over the brochures, dreaming of these  places: "New Mexico, Land of Enchantment. Kachinas. Pueblos. Color. Space.  Florida orange groves. Magic Tourist countries: Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad. The  Caribbean. Lesser Antilles. Windwards. White sands, ocean blues, pale to azure  to green."  </P> <P> One day, while collecting on his paper route, the boy confesses to a woman that  he has a hobby, a travel collection. She calls her aged husband to the door,  exclaiming "the paperboy collects the same thing you do!" A toothless man in  long johns and overalls, who must have lived his entire life in his house next  to the mining foundry and pit, insists on showing the boy his collection. "He  reads the headlines to the boy, sounding out the hard words: Barbados. Montana.  Antigua. Tehuantepec. Kachinas. Land of Enchantment."  </P> <P> "Children fascinate me," muses Caddy. "Their job is to survive, that's their  only job. What they don't need to become self-aware about, they don't. You see  in 'Mining Town: Trick of Treat!' it all means nothing to the child at the  time. Then years later, bang! In the piece 'The Travel Collection,' the boy --  who in this case is me in my youth -- doesn't make anything of this old man.  But look at the two."  </P> <P> Caddy notes that most of the reviews of his new collection have stressed the  violence of his book, and comments that he hopes the book has a greater range  than that, which indeed it does. "One of my reasons for writing these poems was  to explore why I don't hit my kids, as my father and his father did. How did  that happen? Because these kinds of roles are passed on for generations. But as  it developed, I got interested in how boys develop in that particular context  and in those times. How do boys turn into halfway decent people?"  </P> <P> "Everybody who writes about family gets in trouble," Caddy reflects in closing.  "My father just died this summer. I didn't feel comfortable publishing this  book until it was discovered that my mother has Alzheimer's. The man in this  book, my father, is a man in his late 20s and early 30s. God help us if we are  all judged by who we are in our 20s and 30s, right? My father changed a lot. He  was a good grandfather, just a horrible father."  </P> <P> When asked how quickly the young boy who grew up collecting travel brochures  got out of the mining regions of Minnesota, the author replies: "I left Mesabi  right after high school. But in many ways I never left. What has always  fascinated me about Mesabi is that it's surrounded by wilderness. I spent a lot  of my childhood in those woods and that wilderness. I never left those woods, I  left the towns."  </P> <P> Nominees In Poetry  </P> <P> THE COLOR OF MESABI BONES by John Caddy (Milkweed)  </P> <P> GRACE NOTES by Rita Dove (W.W.

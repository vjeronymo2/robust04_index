			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY SCHOOLS CHIEF MAY FACE REELECTION TEST  </P> <P> A Whittier College education professor, using a novel appeal to area school  district superintendents, is quietly testing the waters for a bid to unseat  controversial longtime Orange County Supt. of Schools Robert D. Peterson.  </P> <P> The professor, John F. Dean of Newport Beach, last week sent a sharply worded  letter to the superintendents of every Orange County school district, asking  for their support and advice on a possible race against Peterson, a frequent  target of county grand jury management investigations who recently announced  his intention to seek a seventh term.  </P> <P> "Dr. Robert Peterson has announced that he will seek a seventh term, and many  of us had hoped he would not run again," Dean, 63, said in his letter. "As long  as Bob is at the helm, Orange County schools will never have the qualified  leadership we need desperately."  </P> <P> If Dean proceeds with his campaign plans, a decision he said he will make  within the next month or so, he likely will face an uphill struggle.  </P> <P> Peterson, who is paid $98,663 annually to supervise the $60-million-a-year  operation, has held the superintendent's post for more than 20 years. Although  he often has run into controversy over management of the department, he has  deftly turned back several attempts to push him from office. A school principal  in Santa Ana before winning election as superintendent in 1966, Peterson hasn't  faced serious opposition in more than a decade.  </P> <P> Recognizing that he would enter the race as an underdog, Dean said he hopes a  unique plank in his campaign platform will strengthen his chances. Besides  announcing his possible candidacy, Dean's letter also proposes changing the  nature of the superintendent's post, making it an appointed position rather  than an elected one.  </P> <P> "I may well be the only political candidate in history pledged to eliminate his  job," Dean said in his letter.  </P> <P> County grand juries have recommended the same thing -- one even suggested  abolishing the county Education Department altogether. But county voters have  twice rejected the idea.  </P> <P> Dean, chairman of Whittier's education department for 19 years, said Tuesday  that he has received responses from three area superintendents so far: "Two of  them urged me to go ahead, and one warned me that Peterson can't be beat."  </P> <P> Peterson, 69, has leaned on his solid support from some conservative backers to  easily rebuff challengers over the years. But while he has built a strong  political base, Peterson has also irritated some district superintendents, who  complain that area schools do not receive enough services from the county  office. Some also grouse that Peterson has not kept abreast of developments in  education.  </P> <P> Privately, many district superintendents, who are appointed by their school  boards, say they support changing the county superintendent's post to an  appointed one.  </P> <P> An education consultant hired by a 1986 grand jury found what it called  "universal criticism" of the county department among local school districts.  That report -- which also said the county department failed to communicate with  local districts, ran an expensive videotape operation that was used  infrequently and mismanaged other functions -- suggested that the  superintendent be appointed rather than elected.  </P> <P> In an interview Tuesday, Peterson said he was surprised by Dean's exploratory  challenge, but confidently predicted that it would not topple him from office.  </P> <P> "He would be swimming upstream," Peterson said, adding that he expects to spend  about $60,000 on his reelection campaign. He predicted it would cost any  opponent twice that just to establish comparable name recognition.  </P> <P> Dean, who worked as a public school administrator in Newport Beach for 20 years  before moving to Whittier College, agreed with Peterson's assessment.  </P> <P> "It's going to take a lot of money. And I would guess that 100,000 is about  right," he said, adding that he will explore fund-raising possibilities in the  coming weeks before making up his mind about the campaign.  </P></p>

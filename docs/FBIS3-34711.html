			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq </F> by Dan Scemama "this afternoon in the television studios" --  recorded]    [Excerpt] [Scemama] We open the interview with the chief  of staff with a question about the realities of the last 24  hours. Since the signing of the agreement in Cairo, Naftali  Sahar and Ilan Sudri have been murdered by terrorists.    [Baraq] We must look reality in the eye. In view of the  fact that thousands of Palestinians have employee-employer,  buyer-seller, or service supplier-receiver relationships within  the boundaries of Israel, no police force, security service, or  army can technically prevent the physical ability to raise a  knife. We will do our best to have good control, and I am sure  that the Israel Police and the Shin Bet will do their utmost.  Ultimately, nevertheless, some of the responsibility lies with  the Israeli people.    Today, we are still responsible for providing a livelihood  and jobs to the inhabitants of Gaza. That is why we must allow  them to enter Israel. I hope not to get into a situation where  in the wake of similar incidents we are forced to close off  Gaza. Conditions will change once an agreement is reached. In  my opinion, if workers from Gaza murder Israelis within the  boundaries of Israel, they may very well not be allowed to come  in.    [Scemama] Are you saying that this could be a sanction?  Will we simply bar workers from entering Israel?    [Baraq] I am stating my opinion. At the moment, we as a  state are responsible for them and we must provide them jobs.  If and when an agreement is reached and they become the  responsibility of the Palestinian authority -- if some of them  take advantage of the right to work in Israel to murder their  employers or the right to travel by taxi to murder its driver --  it is my assessment that this could lead us to the conclusion  that such a situation can no longer go on. In my opinion, the  very realization that such a possibility exists will make them  have second thoughts and, perhaps, reduce such incidents.  Otherwise, we will have to make some decisions.    [Scemama] How about Israelis who live in settlements in Gaza  or Israelis driving in the Gaza Strip? Does this agreement  satisfy you? In your view, can this agreement provide security  for Israelis traveling on the roads or living in the Gaza Strip?    [Baraq] A great deal was achieved in the agreement. On the  other hand, many points remain to be worked out -- and I suppose  will be worked out within the next few weeks in Taba and in  Cairo -- before we can sign the final agreement for  implementation. A great deal was achieved in that the  settlements are recognized as one bloc surrounded by a security  circle rather than individually. The agreement recognizes our  responsibility for Israeli traffic on the roads, including the  right to carry out independent Israeli action on the roads and  in their immediate proximity. And, of course, it recognizes our  responsibility for external security. These three points, which  were recognized in principle by the Palestinians, must now be  translated into particulars for implementation.    [Scemama] Sir, today there are undercover units, Shin Bet,  IDF [Israel Defense Forces], and Border Police troops in the  midst of Arab population centers. What will prevent an Arab  terrorist from setting out from Khan Yunus, approaching a  settlement fence, opening fire, and hurting people, then fleeing  back to this Arab town?    [Baraq] Within a radius of several hundred meters from a  settlement -- that is, within a distance from which he can  effectively open fire at the settlement -- he will come up  against the IDF which will be in charge of security. Outside  this radius, in the area controlled by the Palestinians, we  expect the Palestinian police force to act effectively long  before terror attacks and long after terror attacks where the  perpetrators are not killed or wounded in the course of the  attack.    [Scemama] Can we place our confidence in such a future  Palestinian police force?    [Baraq] The agreement we are working on is largely based on  a strong and effective Palestinian police force which would  cooperate with us. If they fail this test, we will have to  reach conclusions about the agreement itself and about extending  it to the rest of Judaea and Samaria later on. I think they  will have a strong incentive to meet these conditions but, if  they do not, we will have to reach some conclusions.    [Scemama] Sir, in the course of the political negotiations,  did you propose to evacuate certain settlements, such as  Netzarim, from the Qatif Bloc, in order to overcome some  security problem?    [Baraq] We did not make such a proposal and we are not even  supposed to adopt a position on any of the issues that were  decided on by the government. The government made a decision,  which it put into writing and signed in the DOP [Declaration of  Principles], to the effect that no settlement will be relocated  at this stage. That is why no settlement, including Netzarim  with its 27 or 28 families, is being relocated....    [Scemama, interrupting] There have been reports about such a  recommendation by military elements.    [Baraq, continuing] ....Or smaller locations. We are not  evacuating any place and there certainly was not and could not  be such a recommendation by the military.    [Scemama] Do you estimate that the IDF will evacuate Gaza  and Jericho by 13 April? When will the withdrawal actually  start now that the agreement has been signed?    [Baraq] This is not the agreement which had originally been  scheduled to be signed on 13 December. This agreement  elaborates in greater detail on the issues I mentioned earlier  and passes the torch to the working teams which will now have to  sit for weeks -- maybe three or six week, I do not know exactly;  it depends on the responsiveness of the other side -- and work  out a detailed agreement for implementation. Only when we get  such an agreement will we be able to assess when its  implementation will be completed.    [Scemama] How long will it take to withdraw from these areas  the moment such an agreement is concluded?    [Baraq] In my opinion, the moment an agreement is concluded  a withdrawal can be completed within six weeks or perhaps two  months. The DOP originally talks about four months from the  signing of the agreement. In practice, we do not need so much  time. However, we have not yet signed the agreement we will  have to implement. This still lies ahead of us and calls for a  lot of work.    [Scemama] Gen. Baraq, after the first Oslo agreement senior  military sources whose identity I do not know said the Army was  not let in on the negotiations and criticized this fact. Now  there is harsh criticism about the excessive involvement in the  political negotiations of officers dressed up in suits and ties.  You must probably be aware of this criticism.    [Baraq] In both cases the criticism did not come from within  the ranks of the Army. We think the decision not to let the  Army in on the details of the negotiations about the Oslo  agreement was right. It is not that I or the chief of  intelligence did not know that an agreement was in the works or  about some of its contents. The prime minister and the foreign  minister did the right thing by refraining from sharing with us  what clearly are political decisions about which there is a deep  and legitimate argument within Israeli society.    On the other hand, it becomes vital to include security  officials the moment the agreement must be put into practice and  discussions begin about security arrangements along the roads,  the security circles around the settlements, joint patrols, the  role of the Palestinian police force, and the activities of our  forces. After all, when all is said and done, we are the ones  who will have to move to the other side of the table and proceed  to implement it the day after the agreement is signed. Our  platoon commander must know what his duties are, what he can and  cannot do; the Palestinian policeman and the Israeli settler who  is being given protection must know what to do, and I believe  the Israeli public also must know.

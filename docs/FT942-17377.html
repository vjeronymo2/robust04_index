			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / UK Company News: GRT sets out for London with a Pounds 40m valuation GRT, a bus and coach operator, will come to the market later this month through a placing which is expected to value the Aberdeen-based group at about Pounds 40m. It will be the third bus group to have come to the market within the past year. Stagecoach, based in Perth, was floated last April, and Badgerline, the Avon-based operator, came to the market in November. The Go-Ahead Group, of Gateshead, will be floated by the summer with a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 40m. GRT operates in the north-east and central belt of Scotland, as well as Leicester and Northampton. The company was formed in 1989 to effect a management-led employee buy-out of Grampian Regional Transport, the first Scottish local authority bus company to be privatised. Midland Bluebird, which operates in the central belt of Scotland, was bought in 1990. The Leicester CityBus and Northampton Transport operations were bought late last year. The flotation, through a placing arranged by James Capel, will raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m of new money, enabling debt of Pounds 10m to be paid off leaving cash for acquisitions and organic growth. Post-flotation, about 30 per cent of GRT's shares will be held by employees, with a further 25 per cent owned by senior management. Some bus drivers and cleaners in Aberdeen will have stakes worth between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 20,000. Mr Moir Lockhead, chairman, said a key element in the success of the group had been the high degree of employee commitment achieved through participation in the buy-out and the operation of an employee share ownership plan. To encourage participation in the flotation, employees will be able to buy one share and receive one free. They will also be offered interest-free loans of up to Pounds 500. Following the flotation, 5 per cent of the group's profits before interest and tax will be allocated to fund the employee scheme. The group currently employs 1,850 people and has a fleet of 725 vehicles. Mr Lockhead said: 'The group has expanded well since the buy-out. In order to continue our development we believe that flotation is the next natural step and will enable GRT to continue to take advantage of opportunities for expansion when they arise.' GRT's turnover has risen from Pounds 11.8m in the year to March 31 1989, to Pounds 32m in the year end-March 1993, with operating profits increasing from Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 3.6m. This excludes the Leicester and Northampton operations.</p>

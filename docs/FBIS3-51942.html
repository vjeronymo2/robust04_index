			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Managua, 26 Jan (AFP) -- Protest organizers assert  that over 100 people have been arrested and 10 injured in the  repression unleashed this morning by Nicaraguan policemen  against transportation workers, who for the third consecutive  day have been on an indefinite national strike.    The police repression came on the heels of a government  announcement at midnight on Tuesday of a package of measures to  benefit the transportation workers. The workers rejected the  offer as insufficient and threatened to strengthen their  protests against fuel prices.    Roberto Gonzalez, leader of the National Transportation  Commission (CNT), denounced the arrest of "more than 100  companeros," while the Sandinist Radio Ya reported 299 arrests.  Government and police authorities have yet to confirm the  figures.    Bus transportation was at a total standstill in the capital  and various other locations around the country today. Some  people erected barricades with bricks removed from the streets  in parts of the city, reporters have confirmed.    The largest barricades were erected in the eastern part of  the capital opposite the Parrales Vallejos Bus Cooperative,  whose members are wearing masks to avoid being identified by the  authorities. The cooperative members are apparently unarmed.    Riot police have been discreetly deployed in different parts  of the capital to keep the peace.    Despite the blockades erected in three parts of the capital,  the flow of private vehicles is normal. Supermarkets, banks,  and businesses have kept doors open, but few people are on the  streets.    Finance Minister Emilio Pereira asked that order be  reestablished and said that "a country cannot be held hostage."  He accused transportation workers of wanting to "stop the  vehicle called Nicaragua," thus preventing the nation from  overcoming its current serious economic stagnation.    Pereira reiterated the government's decision -- announced  last night -- to freeze the price of gasoline, currently at  $2.35 per gallon ($3.78 liter), until April.    However, transportation owners demand that the price of fuel  be reduced to the level of Central American prices, which are  below $2.00 per gallon.    The government also froze the price of kerosene and butane  gas until April and decided to reduce the price of diesel to the  price that existed in June 1993.    The finance minister also announced the delivery of coupons  to taxi drivers and the elimination of the tax on license plates  and traffic permits.    Government authorities called on transportation workers to  form a transportation commission so a transportation law can be  drafted quickly, as is demanded by the CNT, which is promoting  the strike.    With these provisions, according to Transportation Minister  Pablo Vigil, "there is no reason to prolong the strike,"  although it seems to be getting worse, according to the strike  leaders.    Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta warned last night that  the Riot Police, Special Disarmament Brigades (BED), and other  security corps have been deployed to safeguard order.</p>

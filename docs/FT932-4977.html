			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / European Commission looks for more jobs NOTHING is more conducive of short-term thinking than a recession. For European governments, tormented by the cocktail of slow growth and high real interest rates that the Bundesbank continues to serve up, it is tempting to see a cut in German interest rates as an answer to all their ills. But the European Commission cannot be accused of short-termism. Its new 'Community-wide Framework for Employment' should help focus members' minds. The Commission document, essentially an agenda for future study, makes two powerful points. First, the EC has a low rate of employment, particularly for women, compared with other industrialised countries - less than 60 per cent of its population of working age are in work, compared to more than 70 per cent in the US, Japan and the Efta countries. Second, the job creation required to raise this low level of employment will not be achieved by economic growth alone. It will require as yet unspecified supporting policies, instead, if growth is to be more 'employment-intensive'. Europe's record of job creation has been poor not only over the past three years but over the past two decades. Employment in North America has nearly doubled since 1960, but has grown by a mere 10 per cent in the EC. Why has the EC's employment record been so bad? Some clues are to be found in the OECD's interim report on employment and unemployment, released last week. While weak on diagnosis and cures, the OECD report was strong on description of trends in unemployment and employment, particularly the comparative record of private and public sector job creation since the 1973 oil shock. The reason for the superior employment performance of the Efta countries, compared to the EC, is apparent from the charts. It is public sector job creation. The number of public sector jobs created in the EC failed to compensate for the loss of private sector employment in the years to 1985, as the charts show. But while the Efta countries share the EC's dismal private sector job creation, the creation of public sector employment, the most important feature of their employment record over the past two decades, dwarfs changes in private sector employment. Rapid private sector job creation is, by contrast, the reason why total employment growth in North America has outstripped EC job creation. Both the EC and North America have created a little over 5m public sector jobs since 1974. But while the EC has created only 3.1m private jobs, the US and Canada have created 29.8m. This comparison, Commission officials acknowledge, provides some unpleasant fat for EC members to chew over. First, the US achieved this private sector employment growth, in part, because it has pursued a policy of labour market deregulation which does not sit easily with continental Europe's social democratic aspirations. Second, this rapid US job creation has entailed relatively low productivity and real wage growth, compared to Europe. The US record makes the Commission's task - to find ways of simultaneously boosting job creation, real incomes and worker protection - look horribly ambitious, as a senior Commission official, responsible for the EC study, readily admits. 'More jobs mean lower growth of incomes per jobs - unless we produce miracles.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100. Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of ther total labour force. Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 UNITED STATES

----------------------------------------------------------------------- All series seasonally adjusted. Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA. Retail sales volume: data from national government sources except Japan and Italy (value series deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department stores only). Industrial production: data from national government sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US - help-wanted advertising, Japan -    new vacancies, Germany and France - all jobs vacant, Italy -    no data available, UK -    unfilled vacancies. Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical fluctuations which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general economic activity.</p>

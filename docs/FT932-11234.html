			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Auditors qualify annual report of ECH subsidiary ENTERPRISE Computer Holdings' principal subsidiary, Enterprise Computer Services, has had its annual report qualified on a going concern basis by KPMG Peat Marwick, its auditors. The accounts cover the 15 months to March 31 1992 when the group posted pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.33m on turnover of Pounds 157.9m. However, the supplier of second user IBM computers said the boards of both the parent company and the subsidiary were satisfied that the group's bank facilities would continue to be available for a period 'which will allow the auditors to report on the accounts to March 31 1993 without a going concern qualification.' In a statement yesterday the group said its confidence stemmed from the improved trading performance during the last quarter, and the pending merger of Teltronics and SRH, a company in which Enterprise has a 25 per cent equity stake, which is expected to be completed before June 30. The merger is expected to result in the group receiving Pounds 5.3m in cash, property and securities over the next 12 months. Since June last year Enterprise has undergone a substantial reorganisation and restructuring under a new management team led by Mr Shaun Dowling, non-executive chairman.</p>

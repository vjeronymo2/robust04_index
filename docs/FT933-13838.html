			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): Famous faces sparkle at the stroke of a pen - Corporate enthusiasts set the pace in the market for signed photographs, but an interesting collection can still be established for less than Pounds 1,000 / Alternative Investments AUTOGRAPHS HAVE long been one of the most popular fields of collection. Last year it was estimated that there were 3 million enthusiasts in the US, and there are probably as many in Europe. Meanwhile, the past 25 years have seen the growth of an enormous parallel market: the collection of photographs signed by the subject. Notable collectors have included Luciano Pavarotti, Gore Vidal and Robert Woodruff, the Coca-Cola magnate. A watershed in the market occurred in 1972, with the sale in New York of the collection belonging to the Rev Cornelius Greenway, a pastor and teacher who had collected signed photos of a wide range of leading figures of the century to inspire his pupils. Widespread interest in signed photographs followed, and in 1980 the collection of RED Rawlings, an eminent British enthusiast (ex-Indian Army officer and son of a diplomat) was sold at Sotheby's. The ensuing decade saw the arrival of the first big corporate collectors of signed photos and related memorabilia, notably the Hard Rock Cafe. A number of other companies, especially theme restaurant chains, have since entered the market, the most notable recent arrival being Planet Hollywood. The market for the collector of signed images is broad. An interesting collection can still be established for an outlay of less than Pounds 1,000, while many have been built from material which has not appeared at auction. Most collectors select a personal theme - for example, film stars, royalty or sport. The portrait need not necessarily be a photograph. The earliest known signed images, from the 1830s, are engravings or lithographs, which have a rarity value in their own right because few have survived. The earliest readily available signed photographs are cartes-de-visites and cabinet photographs, dating from the 1840s. Many major subjects, including Dickens, Queen Victoria, Lincoln and Ibsen, signed such items. For a signed image of a leading subject, a collector will expect to pay from Pounds 100 to over Pounds 2,000 at auction, especially if the item is by a notable photographer. A signed Tennyson by Julia Margaret Cameron, for example, would cost over Pounds 1,200. Job lots of signed photographs or postcards are still available for as little as Pounds 30 at auction. While these may be useful starters, such things as made-up cards (where a cut-out picture is pasted down and signed) and images with heavy adhesive marks to the reverse should be avoided. Colour images are also avoided by some, because they can fade. The most common images are those invented after 1910 - the publicity shot. Rarely are these anything but straight portraits; the candid image only arrived in the 1930s. Recent research has revealed masters of the stock portrait, such as Hollywood photographer Clarence Sinclair Bull. His work was featured last October in Bonham's pioneering sale, Hollywood Glamour. Fine signed photographs of stars by such masters sell for between Pounds 80 and Pounds 1000. From the 1950s, most images were produced by freelancers, rather than studios. For example, McBean's image of Katherine Hepburn sells for between Pounds 40 and Pounds 350 at auction. All the major salerooms, and a number of provincial auctioneers offer signed photographs amongst ephemera. The latter include T Vennett-Smith, of Nottingham, and Strides in Chichester. There are also a number of specialist dealers. Certain details add value to the signed photograph. An inscription of biographical or historical significance is one. Extremely rare examples of Einstein, Lenin, Martin Luther King and Tsar Nicholas II exist, and would command up to 100 times usual prices. Dates are also important, and can invest an image with particular significance. Early images of the likes of Clara Bow or Marlon Brando are sought after, as they embody a particular era. There are exceptions, such as Einstein, where our accepted image is fixed as that of an older man. Churchill is a notable variant, photographs from any period are much sought after (ranging from Pounds 250 to Pounds 1,100 ). Provenance is another aspect of collection. Marilyn Monroe's photograph dedicated to Sammy Davis Junior sold for over Dollars 5,000 in 1991. Group signed photographs are also at a premium, and recent examples at auction have included Russian cosmonauts, sold for Pounds 650 by T Vennett-Smith; and Buddy Holly and the Crickets, sold by Phillips in April 1990 for Pounds 1,650. The huge popularity of some subjects prompted the issue of photographs with secretarial, facsimile, rubber-stamp or autopen signatures. Jean Harlow, Eisenhower, John Kennedy and the Beatles are well-known examples. All reputable dealers and auction houses will advise on provenance and authenticity. Standard references, such as Harrison's Autographs, can help, as can past sales catalogues. Other published sources include the photographer Eisenstadt's Daybook, which his famous subjects signed after a session. The number of deliberate fakes or forgeries is low. But where larger sums are involved, always seek expert advice. The quality of the photograph or postcard can vary, and there will be a price differential between a signed postcard and a signed original photograph. The difference for Chaplin, for example is between 20 and 40 per cent. Events, too, can significantly change values. Rare pictures of Ceaucescu, the Romanian dictator, could be obtained for Pounds 1 before December 1989, but the price has since reached Pounds 80 or more. Charles-and-Diana joint signatures, valued at Pounds 210 in 1990, are worth looking out for. Experience will reveal that rarities are sold quite often, because a collector usually keeps only one image of a subject; so do not be tempted to pay too much over the odds. Film and pop personalities remain the most popular and collected subjects. New film releases, or annual events such as the Oscar ceremonies, give regular boosts to the market. Television never has quite the same appeal, lacking the international market base given to film stars. Among the up and coming areas are sport, opera and 20th century politics. Sporting items have appeared in specialist sales for some time, and the price of a leading subject, such as Rocky Marciano, has risen from Pounds 100 in 1989 to Pounds 350 in 1993. Fair sums have been paid in recent years for political photographs - Gorbachev (Pounds 360), Khomeini (Pounds 1,100) and Saddam Hussein (Pounds 305). Among areas out of favour are 19th century worthies and music hall: extensive collections can be bought for below Pounds 50, even where the quality of the photographs may be very good. Most people's collections still begin outside the saleroom, often built up slowly from childhood by writing to famous people (who now appreciate a stamped addressed envelope), or by encountering the famous in person. The latter route is now rarer, particularly since John Lennon was murdered shortly after signing an autograph for his assassin. Many signed photographs are still kept in photo or autograph albums. However, some modern plastic sleeves or self-adhesive sheets can do untold damage to the image and lift off some signatures altogether. If not framed and displayed away from direct sunlight, they are ideally kept singly in acid-free envelopes in a dry, dark, relatively cool place. From time to time they should be aired. Where possible, signed mounts should not be separated from the image, and photographs should not be handled except from the edges. Kept in good condition, a collection can prove an excellent and interesting investment.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENER'S CHECKLIST  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  </P> <P> * Allow fuchsias to rest from now until February when you would prune them  back.  </P> <P> * Don't rush on lifting dahlias. Foliage should be allowed to ripen off and  turn yellow, or the bulbs will be robbed of energy for next year's growth.  </P> <P> * Sweet alyssum can be sown from seed over bulb beds; they'll bloom with the  bulbs next spring.  </P> <P> * Cool-season perennial vegetables can be planted now -- artichokes, asparagus  and rhubarb.  </P></p>

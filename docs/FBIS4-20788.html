			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "PAC Raps Finance Ministry for `Lapses'"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The Public Accounts Committee  [PAC] has indicted the Union Finance Ministry for not having  carried out a "meaningful probe" in a case of unauthorised  import and under-invoicing by Reliance Industries. The case  involves customs duty of Rs. 119.64 crores on goods imported by  the company for its Patalganga polyester filament yarn project  in Maharashtra. The allegation of unauthorised import of plant  and machinery, misdeclaration and underinvoicing of goods was  made in a showcause notice issued by the Customs Department in  1987.    The PAC, presided over by Mr. Bhagwan Shankar Rawat (BJP)  (Bharatiya Janata Party), pointed out that the report submitted  by the Director-General Inspection (Customs and Excise) "does  not inspire confidence" while the Finance Ministry has not  undertaken any meaningful probe on the lines recommended by the  committee earlier. It therefore urged the Ministry to re-examine  the whole issue to check "any unhealthy practices in the  department."    The committee submitted its 61st report today to both Houses  on Government's action on the 164th report which had recommended  a thorough probe into the entire issue.  <H5>  Decision Delayed </H5>   The PAC observes that the case pending since April, 1989,  before the Customs, Excise and Gold Control Appellate Tribunal  (CEGAT) has not been decided even after a lapse of over four  years. It was following the committee's recommendations that the  Government had filed a review petition against the adjudicating  order passed in January, 1989, dropping the charges contained in  the showcause notice issued against the company in February,  1987.    The PAC notes that the stay order obtained by the company  against the proceedings in CEGAT has since been vacated and the  matter is said to be pending before the Tribunal for a final  decision. But the committee felt this was another instance of an  importer resorting to tactics of successfully buying time for  paying huge amounts of customs duty. It has, therefore, urged  that the matter be thoroughly examined and effective measures  evolved to ensure that Government's legitimate dues are  recovered in time.    In the previous report, it was noted that Reliance  Industries  had registered three project contracts with the Bombay Custom  House for availing of concessional duty rates. It was found that  against the prescribed time limit of 15 days of the import of  the last consignments, the company was allowed a period of four  years and two months for the first contract, nine months for the  second contract, and nearly a year and one month for the third  contract to file reconciliation statements. The PAC had urged  that the circumstances in which the company was permitted to  submit reconciliation statements in this manner be thoroughly  probed and responsibility fixed for the "undue favour."    The Department of Revenue in the Finance Ministry, in its  reply to the PAC on this issue, said it had been studied by the  Director General of Inspection (Customs and Central Excise). His  report revealed that the file remained in the Custom House  unattended for two years and five months in the first case, nine  months in the second case and 10 months in the third case. The  Director-General concluded that while there was administrative  slackness, there did not appear to be any `motivated delay' by  Customs officials.    On fixing of responsibility, the Central Board of Excise and  Customs felt that work of this nature "tends to fall in arrears"  owing to acute staff shortage. In this case, though delayed,  corrective action has been taken by issue of show cause notice,  it was pointed out. Besides, fresh instructions have been issued  to Collectors of Customs to ensure that reconciliation  statements are submitted by importers within the prescribed  period and to enforce bonds where these are not submitted within  the stipulated time.</p>

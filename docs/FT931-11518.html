			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK food sector With the PSBR pressing down on him, Mr Norman Lamont may eventually have no choice but to raise some extra cash. Tax hawks suggest extending VAT to books, newspapers and domestic fuel, but the really big target would be food. The Treasury estimates it could garner a further Pounds 7bn by making full-rate VAT applicable to food. Taxing bread and butter would certainly provoke a furious public reaction. It would also raise questions about food industry earnings. The worrying memory is of April 1991, when a large chunk of the 2 1/2 percentage point increase in VAT came out of the margins of retailers and their suppliers. Recessionary conditions prevented the increase from being passed on to consumers. In the case of food, the direct consequences might not be as bad as at first imagined. Many discretionary items, such as soft drinks and snacks, already attract VAT. Higher taxes would not depress consumption of essential foods, though there might be trading down to cheaper items. Prized brands would become less valuable for a while. With food more expensive consumers might spend less on other items, like restaurant meals, with a knock-on effect in other sectors. Large food retailers might suffer the least damage because of the power they wield over their suppliers, but margins should recover quickly. Food has declined as a proportion of disposable income over many years. The additional burden of VAT, were it introduced, would only represent a blip in this long-run trend.</p>

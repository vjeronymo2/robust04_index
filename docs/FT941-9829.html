			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Pension bonds lift National Savings Pensioners' guaranteed income bonds attracted Pounds 75m of funds in the first 10 days they were on sale, National Savings reported yesterday. The amount involved is lower than the Pounds 93m attracted in a similar period for the National Savings First Option bond almost two years ago, although the number of savers, at 9,400, is higher. The clash between societies and the government over the First Option bond culminated in its temporary withdrawal. When the pensioners' bonds were announced in November's Budget, there was concern among building societies that their terms might act as a drain on societies' retail savings. Yesterday's figures appeared to offer them some relief. The bond, which went on sale on 21 January, offers an interest rate of 7 per cent gross fixed for five years for people aged 65 and over. Total gross sales of all National Savings products in January amounted to Pounds 840m.</p>

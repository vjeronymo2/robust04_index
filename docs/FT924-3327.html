			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lord Chancellor breaks deadlock THE Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, used his powers last night to resolve a tied vote by peers. The 106-106 division came on a technical amendment on procedure. Tory Lord Aldington, chairman of the European committee, called for the body to determine its own sub-committee structure as its work covered complex EC documents. He moved a change to a report from the Lords liaison committee, which regulates Upper House committees. The Lord Chancellor, after the deadlock was announced, said the rules provided that 'the question should be resolved in the negative unless there is a majority in its favour' and he declared that the proposed change was defeated.</p>

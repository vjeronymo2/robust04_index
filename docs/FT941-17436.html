			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses open 1994 in ascending array The Continent was peppered with new highs, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw US buying late in the session, overcame a weak start and closed with the DAX index 1.30 stronger at a new closing high of 2,267.98. Trade was quiet after Thursday's DM11.2bn turnover. Construction shares, savaged by some analysts in mid-1993, broke resistance levels and blossomed. Hochtief and Holzmann both rose by DM60, to DM1,200 and DM1,045. PARIS said domestic bank rate cuts were neutral in effect but good for sentiment, and that futures-related buying was behind a rise in the CAC-40 index of 22.34 to a new high of 2,290.56. Turnover amounted to FFr3.2bn. Eurotunnel gained FFr1.90 at FFr54.40 on its tariff structure. CCF fell as low as FFr290 on its rights issue at one point, recovering to close still FFr5.60 down at FFr297.40: it talked of higher 1993 profits. ZURICH returned to record setting territory, the SMI index registering an advance of 38.6 at 2,996.2, with the best per-formances coming in cyclicals. MADRID peaked 4.39 higher at 327.16, with construction stocks in the lead. Registered shares in Ciba-Geigy, viewed as the most cyclical stock among chemicals, put on SFr29 at SFr929. COPENHAGEN gained 2.2 per cent in active buying by institutional investors, and the KFX top-20 index climbed 2.39 to 109.19 in big turnover of DKr854m. AMSTERDAM saw enthusiastic local buying which took the new AEX index 6.1 ahead to a high of 420.37. A rise of Fl 2.50, or 5.3 per cent, to Fl 49.40 in Ahold, the retailer, was attributed to favourable press comment on the outlook for the group's US supermarket chains. BRUSSELS moved ahead, the Bel-20 index adding 8.68 at a peak 1,481.78. STOCKHOLM put aside political worries over an impending decision on the Oresund Bridge between Sweden and Denmark and the Affarsvarlden index rose 22.1 to a record 1,424.9. OSLO shrugged off continued low prices for Norway's North Sea oil and the all-share index moved forward 4.83 to 617.91 in active turnover of NKr672m. VIENNA rose by 1.8 per cent, the ATX index closing 20.78 higher at 1,149.56 on a lack of sellers. WARSAW's WIG index climbed 606, or 4.9 per cent, to 13,045 in active turnover of 1,400bn zlotys. ISTANBUL hit its third consecutive peak, the composite index ending at 21,788.1, up 1,105.3 or 5.3 per cent. ATHENS scored a new high with a 3.3 per cent gain on institutional buying, the general index closing 31.55 stronger at 990.21. Written and edited by William Cochrane and Michael Morgan</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / D'Alema chosen to lead Italy's ex-communists Italy's former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) yesterday elected Mr Massimo D'Alema, to succeed Mr Achille Occhetto as leader. Mr D'Alema has been the party's number two and heir apparent. But Mr Occhetto himself and a large section of the grass-roots in the PDS favoured Mr Walter Veltroni, his rival, who edits L'Unita, the party daily. The PDS is the largest parliamentary party. It is the acknowledged leader and organisational force for the five main groupings that form the left-wing opposition. But Mr D'Alema now faces a difficult task in rejuvenating the party and making it appeal to a broader section of the electorate. He is highly regarded as an astute political operator and a good diplomat. However, his detractors regard him as formed too much in the old school of the Italian Communist party (PCI) with its doctrinaire approach to issues and blind faith in organisation. Mr D'Alema began his political life in the PCI's youth wing in 1963, working his way up through editorship of L'Unita. Although he was the recognised heir, it was only this week that Mr Occhetto revealed the full extent of his disagreement with Mr D'Alema. In yesterday's meeting of the party's national council, the balance narrowly swung in favour of Mr D'Alema. However, grass-roots members clearly saw Mr Veltroni, with his boyish charm and open admiration for the American way of life, as more presentable and 'modern' - the Italian version of US President Bill Clinton, or Mr Tony Blair, aspiring to Britain's Labour party leadership. The election of Mr D'Alema does not solve the broader issue of who leads the left. Critics such as Mr Massimo Cacciari, the influential mayor of Venice, argue that the left must be led by someone not directly linked to the PDS. The PDS, Mr Cacciari claims, remains wedded to the old communist structure, and as such is an electoral liability.</p>

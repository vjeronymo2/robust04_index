			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 6 Apr (NA) -- Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo said today that the approval of the Patents Law is "a  credential in the negotiations with the U.S. Government to get  it to modify the extremely closed tariff stance it has with  Argentina."    Cavallo complained that while Argentina is "extremely open  to  the United States, it is extremely closed to us in tariff and  rates matters."    He stressed it is "fundamental" that the Patents Law be used  as a lever in the negotiation of a bilateral trade relation with  the United States, and "no ground must be given regarding future  sanctions."    "It is very important for them that it can be considered as  a  credential in the negotiations," the minister reiterated during  the luncheon he had with an organization of business people.    The economy minister warned that if negotiations with the  U.S. Government are successful, the norm for acknowledging the  intellectual rights of U.S. laboratories "will have to be made  within the framework of GATT."    This is precisely the measure that is being demanded by the  national enterprises grouped within the Industrial Center of  Argentine Pharmaceutical Laboratories (CILFA), something the  foreign companies, represented in this case by the U.S. Embassy  with James Cheek at its head, wish to prevent.    The minister hopes that the approval of the Patents Law,  which is sleeping in Congress, will be the "key" to unfreeze  trade relations.    Cavallo then referred to Brazil and stated that trade  relations with the neighboring country are "as important as  those with as those with the United States."    Moreover, he confessed that the Argentine Government  "slipped  up when it negotiated a free trade" [zone], referring to the  Mercosur [Common Market of the South] Treaty, and he said:  "There was no need to achieve a customs union."    Notwithstanding, he expressed his happiness in that "the  Brazilians are quite realistic and have come to the conclusion  that free trade is not yet feasible."    As a detail to support his position, the minister maintained  that many Europeans are "more skeptical about their monetary and  economic union."</p>

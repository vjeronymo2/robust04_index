			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commission Launches Second Program </F> for Democracy in the East"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE  database]    [Text] The European Commission announced the launch of its  second Democracy program for Central and East European  countries, for a total of ECU12 million, this is:     -  The  second program of its type under the PHARE [Economic  Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program, for ECU8  million, benefiting 11 Central and East European countries;    -  A  first program of the same type for countries of the former USSR,  for ECU2 million, in the framework of the TACIS [CIS Technical  Assistance] program (Mongolia, while covered by TACIS, is not  involved in the program).    You will recall that a European Parliament initiative lies  at  the origin of these programs, aimed at promoting the development  of democratic societies based on the rule of law and the  expression of the free will of the citizens. The current  program consists above all in a support for selected local  nongovernmental organizations, through partnerships between them  and similar organization in states of the Union. Thus, projects  covering a wide range of activities (but not political party  activities, nor capital expenditure, nor grants for conferences)  will be able to benefit from subsidies of up to ECU150,000,  which could be funded to the tune of 70 percent of the costs of  each project. One of the conditions, however, is that the  projects need at least three partners, two from the European  Union and one from the beneficiary state. Moreover, ECU1  million extra is planned for those countries benefiting from the  PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary], with  view to financing a new aspect of the Program for Democracy,  i.e. micro-projects: In this case, the subsidies from the  European Union -- from ECU3,000 to ECU10,000 -- can finance up  to 90 percent of the cost of the projects, and partnership with  European Union organizations are not necessary. The European  Commission will be assisted in the management of the programs by  the European Human Rights Foundation, which has a lot of  experience in similar programs undertaken by nongovernmental  organizations [NGOs] which work to promote human rights and  democracy. Thus, the Commission will select the projects and  the Foundation will then follow their implementation.</p>

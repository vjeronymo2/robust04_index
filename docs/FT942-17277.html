			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / 2,000 advisers apply to PIA The Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect private investors, had by yesterday received just over 2,000 applications from companies and individuals wanting to be regulated by it, Alison Smith writes. When the PIA published its prospectus in February, it estimated there were about 6,000 potential members who now come under the existing self-regulating organisations, Lautro and Fimbra. The PIA will open in July and has warned life companies and independent financial advisers that if they missed yesterday's deadline it cannot guarantee that applications will be processed by then. The decision by Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, to reject the PIA and be regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board has intensified caution within the financial services industry over the PIA's future, leading many potential members to hang back before applying. Bradford &amp; Bingley, the seventh-largest building society, yesterday announced it had applied to join the PIA. Mr Geoffrey Lister, its chief executive, is on the PIA board.</p>

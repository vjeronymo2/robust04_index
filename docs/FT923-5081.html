			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Pavilion too far vexes the mandarins: A look at the future of Britain's Expo '92 showpiece THE BRITISH pavilion at Seville's Expo '92, which has been widely acclaimed as the event's showpiece, faces an uncertain future. Government officials and potential investors are apparently unable to make up their minds about what to do with it once the fair ends in mid-October. The government has faced increasing lobbying from the British Science and Technology Trust - a charitable group which counts Lord Forte, Lady Thatcher and Lord Palumbo, the chairman of the arts council, among its trustees - to move the pavilion to the grounds of London zoo. Lord Palumbo has also put forward a proposal to have the pavilion sited beside the Design Museum near London Bridge. There have been approaches from Kent County Council - which wants the pavilion near the Eurotunnel rail terminal at Ashford - and from the National Energy Trust based in Milton Keynes. The British Science and Technology Trust project, which would house an environmental technology centre and a three-dimensional cinema, is understood to have received the tacit backing of senior management at the zoo and the Department of the Environment. But the trust has been unable to raise the necessary financial backing for its project and has said that it is unwilling to meet any of the costs of the relocation. Professor Paul Cook, president of the trust, said the government should be persuaded that the plan would best serve the national interest by providing a home showcase for British environmental technology, as well as possibly helping the zoo out of its financial difficulties. 'We think the scrap value of the building is Pounds 1m,' Prof Cook said. 'We are not prepared to pay Pounds 1m. We want it given to us. It would become a fantastic exhibition centre which would stand on its own two feet.' But the Department of Trade and Industry, which paid Pounds 15m for the pavilion to be built by Trafalgar House just over a year ago, appears anxious to strike a hard bargain over its disposal. In Seville chartered surveyors Healey and Baker are working on the department's behalf to attract firm offers from around the world for the pavilion, which boasts a 70-metre water wall as a facade and has an internal volume as big as St Paul's Cathedral. Healey and Baker said that Monsanto, the multinational chemicals organisation, was one of three groups studying a possible acquisition that would keep the building in its present position as part of a future research and development park being planned on the site of the Expo by the Spanish government. Other national pavilions in Expo were built as temporary structures or, in the case of those housing the Italian and French exhibits, as permanent ones that will be maintained after the event by public money. Denmark managed to sell its stylish pavilion to a Japanese group before it was even set up on the Expo '92 grounds. The sale of the British pavilion is proving difficult partly because there is not a clear price for its transfer to the UK and partly because there is no clear guidance from the Spanish government on any fiscal incentives which may be connected with the future R&amp;D park. Interested parties in the UK are also faced with considerable additional costs involved in converting the pavilion's air conditioning and cooling systems, built for the Seville summer, into central heating. An alternative energy supply for the water wall would have to be devised. At present it is powered by solar panels, meaning that the British weather would reduce the familiar sheet of water to something akin to a trickle from a leaking tap. Healey and Baker has set a guide price of Pounds 2m to Pounds 3m for the building and a cost of Pounds 2m for its transfer to the UK. It has received no firm offers. Pressure appears to be on to secure a solution that would prevent the award-winning building, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw, being sold as scrap. Under regulations agreed to by all the participating countries in Expo '92, the five-storey building will have to be knocked down if the DTI fails to dispose of it by the end of March next year.</p>

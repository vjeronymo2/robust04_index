			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["uhl"-signed report: "CDU: Savings Banks and Land Banks </F> Should Also Be Privatized"]    [Text] Bonn -- The CDU [Christian Democratic Union]  Economic Council has proposed a "new privatization offensive" to  achieve more growth and investment and thus make Germany more  attractive as a center for business.    As was stressed by Juergen Westphal, the chairman of the  Economic Council's "Economic and Competitive Policy" Commission,  there is also a need for savings banks and land banks to be  privatized. These public law institutions have a market share of  over 35 percent and their volume of business amounts to about 2  trillion German marks [DM]. Contrary to their original aims,  the savings and land banks have developed into universal banking  institutions. In terms of the range of services they offer,  they are hardly distinguishable from private banks and credit  cooperatives.    Nevertheless, the privatization of the savings and land  banks  should involve more than just a formal legal change. The more  important point is that at least 51 percent of the capital  should be really sold to the private sector. According to  Westphal, privatization does not mean that the savings banks  have to lose their regional links.    According to the Economic Council, by far the greatest  potential for privatization among all public bodies is at the  municipality level, where there are over 100,000 publicly owned  companies. The gains in efficiency resulting from privatization  would amount to an estimated DM40 to DM50 billion a year for the  municipalities. The most important areas are garbage  collection, sewage treatment, cleaning streets and buildings,  planning, construction, transportation, telecommunications,  energy, and housing administration.    Western German laender should also step up privatization  efforts, especially with regard to public law financial  institutions, housing and energy companies, as well as airport  and trade fair companies. The nominal value of their direct  capital holdings amounts to over DM13 billion. This amount is  twice that held at the federal level. In addition, there are all  kinds of forms of indirect ownership. For example, through its  43.6 percent share in the WestLB [bank], North Rhine-Westphalia  owns 10 percent or more of nine companies quoted on the stock  exchange.    Privatization must also continue at the federal level. The  reform of the federal railroads and the postal service should  involve more than just reorganization. Telekom, above all, is  suited for wide ownership on the part of citizens. The  implementation of all federal privatization projects to date,  including Lufthansa, has reduced federal ownership by 40 percent  or DM2.3 billion.</p>

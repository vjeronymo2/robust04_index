			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (vi) Other Department of Education records and materials if the records and materials were provided to the hearing official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no later than 3 days after the institution's or servicer's filing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its request for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f) The hearing official accepts only evidence that is both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissible and timely under the terms of paragraph (e) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, and relevant and material to the appeal. Examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence that shall be deemed irrelevant and immaterial except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon a clear showing of probative value respecting the matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in paragraph (d) of this section include_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Evidence relating to a period of time other than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time covered by the audit or program review;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Evidence relating to an audit or program review of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution or third-party servicer other than the institution or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer bringing the appeal, or the resolution thereof; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Evidence relating to the current practice of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution or servicer bringing the appeal in the program areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at issue in the appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) (1) The hearing official may schedule an oral argument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if he or she determines that an oral argument is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarify the issues and the positions of the parties as presented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the parties' written submissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In the event that an oral argument is conducted, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated department official makes a transcribed record of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceedings and makes one copy of that record available to each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the parties to the proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 42. Section 668.123 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;668.123 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Collection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To the extent that the decision of the Secretary sustains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final audit determination or program review determination,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the provisions of &sect;668.24(c)(3), the Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education will take steps to collect the debt at issue or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise effect the determination that was subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1094)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 43. A new Appendix A to part 668 is added to read as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=75 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix A to Part 668_Standards for Acceptable Refund Policies by Participating Institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of &sect;668.22(b)(1)(iv)(A), the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers an institution to have a fair and equitable refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy if the institution uses a policy that meets the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of this appendix. These requirements do not affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution's obligation to comply with other Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (I)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The governing board of the institution must review and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve the schedule of all institutional charges and refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies applicable to students.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The pricing of services and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund policies have important consequences to students, parents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution, and society; as such, pricing and refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies must receive board attention and approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (II)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institution must seek consumer views in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process of establishing and amending charge and refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Decisions regarding institutional funds are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ultimately the sole responsibility of the institution's legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated fund custodians. However, consumer concerns do affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision making, and involving consumers in decision making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to charges and refunds is an essential approach for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessing student needs and creating public awareness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (III)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institution must publish a current schedule of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all student charges (including the costs of required supplies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment), publish a statement of the purpose for such charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and related refund policies, have those statements readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available free of charge to current and prospective students, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantiate that the costs of required supplies and equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are reasonably related to the cost of providing the supplies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment to the students.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Students and parents have a right to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> know what charges they will be expected to pay and what will or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be refunded. They also have a right to know what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services accompany payment of the charges. Informational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials published free for students and prospective students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are ideal for this purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (IV)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institution must clearly designate all optional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges as ``optional'' in all published schedules and related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Charges that are mandatory and charges that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> optional must be plainly differentiated in all printed materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statements accompanying the schedule may include institutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endorsements of the optional program or service. The institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must state clearly in its schedule if a charge is optional for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some students but required for others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (V)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institution must clearly identify charges and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits that are nonrefundable as ``nonrefundable'' on all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published schedules.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Institutions determine on an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis which of their charges are refundable or nonrefundable. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general, admission fees, application fees, laboratory fees,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility and student activity fees, and other similar charges are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not refundable. These fees are generally charged to cover the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of activities such as processing applications and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student information, reserving academic positions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing the limits of institutional programs and services,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserving housing space, and otherwise setting the fixed costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution for the coming academic periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutions determine on an individual basis which of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits are refundable or nonrefundable. Some deposits will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonrefundable or will be credited to a student's account (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition deposits). Others are refundable according to the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the deposit agreement (e.g., deposits for breakage).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (VI)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institution must refund housing rental charges,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less a deposit, as long as written notification of cancellation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is made prior to a well-publicized date that provides reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to make the space available to other students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Written notification on or before the beginning of the term of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the contract is necessary to ensure utilization of housing units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the term of the contract, room charges are generally not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refundable. However, based on the program offered, space  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability, debt service requirements, State and local laws,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other individual circumstances, institutions may provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some more flexible refund guideline for housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (VII)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institution must refund board charges in full,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less a deposit, if written notification of cancellation is made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to a well-publicized date that falls on or before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning of the term of the contract.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequent board charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be refunded on a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> basis. It is reasonable to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a refund for those goods and services not consumed. The deposit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should reflect that portion of an institution's costs that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed for the term of the contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (VIII)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institutional refund policy must include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following requirements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The institution must refund 100 percent of the tuition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges, less an administrative fee that does not exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lesser of $100 or 5 percent of the tuition, if the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submits written notice of cancellation on or before one week  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preceding the first day of classes for the period of enrollment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which the student was charged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The institution must refund at least 90 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition charges if the student submits written notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancellation between the end of the period of time specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (VIII) A. and the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of enrollment for which the student was charged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The institution must refund at least 50 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition charges if the student submits written notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancellation between the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of that period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. The institution must refund at least 25 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition charges if the student submits written notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancellation between the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of the first 50 percent (in time) of the period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

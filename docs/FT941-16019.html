			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Leading Article: An end to foot-dragging Does the insurance industry understand the real world? The question arises from the wrangle over creating a new self-regulatory body, the Personal Investment Authority. Its history has been a messy one. First, the people putting together the new body needed some overt spine-stiffening from Mr Andrew Large, who sits atop the regulatory pyramid as chairman of the Securities and Investments Board. Then they had to overcome the hostility of the clearing banks, the abrupt departure of their putative chairman, and a public questioning of their objectives by Mr Mick Newmarch, boss of the Prudential. Now, one of the PIA's founding committee has himself resigned in protest. Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life, is not by temperament a rabble-rouser, and the life office for which he works is Edinburgh respectability incarnate. Yet, like the Pru's Mr Newmarch, he may underestimate the challenge now facing the industry. The current system of regulation, says Mr Stretton, is unsatisfactory; its mooted replacement worse. The intended composition of the PIA's board - nine 'public interest' representatives, nine active industry participants and the authority's chief executive - tilts the balance too far away from the industry to be true self-regulation, he feels. It would therefore be better to go the whole hog, setting up a statutory body with proper public accountability. In the abstract, this argument has some merit. But the future of insurance industry regulation is not an abstract matter. The early years of the current phase of regulation were unduly influenced by the industry itself; since then, the regulators have had to struggle to convince the life offices of the need for commission disclosure. Undesirable - and far too widespread  -selling practices have been revealed. Most recent and most damaging is the discovery that many sales of the industry's hot new product of the 1980s, the personal pension, were made without proper documentation, and sometimes against the obvious interests of the pur-chaser. Since Mr Large took over at the SIB, he has made serious efforts to address these problems. He has also had to decide whether to ask the government to tear up the current structure of regulation, or make it work better. He has chosen the latter course, and has not had a great deal of public support from the industry in doing so - though many people, including Mr Stretton, have given much in private to the building of the PIA. That is not enough. It is time for those in the industry who appreciate how much their business relies on public confidence to speak out in support of Mr Large's efforts. And it is time for ministers to make it clear that, if push comes to shove, he will get the legislative time and support he needs to end any further foot-dragging from the industry. The real world demands no less.</p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> OPEC Ministers at Impasse: OPEC is at an impasse and loosely split into two  camps over how to meet demands from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates for  bigger shares of the cartel's production pie, sources said as OPEC continues  its meeting in Vienna, Austria. The ministers from the 13 Organization of  Petroleum Exporting Countries were expected to resume negotiations in small  groups, perhaps today, aimed at reaching an oil production and price agreement  for the first half of 1990. Lack of agreement could send crude prices tumbling  to as low as $15 a barrel in the first quarter of 1990, said one ministerial  source.  </P></p>

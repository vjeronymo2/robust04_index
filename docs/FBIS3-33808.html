The civil aviation minister, Mr. Ghulam Nabi  Azad, apprised the UAE leaders of the anti-India tirade launched  by Islamabad. He held wide-ranging discussions in Dubayy with  the labor minister, Mr. Sayf al-Jarwan who virtually holds the  number two position in the UAE government. Mr. Azad regretted  that Islamabad looks at every bilateral issue through the prism  of Kashmir, making a meaningful dialogue difficult. He squarely  blamed Pakistan for the problem in Kashmir and said Islamabad is  fomenting the trouble to further its own political interests.  The civil aviation minister also said that India is not sure  whether a commitment made by one government in Pakistan will be  honored by the next government. He pointed out that the late  Pakistan prime minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, had committed to  resolving the bilateral problems within the framework of the  Simla agreement.    The UAE minister, Mr. Jarwan, appreciated India's  achievements as also the steps taken for maintaining stability  and communal harmony. He assured Mr. Azad that the Indian  community in UAE will be well protected.</p>

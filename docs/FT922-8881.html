			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: GE Capital takes Dollars 126m BBV stake GENERAL ELECTRIC Capital of the US has paid Dollars 126m for a 1.85 per cent stake in Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's most powerful commercial bank. The acquisition is part of a wide-ranging strategic deal which will allow BBV entry into a number of GE Capital's UK credit operations. In a weekend agreement that finally brought to fruition an idea launched in July, GE Capital has also paid Dollars 24m for 45 per cent of BBV's leasing arm, Finanzia. The Spanish bank, in turn, has paid Dollars 12m for 9.9 per cent of three GE Capital affiliates in the UK: First Personal Bank, First Personal Insurance and First Personal Insurance Brokers. The deal makes GE Capital the second largest single shareholder in BBV after the Japanese insurer, Nippon Life, with 2 per cent. The US group intends to use its arrangements with BBV to spearhead a drive into the Spanish and Portuguese markets in leasing and private credit cards, in which it is the world leader. GE Capital's UK affiliates control a number of prestigious credit card operations, including Harrods and Burtons and, with Finanzia, the two groups plan to create similar business among large Iberian chains. With the entry of GE Capital, Finanzia also plans to enter into project finance - although its objectives still remain undefined - and property finance. BBV has also spent Dollars 20m buying 20 per cent of GE Capital Corporation of Puerto Rico, where it recently also took over Royal Bank of Canada's banking business. Most Spanish banks have now established a strong presence in Puerto Rico, regarded as a key element in developing offshore business from the US.</p>

But officials are declining  comment on whether there was any evidence to indicate that a  single group was behind the two blasts.    Interior Minister Salamah Hammad confirmed the arrest of  five  people on Wednesday, one day after a bomb tore through the Salwa  movie theatre in al-Zarqa, injuring two people, one of them  seriously.    The minister said investigations were continuing and that  investigators were keeping all possibilities open. Other  sources said more arrests were made but did not disclose any  details.    The Salwa blast followed a similar explosion on January 26  at  the Rivoli movie house in downtown Amman which injured seven  people, one of them seriously.    The common features of the two bombings were that both  occurred at establishments screening X-rated movies and the  nature of the explosive devices were the same. In addition, the  exact place where the bombs, described as crude homemade devices  lacking any sophistication, was also the same--near the  projection rooms.    More importantly, however, according to sources, the bombs  were of the same type as that of devices removed and defused  before they exploded at two liquor stores over the past six  months. In turn, those devices appeared to have been built with  the same technique that was used by the extremist underground  group called Jaysh Muhammad (Muhammad's Army), the sources said.    "It is premature to point the finger at any specific group  despite the common features of the explosive devices," said one  source. "Anyone who ever worked with the Afghan Mujahidin could  have learned the technique." [background passage on Muhammad's  Army omitted]    The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the  Brotherhood, has denounced the January 26 bombing, saying  violence was not the means to prevent cinemas from showing films  that many see as incompatible with the conservative Jordanian  society.</p>

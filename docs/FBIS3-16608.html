			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 17, BNS -- Latvian Justice Minister Egils  Levits said Thursday [17 March] at the Saeima [parliament]  plenary meeting that the government would publish agreements,  parafied during Latvian-Russian talks, in Friday's issue of the  official newspaper LATVIJAS VESTNESIS.    Levits noted that the publication contradicts with the  international regulations which do not provide for publication  of agreements not yet signed.    The above mentioned announcement was made responding to  Latvian National Independence Movement's (LNIM) claim that the  Saeima must acquaint the deputies within 24 hours with all  agreements parafied [as received] during interstate talks with  Russia.    Latvian Way faction leader Andrejs Pantelejevs said at the  plenary meeting he was surprised that Fatherland and Freedom,  and LNIM factions have asked people to picket without even  knowing the contents of the agreements.    After returning from the round of talks in Moscow, Latvian  delegation head, Martins Virsis, said Tuesday at a press  briefing that the agreements will be made accessible only after  they will be discussed by the Latvian Government.</p>

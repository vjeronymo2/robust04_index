			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- The United States plans to  scrap a global trade accord proposal on electronic components in  response to what it views as Tokyo's insufficient efforts to  open its lumber market, Japanese trade officials said Wednesday  [16 February].    The U.S. has notified the secretariat of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that it will retract a 60  to 70 percent cut in tariffs on electronic parts as proposed  under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, the  officials said.    Washington is frustrated over Tokyo's failure to meet  repeated U.S. calls for removal of wood product tariffs in  Japan, the officials said.    The latest U.S. action prompted rescheduling from the  originally set deadline of Tuesday for each GATT member country  to show an item-by-item plan for reducing tariff rates, the  officials said.    In the Uruguay Round talks concluded last December, Japan  agreed to halve lumber tariffs. But the step did not fully  satisfy the U.S., which called for total abolition in order to  improve American access to Japan's lumber market.    The latest move is apparently targeted at Japanese exports  as  part of trade sanctions following the collapse of trade  framework talks last week.    The U.S. is likely to exclude from the tariff cut plan  electronic components which serve as Japan's mainstay export  items, the officials said.    The Japanese side, dismissing the U.S. move as against the  GATT accord, is expected to form an alliance with South Korea  and other Asian countries in seeking the tariff reductions on  electronic parts, the officials said.</p>

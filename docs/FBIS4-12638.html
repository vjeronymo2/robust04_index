			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 Apr (MENA)--In its commentary today, the  newspaper AL-AKHBAR says the raid waged by two NATO planes  against Serbian forces positioned around Gorazde will not deter  Serbian commanders from pressing ahead with their criminal  attacks on various towns and villages in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The newspaper asks if a mission by two NATO planes conducted  once every few months is sufficient to end two years of bestial  aggression against the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The paper recalls the "limited" air strike that NATO planes  directed against Serbian forces besieging Sarajevo a few months  ago to force them to pull back their heavy weapons from  Sarajevo's immediate vicinity. Despite that strike, the paper  writes, Serbian forces continued to return the weapons that they  pulled back earlier so as to use them to kill as many of  Sarajevo's inhabitants as possible.    The world must be puzzled by the inability of the United  Nations and the UN Security Council to discipline a state as  small as Serbia, the paper says. AL-AKHBAR asks: What if the  aggressor were a stronger nation and one with more clout than  Serbia?    The paper points out that the Bosnian tragedy, coming after  the Cold War, was a test of the so-called new world order. The  results have been disappointing, AL-AKHBAR concludes.</p>

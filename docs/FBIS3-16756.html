He is doing this by checking his  plans against the opinions of regional leaders.    The meeting between the head of state and Kuban Governor  Nikolay Yegorov lasted several hours. The latter admitted that  he was pleasantly surprised by the president's knowledge of the  state of affairs in Krasnodar Kray. That is why problems  relating to the Kuban's economy and social and cultural spheres  were discussed without any preamble.    The subject of the head of state's special concern was the  development of the agrarian sector. The president focused  attention on the need for more careful preparation and organized  conduct of spring field work, and approved the measures being  adopted by the kray leadership in this sphere.    Programs drawn up in the kray for the development of  industry, construction, culture, the social sphere, and the  fight against organized crime, and approaches to strengthening  Russia's land and maritime borders with the Transcaucasus states  and to the stationing of forces re-stationed in Kuban from  nearby and more distant foreign countries, also met with  Yeltsin's support. The president agreed with the proposals made  by the head of the kray administration aimed at solving  questions of interethnic relations, and he approved of the  governor's intention to introduce a visa system for crossing the  borders of Krasnodar Kray. B. Yeltsin advised Yegorov to  present the relevant proposals to the federal authorities.</p>

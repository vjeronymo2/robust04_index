Chatumongkhon Sonakun said the department is summing up the  results of the talks, held in early February, for Finance  Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin. Mr. Tharin will discuss several  unresolved issues with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen  during the APEC meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, on 19-20 March.  The director general said he hoped that a conclusion could be  reached and that no more official negotiations would be  necessary. Anyway, he realized that it is difficult because  there are several sensitive and complicated issues left to be  tackled.    M.R. Chatumonkhon said these partly came from the failure of  Thai officials negotiating with the U.S. side, which demanded  more than the Thai could grant. Another problem deals with  rigid regulations the U.S. side wanted to put into the protocol,  whereas the Thai side wanted something more flexible.    A source at the Revenue Department said that there are  several points left for negotiations concerning the protocol.  He said the United States wants advantages over Thailand,  whereas the matter itself is very complicated. A still  unresolved important issue is about taxation on benefits. The  United States has a special service set up for financing housing  loans. The United States defended this as helping people to own  homes. Thailand, meanwhile, wanted its BIBF [Bangkok  International Bangking Facilities] covered by the double  taxation protocol, but the United States disagreed.    According to the source, there are unsettled issues  concerning copyrights, such as import tax rates of U.S.  copyrighted movies for distribution in Thailand. Thailand  requested a rate reduction; there was no agreement on this.  Anyway, there is no problem about purchasing real estate.    The U.S. Government attached importance to U.S.-Thai  negotiations on double taxation. The matter was taken up for  discussion during U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's visit,  and there was an agreement to hold official negotiations as soon  as possible. As a result, there were talks in mid- February,  but it yielded no clear-cut solution. Finance Minister Tharin  Nimmanhemin is expected to discuss the problem with Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen during the meeting of APEC finance  ministers pending further official talks in early 1994.</p>

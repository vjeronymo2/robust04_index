			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Opposition launches NHS offensive - Pre-election campaign LIBERAL Democrats yesterday backed guaranteed 'sustained increases' in National Health Service funding, as Labour accused the government of creating a US-style, two-tier health service. NHS spending would be increased in real terms every year if the Liberal Democrats' policy document were implemented. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said service levels would remain constant, or rise, after taking account of demographic changes and higher costs. A fully-costed programme will be given in the party's election manifesto. The final, pre-election version of Labour's health policy will be launched by Mr Neil Kinnock, party leader, and Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, on Thursday. Mr Cook prefaced the launch yesterday by producing a dossier of case studies which he said showed that patients were being forced to go to the private sector for treatment - in effect, 'privatising' the NHS. The Labour proposals will pledge the party to ending the internal market on which the government's NHS reforms of last year are based. This will include an undertaking to abolish the two most highly publicised aspects of the reforms - self-governing trust hospitals and GP fund-holders. The proposals will, however, recognise the case for giving GPs greater involvement in planning. Labour leaders acknowledge the need to keep purchasing and provision of health care separate - an approach which is being adopted in health systems around the world. They believe it can be achieved managerially in health authorities, rather than by market mechanisms. The Liberal Democrat proposals also embrace the separation of responsibility between deciding priorities and running services, but they would be based on service agreements between democratically accountable health authorities and hospitals. The party also plans to abolish charges for eye and dental checks, increase investment and gradually reduce prescription charges. Tobacco promotion would be banned. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health minister, said that whereas in 1987 the then Alliance parties had backed an 'internal market', the Liberal Democrats were now 'desperately in search of a workable health policy'. She added: 'This isn't it.' Mr Ashdown said yesterday that Labour or the Tories should try to form a coalition government with minority parties in the event of a hung parliament, rather than making a 'fast dash' to a second contest. 'The voters want a constructive, more positive approach from their politicians,' he said.</p>

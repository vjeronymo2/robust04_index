			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Take me out to the ball game - Peter Berlin attends a Cuba-America baseball clash THE Barcelona Games are far too friendly. There are no boycotts and no political protests. Sport's Cold War is over. Instead, the competition is full of plucky, freshly independent little republics. Barcelona is crawling with friendly fans from around the globe. Everyone is cheering, no one is booing. This niceness is growing wearying. So, this week, I went to the baseball, to see the US take on Cuba. Baseball is America's national game, but at the Olympics the US team of college boys is David against the Goliath of Cuba's amateur world champions. What I found was a very drab baseball game. Hospitallet is a glum municipality whose share of the Olympic pork barrel is a lovely little ball park plonked in a field a mile south of the town's glummest fringe. There, fans do the Mexican wave even though the stands only border half the field. The public address system plays raucous Cajun and country and western music between innings. And a full house sat unti 1am noisily enjoying a slowly and badly played game draw to a predictable close long after the last busses and trains had stopped running. The college boys started well. They took a 5-0 lead in the first inning thanks to a home run by Michael Tucker and two fielding errors. Antonio Pacheco hit a bases loaded home run in the third inning: 5-4. Suddenly the Americans began to play like the college kids they are rather than the major league millionaires they will be. They committed one basic fielding error after another. The score only stayed close because the Cubans matched them almost error for error. After Pacheco's home run, I headed for the stands where I was way-layed by Angelo, Ilyana and Francisco, three Cubans who live in Barcelona. As Cuba scored twice in the fourth inning to take the lead, their fans danced in the aisles, shouting, singing and waving flags. 'Everyone here is for Cuba,' said Ilyana. 'The Spaniards are for Cuba. The children are for Cuba. Even the Americans are for Cuba.' Well, not quite everyone. Two rows away sat a group from Palm Beach, Florida, some of them slowly drinking beer. Very occasionally one would aim a cheerful taunt at the Cuban fans. They were used to Cubans, said one of the Floridians. 'We've got them coming in all the time, floating in on boats, guys who couldn't make this baseball team.' I sat in an empty seat, notebook in hand. Directly behind me was the biggest and noisiest American. His first yell almost took my head off. His name was Scott Benedict. Benedict had cast a knowledgeable eye over the Cubans. He had timed them running the previous day and had been impressed by their speed. He also approved of their approach. 'I like the Cubans. They know how to play the game.' The game ended at 1am, 9-6 to Cuba. Fans from around the world, who had come together to share four hours of tedium, applauded, then went their separate ways.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bugs Bunny set to lead invasion of Hong Kong Dickson Concepts, the Hong Kong based luxury wholesaler and retailer, is bringing Bugs Bunny and Batman to Hong Kong through a franchise arrangement with Warner Bros Consumer Products. Dickson, which is putting more than HKDollars 150m (USDollars 19.4m) into the project, plans to open Hong Kong and Singapore flagship stores selling exclusive clothing, jewellery, accessories and memorabilia of Warner Bros' cartoons and superheroes around the middle of next year. Further outlets will follow. This is the first time Warner Bros has taken a partner to open and operate stores. Outlets in Europe and the US - which will total 110 by the year-end  -are company-owned, but it was felt local expertise would be important in developing the Asia market. Dickson Concepts will pay a royalty fee to Warner Bros. Mr Dickson Poon, chairman and controlling shareholder of the group, believes the project will become a significant contributor to company profits - although he said it was too early to say if Tweety Pie T-shirts and Daffy Duck mugs could be taken to China, where he has already taken Ralph Lauren clothing. Dickson will be financing the deal from its cash resources. In spite of opening 50 stores throughout Asia in the past 12 months, the company - which also owns the Harvey Nichols store in London - is in a net cash position, and will remain so after the latest investment. Mr Barry Gilbert, a senior vice-president with Warner Bros in California, said the consumer products arm wanted to expand worldwide as rapidly as possible. He was unperturbed by the prospect of problems with counterfeiting in Asia, in spite of being temporarily based in Tsim Tsa Tsui, the heartland of copy watches and clothes depicting Walt Disney and Warner Bros characters with varying degrees of skill and accuracy.</p>

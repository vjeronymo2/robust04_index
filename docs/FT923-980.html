			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Life assurance reforms urged SIR BRYAN CARSBERG, director-general of fair trading, yesterday gave the life assurance industry a 'daunting shopping list' of reforms it should carry out if it wanted to head off tighter regulation. He said at the Chartered Insurance Institute meeting in Preston, Lancashire: 'There should be a shift in competition away from who gives the best commission to who gives the best value to the customer.' His remarks come amid speculation that the Office of Fair Trading will call for much tighter regulation on disclosure of charges when it advises the government on the competition implications of the Securities and Investments Board's review of retail financial regulation. A decision is expected in the next two months. Sir Bryan's speech brought instant condemnation from the Association of British Insurers, which said he had 'betrayed a lack of understanding about how the insurance industry operates'. Sir Bryan suggested that, to stimulate competition, 'league tables' should be published showing the charges levied by different companies for equivalent policies. He also attacked the heavy penalties suffered by investors who surrender endowment policies early. 'No other investments result in such heavy automatic losses,' he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng said here today that Chinese Government will not adopt any  discriminative policy against British businesses as a result of  the breakdown of Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue.    Li said that China welcomes British businesses to  participate  in fair competition on the Chinese market and cooperate with  their Chinese partners on an equal and mutually-beneficial  footing.    Li Peng made the remarks at a reception here this afternoon  sponsored by Zhou Jue, spokesman for the just-ended Second  Session of the National People's Congress.    He said that there has been traditional cooperation between  Chinese and British businesses and that such cooperation has not  been interrupted because of the current state of bilateral  relations.    Yet, the premier said, sound political and diplomatic  relations between the two countries will surely help promote  bilateral trade and economic cooperation and, if the two  countries do not have good political and diplomatic relations,  it is impossible for bilateral economic and trade ties not to  suffer at all.    Li said that the Chinese side is willing to make efforts to  minimize any negative impact on British businesses when they  compete on the Chinese market and make investment in the country.</p>

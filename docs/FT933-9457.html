			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Watch those freebies Many companies are offering unnecessary discounts in a misguided attempt to increase sales and may be needlessly sacrificing a large share of their profits. This is the finding of a survey* carried out by Winkler Marketing, a consultancy. Most of the time companies do not know how much money they are giving away in discounts or even which members of staff are doing the most damage to profits. 'When companies run checks on who gives the money away they are often astonished by how many staff, particularly junior staff, are involved and disbelieve their own figures when they see how much money is involved,' comments John Winkler, managing director. Small companies, in particular, allow themselves to be browbeaten into offering discounts for fear of losing a customer. Large companies are less likely to give in to pressure for discounts but are most likely to demand it from their own suppliers. A survey of more than 500 managers showed that companies could increase their sales by an average of 16 per cent if they insisted on sticking to their published price list. Since most companies make a net profit of between 6 and 10 per cent they may be giving away between two and three times their profits in special deals, Winkler calculates. Financial controllers should take a sample of invoices and analyse any discounts, rebates and special prices including any advertising or promotion allowances, the survey suggests. The analysis should reveal which products are most frequently discounted, which sales executive is involved and who the customers are. A handful of deals should be looked at in depth to compare delivery notes with orders and invoices. Sometimes free goods and extras are not recorded on the invoice though they have been delivered. Free services such as delivery, drawings and technical support should also be taken into account, the survey notes. *How Much Does Unnecessary Discounting Cost British Industry?

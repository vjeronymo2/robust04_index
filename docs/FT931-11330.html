			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Letter: No place for Captain Bligh Sir, I was relieved, yet concerned to read Patricia Morrison's critique of the Channel 4 Cutting Edge programme on John Ridgeway ('Macho harassment, not management', January 27. Relieved, because although it was compelling television I also found the Ridgeway techniques unacceptable and it was good to feel the wind of common sense blowing through her article. Concerned, because as a management trainer and someone who runs leadership and team building courses, using both indoor and outdoor development, I am worried that the rest of us should be tarred with the 'exercise in sadism' brush. Sensitively handled, outdoor training can be an important aid to team development and individuals' growth as leaders. It makes sense, however, that the exercises should be mentally challenging rather than physically demanding and that the trainer should never deliberately mislead course members. The good trainer should facilitate other peoples' learning. This means assisting their development, listening to them and encouraging discussion, rather than playing the role of Captain Bligh.

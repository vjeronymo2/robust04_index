			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Japan's economy is poised  to recover with the government's latest stimulus package  expected to send it into a full pickup phase in the current  fiscal year, Finance Ministry regional bureau chiefs said  Thursday [21 April].    The bright picture came in a report assessing overall  economic activity based on reports by 11 regional financial  bureau heads gathered in Tokyo for a quarterly two-day meeting.  "The time is ripening for an economic recovery, with personal  consumption showing brightness, housing construction remaining  buoyant and public investment staying at high levels," the  report said.    It also cited bright signs in some areas in production, a  turn around in corporate outlook to profits for the first six  months of the current year, and declining bankruptcy cases.    By steadily implementing the February 15.25 trillion yen  stimulus package and the economy-oriented fiscal 1994 budget,  the economy "is expected to move on to a full-fledged recovery  track in the current fiscal year," the report said.    On the down side, it said corporate capital spending plans  for the current year "remain cautious," and the labor condition  is deteriorating, both mainly in the manufacturing sector.</p>

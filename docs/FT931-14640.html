			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Arts: Time for a stronger Eros - Off the Wall SO ONCE again a damaged Eros has had to be removed from its plinth in Piccadilly Circus, and Westminster City Council seems content to spend at least Pounds 30,000 repairing Alfred Gilbert's statue of the god of love in time for another reveller to smash it up. Since the GLC invested Pounds 1m in a great refurbishment in the 1980s, Eros has been nothing but trouble. Yet there is an easy, artistically acceptable, solution. Roger de Grey, president of the nearby Royal Academy, wants to provide a permanent home for the original Eros. He is prepared to pay Pounds 40,000 towards a replacement for the Circus. And the joy of the scheme is that the replacement would not be some latter day copy. Gilbert's original plaster of Eros still exists, in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, and Gilbert's original dealers, the Fine Art Society, has the right to make ten casts from the plaster. It has already made eight and sold six of them, for Pounds 140,000 each. There is an Eros in Vermont, another in Pennsylvania, and one has just been sold to Japan. The idea is to make another from the original plaster, but to re-inforce internally the horizontal leg of the statue, the one that sticks out, which is the weak spot and the target for the wreckers. So Piccadilly Circus will get a stronger Eros, and the RA a world famous exhibit. The FAS would offer a discount to add to the RA's contribution, and Westminster would be well advised spending the money it is lavishing on the repairs on completing the deal. It is much easier to tempt companies into sponsoring the arts if they know that their money is going to be boosted by a contribution from the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, a Government funded honeypot which totals Pounds 4.5m a year and is intended to offer matching money to first time sponsors. At the moment the maximum pay out under the BSIS is Pounds 25,000, but later this month it will be announced that this is to be raised to Pounds 50,000 from April 1. This is serious money, and should give a lift to arts sponsorship which has, to date, ridden the recession well but which faces corporate cut backs in 1993. It is to be hoped that the stimulus will penetrate through to the fund raising office at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, which holds the distinction that it has not managed to secure a penny from the BSIS in the last four years. Covent Garden has been able to hold on to most of its corporate members, but this season not one new production has attracted a commercial sponsor. Companies today are much more interested in getting a measurable return from their sponsorship money, or spreading it into education and local initiatives. The big, black tie, Pounds 100,000 plus spectacular is currently out of fashion, but other national arts companies, notably the ENO and the National Theatre, still manage to find sponsors for most of their new productions. London is awash with watercolours, which should suit the national mood. Watercolours are the British art form - romantic, sensitive, and transient - and the RA's ravishing display from the golden age (see William Packer's review) should boost the World of Drawings and Watercolours which opens just along Piccadilly at the Park Lane Hotel on Wednesday. This hardy annual among specialist fairs usually does well. In the past the bonus from Lloyds of London was often invested in another watercolour for the drawing room. Little chance of that this year, but traditional buyers from the shires, lured to London by the RA exhibition, will be tempted to buy from the 50 dealers. The fact that prices begin at Pounds 50, and are no higher than last year, should help business. The Fair has succeeded in extending the range out from just jolly hollyhock rural views. Gothick Dream will be showing Vorticist and Surrealist drawings while Kate de Rothschild offers Renaissance drawings among all the Sandbys, Cozens, de Wints and Girtins. In vivid contrast another regular fair opens next week, Art 93 at the Business Design Centre, Islington, which is now the only annual concentration of contemporary art in London. It is no competitor to the mammoth fairs held at Basle, Madrid and Chicago, but top dealers like Waddington, Gillian Jason, and Angela Flowers are showing their big names, and Annely Juda has been tempted in for the first time. It is making something of a splash, erecting a monumental sculpture by Anthony Caro, priced at up to Dollars 200,000, on the green in front of the Centre. Just as striking should be the 11 works commissioned by pop star and major collector, Peter Gabriel. Gabriel chose the artists, sent them tracks from his new album, US, and waited for inspiration to hit them. The much admired Andy Goldsworthy only received the lyrics of a song on a fax, but went out and moulded a nest of twigs and branches in a dusty hollow created by the drought near his Scottish home. He then watched as the rains came and washed away his creation, but the photograph is now in the Gabriel collection. Antique dealers always say how much they dislike fairs and that there are too many of them. But anything is better than sitting in an empty shop waiting for the recession to end and every day sees the announcement of another big new one. More and more dealers are forsaking their expensive galleries to deal from home, using fairs as their shop windows through which to meet new customers and catch up on trade talk. Wolfgang Fischer, Vanessa Devereux, Anne Berthoud, David Hughes and Mark Glazebrook are just some leading dealers who have chosen this route.</p>

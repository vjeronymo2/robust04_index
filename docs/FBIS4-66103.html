			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels -- Germany has informed NATO that the  operational part of the German Army in the new laender is to be  put under the control of the Western alliance as of the  beginning of 1995. This has emerged from alliance circles after  the meeting of the NATO Cooperation Council in Brussels on  Wednesday [25 May].    Germany had agreed with the former victorious nations that  its troops in the former GDR should remain outside the  integrated NATO military structure at first. After the  withdrawal of the Russian troops from eastern Germany, Germany  will be free to decide.    The details still need to be agreed upon with NATO. Another  open question is which locations will be available to the  Western alliance. The number of joint maneuvers will also have  to be decided.</p>

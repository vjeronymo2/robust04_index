			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT&amp;T TO OFFER NEW TRANSLATION SERVICE  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph today will unveil a new nationwide telephone  translation service designed to help institutions communicate with callers who  do not speak English.  </P> <P> The new service will be offered to businesses, public utilities, institutions  and providers of emergency services, according to an AT&amp;T statement.  </P> <P> Subscribers would be provided quick access by phone to someone who can  translate a call received from a speaker of a foreign language. AT&amp;T is  expected to announce that Spanish and some Asian languages -- Japanese and  Chinese, for example -- will be among those translated.  </P> <P> The telecommunications giant is expected to release further details at press  conferences today in San Francisco and New York City. Officially, AT&amp;T  would not name the organization providing the translation operations nor  disclose how subscribers would be charged or which languages would be  translated. Sources at the company said AT&amp;T has established a new division  to operate the service.  </P> <P> The new service is not related to a translation service established about two  years ago for Spanish-speaking residential AT&amp;T customers.

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / UK monetarist golden age - alas a myth There is a curious myth that the Conservative government presided over a successful, if initially unpopular, monetarist policy, up to the mid-1980s, which was then wantonly abandoned in pursuit of the snare of the D-Mark exchange rate target from which all our discontents are supposed to arise. This myth has resurfaced in the February Economic Outlook of the London Business Group in an article by Professor Patrick Minford in which he challenges the Outlook's support for the European exchange rate mechanism. 'Going back to monetarism' is his alternative. His own unequivocal yardstick for monetary policy is M0 - notes and coins plus banks' voluntary balances with the Bank of England. Unfortunately Minford does not appear to have looked very closely at his own charts. Indeed, I often wonder whether economists - and not just Minford or those on his side - take their own charts seriously or merely use them to decorate their articles. One of the consolations of not being an econometrician is that I take a great deal of trouble to link my charts to my articles, as harassed members of the FT graphics and statistics department will confirm. The chart in this article is a slightly clearer version of Minford's own to which has been added M4 - the favoured measure of 'broad money', which includes bank and building society deposits. Several features stand out from the M0 line on the chart. There was an extremely savage drop in the growth of M0, far more severe than anything in the past couple of years, during the early Thatcher period. Minford is free to argue that the present squeeze is much tighter than anything then; the truth is we still do not know. But he cannot base his conclusions on his own preferred yardstick. There was a quick recovery in the growth of M0 from late 1982 onwards. Minford approves, at least in retrospect. But the usual policy platform of the technical monetarists is a stable or gradually falling growth of the money supply, which can be monitored in a straightforward way. In the period up to the end of 1987, when the credit boom was gathering momentum, the growth of M0 was stable or even slightly declining. Nigel Lawson's real mistake was to give M0 too much rather than too little house room. Whenever I raised this matter at the 'Gooies' (group of unofficial economic advisers) Minford would loudly inform the chancellor that 'M0' was the government's policy. I have a little more sympathy with the rival version of the story told by Tim Congdon in recent Gerrard and National Economic Reviews. Congdon favours the broader M4 aggregate, and can at least tell a causal story. But his version is also flawed. For, as the chart shows, M4 shot up in the early 1980s, during a very severe squeeze when inflation was tumbling. In fact it was growing as rapidly then as in 1988-89 at the height of the recent boom. Indeed, it was the traumatic experience of the early 1980s that led to the gradual shift from a money to an exchange rate objective. It was only well into 1987 that M4 gave an extremely muted warning of expansionary or inflationary forces. As for bank and building society lending their growth exceeded 20 per cent a year in the squeeze year of 1980 and then remained consistently below that level until 1989 when the boom was starting to run down. The real money supply - that is money adjusted for inflation - to which Congdon now wants us to pay attention, may be a helpful diagnostic tool for the real economy. But it is hopeless for a nominal framework aimed at reducing inflation itself. To come forward to the present situation, Minford cites me as saying that the UK will soon return to growth in spite of high real interest rates. I am sure he writes in all sincerity. But I wish he and his mentor, Sir Alan Walters, would read my actual words carefully before going up in flames. The article that Minford cites (Economic Viewpoint January 9) simply said that high real interest rates 'need not' prevent recovery and had not done so in 1981-82. I leave readers to decide whether my words and his paraphrase mean the same thing. Unfortunately I have left myself no time to discuss a more reflective argument in favour of a UK devaluation within the ERM by Simon Wren-Lewis in the same Outlook. But he is well answered by the Outlook's editors. The latter's arguments are reinforced by a new Institute of Economic Affairs Research Monograph by Cliff Pratten entitled Overseas Investments, Capital Gains and the Balance of payments, out today (Pounds 7.95), which suggests that the UK balance of payments is in much better shape than generally contended.</p>

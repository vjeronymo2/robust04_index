			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Building industry output 'to fall' CONSTRUCTION output is expected to decline by a further 1.5 per cent next year, according to the National Council of Building Material Producers, one of the industry's foremost forecasters. The council warned that a further fall in output, after falls of 8.9 per cent and 8 per cent in 1991 and 1992 respectively, might lead to more cuts and redundancies among building material companies. The main gain the industry could expect next year would be in the housing market, where the value of output in constant 1985 prices was expected to rise by 5.5 per cent to Pounds 3.51bn.</p>

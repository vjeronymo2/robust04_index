			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADOBE FLORES IS A STILL WORTHWHILE HISTORICAL SITE  </P> <P> I was delighted to see the in-depth article on our historic adobe ("Historic  Adobe Flores . . . " by Loretta Schertz Keller, Times, May 16), and I have been  very pleased with the loving care (owner) Mr. (Wallace Robert) McCloskey has  given the house.  </P> <P> How well I remember the day the large azaleas were ripped out and carted away  before the groundbreaking for the new apartments.  </P> <P> A tearful spectacle and one that few neighbors were alerted about, and those  who were didn't spread the word about the disastrous happening about to take  place. A time when an insensitive mayor and City Council could have stepped in  to save the site, or at least the house, for the city of South Pasadena. (I  would like to note that (a portion of) the cactus garden of rare specimens is  city owned.)  </P> <P> It's important, too, to realize that although the "site's historical value was  destroyed by surrounding construction," the house and cactus garden in no way  have lost their importance as a historical monument, and many of us have the  dream that one day it will belong to the city, to be enjoyed and seen by the  public on a regular basis.  </P> <P> RICKI de KRAMER  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

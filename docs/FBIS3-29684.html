The new company is a 13  billion won joint venture between PosData, a telecommunications  service arm of Pohang Iron and Steel Co. (POSCO), and Telstra,  state-owned telecom operator of Australia.    "We will start with the domestic value-added network (VAN)  service market...but in the future we hope to play an active  role in the Northeast Asian market," said Kim Tae-kyu, president  and CEO of Atel, 51 percent of which is owned by PosData.    The company has already taken over some of PosData's VAN  services including electronic data interchange, electronic mail  and network integration and information services. The company  also plans to provide international services in enhanced fax,  voice mail and other VAN services. To this end, the company has  established extensive links with such international services as  CompuServe, Nifty-Serve, EasyNet and SprintNet.    Company officials said they are banking on the technological  and market expertise of Telstra and the geographical location of  Korea to launch into the Northeast Asian region including the  Russian Far East and North Korea. Telstra, which was created in  1992 through a merger of Telecom Australia and international  call carrier OTC, is the second biggest telecom operator in the  Asia-Pacific region after NTT of Japan.    PosData runs a nationwide computer network service called  PosServe and also offers various VAN services including a data  network linking giant steelmaker POSCO and its numerous  subcontractors.</p>

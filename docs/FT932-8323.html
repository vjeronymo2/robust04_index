			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: HK group behind Canadian merger A GROUP of Hong Kong investors is to create a substantial Canadian oil and gas producer through the proposed merger of Numac Oil &amp; Gas of Edmonton and Calgary-based Westcoast Petroleum. The merged company, which will rank among Canada's top 20 energy companies, will be controlled by Mr Cheng Yu-Tung, chairman of New World Development of Hong Kong, and the family of Mr YP Doo, whose Hong Kong interests include Fung Seng Diamond Company. Mr Cheng currently owns 24 per cent of Westcoast and 25 per cent of Numac, while the Doo family holds 15 per cent of Numac and 24 per cent of Westcoast. Several other Hong Kong investors are shareholders in Westcoast, which was spun off earlier this year by Westcoast Energy of Vancouver. Under a letter of intent between the two companies, Numac shareholders will receive one Westcoast common share for each Numac share. Westcoast, currently a private company, will have 50.6m shares outstanding prior to the transaction. Numac has 33.1m shares outstanding. The combined company will operate under the Numac name and be publicly traded. Mr Stewart McGregor, Numac's chief executive, declined yesterday to disclose the financial strength of the new company beyond saying the combined cash flow in the first three months of this year was CDollars 25.2m (USDollars 19.7m). Numac's cash flow is expected to grow rapidly over the next year as a result of its 3 per cent stake in the large Caroline gas deposit in Alberta. Mr McGregor said that a 'much larger' capital and cash flow will facilitate expansion. He predicted that the company's international exposure 'will grow over time'. Mr Cheng and his partners appear to be taking a more gradual approach to their investment in the Canadian oil and gas industry than their compatriot Mr Li Ka-shing, whose acquisition of Husky Oil of Calgary has turned out to be a heavy financial burden. Hutchison Whampoa, the conglomerate controlled by Mr Li, last year took a HKDollars 1.42bn write-down on the Husky investment. Husky last month raised over CDollars 100m from the sale of various oil and gas properties in western Canada. By midday yesterday Numac's share price had risen by 37 cents to Dollars 7 1/2 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>

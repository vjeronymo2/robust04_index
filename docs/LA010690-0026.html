			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLEVELAND PROVES TOO MUCH FOR OUTMANNED CHATSWORTH IN STORMING TO 55-POINT WIN  </P> <P> The word "Chatsworth" was plastered across the front of their jerseys as clear  as day, but Friday night the Chatsworth High basketball team sure looked a lot  like the old Washington Generals, those foils the Harlem Globetrotters still  run rings around.  </P> <P> And the Chancellors had about as much chance of beating Cleveland as the  Generals do of whipping the Globetrotters.  </P> <P> As routs go, Cleveland's 87-32 lambasting of Chatsworth in a Northwest Valley  Conference opener is about as bad as it gets.  </P> <P> Exhibit A: Chatsworth (3-7), which starts two sophomores and has no players  with varsity experience, turned the ball over the first seven times down the  floor.  </P> <P> Exhibit B: When the Chancellors did finally take a shot nearly four minutes  into the first period, it was blocked.  </P> <P> Exhibit C: Chatsworth, which had 14 turnovers in the first period and 34 total,  shot 21% from the field in the first half and 29% for the game.  </P> <P> Exhibit D: The Chancellors trailed, 22-4, after the first quarter and 47-13 at  intermission, when their leading scorer was Delvon Hardaway, with three points.  </P> <P> It was so ugly that Cleveland Coach Marc Paez was making wholesale  substitutions as early as the second period.  </P> <P> "I thought we could control it a little bit, but we didn't control it at all,"  Chatsworth Coach Gary Shair said. "I'm frustrated. We'll never have a chance  against Cleveland."  </P> <P> Shair's frustration was evident when he was whistled for back-to-back technical  fouls in the third period, resulting in four free throws by Cleveland's Joe  Eddings. It didn't much matter -- Chatsworth trailed, 63-15, at the time.  </P> <P> It was just another night at the office for Cleveland (11-3), winners of 10 of  its last 11.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers led, 14-0, before Chatsworth even took a shot. Eddie Hill and  Brandon Martin each had 12 points by halftime -- only one less than the  Chatsworth team.  </P> <P> "I really didn't go in expecting a rout. There's always a little bit of fear  for me in any game," Paez said with a straight face. "I thought our starters  went in and did what they had to do. They created a big spread, and we were  able to put our other kids in at an early juncture."  </P> <P> Shair, for one, was pleased Cleveland didn't rub salt in the open wound that  was his team.  </P> <P> "They could have been worse," Shair said. "But he played everybody. He didn't  rub it in. I appreciate that."  </P> <P> Martin led Cleveland with a game-high 17 points. Hill and reserve center  Patrick McCook each scored 12, and Eddings added 11 off the bench.  </P> <P> Chris Dumbar was the lone to Chancellor to reach double figures, scoring 11  points -- three on a three-point basket that put Chatsworth over 30 points for  the game.  </P></p>

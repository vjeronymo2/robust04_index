			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> China Club Jams On: Contrary to an item in Monday's Morning Report, the China  Club's legendary Monday night Projams are still alive and well.  </P> <P> The action has never stopped, but the players have changed, said club publicist  Joe D'Ambrosio. Jim Ehinger and the Nasty Survivors were moved to Thursday  nights to make room for the Kal David Band, which performs at the Projam on  Monday nights. Kal David, former member of the Fabulous Rhinestones, is known  to invite his friends to perform. Recent friends who have dropped by include  Stevie Wonder, Keith Emerson, John Entwistle, Jeff (Skunk) Baxter, Joe Walsh  and Sam Kinison. GREG BRAXTON and BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Price hikes in the city of Guangzhou are slowing  down somewhat. According to statistics, in April this year, the  city's general level of retail prices and general level of  wholesale prices were 17.5 and 21 percent higher respectively  than the same period last year. However, compared with March  this year, the margins of increase were 3.7 and 4.6 percent  lower respectively.    The main reason why price hikes in April slowed somewhat is  that the government has adopted relevant measures to curb price  increases.</p>

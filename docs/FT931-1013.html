			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Society fraudster jailed for five years MR DARIUS GUPPY, a society gems dealer turned fraudster, and Mr Benedict Marsh, his business partner, were yesterday jailed for five years over a bogus robbery and false insurance claim. They were each fined Pounds 533,000 for conspiracy to steal Pounds 1.2m from the gemstones company of which Mr Guppy was an executive director, and warned that they would serve an extra three years if it was not paid within six months. The sentences came five weeks after the end of a three-month trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court, east London. Judge Andrew Brooks sentenced each man to five years for conspiracy to defraud Lloyd's of London of Pounds 1.8m, five years concurrently for conspiracy to steal Pounds 1.2m from their company - for which the Pounds 533,000 fine was also imposed - and 12 months concurrently for conspiracy to commit false accounting. They had pleaded not guilty at their trial to the three charges. At a later hearing on March 4 Mr Guppy, who was best man at the wedding of Earl Spencer, pleaded guilty to three charges of falsely claiming he was entitled to repayment of VAT for bogus gold bullion exports, and Mr Marsh pleaded guilty to one charge. Yesterday the judge imposed a fine of Pounds 2,000, with an alternative of 45 days imprisonment, on each charge. Judge Brooks also ordered that the two men be barred from being company directors for at least 10 years.</p>

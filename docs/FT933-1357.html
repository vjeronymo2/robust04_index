			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Arts: Leipzig cramps the Nash - Concert Visibly, the Nash Ensemble's loyal audience grows ever more ancient; and in the first concert of their Wigmore Hall season on Wednesday, the Ensemble sounded fairly crumbly too. Perhaps they were disheartened by the prospect before them. Until January, they are committed to a 'Leipzig Gewandhaus 250th Anniversary Series' - and it is a nonsense. The introductory programme note promised re-creations of chamber music-making in the Gewandhaus hall, from Mendelssohn's time as conductor of its great orchestra to the late 19th century. In fact the next three concerts will consist exclusively of hyper-familiar standards by Mozart, Brahms, and Mendelssohn, with a trio by the latter's colleague Niels Gade (1817-90) as prelude to the Mozart clarinet quintet on a January morning. Far from extending the Nash's range (or ours), this series cramps it cruelly: no room for any new works, nor the serious rediscoveries - usually French - for which we love them. This first concert was slightly more adventurous, but to no great purpose. To hear a piano sextet by the Englishman William Sterndale Bennett (1816-75), a protege of the leading German composers of his day, we had to arrive by 6. The main concert at 7.30, in which Mozart and Mendelssohn evergreens were cushioned by a Spohr romance, a Weber song, and seven soprano solos and duets by Rossini (no doubt Rossini was heard in Leipzig: but so what?), ran on long past 10 o'clock. By then a sizeable fraction of the audience had gone. The Sterndale Bennett sextet, with a graceful introduction from his great-great-grandson Barry, seemed a well-schooled piece of real talent. How much talent was hard to judge - for it is almost a mini-piano-concerto, and Ian Brown sounded imperfectly familiar with the piano part (most uncharacteristic of him, but all too plain). One could only guess at what a more assured performance might find in the music. In Mendelssohn's second book of Songs without Words later, Brown proved beyond doubt that their essential vein of dewily lyrical, knowing innocence is not his vein. Not with his plonking touch] - and certainly not on the Wigmore's big, booming Bosendorfer, the like of which was never heard until long after Mendelssohn died. Transcriptions of the 'Songs' for the Albert Hall organ would have been no more implausible. Brown is happier with notes that come thicker and faster; he was far more at home with his dashing role in the D minor Trio, but for the mild violin and cello his Bosendorfer loomed like a hungry whale over minnows. Earlier, Mozart's great G minor string quintet got a decently musical performance, though the long accompanying passages for strings throbbing in unison were chronically untidy. The songs were all right. If Lillian Watson's coloratura is more casual about pitch than it used to be, and the new-found depth of Lynn Dawson's soprano was unsuited to her airy Spohr, they still collaborated fetchingly in Rossini. Nevertheless, the whole protracted farrago lacked any point: it was a re-creation of nothing, it shed no new light on anything, and by the honourable Nash standards it was not distinguished playing. Hand on heart, I should say that only the cellist Christopher van Kampen's bass line gave me consistent musical pleasure.</p>

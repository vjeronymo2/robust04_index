The Sao Paulo Bovespa index had risen 1.4 per cent by midday in strong volume of Cr89.8bn (Dollars 61m), recouping a drop recorded on Monday that was mostly due to profit-taking. The Rio de Janeiro index showed a 0.9 per cent increase, following a 0.3 per cent rise on Monday. Both exchanges experienced strong upswings last week, as the government's export incentive package, indications of a modest decline in the monthly rate of inflation, and progress in the debt talks all encouraged investors. The Bovespa index chalked up a 26.7 per cent increase last week, with daily turnover rising above Cr100bn.

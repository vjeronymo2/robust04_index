			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWELL HELPS GIVE DODGERS SECOND-HALF RESTART, 3-2  </P> <P> Usually it is just another baseball word that doesn't really mean what it says.  Usually it is a word, applying to relief pitchers, that is nothing more than a  statistic.  </P> <P> But then there are nights like Thursday, when, in front of 23 fidgety Dodger  teammates, reliever Jay Howell truly recorded a save.  </P> <P> With five pitches in the ninth inning against the St. Louis Cardinals, Howell  saved not just a game, but a feeling -- the best feeling these Dodgers have had  since the start of summer. For a team stumbling away from a first-half crash,  he saved a second-half start.  </P> <P> Entering the game with one out and runners on first and second and the Dodgers  leading, 3-1, he allowed a run-scoring single to Jose Oquendo but retired John  Morris and Leon Durham on three pitches to close out a 3-2 victory before  33,358 fans at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> "To use an expression -- he's been a lifesaver," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda  said of Howell.  </P> <P> "To let the team down tonight would have been a crime," Howell said.  </P> <P> The Dodgers returned to work following the three-day All-Star break in pleasant  spirits. First, there was a short pregame talk by Lasorda. Then there was a  quick run in the first inning on Eddie Murray's RBI single, one of his three  hits and two runs batted in. Then there was starter Orel Hershiser, allowing  just four hits and one run, on a bases-loaded walk, in eight innings.  </P> <P> Then came the ninth. Hershiser allowed a one-out ground single to right field  by Terry Pendleton. Two pitches later, Tom Brunansky grounded a single to the  other side.  </P> <P> "I was just working on reserve then," said Hershiser, who threw 119 pitches. "I  didn't have the bullets to get out of it."  </P> <P> So, in from left field walked the Dodgers' late-night weapon. He stopped calmly  in the outfield to hand his jacket to a bat boy. He calmly threw his warm-up  pitches and got ready to face Oquendo, who at the time had 15 hits in 30  at-bats this season against the Dodgers.  </P> <P> "He's batting about 1.000 against us, so I figured the odds are in my favor  that he'd pop one up," Howell said.  </P> <P> Oquendo threw out his bat, and the ball bounced off it into right field for an  RBI single to make it 3-2.  </P> <P> "Guess he proved me wrong," Howell said.  </P> <P> His logic and instincts having failed him, Howell then turned to his memory for  help. The next batter was pinch-hitter Morris, who faced Howell last season.  </P> <P> "I remembered that he had spanked a first-pitch fastball to center field  against me, so I figured he might go for the first pitch again," Howell said.  </P> <P> And so Morris did, grounding the ball to Murray at first base for the second  out. But the runners moved up, and with pinch-hitter Durham batting, Howell's  strategy changed.  </P> <P> "I had first base open, so I could afford to try more different things with  him," Howell said. "But with a guy on third base, I couldn't afford to try a  curveball and bounce it past the catcher and have the guy score the tying run."  </P> <P> Translated: He needed to throw fastballs, but he could throw them anywhere he  wanted. He chose the inside of the plate.  </P> <P> He threw strike one there, and then strike two, and Durham finally grew tired  of watching. Howell's next pitch was a waist-high strike, but Durham swung and  missed, and the Dodgers had won.  </P> <P> With Howell pitching, nobody really expected anything different.  </P> <P> When asked about Howell, Kirk Gibson simply said, "Hey, how many has the guy  blown?"  </P> <P> The answer is two. In 18 save opportunities, Howell has 16 saves and has  allowed just four earned runs in 47 innings for an 0.77 earned-run average.  Considering that his career ERA is 3.53, he is having the season of his life,  or most relief pitchers' lives.  </P> <P> Not everybody appreciates this. Cincinnati Reds reliever Rob Dibble, when  learning that Howell made the All-Star team, sarcastically said, "So, big, bad  Jay Howell made the All-Star team."  </P> <P> Howell shrugged. "His comments speak for themselves," he said. "I know I  wouldn't have said anything bad about him if he made the team. This winter, the  Dodgers said, 'We appreciate you,' by giving me the three-year contract (worth  $3 million). That said it loud and clear."  </P> <P> And Thursday illustrated that worth plain and simple.  </P> <P> "You can't waste efforts like tonight," Howell said.  </P> <P> He was talking about many things, among them the 8 1/3 good innings by  Hershiser that ultimately made him 10-7 while lowering his ERA to 2.45. Anybody  want to guess his record at this time last season? It was 13-4 with a 2.62 ERA.  </P> <P> "I figured it was about the same," Hershiser said. "We just don't have quite as  good of a team as last year yet."  </P> <P> Howell also saved the good efforts of Murray, who has 14 hits in his last 41  at-bats (.341) to raise his average to .247. He was the main reason the Dodgers  finally figured out Thursday's starter and loser, Ken Hill, a rookie who was  2-0 with an 0.78 ERA against them in three previous starts this season.  </P> <P> Somebody wondered if, as Murray saw more pitchers for the second and third  times in this league, whether he wouldn't be ruining a lot more nights.  </P> <P> "It's always easier when you see somebody for a second or third time," Murray  said. "It makes hitting a little more comfortable. And I'm getting a little  more comfortable."  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Alfredo Griffin's hot streak, in which he has 48 hits in his last 140 at-bats  (.343), is even more impressive considering what is on his mind. Griffin, who  had two more hits Thursday to improve his batting average to .280, said that he  has been worried about his sick mother, who is hospitalized in the Dominican  Republic. He visited her over the All-Star break and is trying to bring her to  the United States for the first time. "She's been sick for a long time, so I'm  prepared for it, but it's still hard," Griffin said. "When I go see her, she is  happy, and when I leave she is sad. I want to get her over by my side. But she  never wants to leave our home." . . . Tim Leary confirmed Thursday that he has  been sent to the bullpen. While he didn't sound thrilled about it, he said he  was too excited over last week's birth of his baby girl to be mad. "I'm still  high from the baby; I don't have time to get angry," Leary said. "I still think  my best value is as a starter." The Dodgers told Leary he would probably start  in one of the two doubleheaders next weekend in Pittsburgh and that his  situation could possibly be re-evaluated after that. "I'll wait until then and  see what happens," Leary said. . . . John Dempsey, son of Dodger catcher Rick  Dempsey, has signed a contract with the St. Louis Cardinals and will join an  instructional league team in Phoenix Saturday. Dempsey, a catcher at Crespi  High School, was the Cardinals' 10th-round draft pick in June. . . .  Albuquerque pitcher Ramon Martinez, likely to be  </P> <P> in a Dodger uniform by Monday afternoon as the starting pitcher against the  Chicago Cubs, was the starter and winner Wednesday night in the triple-A  All-Star game at Columbus, Ohio. In leading the National League minor leaguers  to a win over the American League prospects, Martinez allowed one run in three  innings.  </P></p>

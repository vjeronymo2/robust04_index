			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 10% TAX ON FAIRGROUND ADMISSIONS RESCINDED  </P> <P> After protests from more than 200 employees, concessionaires and promoters of  events at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds, the Pomona City Council has  rescinded a 10% admissions tax enacted a week ago.  </P> <P> The council instead instructed City Administrator Julio Fuentes to work with  Ralph Hinds, president of the Los Angeles County Fair Assn., to seek other  sources of revenue.  </P> <P> Hinds said the tax, which would have applied to admissions and fees for exhibit  space at all events at the fairgrounds except the county fair and off-track  betting, would have had a devastating effect on fairground operations, and  could have cost hundreds of jobs.  </P></p>

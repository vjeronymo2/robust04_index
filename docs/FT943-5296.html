			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Arts: Barricades up at the Bastille - A time-bomb has exploded at the Paris Opera with the sacking of its music director When the Paris Opera Orchestra meets today for the first time since the summer holidays, it is unlikely to make music. The players are almost certain to vote for a strike in support of their sacked music director, Myung-Whun Chung. Without an orchestra, the Opera will be unable to open its season in two weeks' time. A strike at the Opera is nothing new. It has been a financial, administrative and artistic mess for the past 15 years. Its huge, high-tech Bastille headquarters - inaugurated in 1989 as one of President Francois Mitterrand's grands travaux - has only made matters worse, lurching from one catastrophe to the next. But this dispute is different. It is the first major upset to the French government's plan to restructure the Opera, restore its artistic credibility and reduce its deficit. That plan places complete executive power in the hands of one man - Hugues Gall, an internationally-respected opera administrator who currently runs Geneva's Grand Theatre. He is due to take up his post in Paris next summer. Gall, assisted by the Opera's interim management, opened talks with Chung in March, aimed at renegotiating the Korean conductor's lucrative long-term contract. As it stood, the contract invested Chung with artistic powers which Gall himself expected to assume. Gall wanted to reduce Chung's responsibilities, to shorten the contract and limit his pay. At the end of June, Chung received an ultimatum saying that unless he accepted the terms offered, the contract would be annulled. On August 12, he was dismissed. Since then, the conflict has descended into a legal tussle, with Chung waging a vociferous public campaign to portray himself as the wronged party. He appeared to win an important victory last week when a Paris court ordered his reinstatement - at least until the grounds for his dismissal were clarified (which might take months). But the ruling could not be enforced: by a quirk of French law, no one can forcibly enter a public establishment against the wishes of its management. On arriving at the Bastille, Chung and his lawyer found their way to the rehearsal room barred by the interim director, Jean-Paul Cluzel, and a posse of security men. The locks to his office had been changed. His furniture was impounded. Until now, Chung has had the biggest voice in the Opera's artistic decision-making. He had a free hand in choosing repertoire, guest conductors, production teams and singers. His contract guaranteed him a minimum of 30 performances a year, rising to 50 over an eight-year period. His fee for each performance would have increased from FFr80,000 (Pounds 10,000) in 1992 to FFr177,000 (Pounds 20,000) by 2000. He was also paid a salary as music director. The package was worth FFr3.5m a year at the time of his dismissal - or FFr8m (Pounds 1m) by the end of the decade. It was a time-bomb planted by Pierre Berge, Chung's patron and friend of President Mitterrand, in the dying months of the last Socialist government. Berge knew it would blow up in the face of an incoming centre-right administration with its own ideas about how to run the Opera. Chung's pay made good headlines, but the crux of his conflict with Gall was artistic power. 'Gall made it clear he had to take all the decisions,' says Chung. 'Of course you need a strong man at the top, but not a dictator. I have never taken decisions alone on casts and production teams. In any normal situation, the management discusses these with the conductor, and a decision is taken by mutual agreement. Under the terms I was offered, they could have told me to conduct 40 ballet performances and I would have had no choice.' Chung was appointed shortly before the Bastille opened in 1989, a little-known 36-year old who did not even speak French. The Opera orchestra had been decimated by months of inactivity. In the five intervening years, Chung has been the only stable element in the Opera's administration. While a string of managers came and went, Chung filled the vacuum and accumulated power. He made the orchestra his priority - defending its rights, improving standards and bringing in lucrative recording work. He enjoyed his job at the Bastille, and wanted to continue. Chung's dedication and skill earned him the respect of a notoriously fractious group of musicians. 'It was anarchy when he came,' recalls the cellist Marc Latarjet. 'He did a good job, he raised our profile. We had concerts, recordings and tours, so we weren't always stuck in the pit. Nobody will do this for us in future. We need a music director to keep discipline and resolve our problems. Now someone wants to destroy the only thing that was good in this troubled house.' Gall had always made clear that Chung would not figure strongly in his plans. He did not need a music director; at most, he wanted someone to keep the orchestra in shape. While acknowledging Chung's achievements, Gall says the conductor's advisers exaggerated his experience and ability. 'Chung makes himself out to be on the level of the top ten conductors in the world. The gap between his performance and theirs is important. If you look at Haitink at Covent Garden, he has none of the powers in Chung's contract, and not half the money.' Gall's brief is to put the Opera in order. To do that he must run it the way Rudolf Bing ran the Met for 22 years, the way Gall's mentor Rolf Liebermann ran the Opera in the 1970s - with absolute power gathered in his hands alone. Those were the conditions on which he accepted the job. He had no intention of sharing responsibilities with Chung. Gall set out his plans in a report last autumn. He would stick to agreed spending limits. He would close both theatres (the Palais Garnier and the Bastille) at different times, to carry out the repairs and investment necessary to their efficient running. He would transfer the grand classical ballets to the Bastille, and return a select slab of the opera repertory to the Garnier. He would provide a quick injection of what the Opera has been missing - mainstream repertory in non-weird productions, capable of being frequently revived. On the basis of these reforms, he hoped to lure back the top-rank conductors who have shunned the Opera since the Liebermann era. Gall is viewed by most observers as the one person capable of sorting out the Opera's problems. His only mistake so far is to have expected Chung to go quietly.</p>

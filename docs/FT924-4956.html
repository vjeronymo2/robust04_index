			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Greens urged to join pact with France's Socialists FRANCE'S weakened Socialist party renewed calls over the weekend for a partnership with the country's two environmental groupings, in an attempt to reverse a conservative victory in legislative elections next March. Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialist party, asked them to join a broad left-wing coalition of 'forces of progress' also including independents and reformists. His call, at a meeting to prepare the Socialists' election strategy, comes nearly a month after Generation Ecologie and the Verts agreed to an electoral pact, expected to win them their first significant presence in the national assembly. Socialists agreed over the weekend to reserve 30 constituencies for non-Socialist candidates, including ecologists. However, politicians of both green parties have so far been unwilling to join forces with the Socialists on the grounds that they would do better alone.</p>

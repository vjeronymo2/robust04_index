			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / If Cardoso runs, Brazil may pay: Angus Foster reports on inflation's foe tempted by the presidency Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso was recently asked what it was like to be Brazil's finance minister, a tough job in a country plagued by near hyper-inflation and discredited governments. 'It's not the worst job in Brazil, it's the worst in the world,' he said. After lasting nearly a year in the post - something of a record for a Brazilian finance minister these days - Mr Cardoso appears to be preparing to quit. Under Brazilian law he must do so by April 2 if, as widely expected, he wants to run for president in elections in October. But it is a difficult decision. Mr Cardoso's patiently negotiated plan to bring down annual inflation of 2,500 per cent is not yet fully in force. Economists say the plan is the most promising in recent years. But key elements, such as a balanced budget, remain vulnerable to election-year calls for higher spending. In an otherwise weak government, Mr Cardoso is seen as the only politician able to resist those calls. Even if he chooses his successor as finance minister, the plan may still be in doubt. His Brazilian Social Democrats party (PSDB) is small and has so far failed to cement an alliance with a larger grouping. This is partly because of uncertainty about the plan, which is seen as crucial to Mr Cardoso's election chances. But inflation is unlikely to fall until the plan's final phase and the launch of a new currency, probably in May. Mr Cardoso must therefore decide whether to run without knowing if he has done enough to hope for victory. 'He is under tremendous pressure from all sides,' according to a member of Mr Cardoso's economic team. 'His party wants him to run. But it could seriously damage the plan and our first real chance for ages to bring down inflation.' Mr Cardoso, 63 this June, is one of the outstanding Brazilians of his generation. Born into a military family, he trained as a sociologist and later taught at the University of California at Berkeley and Cambridge. His best known works explored 'dependency', a theory which sought to explain Latin America's underdevelopment as a consequence of the continent's dependence on capital and technology from the US and Europe. His links with the left incurred the ire of Brazil's military rulers in the mid-1970s and he was banned from teaching at the University of Sao Paulo. When democracy returned in 1984, Mr Cardoso switched from academia to politics. After losing the race for mayor of Sao Paulo, he was elected a senator in 1986. Two years later he helped found a new political party, the PSDB. Unusually in Brazil, the party and Mr Cardoso have a reputation for clean government. Their policies are slightly left of centre and include social welfare reform and income redistribution. But personality rather than ideology wins Brazilian elections. Mr Cardoso's supporters claim he alone can attract popular support from both the left and right. Observers believe Mr Cardoso's broad appeal would provide a strong challenge to either the current presidential favourite, Mr Luiz Inacio 'Lula' da Silva of the left-wing Workers' party (PT), or a right-wing candidate such as Mr Paulo Maluf, mayor of Sao Paulo. His political strength stems from his experience and prestige in Congress. As finance minister he has persuaded Congress to back his economic policies, even though the government relies on a weak coalition for support. He has also managed, at least so far, to persuade Congress of the need for a balanced budget to fight inflation. 'Fernando has a great capacity of persuasion. He is the first person to persuade the Brazilian public that the deficit is important,' says Mr Antonio Delfim Netto, a former planning minister whose views have often not coincided with Mr Cardoso's. His other advantage is that, as a member of the country's elite, he has a natural appeal among Brazil's middle classes and the media. Both groups are wary of Mr da Silva's strong showing. Mr Cardoso has also won support from some Sao Paulo businessmen, who would normally be wary of his soft-left views and intellectual background. There are still large question marks over Mr Cardoso's candidacy. The most important is whether, as an intellectual and member of the elite, he can attract enough support among workers. Although good on television, he is not a natural orator and is uncomfortable with crowds. Last month he appeared on a down-market TV game show. He looked awkward and out of touch with the studio audience of housewives. This drawback may be especially acute in the country's economically backward north and north-east regions, where more than a third of the country's 90m electors live. According to the latest opinion polls, Mr Cardoso would lose badly to the more populist Mr da Silva in all states in that area. Nationally, Mr Cardoso trails Mr da Silva by 31 per cent to 47 per cent. But in big north-eastern states such as Bahia Mr Cardoso's support falls to 21 per cent. Mr Francisco Weffort, a political scientist and PT supporter, describes Mr Cardoso as 'a first rate politician with a vision of modernisation'. 'But he just doesn't know how to link emotionally with the masses and in this country that's important,' he says.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TREADWAY PROVIDES BRAVES WITH UNEXPECTED POWER -- 3 HOMERS  </P> <P> Jeff Treadway, hardly known for power, hit three home runs to drive in six runs  Saturday night as the Atlanta Braves beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 12-3, at  Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Treadway had only 14 lifetime home runs in 591 at-bats entering the game and  never more than one homer in a major league game. He is the first Atlanta  player to hit three homers in one game since Ken Griffey did it on July 22,  1986.  </P> <P> The Braves scored five times in the third inning. Greg Olson led off with a  walk, moved to second on Ron Gant's one-out single and Treadway followed with  his third homer of the season. Jim Presley and David Justice added RBI singles  in the inning.  </P> <P> In the fourth, Gant singled, stole second and scored on Presley's two-out  double. The Braves added three runs in the fifth inning. Gant's fly ball scored  a run and Treadway hit his second homer of the game. In the seventh, he hit a  two-run homer.  </P> <P> The loss knocked the Phillies out of first place in the East.  </P> <P> The Phillies retired the jersey number of former third baseman Mike Schmidt  before the game.  </P> <P> Houston 8-12, Chicago 1-3 -- Glenn Davis, who had only two hits in his previous  23 at-bats, hit three homers and drove in nine runs at Chicago.  </P> <P> The homers tied a club mark for a doubleheader set by Roman Mejias against the  Milwaukee Braves on May 2, 1962.  </P> <P> In the opener, Davis had two homers and five RBIs. His bases-clearing double in  the eighth inning of the second game combined with a homer to give him four  RBIs.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 5, Montreal 3 -- Barry Larkin singled off reliever Tim Burke with  the bases loaded in the ninth inning at Montreal to break a 3-3 tie give the  Reds the victory.  </P> <P> The Reds have won 17 of 21 road games.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 10, San Francisco 4 -- Wally Backman had three hits and drove in  three runs and Doug Drabek won his sixth consecutive game at Pittsburgh as the  Pirates moved into first place in the East.  </P> <P> Backman's two-run double keyed Pittsburgh's three-run second inning against  Scott Garrelts (1-5).  </P> <P> New York 11, San Diego 0 -- Sid Fernandez pitched seven shutout innings and the  Mets took advantage of bad fielding by shortstop Joey Cora at New York.  </P> <P> Mike Marshall walked with one out in the second inning, and Daryl Boston and  Mackey Sasser followed with singles to load the bases. After Fernandez singled  to score Marshall, two more runs scored when Gregg Jefferies' potential  double-play grounder went through Cora's legs for an error. Fernandez scored  the fourth run of the inning on a wild pitch.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir </F> 'Arafat by Arielle Thedrel in Tunis; date not given: "'Arafat:  `Israelis are Destroying Peace Process'"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Thedrel] According to the  Washington agreements, the Israeli Army should be out of Gaza  and Jericho by 13 April. Is it still possible to keep to this  schedule?    ['Arafat] We, the Palestinians, are ready. As always, the  obstacles are coming from the Israeli side. Let me give you an  example. On 31 March we signed an agreement according to the  terms of which Israel undertook to accelerate negotiations on  the autonomy of Gaza and Jericho. Article 6 of this agreement  stated that the Palestinian police force was to be deployed one  week later. A few days ago we were about to send in the first  wave of this force when the Israelis objected on a number of  pretexts. They also suspended the Cairo negotiations to attend  the Holocaust commemoration ceremonies. Why then, did they not  also suspend the economic committee negotiations under way in  Paris?    I regret to say that the Israelis are maneuvering to avoid  having to precisely and honestly apply what we decided on. In  this same agreement signed last week, Israel accepted to  accelerate the process of withdrawing its troops. However, last  Thursday, Israeli Foreign Minister Mr. Peres announced that the  negotiations -- not the withdrawal -- could be completed by the  end of the month. Clearly, this is maneuvering.    [Thedrel] Would you go as far as to break off negotiations  if  the deadlines are not met?    ['Arafat] That will up to the PLO bureau to decide. Remember  Israeli Prime Minister Mr. Rabin's slogan: "No fixed deadlines."  In December, at our meeting in Cairo, Rabin promised me the  Israeli withdrawal would begin in 10 days. Several months have  gone by and we are still at the same point. Mr. Rabin did not  keep his promise, but nonetheless I agreed to continue with the  negotiations in Oslo, Davos, Cairo, etc. Each time, we reached  agreements which were then not respected. Now we have reached  an impasse situation. The deadline of 13 April is almost upon  us and I can still not see any concrete results on the ground.  When 13 April has passed, we will have to take a very close  look at the situation and face up to our responsibilities. We  will have to tell our people the truth. The Israelis are  currently destroying the peace process and its credibility.  These delays and hesitations are playing into the hands of the  extremists.    [Thedrel] But by issuing an ultimatum to the Israelis, are  you not also playing into the hands of the extremists? The  Hamas Islamic fundamentalists have enjoined you to call off the  peace negotiations for the past year.    ['Arafat] I do not take orders from Hamas. I was elected by  the Palestinian National Council, not Hamas. It is my duty to  ask the international community and the Security Council to  shoulder their responsibilities and not to leave me standing  alone against the Israeli government's maneuvering .    [Thedrel] How do you plan to defeat Palestinian extremism?    ['Arafat] I will be able to reply to that question when I am  in Jericho. For the time being, that is Israel's responsibility.    [Thedrel] Why did you not personally condemn the Afula  attack  last week?    ['Arafat] The PLO condemned it. What distinction do you make  between me and PLO? I am the one who gives the orders. Do not  forget, either, that Palestinians were killed at Afula also.    [Thedrel] Can the current obstacles be overcome rapidly?    ['Arafat] Yes, if there is the will to do so. If this  region, which is very important strategically, does not find  peace , it will be thrown into confusion. However, if we do  manage to find peace, it will signal the start of a whole new  era.</p>

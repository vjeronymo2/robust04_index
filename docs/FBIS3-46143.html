			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State </F> Economic and Trade Commission, by unidentified reporters on 12  January; place not given]    [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- [Reporter] The Fifth  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress Standing  Committee officially passed the "Company Law of the People's  Republic of China." In your opinion, what is the practical  significance of its promulgation and implementation?    [Chen] The Company Law just passed is the first company law  of New China as well as an important law for the establishment  of a socialist market economy. Its formulation embodies the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee on closely integrating reform policy with legislation  policy and on using law to guide, expedite, and protect the  smooth progress of reform. The law was formulated and will be  implemented for the purpose of providing a legal basis for the  organization of the new enterprise type. It is significant in  terms of meeting the needs of establishing a modern enterprise  system and promoting the development of a socialist market  economy.    [Reporter] What role does the Company Law play in  establishing a socialist market economy?    [Chen] The role played by the promulgation and  implementation of the Company Law in establishing a socialist  market economy is mainly manifested in the following four  aspects:    1. It is conducive to standardizing the market's behavior in  the organization of its principal part, to invigorating  enterprises, to deepening reform of enterprises, to establishing  a modern enterprise system, and to enabling a good market order  to take shape.    2. It is conducive to accelerating the pace of transforming  enterprises' operating mechanisms; to clearly defining property  rights involved in relationships and improving the legal person  system of enterprises; to protecting the accumulation and  circulation of funds; to protecting the legitimate rights and  interests of companies, shareholders, and creditors; and to  promoting scientific and democratic decision-making through a  legal system by enterprises in operation and management, thereby  enabling them to become truly legal person entities.    3. It is conducive to accelerating the nurture and  improvement of a market system, standardizing transactions on  the market, and maintaining the order of fair competition,  thereby giving play to the basic role of the market mechanism in  the distribution of resources.    4. It is helpful for the government to change functions,  exercise administration according to law, truly separate its  functions from those of enterprises, and thereby employ legal  means to conduct macroeconomic regulation and control in a  better way to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy national  economic development [cu jin guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian  kang fa zhan 0191 6651 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643  0256 1660 4099 1455] as well as sweeping social progress.    [Reporter] How will you properly organize the study and  propaganda of the Company Law now that it has been promulgated?    [Chen] After the Company Law was promulgated and before it  officially goes into effect on 1 July, first of all, we must  properly organize its study and propaganda in order that people  may understand the essence of its guidelines and be familiar  with its specific articles and regulations. The economic and  trade commissions at all levels must adopt various forms to  conduct intensive study and propaganda and, in particular, must  properly organize its study by the leaders of large and  medium-sized state enterprises. We must widely publicize basic  knowledge concerning the Company Law, and treat the task as an  important element of the "second five-year plan" for the  economic and trade commissions and their affiliated  organizations to popularize laws. This is a prerequisite for  the implementation of the Company Law.    [Reporter] How can the Company Law be effectively  implemented in the course of deepening reform of enterprises and  in the course of establishing a modern enterprise system?    [Chen] The implementation of the Company Law is an arduous  and complicated task. First of all, it must be conducted in an  organized way and step by step under the unified leadership of  the State Council. We must stress practical results in  reorganizing state enterprises through experiment with selected  enterprises according to the Company Law. Special attention  must be paid to successfully handling the relationship between  the transformation of operating mechanisms and the  reorganization of an enterprise into a company system. Only  those state enterprises whose conditions are ripe can be  gradually reorganized into companies. However, such  reorganization must be carried out in accordance with certain  formalities and procedures and in a steady way. Companies  cannot be established or inflexibly reorganized from those state  enterprises whose conditions are not ripe. Least of all are  state enterprises permitted to rush headlong into reorganization  as if it were a mass activity. Do be careful not to  misinterpret this good "sutra." In short, if the company  system, as a scientific form of enterprises' organization, is to  truly give play to its role, we must insist on standardization  and on establishing companies or reorganizing enterprises into  companies according to law.    [Reporter] Could you please discuss how to specifically  implement the Company Law by linking the implementation with the  duties of the State Economic and Trade Commission?    [Chen] As a department under the State Council responsible  for comprehensive management of the national economy, the State  Economic and Trade Commission has the responsibility to play its  due role in the implementation of the Company Law under the  unified plan of the State Council. The Company Law is the most  important law standardizing the principal part of the market;  supportive laws and provisions are still needed to facilitate  its implementation. With the approval of the State Council, we  must vigorously work with other relevant departments to  formulate appropriate, supportive laws and provisions, such as  those governing the reorganization of state enterprises into  limited liability companies, limited liability stock companies,  and wholly state-owned companies, while successfully conducting  study and propaganda of the Company Law. No matter whether  state enterprises are selected for reorganization on a trial  basis or reorganized to implement the Company Law, they must be  protected by well-considered supportive laws and provisions.  Successfully implementing the Company Law is a matter of great  importance that has a bearing on the overall situation of  reforming enterprises and establishing a socialist market  economy. We must make vigorous efforts to safely do a good job  of it.    [Reporter] At a national economic and trade work conference  held not long ago, the State Economic and Trade Commission  proposed a plan to "either transform the operating mechanisms of  or establish a modern enterprise system among 10,000 large and  medium-sized state enterprises, 1,000 key enterprises, 100  different types of large and medium-sized state enterprises, and  enterprises in 10 cities or prefectures" this year. Does the  task have anything to do with the implementation of the Company  Law?    [Chen] The above-mentioned plan which we proposed to carry  out is an important step and a useful tool for deepening reform  of enterprises and for establishing a modern enterprise system.  Its main purposes are to facilitate enterprises' participation  in the market and their transformation into a principal part of  the competition operating independently, and to further  accelerate the pace of the transformation of state enterprises'  operating mechanisms and the adjustment of enterprises'  organizational structure, thereby laying a sound foundation for  the establishment of a socialist market economy. The  implementation of the above plan is closely related to the  implementation of the Company Law. We must conduct  reorganization of state enterprises into companies in strict  accordance with the Company Law and its supportive laws and  regulations. Meanwhile, we must bring about an organic  integration between the implementation of the Company Law and  the continued successful implementation of the "Enterprise Law"  and the "Regulations" on transforming state enterprises'  operating mechanisms.</p>

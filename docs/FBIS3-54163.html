This announcement by the Arab League  secretary general came after his meeting with U.S. Secretary of  Commerce Ronald Brown and shows that the addition of this topic  on the agenda of the upcoming Arab League foreign ministers'  session was done because of U.S. pressure.    Political observers believe that U.S. pressure on the Arabs  to lift the economic sanctions on Israel cannot be understood  with any kind of logic, since the conditions that forced the  Arab countries to boycott the Zionist regime 40 years ago still  exist and, apart from the signing of a scrap of paper on  Gaza-Jericho self-rule, no perceptible change has taken place.  In other words, the Zionist regime continues to occupy Arab  territories, is avoiding the implementation of Security Council  resolutions, and has recently intensified the suppression of the  oppressed Palestinian people without having any qualms. Thus,  at a time when there is no new variant that can call for the  lifting of the Arabs' sanctions on Israel, how can America's  request be assessed?    There is no doubt that Washington-Tel Aviv relations have  had  a special characteristic since the establishment of the Zionist  regime and that America's supportive attitude toward Israel can  be assessed and understood only within this framework. Bill  Clinton's meeting with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva  last week to remove the existing obstacles in the Syrian-Israeli  talks showed that America is the guardian and mouthpiece of  Israel, a reality that the White House has not thought necessary  to hide for a long time now. These sinister relations between  Washington and Tel Aviv have rendered America partial, which is  one of the most important obstacles that prevents Washington  from playing the role of mediator in the solution to the Middle  East crisis.    In view of such a situation, the signing of any type of  agreement between the Arabs and Israel will definitely benefit  the Zionist regime.</p>

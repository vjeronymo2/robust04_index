			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (4): TV, businessmen start to turn on - A new genre Movies and news have been the main drivers of international cable and satellite television around the globe and the main battleground for competing media giants. A new genre of programmes may, after many difficulties, be emerging as a new candidate to join the list - business television. Everyone, of course, wants to reach high-spending international businessmen but they tend to be an elusive lot - often on the move and light television watchers. Now from the US and Europe to Asia, companies such as Dow Jones, publishers of the Wall Street Journal, NBC, the US network company and Reuters, the international news and information group, are targeting television aimed at the business community as a growth area. However, the genre breaks down into two quite specific streams of programming - the general business, financial and industrial channel aimed at satellite and cable networks, and the much more specialist services aimed precisely at the screens of dealers. Some plan to cut costs by offering both types of service simultaneously. For example Dow Jones, in a joint venture with Flextech, the cable programmer, plans to launch a European Business News channel on the Eutelsat satellite system next February and run a service for market professionals. Even apart from the two Dow Jones services, the City of London looks like being one of the liveliest battlegrounds for the new services to business over the next few years. Videotron, the Canadian-owned cable company which has more than 88,000 cable television subscribers in the UK, last month announced that it would launch a comprehensive range of business television services for the City of London and Westminster areas. The company has been awarded a licence to offer competing telecommunications services in the area because the local cable licence is held by British Telecommunications. It is building a dedicated Pounds 38m network to tap into the heavy communications traffic in an area with 37,000 businesses. But, as well as telecommunications, Videotron will have 48 channels of television available to provide non-entertainment services to the business market, direct to computer screens on businessmen's desks. Reuters will provide a special news service to Videotron subscribers in addition to the specialist information service, and the system will also carry CNN, NBC SuperChannel, EuroNews and the Parliamentary Channel, with more programming likely to follow. At the same time, Reuters Financial Television, launched in May and aimed at foreign exchange, debt and treasury financial markets across Europe, is continuing to expand. Apart from morning briefing, Reuters Financial Television stays off the air until there is potentially market-moving information to broadcast direct to dealers' screens. As Mr Mark Wood, editor-in-chief of Reuters, puts it, extensive research showed financial professionals 'did not want television - they want video information that is useful.' Mr Wood remains sceptical about the economics of more general channels. At the same time, NBC SuperChannel, which believes it can reach 60m homes in Europe, former Soviet states, the Middle East and north Africa through cable networks and terrestrial retransmission, is about to change its programming format. It will turn itself into a largely business news channel at least during the day. From January 3 the channel will broadcast European Money Wheel, five hours of business news and information on weekday mornings. An agreement has already been signed under which FT-TV, part of the Financial Times Group, will provide the European Money Wheel segment. When the New York markets open - in the European afternoon - the channel will carry CNBC, the successful US business channel. There is also the possibility of going 24 hours a day with business by adding an Asian Money Wheel. The intensity of television business news competition in Europe is likely to be matched in other regions. In the US Dow Jones has already launched a specialist channel for market professionals, the Dow Jones Investor Network, and is now looking at the possibility of adding a more general business channel to challenge CNBC. In Asia, where the Asia Business News channel has been broadcasting for nearly a year and is available in 12m to 16m homes, there have already been experiments on providing an additional, more specialist service. Before too long, if all the existing channels survive, worldwide business networks may be created so that business television at least begins to aspire to the boast of Cable News Network - that it is available everywhere (apart maybe from parts of Antartica and Greenland).</p>

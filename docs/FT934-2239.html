			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Largest companies improve liquidity Britain's large industrial and commercial companies improved their short-term liquidity position in the third quarter as they used the proceeds of share and bond issues to build up current financial assets and repay short-term borrowings. Seasonally adjusted figures released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed that the overall liquidity ratio of large UK companies increased to an estimated 123 per cent at the end of the third quarter from 111 per cent at mid-year. The ratio measures current assets maturing in less than a year as a share of liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year. It is based on a survey of 350 of Britain's biggest companies and gives an indication of the short-term financial strength of the large-company sector. The liquidity ratio of large manufacturing companies increased to 105 per cent at the end of September from 96 per cent at the end of June.</p>

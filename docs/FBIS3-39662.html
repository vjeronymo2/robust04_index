[District Attorney] Saverlo Borelli replied:  Cavaliere [Berlusconi nickname], you are making a mistake. The  attorney said: "I understand that when such a close relative is  affected, the family cannot feel too much warmth for the  magistrates. In the case of Paolo Berlusconi, however, we had  all the evidence, serious evidence too, enabling us to make the  arrest. He himself has admitted to most of this evidence."  From Arcore [Silvio Berlusconi's residence], for the time being  there is a simple "no comment" in response to the latest sally  of the Clean Hands.    Meanwhile, the judges continue their examination. After  being accused of corruption, Paolo Berlusconi risks facing  another charge, again involving the Cariplo [Savings Bank of the  Provinces of Lombardy] pension fund money, since he acquired  three houses built by the Cantieri Riuniti Milanesi's. Borelli  said: "Paolo Berlusconi has admitted to converting the stocks,  for which he took brokerage fees and which in reality were the  proceeds of corruption, by using invoices for nonexistent  operations for a total of around 1 billion lire [L]." As a  result, the builder, the president of Edifnord, may now also  have to face charges of false company reports. The judges  appear to have decided to take a closer look at the Cantieri  Riuniti Milanesi's accounts and those of its affiliated  companies to see which budgets may have been falsified. Any  possible fresh accusations will depend on what these  investigations turn up.    Paolo Berlusconi's lawyers, after issuing a number of  versions, spoke again on Saturday [12 February] of a  "commission." The district attorney, however, did not have too  many doubts: "Commission in the affairs of a public entity  amounts to corruption."</p>

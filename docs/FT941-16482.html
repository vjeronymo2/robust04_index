			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Scramble for seats on mystery ride: As the Nato summit gets under way in Brussels, David White questions its role and relevance 'An alliance whose purpose is not the intention to wage war is senseless and useless' - Adolf Hitler The challenge the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation faces as it completes its first 45 years is to prove Hitler wrong. Since the cold war dissolved in the late 1980s it has been scraping around for a new sense of purpose. As leaders of the 16 allies meet for their summit in Brussels today, not only the future membership of Nato is in question but also the nature and continued relevance of the organisation. A previous summit in London in 1990 proclaimed Nato to be 'the most successful defensive alliance in history'. Its success as a front against the Soviet Union was such that it never had to put troops into action. Its effectiveness derived from two factors: a powerful military capability, and the political will to use it if necessary. But its reason for existing - the Red Army - is now a thing of the past. It is possible that rebuilt Russian forces might again become a threat to western Europe. But - for all the sabre-rattling of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist Russian politician - they are not considered one now by military chiefs. As a British admiral graphically put it: 'The light house keeper at Muckle Flugga (northern Shetlands) hasn't seen a periscope for years.' The cold war held Nato together and guaranteed a level of public support. Now the only public enthusiasm for Nato is evident in the nations of central and eastern Europe which would like to join, and which most of the allies are anxious, for now, to keep at bay. The summit, called by the US last year, was not meant to be about enlargement, but that is the issue which will dominate it. The strong nationalist showing in last month's Russian elections has exacerbated Nato's quandary - giving countries such as Poland all the more reason for seeking Nato's protection, and Nato all the more reason to tread cautiously and avoid reinforcing Russians' belief that the world is ganging up against them. Nato's leaders have yet to persuade President Boris Yeltsin it would be in Russia's own interest to have central Europe securely linked to western European institutions. The alliance is caught between the risk of playing into the hands of Russian extremists by favouring expansion and that of apparent appeasement of Moscow, allowing it to veto Nato decisions. But there are more problems involved in expanding Nato than Russian reactions. One question is whether Nato is prepared, or militarily able, to protect borders further east. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, put it in blunt terms at the Royal College of Defence Studies last month: 'Are the US Congress, the House of Commons, the French Assembly, the Bundestag solemnly ready to guarantee with the lives of their citizens the frontiers of, say, Slovakia? If not, or if not yet, then it would be a deceit to pretend otherwise.' Another is where to draw the line. Although there is general acceptance in Nato that membership will eventually grow, no consensus exists as to how many might join. Limited expansion could create its own tensions and divisions. 'What if we take Poland in but not Lithuania (which last week became the first ex-Soviet republic to apply)?' asks one seasoned Nato hand. 'What if Hungary but not Romania?' On the other hand, the more countries join, the harder it may be to maintain a semblance of cohesion within the alliance. And the less cohesion, the less advantage there is in joining. The fact that Greece and Turkey were both Nato members may have helped contain their dispute over Cyprus - an example often cited by central European officials. But that was during the cold war; it might not be so with future quarrels. If there is one art Nato has become adept at, it is papering over its difficulties. The summit will open the way to enlargement in principle, without naming names, fixing a timetable or setting criteria for membership. Yet it will be understood that Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia will be put in the fast track, nobody will join for several years and that membership will be conditional on real democratic credentials. Nato now wants to be about shared political principles. In the past - during its first 25 years when Portugal was a dictatorship, during the colonels' Greece or periods of military rule and repression in Turkey - democratic principles took second place to common strategic interests. Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister and an early champion of enlargement, has said that the central European nations will not be joining the old Nato but a new one. By that he meant a co-operative Nato not geared to fending off Russia. The trouble is that what the central and east Europeans want to join, essentially, is the old Nato - to feel safe against Russia. Mr Antony Lake, President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, warns that if they join too quickly their worries about Russia could become 'a self-fulfilling prophecy'. Nato's holding tactic - thought up by the US in October - is to offer military co-operation agreements to all the countries of the former Warsaw Pact, Russia included, and assorted other European nations. Partnership for Peace agreements - PFPs in Nato-ese - will allow countries to draw closer to Nato by exercising and possibly peacekeeping alongside Nato forces. They may be a prelude to membership, but not automatically. And, crucially for the applicant countries, they will not include mutual defence guarantees. Mr Yeltsin has given a guarded welcome to the proposed military ties, which should start to be negotiated this year. Countries such as Poland rather grudgingly accept the idea, suspicious that they are being fobbed off. President Lech Walesa told the Washington Post that Nato's approach to enlargement was 'shortsighed and irresponsible'. Nato's hope is that the co-operative programmes will winnow out the serious candidates - those that can make a real contribution - and groom them for membership, which could roughly co-incide with entry into the European Union. But what sort of Nato will they be joining? Will the US still be as engaged in it? Nato went through many internal spats in the cold war but there was no question of the US commitment or of America's vision of its own security being anchored in Europe. Allies expect Mr Clinton to deliver a strong reaffirmation of Nato's importance and the need to keep it as a transatlantic forum. But it is questionable how long the US can maintain public support for keeping even a reduced troop force of 100,000 in Europe. Nato would be severely weakened without the US contribution - both for vital military assets such as long-range transport and satellite surveillance, and for the weight the US pulls in the world. In the past three months the Clinton administration has bombarded Nato with initiatives, fleshing out its Partnership for Peace idea, seeking Nato involvement in 'counter-proliferation' to deal with potential new nuclear-missile powers, and proposing new Combined Joint Task Forces which would link France more closely into Nato military planning for operations outside allied territory. Nato has unique military resources. No other organisation could provide the sophisticated co-ordination needed for tasks such as enforcing the no-fly zone in Bosnia. The Gulf war effort three years ago also drew heavily on experience of working together in Nato. However, allies' military forces are being rapidly run down. With no clear threat scenario, there is now longer any yardstick for judging what forces Nato needs or what kind of fighting it should train for. There is a risk that, like the excess tanks and artillery of the cold war now being dismantled, Nato's military structure will rust away. It would then be an alliance on paper, which might be worth little if put to the test. 'The trick,' says a former senior Nato diplomat, 'is how to ensure that the habits of co-operation that we have developed over the last four decades are not thrown away.'</p>

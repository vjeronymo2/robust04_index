			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Henderson Admin rises 39% to Pounds 20.3m Henderson Administration, the fund management group, increased funds under management by 18 per cent to Pounds 13.5bn at the end of March 1994, in spite of losing pension fund accounts. Pre-tax profits were up 39 per cent from Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 20.3m. These are the first full-year results to include a full contribution from the Touche Remnant fund management business, acquired in December 1992. Revenue increased by 38 per cent from Pounds 47.7m to Pounds 65.7m, and expenses rose 26 per cent to Pounds 48.1m, producing an operating profit of Pounds 17.6m. Interest and investment income fell from Pounds 5.48m to Pounds 2.18m. Earnings per share grew 43 per cent to 65.3p, and the total dividend rose 5 per cent to 44p after a recommended final of 31.5p (29.5p). Mr Ben Wrey, chairman, blamed the loss of pension fund business on the highly competitive state of the pensions market, where the tendency was for funds to be concentrated in the hands of the top four or five managers. Mr Wrey said Henderson was relying on its improved performance record, placing it twelfth out of 36 managers over a five year period, to stop the outflow of funds. The group had Pounds 5.25bn (Pounds 5.38bn) pension money under management at the end of March. Funds under management increased most sharply in the international division, being more than doubled at Pounds 984m, against Pounds 467m. The figure included Seligman Henderson, the US joint venture, as well as other clients in the US and the Netherlands. Funds under administration, including offshore funds and Peps, grew by 85 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn. On the retail side, one new investment trust, the HTR Japanese Smaller Companies trust, was launched during the year. The unit trust range was rationalised to remove overlaps between Henderson and Touche Remnant funds. Investment trust funds under management stood at Pounds 3.58bn at the year end, up 24 per cent, and unit trusts at Pounds 1.34bn, up 18 per cent. Associated businesses made a profit of Pounds 464,000, after a loss of Pounds 585,000 last year.</p>

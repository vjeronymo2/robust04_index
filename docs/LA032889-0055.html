			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> SOVIETS SCRAP NUCLEAR PLANT  </P> <P> The Soviet Union abandoned construction work at the Krasnodar nuclear power  station near the Black Sea after an outcry over its location and safety, the  official Tass news agency said. The decision came just nine days after the  government shut down the only working nuclear power station in the Armenian  republic, the first plant decommissioned in the Soviet Union. The Soviets had  plans to double its nuclear power generation, but after the 1986 disaster at  the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which killed 31 people, the government  abandoned plans to build six more stations. Nuclear power accounts for 12.7% of  all electricity generated in the Soviet Union.  </P></p>

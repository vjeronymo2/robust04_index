			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hong Kong's contribution rises to Pounds 122m STANDARD CHARTERED has disclosed for the first time the proportion of profits flowing from Hong Kong. Over the last 12 months it has raised assets from Pounds 8.35bn to Pounds 11.2bn and for the six months to June 30 reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 121.7m, against Pounds 92.4m, writes John Gapper. The bank has been trying to reduce risk by cutting exposure to commercial lending in Hong Kong, which accounted for more than half of profits in its core Asia Pacific franchise. Other Asia Pacific countries produced Pounds 82.3m (Pounds 52.7m). About 20 per cent of the Hong Kong assets are now in home mortgages. The bank believes risk is limited by the fact that the average proportion of loan to property valuation is below 60 per cent, and loans are usually repaid in seven years. Bad debt provisions in Hong Kong totalled Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 28.7m), while that for other Asia Pacific countries was Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2m). This compared with a Pounds 113.7m (Pounds 37.3m) charge for the UK, out of total provisions of Pounds 127m (Pounds 118m). Losses in the Middle East and south Asia were cut to Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 98m). The bad debt charge fell to Pounds 1m (Pounds 102m) because it did not make further provisions against its involvement in the Bombay securities trading scandal. The reduced loss was after taking account of a Pounds 21.4m charge for writing down the value of public sector utility bonds in India. In Africa, pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 17.8m) took in a Pounds 13m adjustment for hyper-inflation in three countries. The large UK debt provision left a Pounds 42.5m loss, against a profit of Pounds 200,000. More than half of the provision concerned two large corporate charges, believed to involve loans to Isosceles and Brent Walker. Group expenses rose to Pounds 481.3m (Pounds 353m) although the rise in income reduced the cost to income ratio to 62.1 per cent (67.7 per cent). Mr Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, said this was unacceptable, although it included restructuring. Talks with Price Waterhouse had failed to resolve a Dollars 338m (Pounds 227m) dispute over its purchase of the National Bank of Arizona. Mr Patrick Gillam, chairman, said the claim was being pursued strongly and was likely to return to court. The tax charge was Pounds 73m (Pounds 51m), an effective rate of 43 per cent. Mr Gillam said this was higher than the bank would like because of UK losses and the bank's current inability to benefit from some write-offs and provisions.</p>

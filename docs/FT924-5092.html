			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The stresses on Europe or soon-to-be leader - of a major industrial country who can look upon last week's economic news with pleasure. He may have the good fortune to inherit exactly the recovery Mr George Bush had claimed. By contrast with the better news from the US, the monetary data emerging from Japan are deeply disturbing. Japan's plight is greatly exacerbated by its political disarray. But if the Japanese political class is at sixes and sevens, what of Europe's? A feedback from political failure to economic disappointment and back again is becoming too firmly established. When the original estimate of 2.7 per cent for the rate of US economic growth in the third quarter was announced before the presidential election, it was widely regarded as unrepresentative. Now the figure has been revised upwards to 3.9 per cent. This then was the strongest quarter of Mr Bush's presidency, but it came too late to save him. Will Mr Clinton avoid the temptation to over-egg the recovery pudding and concentrate instead on the medium to long-term problems of the US economy, on lines recommended by this week's OECD report? Other economies look much more fragile. It seems strange to write of a Japan that is in serious difficulty. But it is. Japan is now in its first home-grown postwar recession. This recession is driven by the asset price deflation that followed the inflation of the late 1980s. It reflects, in particular, the damage done to its banking system. Bad loans at the top 21 banks alone could total Y55,000bn (Pounds 293bn) over the next five years, equivalent to 12 per cent of gross domestic product. Not surprisingly, the broad money supply contracted by 0.6 per cent in October. Such a decline suggests the possibility, however remote, of a depression. But the OECD report on Japan, like the Japanese authorities, seems unwilling even to contemplate this threat. Political infighting Japan is inhibited by political infighting from addressing its problems effectively. The same is true of the European Community. The rot is affecting virtually every aspect of EC affairs: completion of the single market; resolution of the conflict over the EC budget; ratification of the Maastricht treaty; completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations; and, not least, the ERM. In the aftermath of the devaluation of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo last weekend, the Irish punt has remained close to its floor, while the Danish krone and the French franc have languished in the bottom half of their bands. The Irish and Danish currencies have been weak despite overnight interest rate differentials this week vis-a-vis the D-Mark of as much as 31 and 21 per cent respectively, and still higher this weekend. Such rates are not a long-term solution, for the simple reason that they cannot be sustained for very long. With such pressure on the outer fringes of the remaining inner core, the parity of the French franc has come once more into question. Economic logic suggests that the D-Mark should no longer be the pivotal currency in the ERM. But the determination of the Bundesbank to sustain its historic primacy ensures that it is. Biggest nut Those, like France, still in the ERM at their old parities are being penalised, first, for the markets' conviction that the D-Mark will remain the strongest currency; second, for the Bundesbank's determination to ensure that that remains the case; third, for the inability of the German leadership to finance German unification without huge levels of borrowing; and, finally, for the willingness of member countries such as Italy, the UK or Spain to devalue. The French franc is the biggest nut in the ERM nutcracker. This week's German figures and pronouncements underline the Bundesbank's determination to go on squeezing. German M3 (broad money) grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 10.2 per cent in October, higher than the figures for September and August and hugely above the upper target of 5.5 per cent for the year. Underlying German inflation seems to be running at some 4 per cent. To make matters gloomier, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, widely expected to be the next Bundesbank president, argued that inflation could remain a serious threat to Germany for the rest of the decade. What happens now depends almost as much on European politics as economics. Will Germany finally take the fiscal action that is required, not at the behest of Mr Norman Lamont but in response to the urgent needs of the French? Mr Kohl's pronouncements suggest not. But is there any other way out for the ERM and, if not, what does his commitment to Franco-German co-operation amount to? The EC badly needs a success of some kind. But it depends on the battered British government, in the last leg of its dismal presidency, to deliver one. Can Mr Major show the vision and achieve the compromises needed at the Edinburgh summit? Hope is possible; confidence is another matter.</p>

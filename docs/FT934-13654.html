			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / BAe's rival aircraft talks raise stakes with Taiwan BRITISH AEROSPACE is raising the stakes over its troubled efforts to form a regional aircraft joint venture with Taiwan by conducting rival negotiations with Indonesia. BAe confirmed yesterday it was having 'an exploratory dialogue regarding regional aircraft with Indonesia', adding that the confidential discussions involved turboprop commuter aircraft as well as regional jets. BAe has a strong relationship with Indonesia's state aircraft industry. Indonesia bought Pounds 500m worth of BAe Hawk trainer-fighter aircraft this year, the biggest military export order BAe has clinched outside Saudi Arabia. There is also the possibility of Indonesia assembling Hawk aircraft were it to acquire further military jets from BAe. The disclosure is expected to strengthen BAe's hand in its complex and long drawn out negotiations with Taiwan this week which appear on the verge of collapse. While still tentative, the Indonesian proposal would involve much broader co-operation, including BAe's Jetstream turboprop operations based at Prestwick, Scotland, as well as the RJ regional jet activities based at Woodford, near Manchester. BAe has been seeking to forge international partnerships for both its regional jet and turboprop aircraft activities as an integral part of its recovery strategy. Both regional jets and turboprops have continued to lose money and BAe announced last week it was cutting 630 jobs out of the 2,500 people employed on the turboprop activities at Prestwick. The regional jet operations employ about 3,000 in the UK. BAe has been losing patience over what it sees as Taiwan's delaying tactics on the proposed joint venture which involves only its regional jet activities. Mr John Cahill, BAe chairman, yesterday began talks in Taiwan to try to salvage the deal. But the UK company is not prepared to let the year-long negotiations with Taiwan drag on further and is expected to take a decision at a board meeting on October 29. Taiwan is seeking to scrap its original agreements with BAe and renegotiate the entire deal. BAe is also resisting Taiwanese demands for transfers of leading edge technologies and a commitment to invest in a Pounds 1bn programme to develop a new regional jet aircraft. By contrast to Taiwan's fledgling aerospace industry, Indonesia has built up an indigenous aerospace sector through international collaboration. It already manufactures a turboprop military transport aircraft with civil applications, the CN-235, jointly with Casa of Spain, which has been successfully exported to Saudi Arabia and South Korea. Its IPTN state-owned aerospace company led by Mr Bacharrudin Habibie is also a subcontractor for Boeing of the US and has co-operation deals with other US and European aerospace groups. BAe has already held talks with Casa over a possible partnership in the turboprop commuter and regional aircraft business. Minister champions BAe deal, Page 6</p>

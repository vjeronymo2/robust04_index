			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH BEGINS HIS ARABIAN ADVENTURE;  </P> <P> HOLIDAY MESSAGE TO TROOPS: NOT ON A 'MISSION IMPOSSIBLE'  </P> <P> On the eve of a Thanksgiving Day trip to the front lines, President Bush  conferred today with Arab leaders on the three-month standoff against Iraq. He  said the 230,000 American troops on Saudi soil are not on a "mission  impossible."  </P> <P> After a 5 1/2-hour flight from Paris, Bush stepped from Air Force One into the  warm, humid Saudi evening at this Red Sea port and was greeted by King Fahd.  </P> <P> Later, he was to meet privately with the exiled emir of Kuwait.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Bush and his wife, Barbara, will share Thanksgiving with troops at  two desert military sites in Saudi Arabia and on a Navy ship in the Persian  Gulf.  </P> <P> "If I do nothing else, I will convey to them the heartfelt thanks of the  American people at this very special time of year for Americans," Bush said.  </P> <P> He told reporters he would tell the troops that "we are going to prevail, that  they're not there on a mission impossible."  </P> <P> Earlier today, Bush told reporters in Paris that he and Mikhail S. Gorbachev  now see "eye to eye" on the crisis, even though the Soviet president's public  statements have reflected a greater reluctance to use military force to resolve  the crisis.  </P> <P> The President is seeking support for a U.N. Security Council resolution  authorizing military force against Saddam Hussein if he does not leave Kuwait  by a certain date.  </P> <P> French President Francois Mitterrand said in Paris today that the U.N.  resolution against Iraq will likely be adopted within three weeks.  </P> <P> The President was to spend the night here, then fly east across the Saudi  peninsula to the Persian Gulf city of Dhahran, not far from the Kuwaiti border.  </P> <P> He and his wife, top aides and a press pool of about two dozen are to board  helicopters to visit three sites -- an Army installation, a Marine encampment  and a naval vessel in the Persian Gulf.  </P></p>

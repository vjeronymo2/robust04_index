This is what I endeavored to tell our  British partners in the current meetings and talks on the banks  of the Thames, Republic of Kazakhstan President Nursultan  Nazarbayev stressed in a brief interview with PRAVDA.    Answering my question about the extent to which official  London is interested in the effect of the "Russian factor" on  the situation in Kazakhstan and Central Asia, the high-ranking  guest from Alma-Ata [Almaty] noted that this question is not  very indicative of current moods in Whitehall. The British  leadership is making no secret of the fact that in recent days  the spectrum of its priority interests has noticeably shifted in  the direction of the conflicting opinions and political  priorities in Moscow's corridors of power, and of general  forecasts concerning the immediate future of the vast part of  the planet which only recently was a united Union.    In this context, Nazarbayev stated later on, I have already  said many times what I want to repeat now: Yes, we need very  close integration. Integration which is real and lasting,  unlike now. Incidentally, the CIS must eventually become  different from what it is now. Not loose and amorphous but  highly effective, in line with the scale of the tasks facing all  of us.</p>

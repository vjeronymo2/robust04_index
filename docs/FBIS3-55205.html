It was decided to  call a warning strike in the first "parliamentary week" -- from  10 to 17 January. Three newspapers disagreed with the decision,  including ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA, and  also KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (spokesmen for the last newspaper expressed  their solidarity with the "strikers"). It soon transpired,  however, that Mr. Chernomyrdin is ready to meet with the  editors-in-chief today to talk about all the existing  disagreements.</p>

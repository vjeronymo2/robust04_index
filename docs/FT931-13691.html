			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Technology: Key to increasing security control - Worth Watching Those who hanker for the traditional in a high-tech world will be grateful that Chubb, the security company, has introduced an access control system that does away with the fingerprint, the retina scan and the plastic card. Instead, it uses a key. It is not an ordinary key, however. Embedded in the tip of each one is a uniquely coded microchip containing information about the key holder. Only if the key has been programmed into the memory of the lock, which incorporates a tiny computer, will the key open the door. Chubb: UK, 0902 455440.</p>

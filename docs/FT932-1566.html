			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Letter: Mortgage arrears gloom overdone Sir, Your article ('Mortgage arrears leap', June 21) may well overstate the gloom surrounding the mortgage arrears data you report, although the overall rise in mortgage arrears over the last year was, of course, disappointing. Your analysis misses an important statistical point. You asserted that, in spite of a halving in mortgage rates since 1991, the number of households in two or more months' arrears rose by 27,000 in the year to the end of March. This made no reference to the fact that, because mortgage rates have fallen (by 3 percentage points over the period), many people find themselves more months in arrears - although their level of arrears has not increased. An individual who is six months in arrears with mortgage rates at 16 per cent is 12 months in arrears if mortgage rates fall to 6 per cent and the monthly repayment halves. As the number of home-owners in arrears for shorter periods fell sharply (down by 43,000 for arrears of less than six months), while the number in arrears for longer periods increased (up by 73,000 for more than six months), this technical effect may account for a large part of the increase in longer-term arrears. The success of the government in persuading lenders not to repossess such homes probably played a relatively minor role.

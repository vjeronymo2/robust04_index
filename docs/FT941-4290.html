			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Anhueser-Busch in Japan deal Anheuser-Busch and Kirin, respectively the biggest beer makers in the US and Japan, have reached a deal that will bring Anheuser-Busch's new iced beer to Japan under the name of Kirin Ice Beer. The move marks a strengthening of the relationship between the two companies following their decision last year to create a joint venture called Budweiser Japan. Anheuser-Busch's ice-brewing process involves passing the beer through a special ice chamber where ice crystals are formed and keeping it in ultra-cold storage for several days. Kirin Ice Beer will be brewed at Anheuser-Busch's Los Angeles brewery using a recipe adjusted to Japanese tastes, and will be packed in cans made by Anheuser-Busch's Metal Container subsidiary in Windsor, Colorado. It will be launched at the end of May. Anheuser-Busch and Kirin, which recently exchanged token equity stakes of about Y500m (Dollars 4.6m) are planning further co-operation in beer production and material procurement. Kirin aims to lower its production costs by gradually shifting beer production and beer can supply to Anheuser in the US. The two companies plan to co-operate in procuring wheat and other materials, and in looking for new business opportunities in Asia. Other Japanese beer companies, faced with high production costs and competition from cheaper imports, are expected to reach similar deals with foreign beer makers.</p>

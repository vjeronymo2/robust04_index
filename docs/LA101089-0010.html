			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHIROPRACTORS  </P> <P> In response to "Turf Battle Over Sports Physicals," Metro, Oct. 2:  </P> <P> As president of the Los Angeles County Medical Society, Dr. Charles McElwee's  statements are quite unfortunate. "They are not physicians and they shouldn't  be practicing medicine. If (a patient) wants a true history and physical exam,  they cannot get it from a chiropractor."  </P> <P> The "big lie" continues as McElwee attempts to persuade the public that  inquiry, observation and deduction, the quintessential elements in  history-taking and examination, are the sole purview of his profession.  </P> <P> Chiropractors do not practice medicine as the public regards it, but they do  practice fair, rational and objective thinking. Certainly qualified doctors of  chiropractic are capable of performing athletic exams as are "qualified"  doctors of medicine.  </P> <P> GLENN P. FISCHEL, D.C.  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Los Angeles County  </P> <P> Chiropractic Society  </P></p>

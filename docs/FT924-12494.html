			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (21): Adaptability in slow motion - The Toyota dynasty retreats gracefully THE changing of the guard at Toyota Motor took place like clockwork. After precisely 10 years as president at Japan's most profitable company, Mr Shoichiro Toyoda last month took over the chairmanship from Eiji Toyoda, his cousin once removed, and passed on the presidency to his younger brother Tatsuro. Toyota - Japan's biggest car maker with 40 per cent of the domestic market - has managed to keep it all in the family for yet another generation of leadership. The regularity and predictability of the event gave not a hint that the Japanese automobile industry is facing one of its most difficult periods since the war, with domestic sales falling and profits collapsing. Much like Toyota's Lexus luxury cars that have proved so popular in Europe and North America, Toyota itself gives all the appearance of cruising along in splendid comfort, unruffled by the crumbling of the road surface. The appearance, however, could be deceiving. Certainly, of all Japan's automobile companies, Toyota, with 40 per cent of the market, will emerge the least scathed by the recession in the industry. Yet even for Toyota change is in the wind. To start with, the appointment of Mr Tatsuro Toyoda as president is likely to mark the end of the Toyoda dynasty at the company, which now owns an insignificant percentage of the company's shares. To promote a young member of the Toyoda family over the head of more senior directors would probably provoke a revolt in the company. The structure of the board of directors at Toyota was also changed with the appointment of the new president. Mr Tatsuro Toyoda previously served as Toyota's sole executive vice president. This time Mr Toyoda will be joined by five executive vice presidents, throwing wide open the choice of the next president. As Mr Shoichiro Toyoda said on the announcement of his brother's appointment: 'There is a strong possibility that (the next president) would be someone without Toyoda as a surname.' Mr Shoichiro Toyoda was a strong leader at the company, and helped see Toyota successfully through a decade of rapid international expansion. His brother was intimately involved in that expansion. Tatsuro was until 1988 president of Toyota's joint production operation with General Motors in the US, New United Motor Manufacturing. He also ran Toyota's US sales efforts, and speaks fluent English. Tatsuro's appointment gives a more international flavour to a company that is often seen (probably without justification) as inward looking and archetypically Japanese. But he is not expected to exert the same degree of strong leadership shown by his brother. He will also be facing a business environment that has become extremely difficult. Toyota's consolidated pre-tax profits fell by 40 per cent to Y427.8bn in the year to June on sales that rose by 3.1 per cent to Y10,163bn. Toyota has gained market share slightly in the nine months to August, as its loyal customers continued to snap up its latest model cars. But sales have still declined by 4.1 per cent in the domestic market to 1.77m vehicles during the period. Yet Toyota has one of the strongest balance sheets in Japan, with cash and short term investment amounting to Y1,944bn, and net debt worth only 14 per cent of shareholder's equity. This means that Toyota is capable of withstanding almost anything the Japanese, or international, market throws at it in the next few years. The pressure on Toyota from the rest of the industry to soften its aggressive competitive stance has become extremely intense, and Toyota plans a number of changes to cope with the difficult business environment. The company is likely to knock a few poorly-selling models out of its extensive line up in an effort to save costs. Like other makers, it is trying to save costs by cutting back on the variety of engine types, steering wheels, decorative trim, or colour combinations that it now offers customers. Tatsuro Toyoda supported the idea of saving money by using more common parts in different vehicle designs, although some Toyota engineers are sceptical about whether this will work. But in two critical areas, Toyota has given no hint of change. The company has dismissed suggestions that the current four year cycle of model changes should be lengthened to save money. And the new president said Toyota had no intention of increasing prices to boost margins. Toyota would no doubt like to save money, but the company retains a strong ethic oriented toward providing its customers with the latest technology and design at the cheapest price. As the biggest and probably most efficient producer, it can pursue this strategy for a long time.</p>

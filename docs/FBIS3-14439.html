			<p>Language: <F P=105>Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati by </F> unidentified correspondent in special program on the Economic  Cooperation Organization, date, place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] The activities of the Economic  Cooperation Organization [ECO] have been organized such that it  seems the creation of a free trade zone -- where all the parties  are to have an interest -- is the main objective of the ECO. To  clarify that issue we asked [Foreign Minister] Dr. Velayati  whether the ECO is aiming at a free trade zone or is pursuing  other goals as well.    [Velayati] The ECO pursues numerous objectives, one of which  is the establishment of free trade zones so that all member  states have the possibility of participating in them. Two  documents were confirmed by the leaders at the end of their  meeting and were published. One of the documents concerns the  ECO's long term perspective, based on the ECO's executive plan  which was adopted during a session by the foreign ministers of  ECO member states at Quetta in Pakistan. That became the basis  for the ECO's long term plan.    What is intended in the ECO is mostly long term  infrastructural cooperation; or infrastructural cooperation  which can have most positive and constructive effects in the  region for long-term ECO action.</p>

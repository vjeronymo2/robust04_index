			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Co-op Bank bans speculation CO-OPERATIVE Bank is banning speculation by itself against the pound as a matter of policy in reaction to the profits gained by some of its competitors in currency trading during the recent sterling crisis. The strategy will be added to the bank's ethical policy which forbids it to lend money to companies and organisations involved in activities such as tobacco manufacture, animal exploitation and blood sports.</p>

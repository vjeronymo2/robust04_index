			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO'S 'KRAZY KAT': BETTER SCENERY THAN BALLET  </P> <P> Before "Dick Tracy" reaches the big screen and "Archie" hits network prime  time, here comes "Krazy Kat" (the ballet), another vintage comic strip newly  peopled for the '90s.  </P> <P> Based on George Herriman's classic triangle -- dog loves cat but cat loves  mouse -- this one-act dance-parable enlists principals and soloists from San  Francisco Ballet, the choreography of Brenda Way (founder/director of the  modern-dance company ODC/San Francisco) and a pile of snazzy jazz records by  Jelly Roll Morton, Charles L. Roberts and William Bolcom.  </P> <P> At the War Memorial Opera House on Thursday, however, "Krazy Kat" clearly  belonged to painter Wayne Thiebaud, who created enormous still-life cutouts and  landscapes (some massive enough for Wagnerian opera) in luminous watercolor  pastels.  </P> <P> Sometimes black curtains and small scenic units isolated a character in space  (Krazy Kat alone in the night). More often, the vista expanded to a full,  multilevel stage with giant palm trees and other scenic elements providing an  environment for dances by an 11-member "Cartoon Chorus (the dailies)" dressed  in black and white.  </P> <P> Besides punctuating the discontinuous, quasi-narrative episodes involving Krazy  Cat, Ignatz Mouse and Offisa Pup, this chorus served as Way's primary  choreographic focus -- dancing much more than the principal characters.  However, their flurries of loose, wiggly, slumpy movement -- mostly performed  in place -- never looked as purposeful or interesting on the big stage as such  inspired scenic diversions as a "Swan Lake"-style procession of oversized ducks  and a leisurely boat chase.  </P> <P> Way seemed to be aiming for an anarchic, off-the-wall style -- a ballet made up  as it went along in contrast to the rigid every-finger-in-place premeditation  of the classical repertory. Nice idea, but her impacted vocabulary and  constricted sense of space never yielded much satisfaction.  </P> <P> In the title role, the winsome Grace Maduell got a major solo only at the very  end -- a katastrophic antiklimax. Val Caniparoli made a very appealing Offisa  Pup but scarcely danced at all. And, as Ignatz, Christopher Stowell attacked  his showcase opportunities energetically without making them particularly  memorable.  </P> <P> Completing the otherwise familiar program: an uneven performance of James  Kudelka's "Comfort Zone" that came fully alive only in the passages dominated  by Elizabeth Loscavio, Antonio Castilla, Jamie Zimmerman and/or Christopher  Boatwright. Helgi Tomasson's "Menuetto" featured excellent principals -- Evelyn  Cisneros, Jim Sohm, Sabina Allemann and Ashley Wheater -- each of whom, alas,  seemed to have a different concept of placement, timing and style.  </P></p>

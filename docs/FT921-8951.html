			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Appointments: Shell follows tradition Sir Peter Holmes, chairman of Shell Transport and Trading, is to succeed Lo van Wachem as chairman of the committee of managing directors of Royal Dutch/Shell, the world's second biggest oil group. Sir Peter has been vice-chairman of the committee since 1985, and his appointment to the most senior executive position follows the group's tradition of picking its senior executive alternately from its Dutch and British companies. However, since Sir Peter will be 60 later this year, his tenure at the top will be much shorter than in the case of van Wachem who will have been chairman for seven years when he steps down on June 30. Cornelius Herkstroter, 55, will succeed van Wachem as president of Royal Dutch Petroleum, and will also become vice-chairman of the committee of group managing directors, making him Sir Peter's heir apparent. On his retirement, van Wachem will become chairman of the supervisory board of Royal Dutch Petroleum. The British and Dutch arms of Royal Dutch/Shell each provide three group managing directors and van Wachem will be replaced on the joint committee by Martin van den Bergh, 50, who also becomes a managing director of Royal Dutch Petroleum from July 1 1992. An economics graduate, van den Bergh joined Shell International Petroleum in London in 1968 as a finance trainee and between 1969 and 1979 worked in Japan, Venezuela and Indonesia. Since 1989 he has been based in London as regional co-ordinator Western Hemisphere and Africa and a director of Shell International. He will be the youngest group managing director on the joint committee. Mark Moody-Stuart, the most recent British addition to the committee, is 52.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. LINKS SOVIET TRADE STATUS TO VISAS FOR JEWS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration said Thursday that it will move to extend  most-favored-nation trade status to the Soviet Union only after Moscow enacts  and puts into place its new plan to ease restrictions on emigration by Soviet  Jews.  </P> <P> The clarifications came in the wake of a statement Thursday by Commerce  Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher that the move could come "within the next one to  three months." Mosbacher offered the guess during a television interview, but  aides later backed away from that estimate.  </P> <P> They said that President Bush wants to wait until the Soviets not only have  changed the legal requirements for emigration but also have issued enough exit  visas to demonstrate that they are serious about carrying out the spirit of the  new law. That could take until next summer.  </P> <P> U.S. law also requires that the two countries work out a trade agreement before  the Administration can restore most-favored-nation benefits to the Soviet  Union, U.S. trade officials said. A Soviet delegation, meeting with Mosbacher,  agreed Thursday to preliminary explorations.  </P> <P> Separately, the Administration appeared to soften its tone on another key trade  issue with the Soviets -- whether the United States would drop its opposition  to Soviet membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the  Geneva-based organization that administers world trade rules.  </P> <P> Until recently, Washington had flatly refused even to consider Soviet  membership in GATT. It contended publicly that the way the Soviet economy works  would not be compatible with GATT rules, which are based on market economies.  </P> <P> Although officials insist that the U.S. position has not changed, senior  Administration officials reportedly were somewhat more flexible in discussions  with the Soviets on Wednesday and Thursday, saying that Washington would not be  able to consider such a move soon.  </P> <P> The softening of the U.S. tone was seen as another response to the Soviets'  economic reforms and not as any indication that the Administration will soon  endorse Soviet membership in the 97-country group.  </P> <P> The statements by officials were designed to quell speculation raised by  Mosbacher's comments that Bush may announce the action during his meeting with  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev Dec. 2-3 in the Mediterranean near Malta.  </P> <P> The White House has insisted repeatedly that the two men will not make any  major decisions during the summit.  </P> <P>  Approval of the trade privileges would be an important symbolic milestone in  the improving U.S.-Soviet relationship, putting Moscow on the same trade  footing as the United States' Western allies and other trading partners.  </P></p>

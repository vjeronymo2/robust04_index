			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : DOWN-TO-EARTH ALIEN  </P> <P> "It ain't glamorous," actress Terri Treas says of the realities of her role on  Fox's "Alien Nation." Treas plays Cathy Frankel -- one of a shipful of bald,  speckle-headed "Newcomers" who land on Earth and must adapt to human culture.  </P> <P> Treas, in turn, must adapt to her most unusual acting assignment. On-the-set  nicknames such as "Sponge Head," impossible-to-reach itches under all that  latex and a constant battle with glue in her hair come with the role. But so  does the chance to explore important -- sometimes personal -- issues.  </P> <P> "It's a collaborative effort," Treas says, describing monthly brainstorms among  the cast and staff, one of which resulted in Monday's episode on child abuse,  "The Touch." In the episode, Treas' character tries to reconnect with a  Newcomer boy who has been purged of his capacity to love by an evil leader.  </P> <P> "The writers came up with the idea that alien child abuse would be killing the  love within a child, which is really what being abusive is," says Treas, who  calls her own childhood home "dysfunctional."  </P> <P> Although Treas chooses not to discuss the details of her past, she feels "part  of my recovery is to give back what I've been given." To this end, she tried to  give background on "how the abused child would act, and how Cathy would try to  reach him." The episode's resulting climatic scene, she says, "was a very  moving scene to shoot. It gave me chills."  </P> <P> Treas spends some of her time out of makeup working with Children of the Night,  a local shelter for children involved in prostitution and pornography, and Kid  Power, an organization teaching children self-defense techniques.  </P> <P> "To see these kids have this kind of empowerment is very inspiring," says  Treas, who finds children to be more perceptive than adults. "The kids  recognize me without my makeup on. Adults don't." LAUREN LIPTON  </P></p>

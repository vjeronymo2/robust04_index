			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall cedes ground in PHIT battle JUPITER TYNDALL, the fund management group, yesterday conceded temporary defeat in its battle with the board of Pacific Horizon Investment Trust - but the war may not be over, writes Philip Coggan. The Pacific Horizon directors want to replace Jupiter Tyndall, which has been managing the trust, with Baillie Gifford. Alternatively, Jupiter Tyndall had proposed a reconstruction of the trust in which shareholders could have received an offer worth 90 per cent of the trust's net asset value. Two extraordinary meetings are due to be held today, at which shareholders will vote on the rival pro- posals. But Jupiter Tyndall said yesterday it understood 'that a number of significant shareholders wish to support the alternative proposals of the board of PHIT, and it has there- fore decided that, in order to avoid further controversy, it will no longer continue to press for the resolutions to be passed at the Second Extra- ordinary General Meeting.' In fact, Jupiter Tyndall will not even propose the resolutions. Victory for the Pacific Horizon board in today's votes therefore seems certain. Mr Garnet Harrison, Pacific Horizon's chairman, said yester- day that he was 'pleased' to hear the news. However, Mr Harrison's victory may not be final. In July, Jupiter Tyndall announced an approach from another investment trust which might be interested in making a bid for Pacific Horizon. Although that approach was then withdrawn, there have been reports of other trusts waiting in the wings to make an offer. Mr Harrison said yesterday 'we take the view that any potential offeror has had plenty of time to make a bid. If there were an offeror, surely they would have made themselves known by now.'</p>

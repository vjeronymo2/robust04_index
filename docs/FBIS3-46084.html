			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jia Fenyong (6328 1164 0516)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- The National Conference  of Heads of Religious Bureaus opened today in Beijing.  Attending the meeting were some 100 people from religious  departments in provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities, and responsible comrades from relevant CPC  Central Committee and state organs.    State Councillor Ismail Amat spoke at the meeting. He said:  Correct handling of religious affairs and doing a good job are  an important part of building the great cause of socialism with  Chinese characteristics, which has an important significance in  maintaining social stability; enhancing national unity; and  promoting reform and opening up. Reform and opening up bring  great changes to society and to the people's spiritual outlook,  and provide a favorable social environment for doing a good job  in religious affairs. At present, religious affairs work faces  many new situations and problems. To do a good job under the  new situation, it is necessary to seriously study Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; to resolutely implement guidelines set forth at  the 14th CPC National Congress and Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee; to incorporate the party's basic  line into the real practice of religious affairs work; and to  handle various day-to-day religious affairs work in strict  accordance with the state's relevant laws, regulations, and  policies. At the same time, it is necessary to attach great  importance to unity in religious affairs work. We must forge  unity between the masses of believers and nonbelievers, between  the masses of different religions, and among those who believe  in the same religion; we must be united, be of one heart and one  mind, strive for common progress, and for building a modern  socialist state.    Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of  the United Front Work Department under the CPC Central  Committee, and deputy secretary general of the State Council Xi  Dehua attended today's plenary session. Zhang Shengzuo,  director of the State Council's Bureau of Religious Affairs,  delivered a work report; deputy director Chi Nai presided over  the meeting.</p>

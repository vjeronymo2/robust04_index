			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: World wary of Fortress America syndrome - The view from overseas MENTION Nafta, and it is likely that 'trade blocs' or 'Fortress America' will be mentioned in the same breath. Countries outside the region have been concerned - as they were with the creation of Europe's single market - that it may foster protectionism. But the Nafta text does not yet tell us whether these fears are justified. In so far as the agreement aims to protect US car makers and textile manufacturers, or carve out the Mexican market as the preserve of US exporters, then exporters in Asia and Europe have genuine cause for concern. If US corporations divert investment planned for the Pacific region into Mexico, then that will be a loss which emergent Asian economies may wring their hands over. But if it simply makes US manufacturers more efficient and competitive, and makes Mexico a more prosperous country, then the agreement may provide important net gains to the world economy. From Geneva, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) yesterday hailed the accord as 'a major development within the world economy and international trade.' But in Tokyo, where industrialists see themselves as potential victims of a Nafta agreement, yesterday's announcement was greeted with caution. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) view is that if the accord is 'Gatt-consistent' and 'trade creating,' Japan will have no problem. But government advisers fear Nafta will not be Gatt-consistent. Specifically, the Japanese are concerned about local content restrictions in the car industry, a concern heightened by the US-Canada dispute over the local content of Hondas. Asia's textile and garment exporters may also have cause for concern. The 'yarn forward' agreement in Nafta means garments made by non-north American companies based in Mexico will have to source everything from north American suppliers. The Caribbean economies are without exception heavily dependent on the US market, and fear Mexico's gains could be at their expense. Close behind is Latin America. All are pressing the US hard for free trade agreements that mirror that agreed with Mexico, and will be concerned that there is no 'docking clause' in the Nafta text which allows speedy accession to Nafta.</p>

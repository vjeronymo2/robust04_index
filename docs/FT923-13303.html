			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Arts: Murder by Misadventure HERE IS an old-fashioned comedy thriller of a kind now seldom seen on the West End stage. Written by Edward Taylor, veteran of radio and television scripts including The Men from the Ministry, Murder by Misadventure has a desperately slow start, but begins to come to life towards the end of the first act and afterwards scarcely looks back. The production contains an outstanding performance by Greg Hicks as Inspector Egan. The Inspector does not appear until the second (and final) act is under way. By then a murder has been planned, is thought to have been executed, but turns out not to have taken place in the expected way. Hicks comes in to sort it out, which is where the comedy begins. In the end it appears that there may have been no murder, or at least of anyone in the cast, and Hicks emerges not as a policeman, but only another actor/script-writer looking for new twists in old plots. Meanwhile, he has done a marvellous impersonation of a cynical modern, plain clothes Inspector. The opening is banal. The script-writing team of Howard Kent and Paul Riggs is breaking up because Kent, a former accountant, is fed up with the drinking habits of his partner, and thinks he can do better on his own. Riggs, however, provides most of the ideas and is aware of flaws in Kent's accountancy past. Riggs (played by William Gaunt) threatens blackmail; Kent (Gerald Harper) responds by arranging the perfect murder based on Riggs's latest scenario. The method used is putting drugs in whisky and leaving him to die of hypothermia on the Kents' balcony overlooking the English Channel. When Kent and his wife return from a trip to the US, they expect to find the body, but discover only bloodstains and a lady's jacket. That is really when the piece takes off: enter Inspector Egan and the investigation begins. Hicks plays the part as if he would never resort to bullying. It is only all that police violence shown on television, he observes, that gives the police thoughts of wish fulfilment. Young, dapper, wearing a leather jacket and looking supremely self-confident, he proceeds by asking questions and revealing the odd bit of information. Note his dominant position when he sits on the centre of the settee and knows he commands the stage. As for jokes, he produces: 'You wouldn't be thinking of going to Spain, would you? There's been an extradition treaty - the only good thing to come out of the EEC,' as he calls the European Community. This is a splendid piece of acting, full of menace. There is a good set of the Kent's hyper-modern apartment designed by Tim Shortall, as well as some intriguing but underdeveloped business of objects mysteriously moving position. The role of Emma Kent, played by Angela Down, is also curiously subdued. It is not the best thriller one has ever seen, but I enjoyed the second half, and wish it well. Murder is directed by the very experienced Val May: he deserves a slightly better script. Vaudeville Theatre. (071) 836 9987</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION NOTES / MARTIN BECK;  </P> <P> CHAPMAN IS A PAIN IN THE NET TO RIVERSIDE'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM  </P> <P> Regardless of its national ranking, the UC Riverside women's volleyball team  seems to have trouble when it plays Chapman in Orange.  </P> <P> Last season, Chapman defeated Riverside -- then ranked No. 1 in the NCAA's  Division II -- in five games at the Hutton Center. Later in the season, the  Panthers lost twice at Riverside, including a match that decided a playoff  spot.  </P> <P> Tuesday night, Chapman did it again, winning at home over second-ranked  Riverside in five games. The victory came almost a week after Chapman opened  the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. season by getting swept at home by No.  5 Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> But defeating two National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics teams -- The  Master's College and Cal Baptist -- last weekend apparently recharged the  Panthers, who are 16-9, 1-1 in the conference and ranked 13th in the latest  NCAA poll. Chapman was led by Debi Waller, who had 30 kills and 17 digs, and  Rena Strange, who had 18 kills.  </P> <P> "I knew that we were a much better team than that," Chapman Coach Mary Cahill  said, referring to the loss to Cal Poly Pomona. "This helps a lot. It will give  the girls a little more confidence.  </P> <P> "They know they can play together and beat a good team."  </P> <P> No one got a hole-in-one at the Chapman Athletic Foundation Golf Tournament  Monday, so no one went home with a Honda or Dodge from the Goodwin car  dealership in Fullerton or $10,000 from Orange National Bank.  </P> <P> But the event raised a big chunk of money for the college's athletic  scholarship fund, Chapman Athletic Director Dave Currey said. The final figure  has not been totaled, he said, but the major sponsor, First American Title  Insurance Co., presented $10,000 and 19 other corporate sponsors gave $1,500  each so the figure may be close to $40,000.  </P> <P> "It was a big victory, as we say," Currey said.  </P> <P> The tournament was won by the foursome of Chapman baseball coach Mike Weathers  and boosters Jack Brushert, John Baker and Craig Kuhsc, which shot 59 on the  Newport Beach Country Club course. A group which included former Dallas Cowboy  kicker Efren Herrera finished fourth.  </P> <P> Conference championship: Southern California College cross-country runner  Sherri Hall, a 39-year-old mother of two, will attempt to win her second Golden  State Athletic Conference championship in three years Saturday at Bonelli Park  in Pomona.  </P> <P> Hall, who earned All-American honors in track for finishing fifth in the  10,000-meter race at the NAIA championship last May, likely will be challenged  Saturday by Jenee Ellis of Azusa Pacific. Ellis is the only runner from a  conference school to beat Hall this season, although Hall won three of their  four meetings.  </P> <P> Christ College Irvine, will be running in its first meet with enough women to  score as a team.  </P> <P> College Division Notes  </P> <P> Christ College Irvine ended a couple of losing streaks this week. When the  men's soccer team defeated Caltech, 6-0, Tuesday, it was their first victory in  seven games. The Eagles (2-9) last won Sept. 14 when they defeated Christian  Heritage, 5-0. The women's volleyball team, after losing four consecutive  matches to conference opponents, defeated District 3 foe Biola in five games  Tuesday. . . . SCC's men's soccer team lost to UCLA, the No. 1-ranked team in  Division I, 7-0.  </P></p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Loyalty pledge boosts Tokyo coalition The position of Japan's governing coalition in the battle for political reform has been strengthened by a pledge of loyalty from the Social Democratic party, the largest but shakiest partner in the seven-party alliance. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, SDP chairman, said last night he was confident the four political and electoral reform bills would be adopted. He was speaking a day after the end of the SDP's annual convention, at which a divided SDP closed ranks enough to issue a promise to support the coalition and the reform plans. The government aims to put the plans to an upper house vote next Wednesday, the last hurdle before they become law. Success in the upper house, where the coalition has a slender majority, would further speed the biggest realignment of the political system since the second world war. Yesterday, a group of opposition Liberal Democratic party MPs accused the coalition of using 'fascist' tactics to obtain agreement on reform - strong words by Japanese standards. Separately, Premier Morihiro Hosokawa denied press suggestions he was planning a cabinet reshuffle, to strengthen the government's economic management and quell coalition differences. Speculation is growing that agreement on reform will be the signal for another round of realignments of parties and politicians. The SDP pledge of support represents a victory by the party's moderate leaders over a powerful left-wing minority, which fears the reforms spell disaster for the party. The bills were 'cyanide', one such delegate said during a heated two-day SDP annual convention which ended on Wednesday evening. In a disappointing step for Mr Hosokawa, the SDP agreed to continue resisting plans for a sales tax increase. This casts a shadow over any economic recovery because it complicates the government's attempts to launch an economic stimulus package, including tax reform, as soon as the reform vote is over. Leading coalition members take the finance ministry line that a drop in income tax, seen by many as essential to pulling Japan out of recession, must be funded by a rise in sales tax. Analysts believe the SDP's desire to hold on to its first experience in power in 45 years means it will compromise on tax at the last minute, just as it is doing on political reform. If the SDP left the coalition over tax, so bringing down the government, a future administration would decide a far higher rise in sales tax than even SDP moderates can accept. 'That's a compelling reason for them to stay in the coalition,' one analyst said.</p>

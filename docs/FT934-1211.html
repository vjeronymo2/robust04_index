			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Keating to keep MPs sitting over land bill Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, said yesterday Australia's federal parliament would continue to sit for as long as necessary to debate the highly-contentious 'native title' bill, which sets up a system for dealing with land claims by aborigines and Torres Strait islanders. The Australian parliament was meant to rise last week but recovened yesterday in an effort to debate the legislation and deal with over 200 proposed amendments before Christmas. Opposition leaders and interest groups such as the mining industry, which are fighting the legislation, have urged either that it be scrapped or that the matter at least be reconsidered in the new year. Mr Keating said yesterday that 'If we have to sit here until Christmas Eve and come back on Boxing Day and keep going, we will, because we're going to see the senate vote on this bill'. He added that the government was justified in seeking to have the bill passed this year, in the light of the extensive consultation process that had already taken place.</p>

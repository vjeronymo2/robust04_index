			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAN ON OFFSHORE OIL EXPLORATION FRUSTRATES FIRMS;  </P> <P> A MORATORIUM WOULD POSTPONE RETURN ON HUGE SUMS ALREADY INVESTED  </P> <P> The first thing that an oil company sinks into an offshore drilling project  isn't a metal bit or a seismic probe. It's money.  </P> <P> Under the best circumstances, a firm can expect to pour millions of dollars and  seven to 10 years into a project before seeing any production -- or any return  on its investment.  </P> <P> For most oil companies, it's a calculated risk of doing business, particularly  when offshore areas promise the best prospects for replacing ever-dwindling  domestic supplies of crude.  </P> <P> But now, a sweeping moratorium on offshore drilling is moving quickly through  Congress, threatening to throw a major obstacle in the path of industry efforts  to tap what officials believe is a potential reserve of as much as 7 billion  barrels of oil.  </P> <P> For some companies, the law would even further postpone any return on their  already sizable investments in offshore prospecting.  </P> <P> Last week, the House passed to the Senate a proposed law that would postpone  until at least October, 1990, any activity on proposed oil lease sales off the  California coast. In addition, the measure would ban drilling in areas already  leased off the coast of Alaska and Florida and would place about 84 million  acres of the country's outer continental shelf out of the reach of oil  companies.  </P> <P> Because the moratorium would delay pre-lease activity in California, oil  companies would probably not have a chance until 1992 to bid on three potential  lease sales -- 95 in Southern California, 91 in Northern California and 119 in  Central California.  </P> <P> That would place off limits areas where industry officials believe that they  have the best hope of finding sizable new reserves.  </P> <P> Last week, some oil company executives argued that a moratorium could cost them  money by further delaying projects in which they already have invested  millions.  </P> <P> Of course, proponents of the moratorium are less than sympathetic to the costs  that oil companies may incur.  </P> <P> "Public policy on offshore drilling should be decided on the merits of the  environmental risk, not what it costs a company if they have to wait a little  longer to be granted access to it," said Andy Palmer, director of the  Washington office of the American Oceans Campaign, an environmental advocacy  group based in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Besides, he argued, "if you balance it in the California case, on the  offsetting side is the billions of dollars in tourist industry, commercial and  sport fishing that might be placed at risk by this development."  </P> <P> In any case, oil companies have sizable investments at stake.  </P> <P> In Alaska, the law would put a stop to exploratory and other drilling in areas  already leased in the North Aleutian basin area on the edge of Bristol Bay --  where Chevron, Mobil, Unocal and several other companies put down $95.4 million  for the rights to drill for oil. Including other development costs, the  companies' total investment in the area is more than $100 million, said Alan  Powers, regional director in Alaska of the federal Minerals Management Service,  which handles offshore leasing.  </P> <P> Chevron's share of the rentals and initial investment in the Alaska offshore  leases amounts to nearly $18 million, said Richard J. Harris, general manager  of the land department of Chevron U.S.A.'s Western Region.  </P> <P> "The other cost, of course, is (from) all those people working on that," he  said. "To be suddenly on hold for a year without knowing whether there will be  another extension (of the moratorium) for the year makes it difficult to be  organized or efficient at all in our operations," he said.  </P> <P> The moratorium would direct the Department of Interior to explore compensating  the oil companies for their costs and consider buying back the leases.  </P> <P> In Florida, Unocal Corp. and its partners have invested $20 million in leases  in the Pulley Ridge area of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, said Unocal spokesman  Arthur Bentley.  </P> <P> Mobil Oil Corp. has invested $33.2 million as its share of an investment with  other partners in leases in the Pulley Ridge area, not including the costs of  administration or seismic and other tests in preparation for drilling, a  spokesman said.  </P> <P> Those investments would be put on hold if the moratorium halts exploratory  drilling in those areas.  </P> <P> In California, the moratorium would postpone future lease sales until at least  October, 1990, but would have no effect on ongoing exploratory or production  drilling on existing leases, said Barry Toiv, spokesman for Rep. Leon E.  Panetta (D-Monterey), who drafted the bill. After that, the moratorium could be  reviewed and extended, he said.  </P> <P> Industry executives are reluctant to discuss their strategies for putting  together the highly competitive sealed bids for such lease sales. But they said  an oil company generally spends several million dollars on geophysical tests  and other studies to evaluate an area before making a bid.  </P> <P> Even without a moratorium, all that money and effort could go for naught if the  bid is inadequate. A moratorium simply complicates the matter -- when a sale is  delayed, the studies may have to be recast in light of new information.  </P> <P> "The biggest headache . . . is spending money and effort and time figuring what  to bid for these leases," said David Adilman, an oil and gas analyst with Data  Resources Inc./McGraw-Hill in New York. "When there's no lease sale, it's a big  drain."  </P> <P> Atlantic Richfield Co. is one of several major oil companies that may be  interested in bidding on the California leases.  </P> <P> "The work could still pay off if the moratorium is lifted next year," said Arco  spokesman Albert Greenstein. "It's not like it's wasted effort at this point. .  . . It's always a calculated gamble."  </P></p>

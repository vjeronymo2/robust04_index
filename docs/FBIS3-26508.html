Taiwan was the second largest foreign investor in Malaysia  behind Japan, an official of the ministry's Industrial  Development and Investment Center (IDIC) said.    In 1993 alone, Taiwan businesses invested US$346.50 million  in 86 projects in Malaysia, most involving electronics and  electrical appliance manufacturing, wood processing, textiles  and rubber processing.    Although Taiwan investments in Singapore totaled US$562  million, most of that came from Republic of China [ROC]  nationals meeting an investment prerequisite for Singapore  immigration purposes, the IDIC official said.    Vietnam, an up-and-coming favorite of Taiwan investors,  absorbed 47 investments worth US$436.54 million from Taiwan last  year.    Through 1993, Taiwan was the No. 1 foreign investor in  Vietnam with investments totaling more than US$1.531 billion.  The investments focused on footwear manufacturing and  foodstuff, building material, textiles, and wood processing  industries, the official added.</p>

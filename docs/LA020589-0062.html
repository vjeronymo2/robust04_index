			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COST-CUTTING UNDERMINING U.S. WEAPONS PROGRAMS  </P> <P> When Rockwell International won a contract in 1987 to develop a new gunship for  the Air Force, it appeared that the big aerospace firm had broken into an  important business and had succeeded in at least partly offsetting the decline  of its B-1 bomber program.  </P> <P> But today the company is mired in a colossal cost overrun -- reportedly about  $90 million -- and has fallen behind schedule as it attempts to complete the  first of the gunships, The Times has learned. The Air Force has notified  Rockwell that it intends to withhold contract payments on the program.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Rockwell has retained the defense industry law firm of McKenna,  Conner &amp; Cuneo to conduct a legal review of its contract with the Air  Force, based on concerns that the contract might be flawed, Rockwell executives  said in a recent interview. Among the issues under review is whether the  contract fails to specify all the work necessary to develop the gunship.  </P> <P> The troubled program to produce the gunship, an aircraft known as the AC-130U,  appears to be a case study of how the Pentagon's efforts in recent years to  create aggressive competition and to drive down the price of weapons have  created costly trauma, not only for industry, but also for the military  services.  </P> <P> The legacy of the Reagan Administration's effort to drive down contractor  prices and profits is a trail of sick weapons programs across the nation. Even  though the Pentagon recently has moderated its adversarial methods, the  contract pipeline is full of programs carrying significant liabilities for the  industry.  </P> <P> "The defense industry is not like a department store, where you can take a few  loss leaders," said retired Rear Adm. Stuart Platt, who helped set the  competitive policies for the Navy. "The government is dealing with too powerful  a hand. It has to remember that it has responsibility for stewardship of this  industry."  </P> <P> At the same time, some defense contractors have become desperate to obtain new  business in an era of tight Pentagon budgets, leading them sometimes to make  fixed-price bids that are unrealistically low in their price projections and  risky on technical issues.  </P> <P> "It shows what happens when you have aerospace companies without any business  -- they are willing to bid anything to get a contract," said Paine Webber  aerospace analyst Joseph Campbell, who estimates that the defense industry  faces more than $6 billion in losses on fixed-price development contracts.  </P> <P> For example:  </P> <P> * Former Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr. once boasted that he cut the  development cost of the T-45 trainer aircraft in half with aggressive  negotiating. But, as a result, McDonnell Douglas had to forgo wind-tunnel tests  of the aircraft, among other things. Now, the Navy has discovered that the  aircraft is unstable and needs engine modifications to even land on an aircraft  carrier.  </P> <P> * Grumman, a Long Island aircraft builder, agreed to develop a new version of  the F-14 fighter plane without any profit and under a fixed-price contract. It  suffered a $120-million cost overrun, though it ultimately persuaded the Navy  to absorb half the loss.  </P> <P> * The Norden unit of United Technologies was stung with a loss of several  hundred million dollars on a fixed-price contract to develop new radar.  </P> <P> * Hughes Aircraft suffered a $250-million loss on a new tactical missile for  the Air Force.  </P> <P> * Five major aircraft companies, organized in two teams, will collectively lose  an estimated $2 billion on a project to develop a new Air Force fighter, which  now faces delays because the government does not have enough money to keep it  on track.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, the Pentagon has no administrative system to even monitor such  losses, even though it so often expresses concern about its industrial base. A  study by the Defense Science Board, a government advisory panel, concluded last  year that "investors' skepticism has caused a virtual closure of the equity and  debt markets to all but a few major contractors."  </P> <P> "These losses are weakening considerably the industrial base for national  security," said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at Prudential Bache Securities. "It is  a bad way of doing business, and it is government shirking its responsibility.  They are shifting as much risk as possible onto the industry."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hughes Official's Complaint  </P> <P> In today's competitions for defense contracts, companies sometimes go to  extremes to get business. A few months ago, Hughes Aircraft bid a fixed price  of $1 to win a position as a second supplier for a Navy electronic warfare  program known as the SLQ-32. Although the future payoff may be substantial, the  company is expected to lose as much as $10 million in qualifying as the second  supplier.  </P> <P> "This is what we are forced to do," a Hughes official complained. "We don't  like to make $1 bids."  </P> <P> The tortured case of the AC-130U illustrates how competitive bidding and tough  Pentagon negotiating can turn a relatively small contract carrying a modest  profit into a nightmare involving a major loss.  </P> <P> The gunship would carry a crew of 13 into commando-type raids, such as the  invasion of Grenada, and operate something like an airborne artillery system.  It could safely circle a target at up to 10,000 feet altitude and blast away  even at targets obscured by clouds.  </P> <P> Under the contract, Rockwell takes a standard C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft  built by Lockheed and mounts a 105-millimeter howitzer into the fuselage, along  with two smaller guns. The guns are aimed by a sophisticated airborne radar,  the same one used on the F-15 jet fighter, and the entire aircraft is protected  by sophisticated electronic defenses.  </P> <P> In July, 1987, Rockwell signed a $155-million fixed-price contract, which  included a profit of $14 million, to develop the technology and produce the  first AC-130U gunship. When Rockwell bid on the program, it looked deceptively  simple.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Misunderstanding Cited  </P> <P> "I don't think we understood what the Air Force wanted at the time, and I don't  think the Air Force understood what we were proposing," said John J. Pierro,  president of Rockwell's North American Aircraft unit, in a recent interview.  </P> <P> "This AC-130U is going to be a pretty lethal weapon," Pierro said. "But (the  program) is harder and more complex than we thought."  </P> <P> The contract required Rockwell to meet a "performance specification" on the  gunship's capabilities, which Rockwell thought allowed some degree of freedom  on detailed design issues. In practice, however, the Air Force took control of  planning the configuration of the system.  </P> <P> The changes demanded by Air Force officials have caused delays, and the service  declined to exercise a contract option to start production of the gunship.  Rockwell must still pass a "critical design review," which has been postponed  from February to May.  </P> <P> "What Rockwell did was underestimate the complexity of this thing," said Col.  Paul L. Beggs, director of the group of programs that includes the AC-130U at  Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. "It sounds pretty simple, especially to  a contractor who has just come through the B-1 program. It is not pressing the  state of the art. But Rockwell discovered they were behind the eight ball and  so we agreed to slip the schedule."  </P> <P> The problems started before Rockwell even signed the contract.  </P> <P> In selecting Rockwell, the Air Force used a bargaining technique known as a  "best and final offer" to haggle for a good deal. In its request for a best and  final offer, dated May 29, 1987, the Air Force said that it had only $438  million to spend to buy 12 gunships and that bidders for the program were  required to fulfill all of the requirements that the Air Force wanted or their  bids would be thrown out.  </P> <P> The other bidder was Lockheed, which had built previous generations of gunships  and knew something about the business. It thought the Air Force was asking too  much for the amount of money it had to spend.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Hungry' for Business  </P> <P> "We could never come up with the same capability as Rockwell for the amount of  money the Air Force wanted to spend," recalled John McLellan, vice president  for programs at Lockheed's Ontario operation. "We probably knew too much. That  is what it amounted to.  </P> <P> "Rockwell was very hungry for business. They were laying off large numbers of  people on the B-1, and they bid aggressively. It is going to be a costly lesson  for somebody, either the company or the government."  </P> <P> The Air Force also got Rockwell to accept something called "total system  performance responsibility," a Pentagon policy that essentially shifts all the  technical risk onto a contractor.  </P> <P> "It is an interesting contract," Pierro said. "We have learned some things  about those kinds of contracts."  </P> <P> One lesson is that total responsibility means total liability rather than total  authority. It did not free Rockwell to design the gunship on its own terms,  even if it met the performance requirement. The Air Force has insisted on  changes that Rockwell had not anticipated when it bid on the program, Pierro  said.  </P> <P> Rockwell, for example, has had vigorous negotiations with the Air Force on  something called a system integration laboratory, which is a mock-up of all the  gunship's computers, software, radar and electronic boxes. The laboratory is  supposed to make sure that the whole system works before it is put into the  aircraft. Rockwell wanted to do less laboratory testing, but the Air Force  believed that it was less risky to do more testing.  </P> <P> Another major additional expense occurred when the Air Force decided against  Rockwell's plan to use an electronic warfare system -- a radar and  communications jammer -- mounted on a pod outside the aircraft, which is  standard for most tactical aircraft.  </P> <P> Instead, the Air Force decided last year that it wanted an internal system and  selected the very fancy one used on the B-52 bomber. Although Rockwell did not  have to pay for the electronic warfare system itself, the more complicated  internal system required additional wiring, antennas and structural  modifications to the airframe. It also will need five months of flight testing  that Rockwell had not expected, Pierro said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Details Called Fuzzy  </P> <P> Even small items, such as the type of knobs on radar consoles, became a  negotiating issue. The Air Force was not happy with the type of intercom that  connects the cockpit with the battle management center in the belly of the  aircraft.  </P> <P> "Everything was specified in the contract, but details were fuzzy," said one  Rockwell engineer who spoke off the record. "There was a lack of depth in the  contract on the requirements."  </P> <P> Concerns were raised even before the contract was signed, but "the whole thrust  of the effort was to win the contract," this engineer said.  </P> <P> Beggs, the Air Force official, disagrees that the Air Force was aggressive in  its contracting practices. He said the Air Force simply asked, "Mr. Contractor,  you tell us what you can do with this much money. We selected Rockwell because  at the time they offered more for the amount of money we had to spend."  </P> <P> Beggs also blamed some of Rockwell's cost overruns on the company's failure to  firmly tie down supplier prices before it signed the contract. Pierro, however,  said the modifications demanded by the Air Force have caused the suppliers to  push up their prices.  </P> <P> Whatever the cause, costs have been mounting. The company took a writeoff on  the program in the fourth quarter but declines to say how much it reserved for  potential losses. Under its $155-million incentive contract, the government  absorbs 75% of any overrun up to $177 million and then Rockwell takes 100% of  the loss.  </P> <P> At the time of the writeoff, the gunship was expected to cost $50 million more  than the $155-million target price. But since then the expected overrun has  grown considerably. It is now said to be about $90 million over the target,  authoritative sources in industry and government said. One securities analyst  also estimated the overrun at about $90 million, but Pierro said the amount is  still uncertain and that $90 million is "on the high side."  </P> <P> Pierro denied that Rockwell low-balled the bid. Rather, the company sought to  offset its declining B-1 bomber business by getting into weapons modernization,  in which the military services update equipment rather than develop new  systems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Planned to Spend Full Amount  </P> <P> "We didn't expect to lose money," he said. "Philosophically, we would never bid  a contract that way. We think good business, well performed, deserves a  profit."  </P> <P> But the Air Force was not so sure that Rockwell would make a profit. In fact,  it planned from the beginning to spend the full $177 million, Beggs, the Air  Force official, said.  </P> <P> "Did (Rockwell) buy in knowing they were going to lose their shirt?" Beggs  said. "I don't know. My personal opinion is that they bid this program  expecting very little profit or possibly a small loss. But I doubt they bought  in expecting to go $90 million over target."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Rockwell's hiring of McKenna Conner Cuneo may be laying the  groundwork for an eventual claim against the government or an effort to  restructure the contract. Asked if the gunship contract is legally flawed,  Pierro said, "It could be.  </P> <P> "In a case where we feel that we have a work requirement that is out of the  scope of the contract, we would feel obligated to proceed with that (a legal  effort).  </P> <P> "If we have legal issues, we are going to take those off to the side and not  let those interfere with performance on the contract. We are maintaining very  close liaison with our legal people."  </P> <P> Then he said, "It doesn't mean that we are running the program with lawyers."  </P> <P> If Rockwell ends up with a large loss on the gunship, the diversified  industrial firm is big enough and has enough profitable defense programs to  afford it. But other firms are being jeopardized by such losses and many are  leaving the industry.  </P> <P> Eaton, Unisys, Goodyear, Gould, United Technologies, Lockheed and Honeywell,  among others, are selling some or all of their defense operations.  Allied-Signal, IBM and Motorola have said they will not attempt to expand their  defense businesses.  </P> <P> "The longer-term effect of these losses is that it drives the better people out  of the industry," said Michael N. Beltramo, a consultant and former Rand  research analyst. "In the name of competition, the government is unleashing big  anti-competitive forces that are going to result in an industry contraction."  </P> <P> Although a shrunken defense industry may be inevitable in any case as defense  budgets fall, the Pentagon lacks a policy or a scheme for managing the  approaching shakeout, Beltramo said. So far, the Pentagon appears to be  managing its industrial base by saddling contractors with losses, then seeing  which ones are driven out.  </P> <P> "As far as I can tell, this is all happening by default," he said.  </P> <P> But the alternative is equally abhorrent to the industry, which is opposed to  the idea of the Pentagon being able to decide to put specific firms out of  business in segments of the industry that have excess capacity, such as  aircraft manufacturing.  </P> <P> "That's not in the free enterprise system that we have in the U.S.," said  Lockheed Vice Chairman Robert H. Fuhrman, who led the Defense Science Board  study. "We are big boys, and we win some and lose some. If we lose too many,  then we aren't going to be around anymore."  </P></p>

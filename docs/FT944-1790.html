			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / We are the liberators, say Chechens: The root of the conflict lies in the break-up of the Soviet Union Mr Usman Imayev, the Chechen minister of justice, sits in his office in battle dress with grenades clipped to his belt, cartridge magazines curving out of his pockets and a Kalashnikov automatic on his fax machine. 'In March 1991,' he says, 'there was a referendum on the continued existence of the Soviet Union, in which millions of people voted, including in Chechnya, and it got a majority. 'Then in December 1991 three men, the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, decided to break up the Soviet Union. Chechnya had no hand in that. We did not sign the federation agreement with other republics of Russia. We did not take part in the referendum on the Russian constitution. So when Yeltsin talks about unconstitutional acts - who began them?' Mr Imayev's words have a certain logic. Most obviously, President Boris Yeltsin recreated Russia from the ruins of a state which was internationally recognised and functioning. By acting to break up the Union, he lays himself open to the charge to which all revolutionaries who attempt to stabilise a new order are subject: what gives them the right to say where the revolution stops? If such action was taken to liberate Russia, why cannot Chechens act in the same way to liberate Chechnya from Russia? Second, Mr Yeltsin broke up a state which was multinational. Even if Russian primacy was indisputable, the forms and many of the practices inscribed the equality of the races. Now Russia has to remake herself according to Russian traditions - which are not even formally those of a Moslem mountain people like the Chechens, whose greatest pride is their long struggle against Tsarist colonisation. In this knot of issues lies the root of the conflict, and of its importance to the Russian state and the future of its democracy and its reforms. Soviet communism gave Russia a cloak for prolonging imperialism and, at the same time, placed constraints on how it acted. For those who liked Russia least - and the Chechens of all the peoples within Russia must take the prize for that - the new order is felt more as a burden than a liberation. Thus when, three years ago, General Dzhokar Dudayev, a Soviet air force general, roused his nation to independence from Russia, he was playing on strings of national consciousness which vibrated ever more strongly to his touch. 'In the first year of independence,' said Mr Suleiman Khadjimuratov, a prefect of Vedenskopvo region near the capital, Grozny, 'many people were not sure what it meant. Now, no one will give it up.' The issue, it seems, transcends the manifest personal and public failings of a leader who has helped reduce the Chechen standard of living far below that of much of the rest of Russia and reneged on all of his promises of a better life and greater security. Gen Dudayev is not greatly admired by most Chechens for his achievements - save only that he established independence. That appears to be genuinely, widely, popular. The attempts by Russian leaders such as Mr Nikolai Yegorov, the Russian deputy premier who is the presidential representative for Chechnya, to paint the country as a nation of 'slaves' terrified into acquiescence by Gen Dudayev's thugs, are wide of the mark. Chechnya thus poses a fundamental challenge to Russian statehood. This anyway is fragile and incomplete, cramped within borders which, though still vast, are unfamiliarly truncated in the minds of most Russians accustomed to regard the Soviet Union as their free space. In the minds of the Chechens, Chechnya is the historic land of their fathers. For Mr Yeltsin, who has for three years delayed attempting to unravel, or cut, the Chechen knot, it is the sharpest issue since the parliamentary revolt against him in the summer and autumn of last year. To cede Chechnya on the grounds that its people do not wish to be part of the newly recreated Russia is to call into question all of the lands and peoples conquered in the 19th century, and even before. There is, besides, some truth in the propaganda put out by the Russian authorities on Chechnya. It has been for most of the past three years a state in which criminal bands operated relatively freely and where the proceeds from vast amounts of oil were diverted. And it has been a region from which the Russians, and many others (including many Chechens) have fled in fear of the future or in disgust at a present in which their nationality is treated as a barrier to employment and advancement. Two voices are battling for Mr Yeltsin's ear. One is that of his security and military advisers and ministers, for whom Chechnya is the place where the rot stops and the crack of firm government is heard. It says that a chance must be grasped firmly to demonstrate to Russians, their neighbours and the world that the integrity of the Russian state cannot be challenged without a great cost being paid. The other voice is that of the democrats and liberals, the majority of whom are horrified by the war, not so much because of what it will do to Chechnya as because of what it will do to democratic institutions. Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of Russia's Choice and the most vocal on the issue, pleaded again with the president, with whom he is reluctant to make the final break, to pull back from an attack which would 'destroy all you have achieved' in the way of reforms. For Mr Gaidar and other reformers the coalition of forces mobilised to take Grozny at any price, emboldened by their success in making the president head of the war party, could sweep on to strike against the market and representative institutions. Perhaps because of this cacophony of voices, Mr Yeltsin as of last night had not yet sanctioned the final push against Chechnya. Perhaps he cannot. After all, a sizeable part of the invasion force, that commanded by Gen Ivan Babichev, has stopped over 30 miles from Grozny and refused to move further. However this affair ends, the Babichev challenge, with support from fellow generals Alexander Lebed of the Fourteenth Army and Boris Gromov, the first deputy defence minister, will have consequences which must be dealt with. The Chechnya affair has not ended: it may only have just begun. At stake are democracy, reform and the survival of the present administration. As 1994 runs out and the fourth year of the new Russia begins, these are all at hazard.</p>

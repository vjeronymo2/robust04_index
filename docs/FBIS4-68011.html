			<p>BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- Former RAF terrorist Eva Haule  (37) has been sentenced to life imprisonment in connection with  an attack on the Frankfurt U.S. military airport on 8 August  1985. Pronouncing the verdict on Thursday [28 April], the state  protection senate at the Frankfurt Higher Regional Court spoke  of a "particularly grave wrong" committed by the terrorist.  This means that Eva Haule cannot expect her case to be  reexamined after 15 years for suspension of sentence or  pardoning.    The senate is convinced that Eva Haule was part of the  commando that carried out the car bomb attack on the airport and  killed U.S. soldier Edward Pimental in a forest near Wiesbaden  the previous night to get hold of his U.S. identity card. This  identity card enabled one of the terrorists to take the bomb to  the car park in front of the U.S. headquarters at the Frankfurt  airport. The explosion killed two people and very seriously  injured another two. Several other people were injured.  Property damage was approximately 1 million marks.    Haule has also been sentenced to 15 years for an attempted  bomb attack on a NATO military school in Oberammergau, Bavaria,  by the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court.</p>

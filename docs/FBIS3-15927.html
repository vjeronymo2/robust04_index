Irina Khakamada also thinks that the  policy of the government and the Central Bank of Russia is  primarily geared now at stabilizing today's financial structure,  and then at increasing the state control and flexible  maneuvering within the already set rules of the game.    An official statement about the possibility of restructuring  the Central Bank of Russia into a federal reserve system came  last week from Aleksandr Lifshits, head of a group of experts  under the Russian Federation president. This is not a matter of  xeroxing the U.S. Federal Reserve system, which makes it  possible with the aid of a flexible adjustment of the discount  rate and the supply of money in circulation to avoid abrupt  inflationary changes in the economy. However, according to the  economists and bankers behind presenting this idea to the top  power echelons, a federal reserve system, if formed in Russia,  would make it possible, on one hand, to end the Central Bank of  Russia monopoly, and, on the other, to put in place civilized  forms of internal hard currency settlements.    It is no surprise therefore that the given idea, which is so  far just an idea, has provoked more than a burst of temper among  Central Bank chiefs. (According to some information, Aleksandr  Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Russia,  suggested to the unruly bankers, who had put forward this idea  at a conference in the State Duma budget, taxes, and prices  committee, that they "wash themselves in blood"). The prospect  of weaker monopolist positions on the Russian financial market  made Central Bank chiefs conduct a preemptive campaign to  explain that the federal reserve system idea is corrupt and  totally out of keeping with the specific Russian character.  According to reports from informed sources, mutual  understanding was reached.</p>

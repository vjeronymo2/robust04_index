			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Book Review: Smooth operator AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY: RIGHT AT THE CENTRE By Cecil Parkinson Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 18.99 312 pages In Lady Thatcher's Tory party Cecil (now Lord) Parkinson stood almost exactly between Norman Tebbit and Michael Heseltine, two men with whom his paths crossed frequently and sometimes ran together. Parkinson was better off and more formally educated than Tebbit and therefore lacked the Tebbit abrasiveness. But he was considerably less well off than Heseltine and therefore lacked the latter's independence. Parkinson was also a curious mixture of the flamboyant and the banal. It is an exaggeration to have called this book an autobiography for, although it has interesting parts, much of it is outstandingly dull. About half of it consists of rather tedious accounts of what he did as a minister, the implication being that there was little life outside the office. Those looking for revelations will fail to find them. There are, however, two striking sections. The first concerns his feelings about Margaret Thatcher, whom he admired beyond the call of duty. The second is about his early days before he chose politics. The fall of the prime minister, as she then was, occupies the first 50 pages and must have been one of the main reasons for writing the book. Parkinson was one of the few cabinet ministers to support her to the end. The others were Kenneth Baker and Peter Brooke. He quotes her as saying that it was not the challenge of Heseltine that brought her down; it was, in her own words, 'the cabinet'. He then proceeds to bear this out. When Mrs Thatcher narrowly failed to win on the first ballot, the bulk of the cabinet decided that she must go and - of equal importance - that Heseltine should not be the successor. That was why both John Major and Douglas Hurd were put up against him - to split the Heseltine vote. Parkinson argues that she had almost seen it coming. His theory goes that she was preparing yet again to create a cabinet in her own image. She was unable to do that when she became prime minister in 1979 because she inherited too many 'consensus' rather than 'conviction' colleagues. She started to change the balance with her first cabinet sackings in 1981 and by bringing in people such as Parkinson and Tebbit. Yet the new parliamentary intake goes in cycles. Many able Tories who entered the House of Commons in 1979, such as John and Christopher Patten, were not Thatcherites, but in due course had to be promoted on merit. The balance was thus swinging against her until she could bring forward the more convictionist intake of 1983, such as Francis Maude, Michael Forsyth and Michael Portillo. Time ran out. Parkinson is a good political analyst and one is inclined to take his theory seriously. He was also an excellent party chairman. Compare his smooth success in helping to win the general election of 1983 with the quarrels that went on when the Tories won much more acrimoniously in 1987. Perhaps his background helped. His father was a 'Bevin boy' who went down the mines because he was too old for the war and subsequently worked on the railways. Cecil was a young recruit to the Labour party and sometimes attended communist rallies. Although his socialism had ebbed before he went to Cambridge, he still tended to look down on what came to be called the 'Cambridge mafia' in the Heath, Thatcher and Major cabinets. He was offered a place at Emmanuel College on the assumption that he would read divinity, but switched to English literature which he read under F R Leavis before changing again to law. Unusual for the Cambridge of the time, he chose to go into industry and joined Metal Box. While training as an accountant, he came across a 'tall, blond Oxford graduate called Heseltine' who already ran his own business and seems to have terrified him. Politics came gradually, partly by building a constituency organisation with Tebbit. He won Enfield West in a 1970 by-election and quickly became PPS to Heseltine. The party chairmanship was the peak of his career. It was on the day of the election in 1983 that he told Mrs Thatcher about his affair with Sara Keays. He felt unable to accept the prime minister's offer of the Foreign Office as a reward for his services and went instead to the Department of Trade and Industry. There was one achievement: he brought about the settlement between the Stock Exchange and the Office of Fair Trading which led to Big Bang. But the affair and the media pursued him and he had to resign. Mrs Thatcher showed her continuing loyalty by bringing him back later, though only to energy and transport. The references to Ms Keays in this book are brief. He repeats that slightly offensive line in his public statement at the time: 'I am of course making provision for the mother and child', and there is a singularly ungracious reference to 'my pregnant former mistress'. Still, many people found him attractive. The Queen approached him one day: 'They tell me you have influence with the prime minister. She must take a proper holiday and if you will speak to her about it, so will I'</p>

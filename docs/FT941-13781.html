			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Arts: Dark and desperate down in the pit - Theatre The decline of the British coal industry is one of the most dramatic events in recent British history. Less than a decade ago, the National Union of Mineworkers could threaten to bring down a government, and sometimes succeed. The miners were regarded as the salt of the earth even by former Conservative prime ministers: buying them off was a price worth paying. And when Margaret Thatcher stood up to the miners' strike in the mid-1980s, she was by no means certain the union would be defeated. By now, there are only about 20,000 miners left and British Coal is on the verge of being privatised. Here is a play about the coal face, written from the inside. Mike Cullen's The Cut is the best first full-length work by a British dramatist for some considerable time. Not only does it break new ground in terms of subject, it also observes the classical virtue of confining the action to one place - namely the pit, some 3,000 feet underground. There are only four characters, all miners. Daylight is never seen; the miners shy away from the surface as if it represents a reality not be faced. That does not mean that it is all solidarity. Politics underground are as intense as those above. Because of the location, designed at the Bush Theatre by Suzanne Fields, events are more dramatic. Cullen was an electrician at a Scottish colliery before he turned playwright. His knowledge of the industry must be unsurpassed in the theatre, and the way he draws on it is one of the fascinations of the piece. The Cut is full of technical detail; without it, it would be a lesser play. To take a small example, an elderly miner (Sandy) is plainly suffering from pneumoconiosis; Cullen lets the coughing speak for itself. The writer has borrowed one incident from the 1984-85 strike. In South Wales a concrete post was thrown from a motorway bridge on to a taxi taking a miner to work; the driver was killed. Cullen embroiders this into the wrong man being jailed for the offence, and another being killed because he was a witness. For the rest, however, this is a tale of miners quarrelling with miners, of the most militant being the first to take the redundancy money when the strike is lost and others pushing for management jobs under privatisation. Hessel, the only really unpleasant character, has packed in the union because the only way to have clout is to act from the inside. By the end of the play, he is the new under-manager. The plot is sometimes obscure, and not only because of the heavy Clydeside accents. There are masses of four letter words. But none of that is a defect. This is one of the few occasions where the swearing is a natural part of the language and not a substitute for thought. Being underground may have distorted the miners' intelligence; it has not necessarily diminished it. The Cut is directed by Martin McCardie and performed by a relatively new Scottish company, Wiseguise Productions. It is a thriller because it takes some time before the full villainy of Kenneth Glenaan's Hessel emerges. Earlier one might suspect the equally excellent (but framed) Frank Gallagher as Salter. Jim Twaddale's McGee is one of those panicky characters in between. Bush Theatre: (081) 743 3388</p>

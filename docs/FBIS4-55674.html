			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 19 (TANJUG) -- The speaker of the  Bosnian Serb republic parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik, said on  Wednesday that the cochairmen of the conference on the former  Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, have agreed with  the stand of the leadership of the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.)  that the maps, determined in Geneva on May 13, significantly  encroach upon the integrity of the R.S. and promised they would  work on a better solution.    The formula of the European Union on the division of the  former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina was accepted at  the ministerial meeting in Geneva, where agreement on a joint  strategy towards the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina was reached.  Under the E.U. formula, 51 percent of the total  Bosnia-Herzegovina territory would go to the Bosnian  Moslem-Croat federation, agreed in Washington under U.S.  pressure, while the Serbs would get the remaining 49 percent.    "With regret I conveyed to the cochairmen the conference on  former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Stoltenberg, the stand that the  presented maps seriously encroach upon the vital interests of  the Serb people because they have been made to satisfy the  Moslem-Croat side and not all three sides," Krajisnik said in a  statement to Radio Jagodina.    Taking into consideration that the proposed maps encroach  upon the integrity of the Bosnian Serb Republic and the fact  that they are a poor solution if quality is taken into  consideration, it will be, as Krajisnik said, very difficult to  arrive to a just solution, i.e. a consensus.    The cochairmen promised they would convey the objections  voiced by the Serb side to the contact group for Bosnia,  Krajisnik said.</p>

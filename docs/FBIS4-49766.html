			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- China hopes that the  coming century will see neither world war nor cold war, that  relations among nations will be more open and democratic and  that the international community will advance in harmony.    This was stated by Qian Qichen, Chinese vice-premier and  foreign minister, while addressing the opening of the symposium  on the post- Cold War security situation in the Asia-Pacific  region and its prospects here today.    Dozens of scholars and strategic studies experts from the  United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the  Republic of Korea, Russia, India, Singapore, the Philippines,  Indonesia and Vietnam are participating in the three-day  symposium. They are expected to focus on the security situation  in the region, the security policies of the United States,  Japan, China and Russia in the region, and approaches and  measures to strengthen regional political and security  co-operation.    The overall international situation has moved toward greater  relaxation since the Cold War came to an end. However, there  are still severe turmoil and unceasing military conflicts in  most of the world, Qian said at the symposium.    In contrast, the political situation in the Asia-Pacific  area  is rather stable, as the progress there towards multipolarity  started rather early and the Cold War impact was drastically  reduced. Most countries in the region have long since given  priority to domestic economic development, which has helped  bring about a "virtuous circle of mutual promotion" between  political stability and economic development, the foreign  minister noted.    The situation of relative political stability in the region  is the result of the close co-operation and concerted efforts of  the relevant countries, who should all treasure and continue to  consolidate and develop it, Qian said.    On the other hand, one should also note that there are  indeed  some factors of instability in the Asia-Pacific region in the  post- Cold War period. Some of them are left-overs from the  Cold War such as the Korean question; others are issues that  have come to the fore over the end of the Cold War, such as  economic friction and conflicts over territorial land and  waters; still others have been caused by failure to adapt  national considerations to the post-Cold War situation, as  manifested in highlighting ideology and imposing one's will on  others in handling relations between states.    Qian called on all countries in the region to base their  relations with other countries entirely on the purposes and  principles of the United Nations charter, the five principles of  peaceful coexistence and other universally recognized norms  governing international relations. Mutual respect and  co-operation on an equal footing between states should replace  hegemonism and power politics. Peaceful negotiation, dialogue  and consultation should replace the threat or use of force.  Equality, mutual benefit and complementarity should replace  protectionism and economic sanctions in trade. "Only in this  way can the existing and potential unstable factors be brought  under effective control and be removed altogether, so as to help  maintain and develop the present situation of peace and  stability in the Asia-Pacific region," Qian stated.    He said that China is also in favor of a variety of channels  and levels of bilateral or multilateral dialogue on Asia-Pacific  security. Therefore, in addressing the security issues of the  region, it is necessary to proceed from the realities and  particular needs of the Asia-Pacific region and its sub-regions,  and to improve communications and enhance mutual confidence  among various parties. China appreciates the efforts of ASEAN to  promote multilateral security dialogues in the region and will  take an active part in the ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum), Qian said.</p>

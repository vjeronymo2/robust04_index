			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEDERAL SAFETY AGENCY INTENSIFIES VEHICLE INVESTIGATIONS  </P> <P> A federal safety agency has upgraded investigations into reports of front-end  failures in certain General Motors pickup trucks, seat belt failures in some  Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds and power-seat fires in certain Ford  Tauruses and Thunderbirds.  </P> <P> The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also said it was  intensifying two separate investigations into possible defects in the anti-lock  braking systems of 1985 through 1987 BMWs and 1988 and 1989 Jaguar XJ-6s.  </P> <P> All five investigations were upgraded to the second highest of three levels and  could ultimately lead to recalls of the vehicles.  </P> <P> The agency said it had 668 complaints from owners of 1987 through 1989 General  Motors C and K pickups of lower ball-joint failure, which can affect steering.  </P> <P> The NHTSA said it had 58 complaints of short circuits in the power seats of  1987 and 1988 Tauruses and Thunderbirds.  </P> <P> The agency said 1984 through 1986 Camaros and Firebirds were being checked  because of 136 complaints of seat belt-buckle failures.  </P> <P> As many as 185,000 BMWs could be involved if a recall is ordered to correct a  brake-system flaw.  </P> <P> The NHTSA said it had 56 complaints from Jaguar owners who reported electrical  failures that made their cars' brakes much harder to apply.  </P></p>

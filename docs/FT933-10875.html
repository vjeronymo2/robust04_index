			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Babangida set to delay handover: Transition to democracy likely to be postponed again in Nigeria NIGERIA's President Ibrahim Babangida looks set to remain in office beyond the promised August 27 handover to civilian rule. At a weekend meeting in Abuja, the federal capital, with officials of the country's two political parties it was decided that plans to re-run presidential elections by that date were not feasible, and a new interim government would be established. Although no official announcement has been made, the decision seems likely to prolong the transition to democracy for the fourth time in three years. It will also extend a period of strained international relations and means further delay in efforts to reschedule the country's external debt of Dollars 33bn (Pounds 22.1bn) and resolve its balance of payments crisis. Western governments have already imposed visa restrictions and reduced military links with the Nigerian government in response to the annulment of June's presidential poll. At the Abuja meeting the two army-created political parties agreed to take part in an interim government which will replace the Transitional Council, a group of civilians appointed by the president to assist in the handover to democratic rule due on August 27. They will form a joint committee with some of Gen Babangida's senior military personnel, including the intelligence chief Brigadier-General Halilu Akilu, Lt-Gen Aliyu Mohammed, the head of national security, and Brig John Shagaya, an influential field commander in the north. 'We should. . . see the interim government as a consensus arrangement for concluding the transitional agenda of this administration, which was disrupted by the imperative need to nullify the June 12 presidential elections,' Gen Babangida said. Details of the new government, including its tenure, will be worked out by Vice-President Augustus Aikhomu, officials of the two parties and Mr Ernest Shonekan, who heads a transitional council installed in January and responsible for day-to-day administration. Significantly, Gen Babangida did not reaffirm his previous commitment to step down on August 27. 'We are still in an endless transition to civil rule,' commented House of Representatives member Tokumbo Afikuyomi: 'It's like Jesus Christ's second coming. Promised for so long but no-one except the Lord knows when it will happen.' The president's decision could lead to a split in the Social Democratic party (SDP) between those who are co-opted in the coalition and the supporters of Mr Moshood Abiola, the successful candidate in the June elections. Mr Abiola has so far rejected the interim government and claimed that only he has any mandate to rule in Nigeria. He enjoys strong popular support in Lagos and most of southern Nigeria.</p>

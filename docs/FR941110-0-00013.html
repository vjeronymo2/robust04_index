This amendment requires modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies as terminating action for the currently required replacement and check. This amendment is prompted by reports of loose or missing attachments at the splice joint of the engine forward and aft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust plugs, and loss of the rear exhaust plug following an engine bird strike. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent reduced integrity of the engine exhaust plug installation, which may lead to separation of exhaust plugs from the airplane, and create a hazard to persons and property on the ground. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective December 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O.

The action proposed to require replacement of all attachment screws at the exhaust nozzle plug splice, and a check of nut plates for running torque and replacement of nut plates, if necessary. The action also proposed to require modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies; when accomplished, this modification would terminate the need for the currently required replacement and check. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the two comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requests that the compliance time for the accomplishment of the modification be extended from the proposed 24 months to 60 months. This commenter states that it would have to procure additional spare engines and would need to special schedule its fleet of airplanes to accomplish this modification within the proposed compliance time. This would entail considerable expense over what was estimated in the FAA's cost impact analysis. The commenter indicates that a compliance time of 60 months would allow the modification to be accomplished during regularly scheduled maintenance, thereby eliminating any additional expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered the safety implications, parts availability, and the practical aspect of installing the required modification during normal maintenance schedules. In light of this, the FAA does not consider it appropriate to change the compliance time for all operators based on the unique circumstances of an individual operator. On the other hand, paragraph (c) of the AD provides that an individual may request an adjustment of compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety, and this would be the appropriate means for the commenter to seek the requested relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 110 Model DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 series airplanes of the affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 78 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 46 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required modification, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $21,400 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,866,540,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or $23,930 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Timing critical as Yugoslav peace talks resume: Approach of winter gives added urgency to need for humanitarian aid operation in Bosnia YUGOSLAV peace talks, begun in London last week, reopen today in Geneva amid a growing sense of urgency about the need for a huge humanitarian aid operation before winter engulfs Bosnia and the Balkan peninsula. If any of the agreements made in London are to stick, the conference, which will be co-chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance, the United Nations special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, and Lord Owen, the European Community's mediator, will have to implement a timetable quickly. Mr Ron Redmond, a senior official of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said yesterday that 'several million dollars' was needed to provide shelter for the 2m refugees both inside and outside Bosnia. 'Roads and bridges have to be rebuilt in order for aid convoys to reach the towns and cities in Bosnia. Tons of plastic sheets are needed to provide shelter in many of the homes which were bombed,' he said. The aid programme, which will be discussed in Geneva, will not envisage setting up safe havens, let alone sending the refugees back to villages from which they were forcibly deported by Bosnia's Serb forces. 'To be realistic, many people will be unable to return. They have no homes. They are afraid. The territory is controlled by Serb forces. The ethnic hatred is now too deep. Healing these wounds will be impossible,' said Mr Redmond. Western diplomats said yesterday that Bosnia-Hercegovina had been de facto divided between Croatia and Serbia, despite a commitment from the London conference that its borders would be respected. The humanitarian aid effort faces another problem. Even if many more aid convoys, backed by armed troops under the auspices of the UN, were sent into Bosnia, a western military expert said, Bosnia's Serbs were likely to disrupt distribution. 'If intervention is limited to the delivery of humanitarian aid, the Serbs will see little reason to modify their current methods for seizing and cleaning the areas they claim,' said Mr Charles Dick from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. 'They will probably let convoys through and flights land, contenting themselves with making sure that the operation does not run smoothly.' The danger to the UN forces is evident. Indeed, after Bosnian government forces regained control of the eastern city of Gorazde earlier this week, Serb forces accused the UN aid convoy which reached the city last month of supplying weapons to the city's defenders. As for the dispatch of international monitors to Bosnia's borders with Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro, western military experts said this would not have the slightest effect on the fighting. Given these obstacles, there is every likelihood that the refugee problem will increase, particularly if the war spreads to the Serb controlled province of Kosovo, or to Macedonia. 'Sending monitors to these two regions does not address the problem,' said a western military attache. 'How do we know that Serbia will not send the remnants of the Yugoslav army to Kosovo, while leaving (Radovan) Karadzic and the Serb irregulars to complete their land grab in Bosnia? 'The point is that the London conference agreements are not backed up by force. Any force would have entailed a massive military intervention, backed by air and ground troops. And no western government is ready to go that far.' Nato allies yesterday offered troops and other support to the UN for protecting aid deliveries to Bosnia and agreed that a light force of around 6,000 troops under UN command would be best for the job, Reuter reports from Brussels.</p>

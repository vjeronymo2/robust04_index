			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Saudi ambassador in London admitted the  failure of Saudi authorities to provide the necessary services  to the pilgrims during this year's pilgrimage season, a matter  which led to the death of a large number of them. The  ambassador informed English radio that the number of pilgrims  who died this year reached 829 people.    The JANA Islamic affairs editor commented on the Saudi  ambassador's statements by saying:    It seems that Saudi Arabia is incapable of fully carrying  out  its duties toward the pilgrims who come to it each year from all  over the world. This has become clear this year, when a large  number of pilgrims have died, a matter that has been confirmed  by numerous observers who travelled to the place in question.    The editor said that what happened to the pilgrims this year  makes it incumbent on the Islamic countries to bear their  responsibilities in securing the safety of the pilgrims to the  holy Kaaba and carry out their duties in full toward this issue  that concern all Muslims, and not only Saudi Arabia. [passage  omitted]    The Islamic affairs editor concluded his comment by saying:  What the Saudi ambassador has said raises a logical question: If  Saudi Arabia was incapable of dealing with the situation of  defending itself, how could it offer its services to the other  Gulf countries in connection with offering protection to these  countries in the face of foreign dangers, as it called them?</p>

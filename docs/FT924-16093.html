			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Two unions sign North Sea accord THE Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union and the GMB general union yesterday signed an accord with the Offshore Contractors Council covering about 5,000 engineering and construction workers on North Sea rigs. It involves setting up a consultative committee to cover health and safety, security and other issues, but makes no mention of collective bargaining or representational structures at work. Workers on platforms before oil production starts have trade union recognition but that ends when platforms start to produce oil.</p>

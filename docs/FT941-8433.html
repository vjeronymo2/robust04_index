			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's It has not been a good week for Lloyd's of London. The tragic death of another Lloyd's Name and the rejection of the market's proposed Pounds 900m settlement of past losses are evidence, if any were needed, that the pain remains real. Lloyd's proclaims that there will be no improved offer to losing Names. But the prospect of litigation and years of bad publicity must make the authorities' hearts sink every bit as much as those of the aggrieved Names. A deal is surely there to be done. Perhaps Lloyd's hard-nosed attitude arises because progress is being made elsewhere. Corporate capital is in, and a dustbin for old liabilities is under construction. Lloyd's is considering the possibility of trading participations in syndicates for future underwriting years. That would allow Names to realise value for what is, in effect, the membership of a rather unpopular club. This conjures an asset from thin air, but raises serious issues. In effect, current members of syndicates would be granted saleable pre-emption rights over underwriting capacity. That may be preferable to the grace-and-favour indulgence previously granted by Members' Agents. It may also alleviate some problems if Names can sell their membership of profitable syndicates to cover losses elsewhere. But corporate members may object to this assignment of value to Names. The move will also increase the hybrid nature of many syndicates, with membership increasingly split between limited and unlimited liability. If the market runs into serious claims during the transition to fully limited liability, this pantomime horse could fall apart.</p>

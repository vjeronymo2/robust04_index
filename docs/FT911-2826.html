			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Pension letter query AFTER starting employment with Bowaters in 1967 and being taken over by the Meyer group, I had, by the time that I left Meyer International in 1987, accumulated some 20 years benefits in the group pension scheme. Although in a letter dated 1987 it was pointed out by Meyer that my various 'options' would be set out, nothing of this sort was ever provided. Not until I started a top-up scheme with one of the major pension fund managers was the matter of a transfer considered. However, both my letters and those sent by the pension fund (the Sun Life of Canada) meet with a deafening silence from Meyer. It is now more than a year since I first started to investigate the question with Meyer International. Can you advise if I have any means of applying pressure in this affair? Do I start to pester the chairman, perhaps. If you are unable to get any response from your former employer you can approach the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (OPAS), 11 Belgrave Road, London, SW1V 1RB. Tel: 071-233-8080. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

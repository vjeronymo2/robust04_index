			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Foreign oil companies  which were awarded blocks in the first round of international  bidding for oil and gas exploration in the Tarim Basin in  northwestern China have begun operations in the desert.    Zeng Xingqiu, vice-president of China National Oil and Gas  Exploration and Development Corp. (CNODC), said exploration work  was carried out in the first, second and fourth blocks, with  AGIP, Esso and BP being the respective operators.    The three blocks, situated in the south-east of the  Taklimakan Desert, totalled 38,765 square kilometers, Zeng said.  The operators will work out exploration details and implement  them in the light of the contracts, he added.    CNODC concluded two oil contracts and one agreement on a  geo-physical survey with the three operating groups formed by 14  foreign companies after they won the bidding.    A total of 68 companies from 17 countries had expressed  interest in the five blocks China offered, although fewer tabled  tenders afterwards.    Zeng said he was satisfied with the result of the bidding,  China's first for onshore oil and gas exploration. He said the  harsh natural conditions in the desert pose severe challenges to  exploratory operations there.    The Tarim Basin, with an area of 560,000 square kilometers,  is one of the few "virgin areas" in the world for oil and gas  exploration. However, most of it is covered with dunes or even  sand hills, and often referred to as a "sea of death."    "At a time when oil prices are stagnant, so many companies'  participation in the bidding indicates their deep interest in  China's oil and gas prospects," he added.    Zeng said China's second round of onshore international  bidding has fared well. This time China exposed 26 blocks for  risk exploration and 11 projects for enhancing oil recovery.    So far 76 companies from 17 countries in the world have  registered and are studying data packages. Some of them have  even made field tours, he said.    The deadline for lodging tenders is September 28 this year,  he added.</p>

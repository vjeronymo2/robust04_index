			<p>BFN     [Text] Uzbek Prime Minister Abdulkhashim Mutalov said that  the state language legislation was not satisfactorily  implemented.    He told the commission supervising compliance with the  legislation at its meeting in Tashkent that posters in Russian  were still on display in many parts of Uzbekistan.    He criticized the ministries and agencies which had not used  the Uzbek language in their correspondence.    Mutalov attributed this to the want of national pride and  patriotism in the mentality of certain officials.    Under the legislation adopted in 1990 only the Uzbek is the  national language while the Russian is regarded as the language  of ethnic communication. People of over 100 nationalities  reside in Uzbekistan.</p>

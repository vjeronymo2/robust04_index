			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: BBV to buy Royal Bank of Puerto Rico BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), the large Spanish commercial bank, has agreed to buy the Royal Bank of Puerto Rico, the Royal Bank of Canada's Puerto Rico affiliate, in yet another strong Spanish move into the US dependency's financial sector. BBV officials yesterday said that a price for Royal Bank of Canada's network of 17 branches on the island was still being negotiated. It is likely to be merged with BBV Puerto Rico's 10-branch commercial banking network. BBV said it wanted to increase its presence in Puerto Rico in order to make it a regional centre for banking business in the Caribbean, Miami, Mexico and Panama. Spanish institutions have begun to take a great interest in Puerto Rico in the past few years. Banco Santander now owns three banks on the island, with about 80 branches in all, and is the second largest banking presence in the dependency. In 1990, Mapfre, Spain's biggest insurance group, paid Dollars 100m for Praico, the island's biggest insurer.</p>

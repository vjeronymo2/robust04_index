			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Pushing at the voters' open door RED rose carefully adjusted in mackintosh lapel, Roy Hattersley was ready for a routine canvass in his own political backyard. Not many Labour party workers around. Not a great deal of point in Birmingham Sparkbrook: safe Labour since Mr Hattersley won it in 1964. The workers were in adjacent Conservative marginals. But there are 80 people on the electoral roll at the Trinity Centre, a shelter for the homeless and unemployed. The evening was not a good time to visit, as the shelter official made clear. Retreat was blocked by a resident. 'You Conservative lunatic,' he greeted the deputy leader of the Labour party. 'I'm an alcoholic,' he declared to the world at large. To Mr Hattersley he confided: 'This is not a good place to be. Labour wouldn't have this sort of place.' Certainly it would not from choice. But Sparkbrook needs it. The constituency, just off Birmingham's city centre, has nearly 1,000 homeless families, and unemployment is around 30 per cent. Mr Hattersley moved on to streets of houses constructed for Victorian artisans. 'I'm Roy Hattersley, your Labour candidate, may I count . . . ' - the standard appeal. It was like pushing an open door: 'You've voted for me seven times? Thank you very much indeed.' He was among the Asian-origin population of Sparkbrook.

Ugandan Asians came in the 1970s, Kashmiris in the 1980s. Islam is the main religion. In spite of the fact that Asian names are starting to appear on the lists of Conservative candidates, the ethnic vote largely belongs to Mr Hattersley. 'There is a certain air of 'why is he asking the question?'' Mr Hattersley remarked after he had received another assurance of support. By this time his canvass had turned into something of an evening out. He had his knights of the realm with him, Mr Dick Knowles and Mr Stan Yapp: veteran local politicians who work the constituency for him and preserve their local base. But he had also collected a posse of children, who followed his every move. The cavalcade ran into Mrs Cherrill Burton, vice-chair of the Sparkhill Residents Association. 'The last time I saw you was four years ago,' she complained. Mr Hattersley knows the problems of deprivation in Sparkbrook. 'There aren't special tailor-made policies,' he said. 'This area wants what Labour is offering generally to an extreme degree.'</p>

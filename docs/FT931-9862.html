			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Letter: Classroom peace threatened by dogma and bureaucracy (2) Sir, I have to challenge your assertion in your leader that the action being contemplated by the NASUWT union and perhaps other organisations is a threat to 'classroom peace'. Nothing could be further from the truth. While the main concern of NASUWT is the mountainous increase in workload, a successful boycott of the government's over-prescriptive and distorting arrangements for national curriculum testing and assessment would have beneficial effects for the children. The beneficial side-effect would be that teaching would be restored to the classroom. The disruptive, distorting and bureaucratic nightmare being imposed on pupils and teachers by the government's reforms would recede. You also made the huge assumption that the government's version of testing would help to raise standards. I believe the overwhelming majority of teachers do not share your view. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary, NASUWT, 5 King Street, Covent Garden, London WC2E 8HN</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Amend &sect;404.510 to provide that in determining whether an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual is without fault with respect to a title II deduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overpayment, we will consider all pertinent circumstances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including an individual's age and intelligence and any physical,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mental, educational, or linguistic limitations of the individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including any lack of facility with the English language). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, to eliminate any ambiguity with respect to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of the amendment to section 204(b) of the Act made by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 10305(b) of OBRA 1989 in cases involving title II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction overpayments, the changes to &sect;404.510 will:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) clarify that the situations described in &sect;404.510 in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an individual will be considered without fault in connection with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a deduction overpayment are not all-inclusive; and (2) eliminate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provision in paragraph (n) of &sect;404.510 which requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an individual to be considered without fault with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a deduction overpayment in certain circumstances described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (n), such individual must have made a bona fide attempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to restrict his or her annual earnings or otherwise comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deduction provisions of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Amend &sect;404.511(b) to show that the Social Security  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration generally will not find an individual to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without fault when, after having been exonerated for a title II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``deduction overpayment'' and after having been advised of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correct interpretation of the deduction provision, the individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurs another ``deduction overpayment'' under the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances as the first overpayment. The change to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;404.511(b) also explains that in determining ``without fault''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under such circumstances, however, any physical, mental,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility with the English language) the individual has will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken into consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Amend &sect;416.552 to provide that we will take into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including any lack of facility with the English language) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual has in determining whether the individual is without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fault for purposes of the waiver of adjustment or recovery of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title XVI overpayment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, under section 1631(b)(4) of the Act and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing regulation, &sect;416.556, if any title XVI overpayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is attributable solely to the ownership or possession by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual (or by an individual and his or her spouse, if any) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countable resources having a value which exceeds, by $50 or less,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicable limitation on resources specified in the Act and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, such individual (and spouse if any) will be deemed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to have been without fault in connection with the overpayment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and waiver of adjustment or recovery will be made, unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure to report the value of the excess resources correctly and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a timely manner was willful and knowing. Based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment to section 1631(c)(1) of the Act made by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 10305(e) of OBRA of 1989, we are amending &sect;416.556(b) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that in determining whether failure to report the excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources correctly and in a timely manner was willful and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knowing, and, thus, whether the individual was at fault, we will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take into account any physical, mental, educational, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> English language) the individual has.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Good Faith_Waiver of Recovery of Overpayments_Continuation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Disability Benefits Pending Appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under sections 223(g) and 1631(a)(7) of the Act and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing regulations at &sect;&sect;404.1597a and 416.996, a title II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or title XVI beneficiary receiving benefits based on disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whom the Secretary determines is no longer disabled based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical factors has the option of having his or her benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued through a hearing before an administrative law judge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ALJ). Benefits paid during this period are considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overpayments if the beneficiary loses the appeal. However, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the beneficiary acted in good faith in pursuing the appeal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment can be waived (sections 223(g)(2)(B) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1631(a)(7)(B)(ii) of the Act and 404.1597a(j) and 416.996(g) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> our regulations). Our regulations establish a presumption that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeals are made in good faith unless the beneficiary fails,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without good cause, to cooperate during the appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

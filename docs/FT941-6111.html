			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Accountancy Column: Hope of audit assurance seems a Holy Grail - Andrew Jack assesses the implications of a damning report on the current state of regulation A potent draft document circulating across Whitehall desks in the last few weeks is causing some cheeks to redden with embarrassment among those responsible for audit regulation in the UK. The confidential report, commissioned late last year by the Department of Trade and Industry from Mr Peter Moizer, professor of accounting at Leeds University, and submitted last month, makes some significant recommendations for change to the current regime. If they were all approved by ministers and implemented, the result would be a radical reshaping of the way in which firms are inspected. The purpose of the report was to assess the effectiveness of audit monitoring after the first two full years of operation of the structure established by the 1989 Companies Act. Moizer interviewed practitioners and regulators, and examined the first two annual reports issued by the five recognised supervisory bodies: the three chartered accountancy institutes, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, and the Association of Authorised Public Accountants (which sub-contracts monitoring of its members to the certifieds). The conclusions will not be welcomed by all those mentioned in the report, and in particular by the three chartered institutes, which control the Joint Monitoring Unit (JMU). They were upset by its draft findings and are opposed to their being made public in this format. However, the DTI said this week that it was committed to publication and to generating comment, although it has not yet decided when or in exactly what form. The result is, in any case, likely to a promote a strong response. Overall, Moizer comes down in favour of the idea of the current system of audit regulation. He says the units are working well, that self-regulation is being operated conscientiously within its narrowly-defined role and that the costs are worth paying for the improvements in audit procedures and practices that will result. He says that accepting the value of monitoring is 'an act of belief', but one to which he has been converted. Yet there are many stings in his findings. Moizer argues that the existance of two different monitoring units effectively organised as commercial rivals makes no sense as an attempt to improve professional standards. They should ideally be merged, or at the very least be co-ordinated through a joint committee to agree best practice and encourage the transfer of information. Contrasting the different approaches, he broadly favours that taken by the certifieds. He argues that their inspections trigger less fear among firms, cost less and take less time. He is not convinced that the lengthier periods spent by the JMU, particularly in examining the larger firms, are worthwhile. He also wants the pace of inspections accelerated, to cover all firms within five years. These suggestions may not prove entirely practicable, given the structure of auditing firms - there are far more monitored by the JMU than the certifieds  -and how this may change as a result of the government's decision to exempt many companies from the requirement for an annual audit. This will affect the number of the firms, their methodologies and the funding of regulation. To be fair, some of Moizer's thoughts have already been discussed internally at the JMU and by its masters, the chartered bodies. They have been considering increasing the frequency of visits to firms, for example. So change of some sort now looks inevitable. More interesting is the question of whether his suggestion that there should be greater public scrutiny will be implemented. He says it is, on balance, right that the reports of inspections of individual audit firms are kept confidential, primarily to encourage the authors and firms to be more candid. But he says the existing annual reports produced by the regulators are of only limited use. He calls for the creation of an independent audit monitoring review body, with perhaps three members unconnected with practice, which would examine the process and produce a report each year, rather like the US Public Oversight Board. It could also act as a focus for complaints against professional bodies. Those familiar with Moizer's work should not be surprised that his conclusions go against the status quo. His philosophy was clear from a report written with two academic colleagues published by the Research Board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1992 on the 'audit expectations gap' - the difference between what the public expects of auditors and what they actually deliver. Rather than taking the profession's line - that the solution is education to combat public ignorance - the three suggested a more direct response to meet these expectations: that auditors' responsibilities should be extended beyond existing shareholders, that they be required to detect material fraud, and there should be an independent regulatory agency to oversee the fees and practices of the firms. The DTI said at the time Moizer's appointment was announced last December that it was aware of his views, which raises the question of its own attitudes on the future of the self-regulation of auditing. Some murmur that Moizer's findings in his DTI report suffer the the same flaws as in the research document: the conclusions are not always supported by the evidence presented as much as his personal beliefs. However, two of his most fundamental findings deserve serious discussion. First, Moizer highlights the circular logic implicit in monitoring the larger accountancy firms. Since the benchmarks used by the regulators to assess audit procedures are based on the approach taken by the large firms, these firms are hardly likely to be found lacking. This suggests that the 'clean bill of health' the JMU has awarded recently to large firms entangled in high-profile corporate collapses may offer scant reassurance: for Coopers &amp; Lybrand on Maxwell, Price Waterhouse on BCCI, and Ernst &amp; Young for a series of audits criticised by DTI inspectors. These audits include Sound Diffusion, Milbury, Rotaprint and Edencorp Leisure. The real question is not just whether there are flaws in the firms' procedures designed to identify issues of concern in the audits, but whether their judgments in interpreting the findings thrown up by these procedures are impaired. However, as Moizer puts it in a second vital conclusion, the audit monitoring process does not assess the judgments taken by staff and partners. It concentrates instead on examining documentation and procedures. It does not challenge the decisions made. This means it is a poor safeguard against the pressures on the independence of the auditor, notably the commercial threat of the company's directors threatening to switch to a rival firm. The likelihood of an external inspector being able to assess judgment meaningfully is minimal. Any such hope is probably a Holy Grail. Admissions that might suggest such weaknesses are unlikely to be committed to paper, and only at the extreme likely to emerge under intense cross-examination in court. Audit regulation, at least for smaller firms, seems to be providing a useful service. Overall, it may be working well on its own terms, but those terms are so narrow that they should be served with a health warning. They provide little reassurance to the users of most public company accounts.</p>

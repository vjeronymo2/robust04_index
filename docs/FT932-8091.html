			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Bass hit by UK recession and more bad debts: Chairman expects slow recovery - City responds by taking 50p off share price BASS, the brewing and hotels group, reported a 14 per cent decline in first half pre-tax profits as Holiday Inns in continental Europe were affected by growing recession and the UK brewing business increased provisions for bad debts. Profits for the six months to April 10 fell from Pounds 266m to Pounds 228m  -and the market responded by taking 50p from the shares which closed at 483p. Mr Ian Prosser, chairman and chief executive, said UK sales trends in the past few weeks suggested that the economy was finally stirring. 'But we do not expect any recovery will be fast, and so expect limited benefit from it in the second half of our trading year.' Group operating profits slipped from Pounds 285m to Pounds 268m on turnover 2 per cent higher at Pounds 2.3bn. Brewing profits were 5.2 per cent lower at Pounds 73m, after bad debt provisions were increased from Pounds 10m to Pounds 19m. Beer volumes were marginally higher, despite the group's disposal of 872 pubs. Overall market share rose 0.2 percentage points, with beer supplies to free trade pubs ahead 7 per cent. Rationalisation savings helped ease the pressure from competitive discounting but, after the bad debt provisions, margins declined from 9.3 per cent to 8.7 per cent. 'We are not leading the discounting in the industry but responding to it where necessary,' Mr Prosser said. Pub profits, reflecting the reduction in outlets, fell 11 per cent to Pounds 98m on turnover 2 per cent lower at Pounds 568m. Capital spending of Pounds 48m was slightly lower. Holiday Inn profits dropped from Pounds 54m to Pounds 50m on turnover which increased 13 per cent to Pounds 289m. Improvement in North America was more than offset by an Pounds 8m fall in profits from the European operations. In the half year, 70 hotels joined the Holiday Inn system worldwide, and a further 200 hotels are due to join in the next 18 months. Leisure business profits were up 11.8 per cent to Pounds 38m, with good performances from Coral betting shops and Gala bingo halls. Profits from Britvic soft drinks declined 28 per cent to Pounds 5m, largely due to increased costs as a result of sterling's devaluation. The strengthening of the dollar also added Pounds 150m to the group's net borrowings which, in total, rose Pounds 400m. Gearing increased from 19 per cent to 31 per cent; and interest charges moved from Pounds 27m to Pounds 39m. Earnings per share declined from 20.9p to 17.4p but the interim dividend is raised 3.8 per cent to 5.45p. Lex, Page 20 London Stock Exchange, Page 40</p>

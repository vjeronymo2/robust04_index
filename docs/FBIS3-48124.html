At a press conference, Hata brushed aside some  reports suggesting that Japan's policy on aid to Russia has  changed because of recent political developments in Moscow, such  as the resignations of reformers First Deputy Premier Yegor  Gaydar and Finance Minister Boris Fedorov.    Japan's position to support, in cooperation with the Group  of  Seven (G-7) nations, Russia's efforts for democratization, a  shift toward a market-oriented economy and a transition to a  diplomacy based on law and justice, remains unchanged, Hata  said. Japan is watching closely Russia's moves to form a  cabinet and other developments concerning its domestic politics,  but it has not yet changed its policy on aid to Russia, he said.    He said Tokyo will continue to extend the aid by grasping  the  progress of reforms in Russia and by understanding the needs of  the Russian people.    Hata also said Russia's development and stabilization are  important because the country has influence within the  international community and great resources and technology.</p>

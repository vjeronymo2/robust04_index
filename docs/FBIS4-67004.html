			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "We Need Full Measures to Eliminate Narcotics"] </F>   [Text] Among the Benazir government's priorities, in  addition to establishing law and order, eradicating  unemployment, is the elimination of narcotic trade and taking  action against smugglers. Thus, a decision was made to take  steps to eliminate drug smuggling and the lists prepared during  the caretaker government were also acquired. This system of drug  smuggling in Pakistan has been going on for many years. In  addition to affecting our nation's economy and prosperity, it  hinders implementation of law and order. It can also prove  destructive to the new generation. About 12 or 15 years ago, the  drug abuse was limited to hashish and opium, however, after the  Soviet interference in Afghanistan, heroin also joined this  list. Its trade spread because its price has the secret of  changing people from rags to riches. Therefore, people who  hanker for money and disregard fear of God use various tricks to  make money. As the result of it, the drug trade has also reached  educational institutions and even female students, in addition  to male students. Although all the Pakistani governments during  the last few years have taken some steps to end drug smuggling,  there have been difficulties in totally controlling narcotics  trade because of involvement of some influential persons in  drugs, especially hashish and heroin, smuggling. Heroin worth  millions of rupees is seized every year, however, the persons  involved in this trade are so influential and they have so many  contacts that they manage to escape the law. It is hoped that  the present government which has the mandate from the majority  of our people will pay attention to this evil without any  leniency or favoritism, and will leave no stone unturned in  totally eliminating this evil. Peace-loving citizens and  patriots will fully cooperate with the government to eradicate  this curse.</p>

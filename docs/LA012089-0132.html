			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAYING ON TOP OF THE SHAKE-UP;  </P> <P> MOTHER NATURE'S RUMBLINGS PUNCTUATE SOUTHLAND SHOWS  </P> <P> In Act II of Mozart's "Die Zauberflote," a dejected Papageno contemplates  suicide because he feels that without the woman he loves, his world will  crumble.  </P> <P> New York City Opera's Papageno had the entire Orange County Performing Arts  Center audience momentarily convinced that was exactly what was happening when  a 5.0 earthquake struck Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "Right in the middle of the suicide solo -- what a way to go!" a slightly  shaken Stephen Dickson said after the performance.  </P> <P> "At first I thought people were moving sets backstage. Then I thought it was an  airplane flying very close to the building. Actually, earthquake never entered  my mind. . . . In this case, ignorance is bliss."  </P> <P> Audible gasps and chatter rippled through Segerstrom Hall as people realized  that the rumbling was a quake, not a special effect. Everyone remained in their  seats until the temblor subsided.  </P> <P> When the building began to shake at about 10:55 p.m., Dickson was singing  Papageno's baritone solo in which the comic bird-catcher decides to hang  himself because he has been separated from Papagena, the woman he loves. He  postpones a decision, pleading with the audience to talk him out of it. As he  waited for a response, the hall began shaking and audience members whispered  and nervously checked with neighbors to verify that it was an earthquake. There  was no break in the music, and after the disturbance ended, Papageno sang his  next line in German: "All is quiet."  </P> <P> After the performance, center president Thomas R. Kendrick said no damage to  the center was reported. He said the building was designed to withstand  earthquakes: "This is a rugged building. . . . The worse that could happen is  that the house lights would go on and the standby systems would activate."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS NEAR AIRPORT  </P> <P> There's been so much discussion of late about changing the airport name back to  Orange County Airport that I would like to offer another idea. I think the  airport should be named after someone who typifies Orange County, someone who  symbolizes the county's greed and devotion to the haves taking it all from the  have-nots.  </P> <P> With this in mind, I would like to suggest that the airport be named the Donald  Bren Airport.  </P> <P> DONNA LAMPSON, Irvine  </P></p>

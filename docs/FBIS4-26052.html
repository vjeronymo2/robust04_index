			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Yang Zhaobo (2799 0340 3134) and Guo Xiaolan </F> (6753 1420 5695)]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- The information office  of the State Council today released a white paper entitled  "Intellectual Property Protection in China." Song Jian, state  councillor and concurrently minister in charge of the State  Science and Technology Commission, issued a statement here on  the purposes and significance of the white paper and on China's  basic stand on the protection of intellectual property rights  [IPR].    Song Jian said: The IPR system is an important legal system  for the protection of scientific, technological, cultural, and  artistic achievements. It is also one of the conditions for an  environment for the development of international scientific and  technological, economic, and cultural cooperation and exchanges.  China's Law on Scientific and Technological Progress declares  "the state and society respect knowledge, trained personnel, and  creative labor by scientists and technicians, and protect IPR."  The information office of the State Council released the  Intellectual Property Protection in China White Paper, which  systematically introduces China's IPR legislation and law  enforcement and expounds the Chinese Government's guiding  ideology for improving IPR protection, in order to enable the  international community to have a full understanding of the  basic condition of IPR protection in China as well as the  principled stand taken by China, the international obligations  it has undertaken, and the important measures it has adopted,  and in order to further foster a legal consciousness of IPR  protection among the public. Its release will surely play a  positive role in further improving IPR protection in China.    Song Jian pointed out: China's basic stand on IPR protection  may be summed up as follows. First, China treats IPR protection  as an important integral part of the policy on reform and  opening up and of the socialist laws and regulations; speeds up  the pace of legislation on IPR; and gradually perfects the  relevant legal system. Second, China takes the road of  internationalization in respect to the scope and level of its  protection, and strives to conform to international standards.  Third, China further strengthens supervision over law  enforcement to ensure that various IPR legal systems are  practically implemented. Based on this stand, China has  attached great importance to IPR legislation since the  implementation of its reform and opening up policies in order to  accelerate modernization, the establishment of a socialist  market economic system, and convergence with world standards.  China joined the World Intellectual Property Organization in  1980 and, after that, successively formulated a series of IPR  protection laws and regulations, including the trademark law,  patent law, general rule on civil law, technological contract  law, copyright law, regulations on protecting computer software,  law on unfair competition, and so forth. Especially after the  1990's, China revised the patent law and trademark law to keep  abreast of the international IPR protection trend, and to enable  China's IPR system to completely converge with international  standards. With regard to copyright protection, China's  copyright law and the regulations for its implementation  specifically stipulate the protection for writers' copyright as  well as their relevant rights and interests, and incorporate  computer software in the scope of copyright protection. After  China joined the relevant international conventions, the State  Council promulgated the "Provisions on the Implementation of  International Copyright Treaties" in September 1992 to provide  specific stipulations on the protection of the rights to which  foreign copyright owners are entitled in accordance with  international treaties. We have every reason to say that China  has basically established an IPR legal system and, furthermore,  has reached the international standard in respect of the scope  and level of its protection. Of course, by this we do not mean  to say that China's IPR legislation is perfect. We shall  further amplify laws and regulations. According to the plans  drawn up by the National People's Congress Standing Committee  and the State Council, we shall pay close attention to  formulating a law on protecting commercial secrets, a law on  turning scientific and technological achievements to production,  regulations on integrated circuit protection, regulations on  protecting new species of plants, and so forth in the near  future. I believe China will surely become one of the countries  which has established a complete IPR protection system.    Song Jian said: The principles of China's legal system  are "formulating enforceable laws, prosecuting cases according  to law, enforcing the law strictly, and investigating and  prosecuting any illegal activities." China has not only  formulated an entire set of laws and regulations to protect  intellectual property rights, but has also adopted a serious and  impartial attitude while enforcing these laws and regulations.  Moreover, China has scored marked progress in this field. In  light of the professional nature of judicial work dealing with  intellectual property rights, people's courts in Beijing,  Shanghai, Guangdong, Hainan, and Fujian set up special courts  for intellectual property rights cases in order to have high  quality judicial personnel to specially try these cases.  Recently, China's copyrights administrative organs cooperated  with relevant administrative and judicial organs in  investigating and prosecuting illegal duplication and selling of  audio and video recordings in some regions, and cracking down on  production of pirated audio and video recordings, thereby making  great progress in this field. However, we should realize that  some enterprises and individuals are still indifferent to laws  concerning intellectual property rights, infringement of  intellectual property rights occurs every now and then, some  serious infringements of laws are still taking place in some  areas, and punishment for acts in violation of intellectual  property rights laws should be more severe. The Chinese  Government is determined and able to solve this problem.    In conclusion, Song Jian pointed out: There are no  boundaries to science and technology. As China sets up and  perfects its intellectual property rights system, it is becoming  an important member of the international community that protects  intellectual property rights. While China is establishing and  perfecting its intellectual property rights laws, it will  earnestly fulfill its international obligations, comply with  international standards of intellectual property rights  protection, and play its role in international cooperation.</p>

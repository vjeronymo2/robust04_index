			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUTTING SURTAX ON MEDICARE  </P> <P> According to the article, I am one of the "affluent elderly." That's news to  me. Elderly, OK, but "affluent"? I wish I had the income to match the  appellation.  </P> <P> Only due to a lifetime of prudence have I achieved "comfortable." Now, in spite  of "no new taxes," the catastrophic health care surtax wipes out, to the penny,  my state teacher's retirement cost of living raise for this year. Add to that  the rise in Medicare Part B premium as well as the sharp rise in medi-gap  supplemental insurance, and more to come yearly, how much longer will  "comfortable" apply?  </P> <P> The catastrophic coverage is a catastrophe for some of us. The percentage who  will benefit from it is minuscule.  </P> <P> If I were "affluent" I wouldn't be writing this letter. I would gladly pay up  and shut up.  </P> <P> BERNICE C. NOSSOFF  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

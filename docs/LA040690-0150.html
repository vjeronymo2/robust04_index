			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> MAN HELD IN SERIES OF OBSCENE CALLS  </P> <P> An Irvine man was arrested Thursday for impersonating a sheriff's deputy and  making a series of obscene telephone calls to women in various Orange County  areas, authorities said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Lt. William Francis said deputies seized several security agent  badges, police-type clothing, a police baton and a Taser gun when they arrested  David T. Avery, 22, at his home in unincorporated Lake Forest.  </P> <P> Deputies also found 15 stolen credit cards at the residence, Francis said.  </P> <P> Avery was booked on suspicion of making lewd phone calls, impersonating a peace  officer and possession of stolen property, Francis said. The suspect had been  under investigation since January when authorities received about 30 reports of  obscene phone calls from women throughout the county, Francis said. The suspect  is being held in Orange County Jail on $10,000 bail.  </P> <P> Investigators obtained a search warrant for the suspect's home after one of the  victims recorded one of the obscene calls.  </P> <P> "What (the caller) would do is place his call to a female victim, and would  identify himself as Deputy Sheriff Wilson," Francis said.  </P> <P> The suspect would tell his victims that he had planted illegal drugs on their  property, and warned them he would have them arrested for possession of  narcotics unless they did as he ordered, Francis said.  </P> <P> "If he got the victims to believe his story, he would then inquire as to what  they were wearing, then directed them to perform sexual acts," Francis said.  </P></p>

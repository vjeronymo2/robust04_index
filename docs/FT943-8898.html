			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Management: Desert island manager - Nick Temple Nick Temple, 46, chairman of International Business Machines (UK) was its chief executive from early 1992 until the middle of this year. It was the computer giant's most troubled subsidiary. Temple lived up to his reputation as a no-nonsense bruiser with a precision intellect, and turned the company around. Rewarded with a bigger job - European general manager for the finance industry - he thinks he would welcome a spell off the treadmill. You are allowed one piece of equipment. I would take my notebook computer. I use it all the time to write up notes, briefings and ideas I have while I'm flying across the Atlantic on business trips. It's also got games on it, like chess and backgammon, so that even if I was on my own, I would be able to play. How would you take to a solitary life? I don't think I'd enjoy being on a desert island. I'm very much a social animal and I like people around me. What would you miss most? I love the telephone. It keeps me in touch with what everyone else is doing, and I can talk to people wherever and whenever. My mother - she's 90 - can't quite grasp the idea that I don't have to be at a particular place to phone me, but she's getting used to the idea. And least? I'd miss the television least. I rarely watch it. It just blasts away, and I usually switch it off. Could you operate as a long-distance manager? I wouldn't find it difficult to manage my business remotely. I would delegate to people I can trust. I have learnt the value of having people around who I can rely on and who intuitively know what I would do in a given situation. You can take one film. I'd like Hopscotch, a thriller-comedy starring Walter Matthau. I'm a great fan of Matthau's and I enjoy a film with a few surprises that makes me laugh. I like A Fish Called Wanda for the same reasons. And one book. I'd take Mad White Giant by the explorer and adventurer Benedict Allen. I heard him speak at IBM's business convention in France last year, and have great admiration for his courage. He is totally unconventional and an entertaining speaker. What would you eat and drink? I'd eat fish, which I assume I'd have to catch myself. As I'm not terribly good at fishing, perhaps I'd be allowed a stick of dynamite or two. I'd drink Bourgogne - it's light, fruity and adaptable for all sorts of meals and would be just right for the turbot I'd like to catch. A lot of my best ideas are the result of a glass or two of Bourgogne. Alas, no rescue in sight. What would be your epitaph? I'd like to be remembered as a man who made things happen, who took little notice of red tape and who brought enthusiasm and excitement into work. I'd like to think I'd never be remembered as being boring. Alan Cane</p>

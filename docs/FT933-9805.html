			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Dunkeld shares suspended DUNKELD, the shirt and swimwear manufacturer which recently returned to the black after two refinancings, yesterday appeared back on the brink of collapse as its shares were suspended at 28p pending clarification of its financial position. The group refused to comment. However, it is believed that Dunkeld is facing a liquidity crisis. It is thought to have needed about Pounds 2m for working capital purposes. It is believed that Hill Samuel, the group's lead bankers and 30 per cent shareholder, were not prepared to meet the requirement. In February, the group returned an annual pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.45m, against a loss of Pounds 17.5m. Dunkeld has debt of about Pounds 7m, the legacy of rapid expansion in the 1980s when borrowing rose to Pounds 16m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lichong Angkui and Abdul Karim Mustafa] </F>   [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Friday -- The National Front [BN]  Supreme Council today unconditionally admitted the PDS [Sabah  Democratic Party] and the PBRS [Sabah People's United Party] as  BN component parties.    The decision to admit the two parties, which broke away from  the PBS [Sabah United Party], was made at a meeting of the BN  Supreme Council this evening. However, the BN refused to admit  Setia [Sabah People's United Democratic Party] into its fold.    The meeting, lasting over one hour, was chaired by Datuk Sri  Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and attended by leaders of all the 12 BN  component parties. Also present were UMNO [United Malays  National Organization] Deputy President Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim  and BN Secretary General Datuk Mohamed Rahmat.    Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Dr. Mahathir said  the leaders of all the BN component parties unanimously approved  the admission of the PDS and the PBRS into the BN.    "The BN Supreme Council considered the request of the three  parties to join BN during its meeting today. After lengthy  discussions, we decided to admit the PDS and the PBRS, but not  Setia. [no closing quotation marks as published]    "The two parties were admitted unconditionally as full BN  members," he said.    The PDS was established by former PBS deputy president Datuk  Bernard Dompok, while the PBRS is led by former PBS secretary  general Datuk Joseph Kurup. The PDS currently has 12 state  assemblymen, while Kurup is the sole PBRS state assemblyman.    On 31 May, the Sabah BN agreed to admit the PDS and the PBRS  into its fold. A day later, Datuk Mark Koding, president of  Akar [People's Justice Front], stated that his party remained  opposed to the entry of the breakaway PBS groups into the BN.    The PDS and the PBRS were established after the PBS, led by  Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan, lost power when some of its state  assemblymen quit the party and joined the BN.    The Sabah BN now has seven parties with the admission of the  parties. They are the UMNO, the Akar, the LDP [Liberal  Democratic Party], SAPP [Sabah Progressive Party], the MCA  [Malaysian Chinese Association], the PDS, and the PBRS.    Dr. Mahathir also said that he will discuss with Sabah Chief  Minister Tan Sri Sakaran Dandai the filling of the post of the  deputy chief minister reserved for the non-Muslim indigenous  Sabahans and several other posts.    "I think the admission of the two parties will not cause any  problems because the decision was made unanimously. All the BN  leaders agreed," he said.    Concerning Akar's opposition, Dr. Mahathir said: "That party  gave its opinion. After listening to all opinions, we made a  decision and all agreed."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Relay from Santiago, Chile, by Luiz Augusto Mendoca] </F>   [Text] President Itamar Franco warned that those  businessmen who try to sabotage the economic plan will be  severely punished.    During a chat with journalists this evening, President  Itamar  Franco expressed his indignation over the price markups taking  place throughout Brazil and asserted that the government must  win the battle against price increases by any means.    Franco said that on 14 or 15 March the government will  submit  a draft bill to Congress containing very strict, severe  sanctions on business people obstructing the economic plan.    The president, however, did not mention what type of  sanctions the draft bill will contain. According to Franco,  since Congress is also interested in doing away with constant  price markups, he believes the draft bill might be approved  expeditiously through an agreement with party leaders.    As for the abusive price increases, Franco asserted that  talks with the business sector are not working, that the  government holds talks democratically but despite these talks  nothing happens, mentioning the pharmaceutical industry as an  example.    Franco, who on 11 March will attend new Chilean President  Eduardo Frei's inauguration, also talked about presidential  succession and the rumor that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso will be a candidate. Franco said Fernando Henrique  Cardoso still has said absolutely nothing to him on whether or  not he will be a candidate, and that it is up to him and his  party, the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], to decide  but that he, the president, does not know what the minister has  in mind.    President Franco added that if necessary the minister can  make a decision in 24 hours but that he still has time because,  after all, the deadline to resign in order to run for elections  does not expire until 2 April, which means the minister still  has 20 days to decide.    Franco ended by stating that the president of the Republic  is  responsible for choosing the finance minister and that Minister  Cardoso, in his capacity as a democrat, would never suggest  anybody for the post.    Franco also commented that Congress' decision not to extend  the deadline for those holding a public post who want to run for  elections to resign will speed up the succession process.    Soon President Franco will be leaving for La Moneda Palace,  where he will have dinner with outgoing Chilean President  Patricio Aylwin.</p>

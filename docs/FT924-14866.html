			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Accountancy body changes voting rules THE ELECTION for future presidents of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales will be more democratic than ever before, its ruling council decided yesterday. In the first council meeting to be opened to the public, the members defeated moves to ban canvassing and keep secret the results of voting for the vice-president, who becomes president automatically after two years. The monthly meetings of the council have been made public after a debate over greater accountability within the institute. Voting will continue to be among members of the council.</p>

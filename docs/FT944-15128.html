			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Brussels urges wider trade zone: Proposal would link EU with its North African and Mideast neighbours The European Commission yesterday called on the EU to create a Euro-Mediterranean Economic Area with its North African and Middle Eastern neighbours, to establish the biggest free trade zone in the world, and help stabilise the Union's southern and eastern flanks. Brussels wants the EU to devote aid worth Ecu5.5bn (Pounds 4.3bn) in 1995-99 to lay the ground for this project, and raise Mediterranean policy to near the same strategic importance as east and central Europe, which should get around Ecu7bn over the same period. The EU's eastern neighbours currently receive nearly five times more aid than the states to its south and east, officials say. June's summit of EU leaders in Corfu invited the Commission to come up with a new 'southern' strategy, which Brussels now hopes will be endorsed by December's Essen summit. Mr Manuel Marin, commissioner in charge of relations with the EU's Mediterranean neighbours, said that 'in broad terms, what we would be offering is something like the EEA' - the 1993 European Economic Area free trade zone between the EU and the European Free Trade Association (Efta). The main difference would be that whereas four of the seven members of Efta  -Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - are poised to enter the Union next year, membership would not be on offer to Euro-Med partners. The target countries are the Maghreb and Mashraq states (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya; and Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon) and Israel. Relations with Cyprus, Malta and Turkey remain inside the context of eventual membership negotiations. The Commission argues that it is essential to 'rebalance' the EU's relationships with its neighbours, now weighted towards bringing six central European states into the Union around the end of the century. Germany, in particular, has used its current presidency of the EU to put in place the building blocks of this 'eastern' strategy. This was underlined by yesterday's visit to Brussels by Mr Laszlo Kovacs, Hungary's foreign minister, who underlined his government's wish for full Hungarian membership of the Union 'before the end of the century,' with accession talks starting in 1997. In Mr Marin's view, 'the only country which can launch a realistic attempt to rebalance Europe's relations with its neighbours is Germany; we think the German presidency understands that.' France's EU presidency in the first half of next year is expected to host a Euro-Med ministerial conference to begin establishing the economic modernisation, trade access, and mutual security priorities of the new policy. The French, moreover, will be succeeded by two Mediterranean presidencies of the EU - Spain and Italy - under whose stewardship the strategy should be finalised. A full free trade zone, senior Commission officials said, would take 10-15 years to establish, by which time up to 40 countries encompassing 800m people could be involved. Officials say the transformed prospects for Middle East peace, plus growing instability and migratory pressure in the Maghreb, have prodded the EU in equal measure to review its policy. They add that any substantial boost in aid will inevitably be tied to commitments from the EU's southern neighbours to help control illegal migrants and illicit drugs coming into Union territory. 'Many countries will insist that if we're going to provide around Ecu5bn then drugs and immigration control must have a central part, without doubt,' Mr Marin said. The commissioner also argues that it is important to move now, before southern EU member states become over-nervous about next year's enlargement to the north, and the planned expansion to the east, and the consequent shift in the Union's centre of political gravity Southern EU states prefer aid to trade concessions for North Africa and the Middle East, while their richer northern partners take the opposite view, Mr Marin observes, arguing for a synthesis as 'an antibody to North-South disintegration'.</p>

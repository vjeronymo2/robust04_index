Petitioner filed supplements to the petition on March 14 and 15, 1994. In accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19 CFR 353.12, petitioner alleges that certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings (pipe fittings) from France, India, Israel, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand (manufacturer: Awaji Sangyo (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (AST)), the United Kingdom, and Venezuela are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. (Note: On July 6, 1992, the Commerce Department published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 29702) an antidumping duty order on pipe fittings from Thailand. However, AST was excluded from the antidumping order because its exports were found to have a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> dumping margin. However, based on petitioner's recent allegation, we have determined that it is appropriate to initiate a new investigation of AST.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner stated that it has standing to file the petition because it represents interested parties as defined under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 771(9)(E) of the Act, and because the petition was filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to these investigations. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E) or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, such party should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products covered by these investigations are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent, welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Pipe fittings come in several basic shapes: ``elbows'', ``tees'', ``caps'', and ``reducers''. The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written descriptions of the scope of these proceedings are dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price and Foreign Market Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For all countries except Venezuela, petitioner based United States Price (USP) on price quotes obtained through the business activity of one of its members. Such price quotes show delivered prices of butt-weld pipe fittings to unrelated U.S. customers. Petitioner calculated USP by subtracting movement charges and U.S. customs duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Venezuela, petitioner based U.S. price on average unit values derived from U.S. Customs import statistics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner was unable to obtain home market or third country prices for any of the eight countries. Therefore, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.12(b)(7), constructed value (CV) was used to calculate foreign market value (FMV). Petitioner based the CV on the costs of one of its members, adjusted for known differences in each country. Petitioner then added selling, general and administrative expenses, and profit to compute the CV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, December 31 (XINHUA) -- The volume of  Sino-Latin American trade is predicted to top 3.4 billion U.S.  dollars this year.    That is 400 million U.S. dollars more than in 1992,  resulting  from stable bilateral relations and complementary economies. It  shows a strong momentum for the two sides' trade and economic  cooperation.    Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)  figures show that in the first ten months of this year, this  trade volume reached 2.8 billion U.S. dollars.    "Latin America, among China's trade partners, has jumped  from  no. 5 to no. 4, following Asia, Europe and North America," said  Wang Zhiquan, a MOFTEC official responsible for trade with Latin  America.    Wang attributed the thriving trade mainly to the frequent  summit contacts between China and Latin American countries.    Chinese President Jiang Zemin toured Cuba and Brazil in  November and the presidents of Uruguay, Dominica, Guyana and  Mexico visited China one after the other.    "The visits have offered a favorable environment for the  further expansion of Sino-Latin American trade, " Wang said.    During the visits, agreements were reached in the fields of  economy, trade, investment, and scientific and technological  cooperation. Some of the Latin American countries are  negotiating with China for accords on scrapping double tariffs.    "A sound legal foundation has been laid for the growth of  Sino-American trade," Wang said.    China has been a traditional importer of Latin America's  major exports, such as copper, iron ore, steel, petrochemicals,  paper pulp, timber, wool, grain and leather.    China's exports to these countries have been commodities of  choice because of their good quality and reasonable price.    "We have shipped more machinery and electronic products to  Latin America. They are leading items next only to light  industrial goods among all China's exports to that region in  1993," he said.    As China is vigorously developing its economy and looming as  a huge market, it welcomes Latin American businesses to invest  and produce here with their technology and resources," Wang said.    China has established over 80 joint ventures and enterprises  with exclusive Chinese financing in 17 Latin American countries.    On the possible effect of the North America Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) on Sino-Latin American trade relations, Wang  held that the competition will be fiercer on the American market  for labor-intensive products, as the United States will shift  its labor-intensive industries, such as textiles, garment-making  and shoe-making industries, to Mexico to take advantage of the  cheap labor and resources there.    However, China will be given more opportunities of trade and  economic cooperation when the economies of Mexico and other  Latin American countries are spurred in the wake of the NAFTA  implementation.</p>

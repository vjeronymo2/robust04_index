			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINTER  </P> <P> The pungent smells of a California winter,  </P> <P>  Grayness and rosiness, an almost transparent full moon.  </P> <P>  I add logs to the fire, I drink and I ponder.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  "In Ilawa," the news item said, "at age 70  </P> <P>  Died Aleksander Rymkiewicz, poet."  </P> <P> </P> <P>  He was the youngest in our group. I patronized him slightly,  </P> <P>  Just as I patronized others for their inferior minds  </P> <P>  Though they had many virtues I couldn't touch.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  And so I am here, approaching the end  </P> <P>  Of the century and of my life. Proud of my strength  </P> <P>  Yet embarrassed by the clearness of the view.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  Avant-gardes mixed with blood.  </P> <P>  The ashes of inconceivable arts.  </P> <P>  An omnium-gatherum of chaos.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  I passed judgment on that. Though marked myself.  </P> <P>  This hasn't been an age for the righteous and the decent.  </P> <P>  I know what it means to beget monsters  </P> <P>  And to recognize them in myself....  </P> <P> </P> <P>  You, moon, You, Aleksander, fire of cedar logs.  </P> <P>  Waters close over us, a name lasts but an instant.  </P> <P>  Not important whether the generations hold us in memory.  </P> <P>  Great was that chase with the hounds for the unattainable meaning of the  world.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  And now I am ready to keep running  </P> <P>  When the sun rises beyond the borderlands of death.  </P> <P>  I already see mountain ridges in the heavenly forest  </P> <P>  Where, beyond every essence, a new essence waits.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  You, music of my late years, I am called  </P> <P>  By a sound and a color which are more and more perfect.  </P> <P>  Do not die out, fire. Enter my dreams, love.  </P> <P>  Be young forever, seasons of the earth.  </P> <P> </P></p>

The official, who is Hushyar Zibari, representative of the  Kurdish Administration in Britain, said the authorities in  al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate have begun interrogation of the two  pilots -- Habib Ruhaymi, a Kurd who requested political asylum,  and Iraj Kalanaljin, an Iranian who expressed a desire to return  to Iran. There has been no Iranian comment on this matter.    This is the first time the Kurdish Administration has been  faced with such incident since the parliamentary elections held  in May 1992 resulting in the formation of a government in Iraqi  Kurdistan.    It should be noted that relations between that  administration  and Iran deteriorated seriously last month as a result of the  Iranian forces' artillery shelling and penetration of Kurdish  areas on the pretext of hunting Kurds opposed to the Tehran  regime and using Iraqi Kurdistan as a base.    It is known that the region's administration provides  shelter  for the Iranian Kurdish opposition parties and allows them  political activity in the areas under its control. It has  firmly rejected Iranian requests for the extradition of these  oppositionists or their expulsion from the region, but it did  ask these parties to move their offices to areas away from the  borders with Iran to prevent them being used as an excuse for  continuation of the shelling and penetration operations which  have already claimed some Kurdish civilian victims.</p>

Mohtashami said: A month ago, the Hezbollah center invited  me to speak on the occasion of the approaching auspicious Ten  Day Dawn. Ten days ago, one of the members of the center  contacted me and said that local officials objected to my  addressing the center and did not consider it expedient. He  then told me that it was the governor general himself who  objected and created problems, so that my scheduled speech would  be canceled. The governor general informed the center that if  the event was not canceled, law enforcement officials would stop  it.    Mohtashami was asked: Did you complain to the relevant  authorities?    Mohtashami said: I do not know whether there are any  relevant authorities for such a complaint! In principle, a  complaint about the governor general should be made to the  interior minister. However, when the minister himself bans a  legal march by students, and then openly defends his action and  condemns the students in an address to the Majles, how can I  complain to him?! In response to a question on whether the  Hezbollah center in Sari has lodged an official complaint,  Mohtashami stated: It is unlikely that the center would do so.  Those at the center are employed in various organizations and  institutions and if they display any resistance, their  employment can be terminated.    In response to a question on whether Mohtashami received an  apology from officials, he replied in the negative and added:  The center was threatened with complete closure if such a  speech were made.</p>

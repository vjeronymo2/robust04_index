			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Riyadh, Jan 22, SPA -- Saudi Arabia's Arabic  newspapers today highlighted editorially Saudi Arabia's overall  development and commented on the on-going peace process in the  Middle East. [passage omitted]    Commenting on the peace process in the Middle East, the  Jeddah- based AL-MADINAH said despite the Israeli maneuvers, a  comprehensive settlement will be realized in the Middle East in  view of the fact that it is being supported by the international  public opinion.    "Moreover, the comprehensive settlement is supported by  America and the Arab countries and at the same time it has  become an essential matter after the end of the era of the Cold  War," the paper added.    The Jeddah-based 'UKAZ deplored the intransigent policy of  Israel and said the Israeli policy would block the march of  peace.    The daily criticized the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin to hold referendum in Israel on the idea of  restoring Golan Heights to Syria and said the proposal runs  counter to the Resolutions 242 and 338 issued by the Security  Council.    The idea of referendum constitutes a violation of the  international law because it would be illogical to inquire from  people of a country about the future of another country, the  daily added.    The Dammam-based AL-YA'UM deplored a statement of Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in which he said Israel would not  withdraw from Golan Heights before a visit of Syrian President  Hafiz al-Asad to Israel and said such a statement was part of a  series of the maneuvers practiced by Tel Aviv.    The paper called for a firm stand against the Israeli  maneuvers and procrastination which aim at blocking the peace  process. "It is high time for the U.S. to shorten the period of  talks and take the appropriate measures for the implementation  of the international resolutions," the paper said.</p>

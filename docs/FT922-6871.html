			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Perot scores with write-in primary votes TWO MORE easy presidential primary victories for President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton in the US on Tuesday have again been overshadowed by evidence of Mr Ross Perot's growing political appeal in the Far West and nationally. However, the Texan businessman was himself embarrassed yesterday by a published report in which Senator Warren Rudman, a Republican from New Hampshire, expressed his annoyance that Mr Perot seemed to have hired a private investigator to make 'unauthorised inquiries' about his background. Mr Rudman had been viewed as a possible vice-presidential running-mate for Mr Perot, but said he had no interest in the prospect now. The primary story from Oregon and Washington state was familiar. Mr Bush scored 76 and 83 per cent respectively, against 22 and 13 per cent for Mr Pat Buchanan, his remaining nominal challenger for the Republican nomination. The president won 53 delegates in the two states to Mr Buchanan's five, further padding his already sure majority to take to the party convention. Mr Clinton took 50 per cent of the vote in Oregon and 51 per cent in Washington, against former California governor Jerry Brown's respective 35 per cent and 29 per cent, with former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas, who has pulled out of the race, winning 11 and 16 per cent. Washington state names convention delegates in separate caucuses. The 29 Mr Clinton won in Oregon give him more than 1,850 of the 2,145 needed for the Democratic nomination, which he may well secure in the final primaries - including those of California, Ohio and New Jersey - on June 2. Primaries next week, in Kentucky and Mr Clinton's native Arkansas, do not award enough delegates to put him over the top. However, in both the Democratic and Republican primaries this week, there was evidence of a surprisingly large write-in vote for Mr Perot. Neither state is obliged to disclose such votes immediately, but a CNN exit poll suggested Mr Perot's support exceeded 10 per cent in Oregon and might have carried some rural counties in Washington. That said registered Democrats in Oregon preferred Mr Perot to Mr Clinton by 45 to 41 per cent. On the Republican side, 49 per cent went for Mr Bush and 40 per cent for Mr Perot. The Pacific north-west has long been fertile ground for iconoclastic, outsider politicians. In 1968, Oregon voted for Senator Eugene McCarthy over Senator Robert Kennedy. Several recent local polls have put Mr Perot ahead of the current pack. The NBC-Wall Street Journal survey, out yesterday, had Mr Bush in the lead with 35 per cent, followed by Mr Perot at 30 per cent and Mr Clinton with 27 per cent. Moving closer to a formal declaration of candidacy, Mr Perot has now filed a 123-page financial disclosure statement with the Federal Election Commission. This does not reveal a net worth - assumed to be over Dollars 3bn - but points to recent annual incomes from investments ranging from about Dollars 25m to as much as Dollars 130m. It suggests he has mostly been a conservative investor of his private wealth, being heavily into tax-exempt municipal and utility bonds as well as property, with some hedged bets in stock and currency options, and venture capital partnerships. It was, according to the FEC, easily the largest such statement of wealth received from a presidential aspirant. It underlines his ability to finance a campaign from his own pocket without recourse to federal funds. The question of Mr Perot's ability to buy the presidency, as it were, may become an issue late in the year.</p>

Under the bill, the status can be granted not only to  Latvian  citizens but also to permanent residents who suffered either  from the Communist or Nazi regimes in Latvia.    The bill, unlike the currently effective law, recognizes the  two occupation regimes in Latvia, said Inese Birzniece, head of  the Human Rights Committee. Presently, 28,000 people have  certificates of politically repressed persons in Latvia.    The committee will submit the bill for Saeima consideration  March 28.</p>

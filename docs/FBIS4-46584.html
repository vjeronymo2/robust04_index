			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Sizova in the column "Warning": "Would </F> You Step on a Rake?]    [Text]  <H8>  Friedship With Mafia Always a One-Way Street, Even for </H8> Military    Especially visible among the many less than hopeful trends  current today is a pronounced increase in professionalism of  organized crime. In literally one year, the domestic "Cosa  Nostra" has progressed from minor stabbings and senseless random  shootings to surprisingly accurate explosions in offices and  residences, to contract killings carried out with a sniper's  precision, to highly sophisticated criminally planned motor  vehicle accidents.    It appears in general that the amateurs have been replaced  by  professionals, ones carrying out, rather than merely organizing,  the crimes. This has been accompanied by another trend: a  lowering of the average age of the criminals.    Just how is the youth of the criminals carrying out crimes  associated with professionalism? The answer to that question is  unbelievably simple. Shadow structures are attempting to involve  in "business" the engineer troop, Marine, airborne trooper or,  in a word, specialists who have received a particular kind of  training in Army service. This is not only a simple solution,  but also an inexpensive one, so to speak.    Although much has been said about the criminal world's  increased interest in servicemen, very few details have been  made known. Conventional wisdom has it that the only thing the  Armed Forces have that is of interest to the Mafia is weapons.  This being the case, preventive measures in effect in units, if  any are applied, are based primarily (if not exclusively) on  this aspect of the problem. Nonetheless, presently targeted by  the Russian "camorra" just as intensively as the above is the  Army's cadres. In this connection, criminal agents do not limit  their efforts to enlisting the aid of men already discharged  into the reserve. Several examples follow.    Cadet N. (whose investigation is still in progress) of the  Pacific Ocean Higher Naval School acquired the habit of taking  his automatic rifle from the weapons room, once a week over a  period of six months, with the purpose being - of all things! -  providing guard service to narcotics traffickers. Outrageous?  This unfortunately is not an isolated case, since other military  schools are experiencing this kind of occurrence. This falls  under the category of individual "creative activity."    Incidentally, there also exists a group activity. It came to  light that, until recently, representatives of regional  groupings of organized crime were holding conferences on  Tuesdays in a Vladivostok stadium. One item unfailingly included  on the "agenda" was the question of utilizing Marine servicemen  and subunits. Marines specially selected because of their  remarkable physical conditioning were tasked with blackmailing  competitors, often with the use of force. Made on the Tuesdays  was a decision of how to deploy the "rapid deployment group" for  the next job.    Other examples could be cited. The essence of the activity  consists of effective organization, ease of finding willing  participants, and relatively low cost of the "workforce." In  addition, there is the possibility of using standard issue  weapons. The foregoing inspires the domestic variety of the  "Cosa Nostra" to mount ambitious searches for enlisting the aid  of the man in uniform.    Just how is "recruitment" carried out? My work involves  meeting various officials, including representatives of the  military procuracy. They state that organized crime employs a  widespread network of informants and doers. First on the  targeting list are persons who have a criminal record prior to  entering military service. The number of this kind of person in  some units is as high as 20 percent, meaning that the supply of  persons is large.    Let us assume (theoretically) for the moment that in a  particular regiment there is not a single person bearing a  criminal past. Let us assume that. However, trying to imagine  that in the regiment there is not a single serviceman dealing in  fuel, canned meat, condensed milk, and other "small items" in  our country is an exercise in futility. The "recruiter" will get  to them, also.    Take the case of Private Ishin, who was stationed in a unit  of the Far Eastern Military District. As his term of service  neared completion, the soldier started to sell fuel "on the  side." Representatives of shadow structures provided him with an  easy and lucrative business. They later ordered some kinds of  spare parts and once more paid him well. Ishin by that time had  been discharged, but he did not depart from the unit, in that he  was hired as a civilian driver. That is how he earned extra  money, based on his friendship with the "authorities." The  logical conclusion of this friendship was his receiving an order  to steal weapons, an act which caused his "downfall."    Generally speaking, few servicemen who become involved with  criminals realize the full seriousness of their actions. They  often rely on their contacts and an unreal conviction in  imagined benefactors.    A major group at risk in this connection are the so-called  "runners," soldiers who absent themselves from their unit  without official leave. To find such persons, the "Cosa Nostra"  has special intercept persons who station themselves at railroad  stations, bus stations, and airports. The deserters possess no  money, as a rule. All of a sudden, present on the scene is a  "savior," who offers the deserter an opportunity of earning the  price of a ticket. What comes next? Nothing less than slave  labor, languishing in some warehouse, a bed consisting of boxes,  poor food. Subsequently, the "runner" is told that he has done  nothing for which he can be paid, and that, on the contrary, he  has fallen into debt.    A system of fines spread throughout the criminal medium  imposes monetary deficits, with the cause cited - for example -  of taking up space in a warehouse in which the deserter does not  belong (not an exaggeration). It is possible to turn off the  "meter," partially at least, but only at the cost of sinking  even more deeply into the quagmire. There exist many instances  of that.    Take another case of a regimental headquarters of a military  builders' detachment. Local mafiosi made duty Sergeant M. (whose  investigation has not yet been completed) an offer to sell  drugs. They quoted a sum of money they intended to receive, one  considerably less than the going rate. This duty soldier, with  the smell of easy money in the air, gave his assent. He did this  a couple of times. Then he was told: "Young man, you are in this  over your head. There is no way you can get away from us." The  drug dealer, working in his profession of a "condemned man," was  active for several weeks, then he was arrested. Meanwhile, a  search was on for someone else who would like to "earn some  money."    Especially alarming is how easily taken is the bait - first  sweet promises, then abject bondage - by officer cadres, not  only enlisted personnel. There is a disciplinary battalion  stationed on Russkiy Island. It is a restricted post. It does  not appear to have any ties to the mainland. Nonetheless, rumor  had it that a man arriving from the "big land" had given away a  considerable sum of money "out of friendliness." To whom? To  officers awaiting discharge. Why had he done this? To pave the  way for future cooperation in the civilian sector. The  interested officers were told the details. The offer was  tempting: It involved vessels of the merchant fleet performing  primarily "Japanese" voyages. Foreign-made goods may be brought  in. Some persons agreed to participate. Only later was it  determined that the first three motor vehicles were intended for  a "sponsor." But the deal had already been concluded.    We cannot be remiss by not mentioning how the Mafia deals  with people who are stubborn, violate the "rules of the game,"  or outlive their usefulness. Agencies exercising jurisdiction  over these matters are of the opinion that it is fairly  difficult to help people who become deeply involved. However, it  is possible (and necessary) to do something else: Warn anyone  having any thoughts of taking advantage of the "unselfish" help  offered by "friends" in a regimental headquarters.    Finally, is everything clear? If someone steps on a rake, he  will undoubtedly be struck in the head, no matter how carefully  he does the stepping. That is how the tool is made.    Therefore, does it not make sense to do some thinking about  this beforehand?</p>

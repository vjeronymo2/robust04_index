			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S HAVEL TO PROPOSE SUPERPOWER SUMMIT IN PRAGUE  </P> <P> President Vaclav Havel said Tuesday that when he visits Washington and Moscow  next month, he will propose that the next superpower summit be held in Prague.  </P> <P> Western diplomats had no immediate comment on the proposal.  </P> <P> In a speech to Parliament, Havel also proposed a number of changes, including  dropping "Socialist" from the country's official name.  </P> <P> "As for the word 'socialism,' nobody knows what it means any more. What is  more, it provokes general resentment. Today it symbolizes the totalitarian  system of the past," he said.  </P> <P> Havel suggested that the country be known simply as the Czechoslovak Republic.  </P> <P> In further moves to rid the new political system of the vestiges of Communist  rule, Havel also proposed a new state emblem to replace the existing one, which  bears a Communist star above the Czechoslovak two-tailed lion. He proposed a  shield bearing the traditional emblems of the Czechoslovak federation, in which  the star above the lion would be replaced by a crown.  </P> <P> Parliament, meanwhile, passed a law giving independent political parties the  right to exist. About 35 new parties have sprung up since Communist rule was  effectively ended in December, though they had no legal basis now.  </P> <P> Havel, who was elected president by the Parliament Dec. 29, has pledged to lead  the country until its first free elections in 40 years, scheduled for June 8.  </P></p>

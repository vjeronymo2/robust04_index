			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar shrugs off the bears THE dollar turned in another rousing performance against the D-Mark yesterday as it bounced back from weak economic data to close almost 6 pfennigs up since Monday, writes Peggy Hollinger. The US unit suffered only a brief stumble after weak producer price and industrial production statistics, falling from DM1.6225 to DM1.6150. Almost immediately, however, the buyers moved in and the currency shot up to DM1.6350 'without touching the sides', said Mr Steven Barrow of Chemical Bank. By the close, however, fears of central bank intervention had put a damper on dollar enthusiasm. The US unit bounced off strong resistance at the DM1.6350 level - a touch below the year's European high of DM1.6355. The dollar finished in London at DM1.6285, compared with Thursday's DM1.6230. Traders suggested that some of the dollar's moves had been exaggerated by the thin market in advance of the US holiday on Monday. However, most agreed that market sentiment had become bullish on the US currency this week, and was likely to remain so in the immediate future. The dollar/yen rate moved in a fairly narrow range as rumours of intervention circulated the market. One trader pointed out that the last time the Bank of Japan had intervened had been on the Friday before a US holiday. The dollar closed in London at Y127.90, near the expected intervention level of Y128. The dollar's rise had an adverse effect on the Swiss franc, which weakened from SFr1.4575 to SFr1.4675. However, the franc's most notable weakness was against the D-Mark, which rose to a two-year high against the Swiss currency. The D-Mark closed at 90.14 centimes, compared with 89.71 on Thursday. 'There is a feeling that Swiss rates could come down a hell of a lot faster than the German rates,' said Mr Barrow. Against other currencies, the D-Mark continued to feel the adverse effects of the strong dollar. Within the exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark fell against the French franc from FFr3.4052 to FFr3.4039. At the Paris fix, the German unit hit a five-month low of FFr3.4037. Sterling enjoyed a respectable rise from DM2.8725 to DM2.8800, despite soft economic data. Although the UK currency is still at the bottom of the ERM grid, it was showing a divergence indicator of just minus 31 at the close yesterday. The UK currency is allowed a swing of minus 75 before central bank intervention. Nevertheless, traders expected that sterling's weakness in the ERM would still hinder an imminent rate cut in the UK.</p>

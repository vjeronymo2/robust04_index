			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Enthusiastic response to French utility FFr3bn issue ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market picked up yesterday, and is expected to remain buoyant throughout the week, with several new issues likely to emerge in a stronger Ecu bond market. Among yesterday's offerings, Electricite de France, the French electricity utility, launched a FFr3bn issue due 2022, marking a further extension of the Euro-French franc yield curve from 20 to 30 years. A month ago, Caisse Autonome de Refinancement, the French government-owned agency, launched the first issue of 20-year bonds in the Euro-French franc bond market. Outside the government bond market, the longest duration available prior to the CAR deal was 15 years in the domestic market and 13 years in the Eurobond market. The EDF deal, arranged by Paribas, was rapidly sold out, repeating the success of the CAR transaction. Demand was concentrated among international institutions, which are currently bullish on both the French bond market and currency. Insurance companies, which like to match assets to long-dated liabilities, were particularly active buyers. In addition, the rarity of 30-year paper boosted demand. Dealers noted the spread for 12-year EDF paper is a basis point or two wider than the launch spread of 36 basis points above the 30-year OAT offered by EDF's 30-year deal. For French borrowers which require long-dated funding, the long end of the yield curve has obvious attractions, since the yield curve is virtually flat from 10 years to 30 years, so they can extend maturity without paying a higher yield. In the Ecu sector, Mobil Oil Canada launched an Ecu125m five-year deal via Credit Suisse First Boston, targetted at retail investors. The deal is intended to catch an expected surge of demand for Ecu bonds this week, if the Danes vote in today's referendum to ratify the treaty on European monetary union signed at Maastricht by European government leaders last December. The Ecu bond market rallied as much as half a point at the end of last week, as signs that Danes would vote for ratification relieved some of the political concerns which have been dogging the market. A number of borrowers are preparing transactions, on expectations of a positive result for the market. France Telecom is planning an Ecu300-Ecu350m 10-year deal, while Caisse Nationale des Autoroutes is considering a nine-year deal of similar size. Two Swedish borrowers, Electrolux, the manufacturing company, and Spintab, the Swedish mortgage subsidiary of Swedbank, tapped the dollar sector. Electrolux brought a Dollars 150m five-year deal via Lehman Brothers, while Spintab launched a Dollars 300m five-year deal, due to be priced today, via JP Morgan. The Swedish National Housing Corporation (SBAB) is also rumoured to be preparing a dollar transaction. In the D-Mark sector, Finland added a further DM1bn tranche to its DM1bn 10-year deal launched a fortnight ago via Deutsche Bank. Although Finland has been a regular borrower in the sector, previous deals have been much smaller. Finland's growing financing needs - its borrowing programme is Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn this year - have encouraged a greater focus on markets where a distinct investor base exists. While many institutions which buy Ecu and dollars are rather full up on the name, German institutional demand remains firmer. The first securitisation of aircraft leases, by the Irish leasing company GPA, is close to completion. The Dollars 522m deal, arranged by Citicorp, is due to be launched next week, providing a satisfactory credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's has been secured.</p>

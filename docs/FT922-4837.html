			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Watchdog criticises BBC World Service THE National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, yesterday called on the BBC World Service to improve its efficiency. The report paid tribute to the World Service's independence and high standard of broadcasting. It also found that the organisation - which broadcasts in 38 languages to an audience of 120m - had 'a generally satisfactory system of resource planning and financial management, and had developed comprehensive procedures to assess the effectiveness of its output'. The watchdog called for: Further apportioning of overheads to individual services. The continuation of improvements to weak cashflow forecasting. Improvements in the use of studios and in deploying studio managers. Greater use of appraisal techniques to justify capital spending. Further assessment of the impact of the Pounds 166m spent over the past 10 years to improve the audibility of broadcasts. The Foreign Office paid Pounds 143m to fund the World Service in 1991-92 - not including Pounds 16m for monitoring other foreign broadcasts. Management of the BBC World Service. HMSO. Pounds 7.</p>

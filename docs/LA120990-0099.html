			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCALE OF THE JAIL: WHY THE RESIDENTS ARE WORRIED  </P> <P> I read with interest the ongoing discussions about the location of the Orange  County Jail. I read with dismay the proposals to put the new jail in any  location other than adjacent to the existing jail in the Civic Center in Santa  Ana.  </P> <P> I believe that in this matter the supervisors are bowing to pressure and  abrogating their responsibilities to Orange County residents as a whole.  </P> <P> The reasons for locating the jail adjacent to the existing jail appear to be  obvious. They are:  </P> <P> * It will be less expensive. The county already owns the land.  </P> <P> * It will facilitate administration and will cut down on the expense of  transportation of prisoners from the jail to court. The logistic problem  inherent in moving prisoners from a jail in another location to court in the  Civic Center is staggering, and overtime will probably double the actual cost  of the jail.  </P> <P> * It will result in greater convenience to all concerned -- the sheriff's  office, the prisoners and the judges.  </P> <P> FREDERICK T. MASON, Santa Ana  </P></p>

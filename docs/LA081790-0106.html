			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTORS' EQUITY SAYS WHITE CAN PORTRAY EURASIAN;  </P> <P> THEATER: THE CANCELED 'MISS SAIGON' MAY PLAY ON BROADWAY AFTER ALL. THE  REVERSAL ON THE CASTING OF BRITON JONATHAN PRYCE MEETS WITH MIXED REACTION.  </P> <P> Actors' Equity on Thursday reversed its controversial decision to bar British  actor Jonathan Pryce from playing a Eurasian on Broadway in the hit London  musical "Miss Saigon."  </P> <P> The move leaves the door open for producer Cameron Mackintosh to bring the  $10-million musical to New York. Last week, he canceled the show rather than  let Equity dictate his choice of star.  </P> <P> In a statement released through a publicist, Mackintosh said he was encouraged  by Thursday's decision. "Over the next few days, I will confer with members of  the creative team and with Jonathan Pryce to determine if it will be possible  for the production to be reinstated for Broadway," the statement said.  </P> <P> "Miss Saigon," which had a $25-million advance ticket sale, the largest in  Broadway history, had been scheduled to open in March.  </P> <P> The new Equity ruling, reached after a six-hour session of the union's council,  met with mixed reaction on both coasts.  </P> <P> Alan Eisenberg, Equity executive secretary, apologized for the rancor that has  colored the debate, saying the union never intended the dispute to become "one  of personalities and innuendo."  </P> <P> Equity's original decision to bar Pryce in order to promote minority casting  opportunities met with a storm of protest from union members who petitioned  Equity to reconsider its ruling.  </P> <P> Members of the Asian-American theater community had applauded the original  decision, which set off a national debate.  </P> <P> Eisenberg said Thursday that the Equity council had determined that Pryce  qualifies as a "star" under the union's agreement with the League of American  Theatres and Producers and, therefore, that his casting was not subject to  Equity approval.  </P> <P> "I think a lot of people would have been happier had it been an Asian (playing  the role)," Eisenberg said, when asked to characterize the meeting at a press  conference at Equity's New York headquarters. "But we deferred to the contract;  we deferred to Mr. Pryce's talent, and we deferred to Mr. Mackintosh's wishes  to have Mr. Pryce play the role."  </P> <P> "M. Butterfly" playwright David Henry Hwang, whose protest of Pryce's casting  helped trigger the controversy, used a moderate tone in a written statement  Thursday: "I have stated my intention to support whatever decision Actors'  Equity feels best reflects the interest of its membership, and I stand by that  today. I do hope that the complex issues of opportunities for minority actors  and artistic freedom will continue to be discussed, albeit in a less polarized  environment."  </P> <P> Colleen Dewhurst, the president of Actors' Equity who had likened "Miss Saigon"  to a "minstrel show," did not appear at Thursday's press conference because she  was filming in Toronto.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Eisenberg delineated Equity's policy toward  non-traditional casting, which, he said, was "distorted and misconstrued" in  the dispute.  </P> <P> According to the contract between Equity and the Theatre League,  non-traditional casting is "the casting of ethnic actors in roles where race or  gender is not germane to the character," the statement said.  </P> <P> Sharon Jensen, executive director of the Non-Traditional Casting Project, a  nonprofit arts organization that lobbies for the hiring of minority actors,  lauded the new ruling. She said the 50-member cast of "Miss Saigon" includes  parts for 34 minority actors. "Assuming this show's a success, it can mean  literally hundreds of jobs for ethnic actors" as touring companies are later  formed, Jensen said.  </P> <P> Actor Sab Shimono, who auditioned for Pryce's role last January in Los Angeles  and was a member of the original cast of "Pacific Overtures" on Broadway, was  bitter over the decision to allow Pryce to perform on Broadway. "I suppose  we're still part of the colony . . . . The good thing is that the discussion is  out in the open," he said.  </P> <P> "Why did they (Actors' Equity) collapse?" asked Dom Magwili, who resigned his  post as director of the AsianAmerican Theatre Project at Los Angeles Theatre  Center because he disagreed with an LATC official's statement condemning  Equity's original decision. "Because $25 million in advance sales is a tough  argument. Jobs are valued more than principle. In the end," Magwili said, "it's  the money that talks."  </P> <P> "It's a bad decision. It'll set us back 20 years," said actor Robert Hooks, a  star of the 1988 ABC series "Supercarrier" and co-founder of the Negro Ensemble  Company in New York and the now-defunct D. C. Black Repertory Theatre. "Only  the minorities are crying. They're a small voice -- or that's how they're  viewed on the Great White Way. To make this decision and then retract it is a  real kick in the behind."  </P> <P> Hooks said he had heard "a lot of intellectual arguments about artistic  integrity." Although some jobs for minorities may be restored if the show now  goes on, Hooks said: "There's a tremendous principle here that goes far beyond  'Miss Saigon.' "  </P> <P> Charlton Heston, who resigned his active membership in Equity in protest of the  original decision to bar Pryce, said he would not change his mind. "I objected  to what they did. Now they have stopped doing it. But they still did it. The  reason they gave in was because there was a firestorm.  </P> <P> "My central concern is not Jonathan Pryce or the numbers of fine Asian actors  who are underemployed. We're talking about artistic freedom here."  </P> <P> Playwright Velina Hasu Houston, president of the Amerasian League in Santa  Monica, said that despite its reversal on the issue, "Equity has accomplished  some important things. The Asian-American community has spoken up and said  yellowface has to go the way of blackface, and Equity has shown support for  that voice, despite this decision. Producers have shown their true colors . . .  . Neither side heard the other side." "That has been the most unfortunate thing  in this situation.  </P> <P> Granville reported from New York and Shirley from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

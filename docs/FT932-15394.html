			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Rabin set to make concession on talks MR Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, is expected to tell President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt today that Israel is prepared to allow a prominent Arab resident of Jerusalem to participate in a Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace talks, Judy Maltz reports from Jerusalem. The Israeli and Egyptian leaders will hold a summit in Ismailia, which will focus on ways of reviving Middle East peace talks, stalled since December, when the Jewish state expelled 415 Palestinians to South Lebanon. Israel is hoping its decision to allow Palestinian leader, Faisal al-Husseini, a resident of East Jerusalem, to participate will convince the Palestinian delegation to drop their ultimatum that all the deportees be repatriated before it returns to negotiations.</p>

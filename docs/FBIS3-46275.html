			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, Jan 16 (XINHUA) -- National meetings of  branch directors of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China  [ICBC], Agricultural Bank of China [ABC], Bank of China [BOC],  People's Construction Bank of China [PCBC], and the  Communications Bank of China [CBC] concluded here today. It was  agreed unanimously that the banks should firmly implement the  monetary and credit policy of the People's Bank of China as well  as the measures for macroeconomic regulation and control, put  the national interest first, strictly abide by financial  discipline, and enforce all orders and prohibitions in order to  execute work in the banking sector well in 1994.    The national meetings of branch directors of the five banks  began in Beijing on 12 January. During the meetings, the  various banks outlined their reform measures and operational  plans for 1994.    Zhang Xiao, president of the ICBC, noted: The guiding  principle and tasks of the ICBC for 1994 are to conscientiously  implement the guidelines of Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee and the State Council's decision on  reforming the banking structure, vigorously expand sources of  capital, exercise strict control over credit volume, intensify  reform of internal mechanisms, make continued efforts to  consolidate order in the banking sector, create conditions for  gradually changing itself into a state-owned commercial bank,  and promote a sustained, rapid and healthy development of the  national economy.    Zhang Xiao pointed out: In transforming itself from a  specialized bank into a commercial bank, the bank must first of  all engage in the management of the proportions of assets and  liabilities, and in risk management of assets. For this reason,  starting from this year, the ICBC will implement across the  board the management of the proportions of assets and  liabilities under the management of lending limits. The bank  will appraise -- in terms of total volume, turnover, security,  and efficiency -- such indexes as the abundance rate of capital,  the deposits-lending ratio, the turnover rate of assets, the  quality of lending, the profit rate of assets, and so forth.  There will also be an incremental switch from evaluating the  volume of increase to evaluating the balance. Meanwhile, we  will set up a risk safeguard mechanism, mechanisms for  separating policy lending and commercial lending, mechanisms for  allocating sectorial funds, and a new mechanism for foreign  exchange operations.    Ma Yongwei, president of the ABC, said: The principal tasks  for banks in rural areas are as follows: Strictly control the  volume of credit, expand the sources of funds, rationalize the  credit structure, and increase input in agriculture; steadily  implement reform of the rural banking structure; make continued  efforts to consolidate order in the banking sector, step up  infrastructure construction, strengthen internal management, and  further improve economic efficiency; and persist in the policy  of giving equal emphasis on two fronts and doing well in both,  and raise the quality of cadres. Ma Yongwei noted: This year  we must truly increase agricultural lending. The increase in  agricultural loans, which accounted for 6 percent of the total  increase of ABC's lending last year, should be raised to 10  percent this year. In setting lending priority, we should --  while persisting in operating under the guidance of market  forces and emphasizing efficiency and technological upgrading --  help accelerate the readjustment of the structure of agriculture  and the mix of agricultural products and develop, on a priority  basis, a highly efficient agriculture that provides greater and  better yields. Meanwhile, we should lend active support to  village and township enterprises to help them improve efficiency  and grow in a steady and sound manner; and we will also promote  development of the rural market and enliven commodity  circulation in rural areas.    Speaking of the general goals of the rural banking reform  set to start step by step this year, Ma Yongwei said: We will,  by way of reform, develop a rural banking system whereby the  Agricultural Development Bank of China [ADBC], the ABC, and  rural credit cooperatives will be closely integrated and develop  through coordination. Under this new system, the newly founded  ADBC will handle strictly defined agricultural policy-lending  business, the ABC will gradually shift toward the operating  mechanism of a commercial bank, and the rural credit  cooperatives will be gradually "disjoined" from the ADBC and, if  needed, form an agricultural cooperative bank in a well-planned  manner.    Wang Qiren, chairman of the BOC board of directors, outlined  the BOC's principal tasks for 1994 as follows: Intensify  banking reform and change the mechanisms step by step; persist  in steady operations and constantly increase the bank's  resources; and improve scientific management and enforce strict  management discipline. He emphasized: a new system of foreign  exchange administration has been put into effect this year. The  banks should conscientiously carry out foreign exchange selling  and buying business, improve management of foreign exchange  accounts, and improve customer service. We should institute and  improve a system of listed exchange rates for the entire banking  sector under which the head office is responsible for setting a  unified exchange rate and the floating range, to ensure all  branches follow a uniform rate. Meanwhile, we should manage the  banks according to law and actively cultivate and develop a  foreign exchange market.    Wang Qiren said: In changing itself into a commercial bank  this year, the BOC will focus primarily on setting up a renminbi  fund management system characterized by unified regulation and  control and division of responsibility among different levels,  engage in the management of the proportions of assets and  liabilities and in risk management of assets; separate  policy-lending banking from commercial banking; and make active  but steady efforts for entry into the monetary market.    Zhou Daojiong, president of the PCBC, said: A major  component of the reform of China's banking sector in 1994 will  be the establishment of the proposed National Development Bank  [NDB] to provide policy support for key state projects, and  handle lending and discounting [tie xi 6317 1873] business.  PCBC will drop policy-lending that has been part of its  business. Consequently, there will be a number of changes in  PCBC's business: First, in connection with the operational  readjustment and division of responsibility, PCBC will not  directly handle policy-lending any more. Instead, it will be  commissioned by the NDB to handle policy- lending. Second, by  changing its managerial mechanism, PCBC will operate as a  commercial bank; it will gradually implement the management  principles of independent operation, responsibility for its  profits and losses, taking risks on its own, and exercising  self-restraint. Zhou Daojiong pointed out: After shifting  tracks, the PCBC will focus on long- and medium-term lending.    Wang Mingquan, president of the CBC, pointed out that the  CBC's objective for 1994 is to strive to run a standardized  commercial bank. He said: In the new year, the CBC will carry  out a series of reforms of its corporate system, organizational  structure, motivational mechanism, distribution system, and so  on. We will put the stress of business development in urban  centers and economically developed regions, and further improve  our internal operational mechanisms. We will ensure fluidity,  safety, and profitability of banking assets, increase the value  of assets and profits, and optimize our structure. The reforms  will mainly deal with standardizing the CBC's share-holding  system and perfecting its corporate system; persisting in  comprehensive operation with business managed by specialized  departments, strengthening the CBC's comprehensive service  functions, conforming to the new supervisory procedures of the  central bank, and establishing a system of appraisal for  internal performance; gradually enhancing the head office's fund  control ability and operational functions, and improving the  organizational management system; actively seeking business  development abroad and constantly raising the CBC's  international status; and promoting the personnel system of a  commercial bank, and improving the motivational mechanism and  distribution system for employees.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / CAA rules out smoke hoods use THE Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) yesterday ruled out the use of passenger smoke hoods on aircraft because they risked delaying emergency evacuation of a cabin on fire, Paul Betts writes. A CAA report on improving the chances for passenger survival in aircraft fires favours the introduction of water spray systems in aircraft cabins. Tests have shown that water sprays would hold down cabin temperatures and extend the time for safe evacuation in the event of fire. The introduction of such systems would increase an airline's overall operating costs by increasing the weight of an aircraft. The CAA said smoke hoods were likely to increase the risk of death in a fire. Its opposition to them is likely to provoke fierce controversy because of widespread calls for the introduction of smoke hoods after the fire on a British Airtours Boeing 737 at Manchester Airport in 1985. The Consumers' Association said it was outraged by the CAA's decision. After the Manchester accident in which 55 people died, including 48 directly from inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, the CAA was asked to consider introducing smoke hoods on all UK registered aircraft.</p>

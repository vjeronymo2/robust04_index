			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / New currency for Georgia Georgia yesterday brought in a temporary new currency, supplementing the Russian rouble with new coupon banknotes in a first stage towards full monetary independence, Reuters reports from Tbilisi. Officials said the coupons were being introduced to counter an acute shortage of cash. Valued at one rouble each, they will initially be used to pay for food, medicine, public transport and public utilities. The banknotes, printed in Britain, have face values between 5 coupons and 10,000 coupons.</p>

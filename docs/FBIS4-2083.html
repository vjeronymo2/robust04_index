			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 5 KYODO -- Separate Japanese and  Chinese investigations reveal that moldy, foul-smelling Chinese  rice found in Japan was not the result of poor handling on the  Chinese side, according to a state press report.    Tests on 42 samples, kept from a 5,000-ton shipment from  China in early January, were free from mold and had a water  content of only 13.1 percent, nearly 3 percentage points lower  than what the contract specified, the INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS  NEWSPAPER said.    The samples were kept at the Tanggu commercial inspection  bureau at the eastern Chinese port city of Tianjin and were  tested on February 17, the paper quoted a person connected with  the case as saying.    The unnamed person also said Japanese officials visited and  inspected the rice plant responsible for the shipment as well as  storage facilities in Tianjin and concluded that "the cause of  the mishap is not on the Chinese side."    The paper accused the Japanese press of seriously harming  the  credibility of Chinese rice exporters.    Other similar incidents have been reported concerning U.S.,  Thai and Australian rice, the paper said.    "Concerning the difficulties and frustration of opening the  Japanese rice market, the appearance of this type of incident is  unfortunately not by chance," the paper said.</p>

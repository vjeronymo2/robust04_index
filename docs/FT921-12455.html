			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Arts: Milton Keynes, the view from the grid - Architecture Cities are dense and difficult places. They both elevate and depress the human spirit. God and Mammon fight for the city's heart while mere mortals scurry about their business hoping to find solace from the daily grind. Cities are more than paper diagrams of imposed order. They flower out of adversity and take time to establish their character and culture. They need a purpose higher than mere accommodation, a status beyond statistics. Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire is celebrating 25 years of birth pangs this month. It is described as the fastest growing city in Britain - its population when it was designated in 1967 was 18,350, today it is around 150,000. It is the last new town to be commissioned in England and in many ways it demonstrates the easy solution to the problems of our declining cities. It is relatively straightforward to take 22,000 acres of Buckinghamshire farm land and turn it into an efficient new suburb; it is much harder to plan and organise the rejuvenation of those English cities that exploded in the 19th century and have never quite recovered their equilibrium. No one underestimates the skill and hard work that goes into persuading people and businesses to relocate to a new town. But it cannot be denied that it helps to have a blank sheet, and it certainly helps if your blank sheet can be laid across some desirable meadows half way between London and Birmingham and near good motorways and railways. What does Milton Keynes look like after 25 years? How successful is it? Can it be described in any way as a city? When it comes to visibility and civic appearances Milton Keynes does not score highly. What you see derives strictly from the plan created in the late 1960s by Llewelwyn-Davies Weekes Forestier-Walker and Bor under the particular guidance of one partner, Richard Llewelwyn-Davies. He was described at the time as 'the intellectual leader of the scientific wing of English architects'. He was subsequently to become a Labour peer. His plan was for a town dedicated to ease of movement by motor car. The basis of the plan is a grid of roads; and each kilometre square of the grid formed the boundary for local development. The grid linked the existing settlements at Bletchley, Wolverton and Stony Stratford with the new centre of Milton Keynes. A famous perspective view of the future new city was drawn early on by Helmut Jacoby, in which a bubble helicopter hovered over a leafy grid of roads, water and low-rise buildings. His vision was accurate. You can visit Milton Keynes today and not really notice the town at all because of the effectiveness of the tree planting and landscaping. Actually you could just spend your time exploring the double grid: at one level there is the superior network of landscaped roads for cars, and below there is another network of 'Redways', landscaped pedestrian and cycle tracks. In summer, with a bicycle, you could have quite a good day out on the grid. Since the inception of the town, some 15 million trees have been planted, wide planted verges are everywhere and there must be hundreds of planted roundabouts. Because all the buildings are low rise - indeed there was apparently a planning instruction that nothing was to be higher than a tree  -the town is largely invisible. Because of this strange sense of arboreal limbo it is quite a shock to dive off the road grid into the housing neighbourhoods. But it is a salutary shock. Here is written the history of British housing design over the last two decades. It is also the history of British architecture. The new town assembled good teams of well known architects. Influenced by the grid, early housing like Netherfield ran long, low, flat roofed terraces across half a mile of landscape. Netherfield was designed by Jeremy Dixon, Ed Jones, Chris Cross and Mike Gold. It had aluminium roofs and plastic fins dividing house from house in the terrace. As the land dropped so did the houses, but the long flat roofs continued at one level height throughout, sometimes leaving large gaps between the houses and the roof. Norman Foster's office also designed some housing for Milton Keynes in the early days at Beanhill. The houses had flat aluminium roofs clad with profiled aluminium panels. This experiment failed and after a law suit, pitched roofs were added to the terraces. Today those sorts of terrible architectural experiments would not be allowed and the idea of regimented workers' housing - however much part of Llewelwyn-Davies's and others' Leninist dreams - has vanished. A tour of the housing areas today is, if anything, like a visit to the Ideal Home Exhibition; 69 per cent of the population are house owners and houses are largely built by private developers following standard guidelines. There are good vernacular 'fishing village' designs by architects like Richard Mac Cormac, Wayland Tunley, Peter Aldington and Ralph Erskine. There are also mock Tudor houses, Georgian houses, thatched houses, regency houses, and every conceivable variety of gingerbread houses. Both Hansel and Gretel would be happy here. The town centre and almost all the public and commercial/industrial buildings are in marked contrast to the housing. The enormous shopping centre, which provides an indoor street almost as long as Oxford Street, is cool and Miesian. It has a faint air of Mussolini's new Rome about it, but perhaps that is because of all the travertine. The railway station and offices are mainly glass boxes, but there are some more interesting, very new buildings like the polytechnic by Ted Cullinan and the headquarters of Pharmacia by Hobbs Architects. There is the brand new ecumenical church, with its dome, at the centre of the town, designed by PDD architects. This ought to have been much bigger: the dome does not do what domes are meant to do and sail over the lower buildings. Instead it looks as though it tried to rise above its surroundings but sighed so deeply that it sank down again. That somehow sums up what I feel about Milton Keynes - it ought to have been wonderful but it isn't. None of our really good architects worked on any of the public buildings - and although all the trees are splendid, the built fabric of Milton Keynes is not of the calibre needed to make it a city. It is the garden suburb adapted for the car, and oh so carefully planned.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SMITHKLINE PROFITS DROP 65%  </P> <P> SmithKline Beecham PLC reported today that its profits for 1989 declined 65%  over a year ago due largely to heavy costs associated with the recent merger  that created the world's second-largest pharmaceuticals company.  </P> <P> The company said its net profit totaled $209 million, compared with $591  million in 1988.  </P> <P> Sales, however, rose 14% to $7.9 billion from $6.9 billion.  </P> <P> The full-year results were the first for the company since its merger in July,  1989. Britain's Beecham Group PLC and Philadelphia-based SmithKline Beckman  Corp. merged through an exchange of shares, creating the second-largest  pharmaceuticals company after Rahway, N.J.-based Merck &amp; Co.  </P> <P> The 1989 results included an $805-million restructuring charge as a result of  the combination for closing some of its facilities, cutting staff and writing  down certain assets. SmithKline Beecham said it also took a $124-million  extraordinary loss due to merger transaction costs.  </P></p>

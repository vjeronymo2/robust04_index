			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Companies' liquidity continues to improve THE LIQUIDITY position of large British companies continued to improve in the first quarter of this year, according to figures released yesterday by the Central Statistical Office. The CSO reported that the liquidity ratio for all large UK industrial and commercial companies increased to an estimated 132 per cent by the end of the first quarter of this year from 126 per cent at the end of last year, indicating that companies are now more able to lay their hands on short-term funds than before. The ratio, which measures current assets maturing in less than a year as a share of liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year, was higher at the end of December than at any time since the late 1970s except for immediately after the October 1987 crash. The liquidity ratio for large manufacturing companies rose to 123 per cent at the end of March from 119 per cent at the end of last year, while that of non-manufacturing companies, including oil companies, rose to 145 per cent from 135 per cent. The CSO bases its estimates in part on a survey of 650 large companies.</p>

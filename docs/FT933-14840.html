			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Russian ship tied up in web of creditors' claims FOR 13 months, the Russian cargo ship Kapitan Kanevskiy has been chained to the quayside in Rotterdam harbour while lawyers argue in court about Dollars 4.4m in unpaid bills for the delivery of children's and women's clothing to the former Soviet Union. The ship, operated by the St Petersburg-based, state-owned Baltic Shipping Company, was impounded in June last year in what is believed to be the first seizure of Russian physical assets over a payments dispute with western creditors. The dispute is a minefield of complexities, raising difficult questions about the ownership of property and assets under the old communist system and whether they are applicable today. The details centre on the non-payment of goods in the crucial years 1990 and 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed in chaos and gave way to the Commonwealth of Independent States. The case is arousing interest in the Netherlands, where at least 50 other companies without export credit insurance are waiting to be paid for Fl 350m (Dollars 185m) worth of goods supplied during this period. Now the fate of the Kapitan Kanevskiy is starting to win attention abroad. Alfred C. Toepfer, the German commodities trader, filed a petition in Rotterdam last week asking for permission to 'arrest' a ship of the Russian Federation as part of its dispute with the Russian authorities about non-payment for deliveries of cigarettes, personal care products and other western goods in 1990 and 1991. No date has yet been set for the court's ruling. The lawyer for the plaintiff in the Dutch case, a small Amsterdam-based trading company called Pied-Rich BV, maintains that the court battle could have implications for 'The Dutch laws on attachment are very liberal, meaning that a US company could have Russian property arrested in the Netherlands even if the claim does not involve the Netherlands,' Mr Ton Steinz, of the Amsterdam law firm Steinz and Van der Veen, said. Pied-Rich's dispute is not with its Russian customers or with the Russian shipping company but with the Russian state. It says the former Soviet Ministry of Merchant Marine guaranteed in 1990 it would act as the vehicle for paying the Russian customers' bills. This was agreed as part of a wider arrangement whereby the Dutch company was committed to finding cargo business for Baltic. When Dollars 4.4m in bills for 1990 and 1991 were not paid, the Dutch company petitioned a Rotterdam court to have the Kapitan Kanevskiy, valued at some Dollars 16m, impounded in Rotterdam harbour. The ship has been under 'protective arrest' since June 14 1992. In court documents, lawyers for the Russian Federation accuse the Dutch company and its lawyers of abusing Dutch laws on property seizure and of attempting to use 'blackmail' to get the Russians to settle their debts. They say the impounding of the ship has already cost the company Fl 1.75m in direct costs as well as at least Fl 3.5m in lost revenue. The 13th lawsuit associated with the main legal case was heard in a municipal court last week. The proceedings turn partly on whether the ship can be considered Russian state property, raising a host of questions about property rights and leasing under the old communist system. The main legal case, which centres on whether the ship can be sold at auction if the debt is not repaid, is expected to drag on into 1994. A parallel arbitration case is pending in Moscow. Although it is being watched by other Dutch companies, the case cannot necessarily be 'extrapolated' to those of other creditors, according to one industry observer who is familiar with other uninsured Dutch claims. He noted that the Pied-Rich dispute involves a particularly complicated, tripartite payment system, as does the Toepfer case. 'Other creditors prefer to follow the diplomatic route so that they don't harm future trading relations,' he said.</p>

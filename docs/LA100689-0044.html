			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> In his first L.A. show, New York artist Julian Lethbridge presents simple  linear webs that form an alligator skin pattern across the canvas. The surface  is thick, scarred with brush marks or sweeping impressions of the artist's  gesture. With the color going methodically from white to black, there is little  to distract from the surface or the mark and that seems to be Lethbridge's  point. Something of a conceptualist painter's painter, these works reduce  painting to the elementals with a thoroughness reminiscent of Robert Ryman, but  with a more overt appreciation for the act of painting.  </P> <P> For all their intellectualism, however, there is still something appealingly  down-to-earth about paintings that can carry on a straightforward formal  discussion about surface while decked out in painterly animal hides or  magnified skin patterns. (Daniel Weinberg Gallery, 625 N. Almont Drive, to Oct.  28.) SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Eduard  Baltin, distrusts the latest agreements on dividing the Black  Sea Fleet reached between Moscow and Kiev. "As its predecessor,  the latest agreement will fail to work," he said in an exclusive  interview with Interfax.    Furthermore, Baltin said he is puzzled by Ukraine's  insistence that the two countries' fleets should share the same  naval base in Sevastopol.    "This runs counter to common sense and has no precedent in  international practice. Such a situation has already resulted  in aggravating tensions between Russian and Ukrainian  servicemen," the Black Sea Fleet commander said.    Some Ukrainian naval units stationed in the Crimea, he  noted,  have been disconnected from the Fleet's energy system. "The  Ukrainian Navy's debt to the Fleet has reached 4.5 billion  rubles. There are no political motives in this. Politics and  economics must not be confused," the admiral stressed.    His fleet has no newly-built ships, Baltin complained. He  deplored Ukraine's inability to finance the work of the  shipyards in Nikolayev, and said he hopes that in the near  future Russia will be able to provide his fleet with modern  ships from Russian shipyards in the Baltic region and the  Northern Fleet.    In answer to Interfax's question about the fleet's attitude  to the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, Baltin said: "He is a picturesque personality.  From the point of view of humour he adds some color and  animation to the work of the State Duma, but nothing more."</p>

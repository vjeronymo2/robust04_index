			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Roussel-Uclaf outperforms as Paris climbs Responses to Wall Street's overnight recovery varied in their enthusiasm, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS recorded its first rise in four sessions, but the 2 per cent gain was mainly technical: it was the last day of the account, and the buying impetus came from futures and bonds. The CAC-40 index closed up 43.22 at 2,135.17, 1 per cent down on the week. Turnover of FFr5bn was higher than the recent average. Roussel-Uclaf, the pharmaceuticals group, outperformed the market with a rise of FFr34, or 6 per cent to FFr630, helped by positive analysts' recommendations following a 25 per cent increase in first-quarter income announced on Thursday. Mr Mark Tracey, of Goldman Sachs, commented that the results highlighted the company's strong pharmaceutical growth, significant benefits arising from restructuring and scope for expansion. Elf Sanofi added FFr24 to FFr995: it announced that it would make a 4-for-1 share split on June 1, and change its name to Sanofi. MADRID had a complete change of mood as the Bank of Spain cut 25 basis points off the repo rate. Interest rate-sensitive and US-influenced stocks starred as the general index recovered 7.84 to 318.96, virtually flat on the week. Turnover soared from Pta19.7bn to Pta33bn. Sevillana led a strong utilities sector and rose Pta35 or 5.5 per cent at Pta666. Telefonica added Pta65 at Pta1,760 while in banks, BBV climbed Pta95 to Pta3,205. The more likely contenders in the Banesto auction, Argentaria and Santander, were less lively, while Banesto itself fell Pta22 to Pta778. FRANKFURT was braked by the chemicals sector, itself weakened by profit-taking and toxic dumping rumours. The Dax index rose 16.95 to 2,213.92 for a 0.6 per cent gain on the week as BASF fell DM4 to DM317.80 and Hoechst DM4.50 to DM337.50. Turnover rose from DM10.4bn to DM11.6bn. Other cyclicals were mixed, Siemens rising DM7.80 to DM734.80 ahead of next week's results and Daimler up DM10 at DM883.50. But Volkswagen and Mannesmann down on profit-taking by DM4 to DM548.50 and DM7 to DM476.50 respectively. Financials and other defensive stocks gave the market some impetus with Allianz DM60 up at DM2630, Deutsche Bank DM15.50 at DM781 and retailers better again. Mr Hans Peter Wodniok at Flemings in Frankfurt said that there was more pragmatic approach to the Schneider property debacle after Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chairman, said the bank would be holding the properties on which it had lent money. Retailers, he said, originally responded to a rumour that Kaufhof would pay a special dividend - although Karstadt did best in the end with a rise of DM24.50 to DM618. AMSTERDAM ended with the AEX index 3.70 higher at 419.11 but down 1.4 per cent on the week, mainly because of the rise in US interest rates. Royal Dutch rose Fl 3.80 to Fl 206.60 and Nedlloyd Fl 5.00 to Fl 80.70 following satisfactory results earlier this week. ZURICH ended 2.9 per cent down on the week as further weakness in Roche pulled the market back from its best levels. The SMI index finished 6.3 higher at 2,787.9. Roche certificates, under profit-taking pressure after figures earlier in the week, fell another SFr50 to SFr6,850. The textile machine makers Saurer and Rieter gained strongly. Saurer bearers rose SFr100 to SFr2,950 and Rieter bearers by SFr60 to SFr1,660 after Saurer said it had placed its Rieter holding in a trust management company. MILAN rebounded on economic figures suggesting that recovery was under way. The Comit index rose 10.47 to 777.28, down 3 per cent on the week. UBS, which had adopted an overweight position on Italy since November, recommended a cut to a neutral weighting. It said the euphoria which drove the Italian market after the general election had now subsided. Fiat climbed L241 or 3.8 per cent to L6,635 on growing optimism about its pending results. Olivetti followed suit, rising L106 to L2,900, and Montedison put on L54 to L1,132. Benetton rose L1,436 or 5.6 per cent to L27,150 and Pirelli put on L84 to L3,015 after results from both groups. James Capel downgraded the Benetton stock, saying that it did not have the same scope for profits growth as some of the industrial companies. Ciga fell L38 or 3.2 per cent to L1,169 as the bid by ITT Sheraton looked on the brink of collapse after the recent unexpected surge in Ciga's share price. ISTANBUL fell a further 4.9 per cent although late buying helped it recover from session lows. The composite index ended off 955.05 at 18,473.26 for a week's loss of 18.2 per cent.

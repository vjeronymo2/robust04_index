			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA) -- The 1994 energy research  &amp;  development and technology transfer seminar of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum opened at the Taipei  International Convention Center Wednesday [2 February].    More than 180 industry, academic, and government  representatives from 17 APEC member countries are taking part in  the two-day energy seminar.    Discussions focus on three main areas -- "technology to  convert wastes into energy sources," "efficient energy  utilization technology in urban areas," and "the effective  utilization of energy for the creation of improved amenities."    This is the first time that Taiwan has hosted an APEC  seminar  since it joined the regional organization in 1991. The energy  seminar is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and  Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.    Addressing the opening ceremony on behalf of Economic  Affairs  Minister P.K. Chiang, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu  Ke-sheng expressed the hope that this seminar and other similar  gatherings will help strengthen cooperation among APEC members  on energy conservation and efficiency improvement.    The Asia-Pacific region, which had the world's fastest  economic growth over the past decade, still faces the challenge  of solving the "3e" problems of energy, economics, and  environment, Sheu said.    It is therefore most appropriate that "new and efficient  energy technology to create a safe, clean, and comfortable  environment for the next decade" has been chosen as the main  theme of the forum, he explained.    In Taiwan, he noted, the government is also plagued with  "the  emerging problems in energy demand and their environmentally  unfriendly potential, both locally and internationally."    In addition to increased domestic reserach in new energies,  waste management, and efficiency upgrading, Taiwan has also  initiated "research programs, that take on a more universal  significance, in carbon dioxide omission control and alternative  refrigerants," he pointed out.    APEC, founded in 1989, groups Australia, Brunei, Canada,  Mainland China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New  Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,  Thailand, the United States, Papua New Guinea, and Mexico.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / People: Tarmac stiffens its board Tarmac, Britain's biggest building materials and construction group, has taken a further step in strengthening its board. Sir John Banham (right), the retiring director general of the Confederation of British Industry, and Sir Anthony Gill (far right), chairman and chief executive of Lucas Industries, have been appointed non-executive directors. The move to add two well-connected names to the board comes just two months after the 58-year-old Sir Eric Pountain, Tarmac's chairman for the past 13 years, handed over the chief executive's baton to Neville Simms, 47, head of the group's construction division. Although there are several non-executive directors on the Tarmac board, there has been a feeling in some circles that it could do with some rejuvenation. The Duchess of Devonshire and Sir Nicholas Henderson, the two outgoing non-executives, are both in their 70s and have been on the board since the early 1980s. Sir John, 51, became director general of the CBI in 1987 after four years as controller of the Audit Commission. Sir Anthony, 62, who has headed Lucas since 1987, joins the board with immediate effect. Sir John's appointment takes effect from July when he steps down from the CBI and will also join Sir Anthony as a non-exec at National Power.</p>

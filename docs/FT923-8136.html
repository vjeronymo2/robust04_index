			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: US and Europe provide some relief as Heywood falls 37% HEYWOOD Williams Group, the glass distributor, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down 37 per cent at Pounds 5.1m for the six months to June 30. The fall from Pounds 8.1m was forecast on June 29 prompting a share price fall of 41p to 288p. A month before that the shares had peaked at 388p. Yesterday they eased 1p to 177p. Glass saw operating profits halved to Pounds 3.17m (Pounds 6.1m), while aluminium and plastics fell by almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 730,000. Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, chairman, said the companies supplying the construction industry - 25 per cent of Heywood's UK business - had suffered the most and were likely to take the longest to recover. About 60 per cent of the UK business was in replacement doors and windows, which he said was 'likely to recover more quickly'. The automotive side was more recession-proof, Mr Hinchliffe said, as it operated mainly in the replacement window and windscreen market. However, profits in Europe and the US provided some relief. On the Continent they advanced from Pounds 672,000 to Pounds 1.07m, led by acquisitions, and across the Atlantic organic growth saw them treble to Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 421,000). In February Heywood bought Door Panels, which makes exterior and conservatory doors, for Pounds 7.8m and in July it spent a combined Pounds 4m on BMV and a controlling stake in Pels &amp; Joosten, French and Dutch glass companies respectively. Group turnover grew to Pounds 190.4m (Pounds 160.5m) and the interim dividend is held at 4.5p, uncovered by earnings of 3.4p (7.7p) per share. COMMENT Though its glass processing side has in the last two years afforded some protection by boosting its buying power, Heywood is now reeling from both a decline in demand and weak prices. But the balance sheet remains strong and gross margins have not fallen too much. A small movement in volumes would result in a jump in profits. But with no such movement and with the variable overhead pared to the bone, the company is looking at some Pounds 8m-Pounds 10m reduction in the fixed overhead to remain in the black. Assuming the housing market receives no external help, full-year profits are expected to be about Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 19.2m), allowing for Pounds 2m of redundancy costs in the second half. This gives earnings of 8.6p and a prospective p/e of 21, which looks high even taking cyclicality into account. However, sound management and the scope for profit improvement through cuts make it worth holding.</p>

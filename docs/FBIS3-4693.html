Since Prime Minister Hosokawa  has stated the issue has now been taken back to the drawing  board, he will not take the trouble to start a new cabinet."  The SDPJ leader thus stated that an early cabinet reshuffle  prior to the Diet approving the fiscal 1994 national budget bill  has become difficult."    Citing the reason, he said: "If the fiscal 1994 national  budget bill is presented to the Diet on 4 March, policy speeches  will be delivered on 7 March. It would be physically difficult  to change cabinet members at that time. The cabinet reshuffle  is a different argument." He added: "Representatives from  three parties and one parliamentary group told the prime  minister this was not the time to reshuffle the cabinet. It  might be appropriate for a cabinet reshuffle to take place  following passage of the budget bill or after the current  ordinary Diet session closes." The SDPJ leader stressed that an  agreement has not been reached among the ruling parties on the  necessity of a cabinet reshuffle.    Chairmen of the SDPJ and the Democratic Socialist Party, as  well as a representative of the Democratic Reform Party, met  with Prime Minister Hosokawa on 24 February to ask him to  cautiously deal with the issue of an early cabinet reshuffle.  They expressed growing opposition to prime minister's idea of  forming a large, unified parliamentary group as well as to a  cabinet reshuffle. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  also attended the meeting. There is an intensifying  confrontation among the ruling parties over the issue of a  cabinet reshuffle. The SDPJ leader indicated it has become  objectively difficult for the prime minister to carry out a  cabinet reshuffle, probably because the leader judges the  handling of the issue of ousting Chief Cabinet Secretary  Takemura from the cabinet has now become more difficult under  these circumstances.</p>

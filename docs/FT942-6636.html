			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Sport: Mystery of the vanishing amateurs - Golf No doubt the keen golf followers among you will be able to work out the common thread that binds together the names of Duncan Evans, Martin Thompson, Philip Parkin, David Curry, Paul Mayo, Stephen Dodd, Stephen Dundas, and lain Pyman. Equally, there is no shame in not having the faintest idea who half of them are, let alone what fate has brought them together. Perhaps the cynical have made a stab at the fact that, apart from Pyman who has only just joined the paid ranks, they are all struggling professionals, in which case award yourself one mark out of two. The correct answer is that these are the British players who have won the Amateur Championship since 1980 and, full of ambition and with dreams in their heads, have gone on to turn professional. A good point to start is 1980, because it was about then that the amateur game had ceased to be any such thing and had evolved into a nursery for budding professionals. This year's Amateur Championship begins on Monday at the beautiful Nairn golf club on the east coast of Scotland, and the average age of the 288 players from 19 countries who will try to win it will certainly be no more than 25. It will be a surprise if the winner is over 21. Next Saturday afternoon, he will come into the interview room and he will say that it has always been his ambition to play in the US Masters; winning the amateur gains an invitation to Augusta next April. Shortly thereafter he will be faced with the tricky decision of either turning professional or waiting until the completion of the Walker Cup the following September. Great things will be predicted for him and maybe he will allow himself to be carried away by some of them. So let me introduce a note of caution: just study that list of winners again. They are not exactly household names. Indeed, only Mayo is currently playing regularly on the European tour, and no one would consider him anything other than a journeyman. Some of the failures have been spectacular. Evans, after a particularly unhappy time as a pro, was reinstated to the amateur ranks, and for a while was working in a fish and chip shop. Parkin is perhaps the biggest mystery of all. In his first event as a professional he finished in a tie for 81st in the Open at St Andrews. Two years later, at Turnberry, he was lying 10th with three holes to play, before finishing bogey, double bogey, par to drop back to 21st. Who would have thought that eight years on, as the Open returns this July to the Ailsa course in Ayrshire, that Parkin would have no tour card, and would be reduced to lining up in the Open regional qualifying stages? Dodd and Dundas are assistant professionals, their aspirations of playing the tour having regressed to the point where no one calls them 'promising' any more. Going slightly further back, there is the case of Trevor Homer, who won the Amateur not once but twice in three years in the early 1970s. But his professional career was a failure. He applied for reinstatement, and was so disillusioned with the game that he did not pick up a club for almost 15 years. Of the three overseas players who have won the Amateur since 1980, and have tried their hand at the professional game, Christian Hardin from Sweden, and Rolf Muntz from the Netherlands can only be said to have added their names to this mysterious litany of failure. Why does it all go wrong? Most often, and certainly in the cases of Evans, Homer and Dodd, they make a bad start and when what little sponsorship revenue they have managed to cobble together runs out, they become trapped in a vicious cycle where the pressure to make money strangles their golf. All the same it is baffling, at a time when a distinguished amateur career is accepted as a landmark towards professional success, that winning the biggest amateur event can mean so little. There is, however, one glorious exception. In 1984 at Formby Jose-Maria Olazabal, having defeated David Gilford in the semi-finals, beat Colin Montgomerie in the final. Still, it is sobering to reflect that he is the first winner of amateur golf's premier event to go on to achieve a major championship victory since Lawson Little, Amateur Champion in 1934 and 1935, won the US Masters in 1940.</p>

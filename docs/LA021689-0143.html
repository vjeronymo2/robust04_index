			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACLU SUES FOX HILLS MALL OVER RESTRICTIONS ON ACTIVISTS  </P> <P> The American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday sued a company belonging to one  of Southern California's leading shopping center magnates for allegedly  refusing to let peace activists hand out leaflets at a Culver City mall.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that managers of the Fox Hills Shopping Mall in Culver City  denied members of the Westside Sane/Freeze access to the mall, violating their  rights to exercise free speech.  </P> <P> Sane/Freeze is a group campaigning for a ban on nuclear testing. Its  coordinator, Andrew Tonkovich, said he applied for permission last November to  distribute leaflets at the mall and to talk to shoppers but was turned down  because his cause was "political."  </P> <P> Tonkovich and ACLU attorney Robin Toma said the mall's policies allow people  into the mall to register voters or circulate petitions but won't permit people  advocating nonpartisan political issues.  </P> <P> "The mall's policies violate the California Constitution because they  arbitrarily discriminate among speakers based on their message," Toma said in a  prepared statement.  </P> <P> The Fox Hills Shopping Mall is owned by the San Diego-based Ernest W. Hahn Co.,  which owns numerous malls throughout Southern California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Malls Sued  </P> <P> Attorneys for the firm were not immediately available for comment.  </P> <P> Toma said two other Hahn-owned malls have been sued for allegedly restricting  activists' ability to canvass customers.  </P> <P> In Culver City, Fox Hills manager Joanne Sudjin Brosi said she was unaware of  the lawsuit but that the mall does not deny access to groups that want to  campaign for political causes.  </P> <P> "We go by the letter of the law," she said. "We are private property, we do  have merchants, so we can't have people that disrupt business. . . . (But) as  far as not allowing access, if it is of any political nature, we cannot deny  access."  </P> <P> She said the company receives several applications a week from people who want  to promote political causes, and the applications are usually granted.  </P> <P> In its suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, the ACLU is seeking a  preliminary injunction to allow Sane/Freeze members to "engage in peaceful  political expression at the mall."  </P> <P> The suit also asks the court to declare as unconstitutional the rules that the  mall management asks users to obey. Toma said the rules, such as restricting  politicos to certain areas and requiring a $75 deposit, are "unnecessarily  burdensome."  </P> <P> Tonkovich said his group frequently visits malls, libraries, supermarkets and  schools to speak on the arms race.  </P> <P> "We just wanted to talk to people and educate them on the arms race," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Big Following'  </P> <P> "We've had a presence in malls all over the Westside," Tonkovich said. "We are  really anxious to get our message out. We have a big following in the Culver  City area and want more in areas where we don't. It's hard to get the message  out when you are denied access."  </P> <P> Toma said the state Supreme Court, in a landmark decision in 1979, established  that Californians have free speech and petitioning rights in privately owned  shopping malls.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Afrikaner National Front and Freedom </F> Alliance leader, General Constand Viljoen, by South African  Broadcasting Corporation presenter Marietta Kruger in the  television news studio -- live]    [Text] [Kruger] In the studio tonight we have one of the  leaders of the Freedom Alliance, General Constand Viljoen. Good  evening General.    [Viljoen] Good evening.    [Kruger] We have just heard that the Ciskei government is  fully prepared to cooperate with the Transitional Executive  Council. Can one infer from this that there is a split in the  Freedom Alliance?    [Viljoen] No, I don't think that we should regard this as a  split. Brigadier Oupa Gqozo did meet with alliance leaders and  he explained his position to us. He is in an unenviable  position, in the sense that he is isolated and is experiencing  pressure and threats from the government and the ANC [African  National Congress]. What is obviously not a very level playing  field is causing Brigadier Oupa Gqozo a lot of hardship. For  example, he is pressured by his own officers, who say that they  will not be integrated into a future defense force because the  South African Defense Force told them that unless their leader  decides to participate in the transitional councils, they will  not be eligible for selection for the future defense force. So  within the Ciskei there is this intense pressure on Brigadier  Gqozo. He is in a very difficult position. He did explain it  to us. It will probably be discussed at the forthcoming  leadership meeting on Friday.    [Kruger] Do you expect more parties to follow Ciskei's  example?    [Viljoen] No, I do not think so. I think a very clear stand  has been taken by the Freedom Alliance. We have, without doubt,  walked down the road of negotiations. Recently we declared that  we are fully prepared to negotiate. We even said that if  negotiations are successful and if everything goes well, then we  will consider, if our controlling bodies approve, to participate  in such an election -- in the process -- so I do not think there  is any danger of people walking out. I think we should first  see if we can solve the negotiations issue. As you know, we are  a negotiating alliance and only when the negotiations issue is  solved, then we will consider the possibility of forming a  political or other alliance.    [Kruger] General Viljoen, thank you.</p>

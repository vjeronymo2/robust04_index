			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WHOLESALE PRICES UP MODEST .4% IN APRIL;  </P> <P> GASOLINE PRICES SOAR; AUTO, FOOD COSTS IN DECLINE  </P> <P> Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4% in April, despite the sharpest increase  in energy costs in nearly 2 1/2 years, the government said today.  </P> <P> The gain in the Labor Department's producer price index reflected a steep jump  in gasoline prices, counterbalanced by a substantial drop in auto prices and  broad declines in food costs.  </P> <P> It followed a 0.4% gain in March and back-to-back 1% jumps in January and  February.  </P> <P> Because of the steep rises early in the year, wholesale price inflation, one  stop short of retail, advanced at a 9% annual rate in the first four months of  1989.  </P> <P> "This is very good news . . . but the inflation watch is not over," said Dirk  Van Dongen, president of the National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors. "My  concern is it's dangerous to generalize long-term trends from any 30-day  snapshot. We still have some sectors in the economy that are hot even though  some have slowed."  </P> <P> Economists were paying particular attention to the inflation rate for goods  other than the volatile food and energy categories, which edged down 0.1% in  April after a 0.3% rise in March. It was the first drop since an identical fall  in October, 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Biggest Decline Since 1987  </P> <P> A 0.6% decline in food costs was the biggest since a 1.1% decline in December,  1987, and represented the first substantial price relief since last year's  drought.  </P> <P> The huge 7.2% rise in energy costs matched the increase in January, 1987.  Energy prices have not risen more sharply in one month in 15 years.  </P> <P> The energy increase was almost entirely attributable to a 13.4% climb in  gasoline prices, the steepest since January, 1987. Fuel oil rose a  comparatively moderate 0.6% after zooming 16.8% in March. Natural gas prices  advanced 1.9%  </P> <P> The decline in food was led by a 15.9% drop in eggs. Vegetables fell 7.5%;  pork, 3.6%; fruit, 2.7%, and fish, 1.3%. The prices of turkeys, rice and candy  rose.  </P> <P> The biggest drop in categories other than food and energy came in autos, where  prices fell 2.8%, the result of manufacturers' incentives to lure customers  into showrooms and revive slumping sales.  </P> <P> There were also declines in children's clothing, cosmetics, magazines and  tires. Prices rose for jewelry and electronic equipment.  </P> <P> Inflation measures earlier in the production process also showed moderation.  Intermediate goods rose 0.4% in April after a 0.7% jump in March. Crude goods  rose 0.6% after a 2.3% gain.  </P> <P> An example of the three processing levels would be: finished -- wholesale  bread; intermediate -- flour, and crude -- wheat.  </P> <P> The 9% annual rate of wholesale inflation so far this year is more than double  the 4% price rise last year and four times the 2.2% gain in 1987.  </P> <P> Analysts, however, are divided over whether inflation will continue  accelerating later this year.  </P> <P> Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, acknowledged earlier  this week that "we may see another bumpy month or two." But he pointed out that  "the great bulk of the acceleration was due to the increased price of crude  oil."  </P></p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Business Travel:: Highland link by BA and Loganair Air travellers to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland will notice changes from July 11. There will be fewer flights by British Airways' 64-seat ATP turbo-prop aircraft, and more by Loganair's 36-seat Shorts 360s. The white and red livery of Loganair's fleet will also gradually be repainted in BA colours, and its cabin staff will don BA uniforms. The changes, which will mean a small increase in frequencies on some routes but with smaller aircraft, are the consequence of Loganair becoming a franchisee of BA. It will remain a separate company (and may also be bought by its management from Airlines of Britain, owner of British Midland), but will operate services for BA as British Airways Express. Loganair flights will get BA prefix codes and join BA's reservations system. BA's ATPs will stop serving Glasgow-Aberdeen, Glasgow-Belfast International, Glasgow-Inverness, Inverness-Kirkwall, Kirkwall-Sumburgh, Edinburgh-Aberdeen and Aberdeen-Inverness routes. Loganair as BA Express, using Shorts 360s, will take over Glasgow-Belfast and Glasgow-Aberdeen, and will increase frequency on Glasgow-Inverness, Inverness-Kirkwall and Kirkwall-Sumburgh. Neither company will fly Edinburgh-Aberdeen or Aberdeen-Inverness (though Air UK and Business Air serve the former, and Business Air the latter). BA will continue to fly to Benbecula and Stornoway in the Western Isles and to Shetland and Orkney, while BA Express will go on serving its many island destinations. The arrangement safeguards Loganair as a business and preserves its thin routes, while enabling BA to give up loss-making routes and deploy more ATPs on services linking Glasgow and Edinburgh with Manchester and Birmingham.</p>

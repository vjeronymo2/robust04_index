			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Middelburg, Eastern Transvaal, Jan 27 SAPA--The  African National Congress [ANC] was the real lame duck party  carrying the weight of all the failures of communism across the  world, State President F W de Klerk said on Thursday [27  January].    He was on an election road show stop at the Kanhym feeder  farm outside Middelburg where he addressed an audience of a  1,000, two thirds of them black.    He was welcomed in jamboree style with a four-piece band,  singalongs and viva shouts along with a constant drone of boos  from an apparently ANC supporting section of the audience.    Mr de Klerk told his audience South Africa had changed under  the transition process initiated by the NP [National Party].  "Now it is the ANC who tells you you may not buy there, you may  not walk here and you may not go to that meeting."    He warned the ANC was not to be trusted and would become a  suppressing party. "Mr Mandela recently claimed ours is a lame  duck government. But this party is a very alive duck swimming  to a win. It is the ANC that is way down in the water as a lame  duck carrying the weight of the South African Communist Party  [SACP] and all the failures of communism across the world."    The ANC list of political candidates carried names of failed  politicians such as Nelson Ramodike and Prince James Mahlangu  who had wrecked their respective homelands of Lebowa and  kwaNdebele with maladministration. "They are way down on the  list along with Winnie Mandela... Let me say no more."    Mr de Klerk was supported throughout with shouts of viva.  The group which booed fell silent towards the end of the  meeting when he referred to the ANC's economic policies and  specifically to Mozambique as an example of such policies. "The  world is divided into a rich half and a poor half," he said.  "The poor half of the world is where the policies of communism  and Marxism have been applied -- where the policies of the ANC  have been applied." "Just look at Mozambique where everybody  has been made poor, jobs have been lost and the country has  retrogressed." "South Africa looks much better. And what  party's policy was applied? -- the NP's".    The NP stood for one man, one job and for economic growth,  but the ANC was introducing aspects of SACP and Cosatu [Congress  of South African Trade Unions] policies to satisfy them and this  would make all South Africans poorer and frighten off  international investors.</p>

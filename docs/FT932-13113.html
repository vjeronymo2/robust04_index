			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Three steps to share 'success' EVERYBODY wants to find the magic formula that produces sure-fire share selections. Given the bewildering gyrations of the market, this is not surprising. The latest author to outline his theories is Raymond Caley, a broker who has been an active investor for more than 25 years. His book* outlines a step-by-step system under which shares are selected only if they meet three criteria. These sound relatively simple. The first is that shares should be bought only if their price has reached a high for the past 12 months, or longer. It might seem odd to pick a share when it has reached a high, rather than a low. But Caley is looking for evidence that other people, and particularly the investment institutions, have started to see merit in the stock. The second step is to buy shares where profits are set to break records. Finally, one should look only for shares where the price-earnings ratio is at least 25 per cent below the sector average. So, if the sector p/e is 16, the share's p/e should be no higher than 12. The combined result is to acquire shares in companies with a sound business position, but to avoid paying an inflated price. Caley then adds two safeguards which apply once you have bought the stock. Investors should sell shares (a) if the price falls back 17.5 per cent or more from the peak price; or (b) if the p/e ratio rises 25 per cent or more than the sector average. These criteria give the investor clear signals which indicate when to take a loss and when to realise a profit. Although the criteria are fairly straightforward, the difficulty lies in compiling the information on which to base the investment decisions. The Financial Times publishes share price highs, for example, but these are compiled for a calendar year (with the exception of the first three months of the year), not on a rolling one-year basis. So, investors must keep their own records to follow Caley's system. Even more of a problem is that Caley (for quite understandable reasons) focuses on future earnings. So, investors have to rely on brokers' forecasts, derived from whatever source is available (the Investors Chronicle, Earnings Guide, Estimate Directory or newspapers), to assess the second and third criteria: the prospect of record profits and the relative level of the p/e ratio. Brokers' forecasts often can be wrong - as the shareholders of companies such as Parkfield and Queens Moat Houses can attest. But Caley would argue that if the analysts were wildly wrong in their forecasts, then this might well have been picked up by share traders; thus, the stock would not be trading at a 12-month high. The third criterion relies on investors choosing shares at a 25 per cent discount to the sector p/e. To help readers, Caley gives his own list of the average p/e's of the sectors. These might provoke some debate among the experts - FT-SE 100 stocks and those with market capitalisations over Pounds 100m are, for instance, assigned a p/e of 15 while conglomerates are allowed a p/e of 10. Caley's system has its virtues, though, not the least of which is that it is fairly demanding. It is quite difficult to find stocks where record profits are expected, where the share price has risen over the past 12 months - and where they are still rated on a discount to the sector. In the book, Caley writes: 'For example, the system did not identify any suitable shares in 1989. And in many months of 1990 and 1991, and for much of 1992, there was a dearth of attractive shares suitable for investment. The explanation lies mainly with the fact that the technique unearths recovery shares brought about by a sustained decline in interest rates.' With the UK economy showing signs of recovery, Caley believes 'there will be more shares to invest in.' He goes on to cite stocks selected by the system in the past, such as Airtours, the best-performing share of 1991. But it is not foolproof: Instem was one pick which had to be sold after a 10 per cent decline. Keeping the records required to follow the system would be quite time-consuming, which might deter all but the highly-enthusiastic amateur investor. Nevertheless, private investors might find the system useful as a cross-check for their own picks. If your own selections fail Caley's criteria, you might re-examine your reasons for buying them. *How to Choose Stockmarket Winners: a Minimum-Risk System for the Private Investor, by Raymond Caley.

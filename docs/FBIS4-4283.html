He made this proposal in the Sarajevo while meeting the  newly  established "contact group" on Bosnia, which consists of Russia,  the European Union (EU), the United States and the United  Nations.    After visiting Bosnia, the group, set up early this month in  London, will prepare a report within a week for a ministerial  meeting of the U.S., Britain, France, Germany and Russia.    This new group, headed by Lord Owen, an EU envoy for Bosnia,  will also meet Bosnian Serb and Croatian leaders.    The task of the group is to ensure a two- to three- month  peace in Bosnia, map out a comprehensive settlement, and draw up  a plan for the division of territory.</p>

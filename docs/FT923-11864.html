			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Management: Quest for good connections - Damian Fraser meets the man charged with modernising Mexico's telephone service Carlos Slim, the Mexican businessman who controls Telmex, the country's recently-privatised telephone monopoly, has one of the most demanding jobs in Mexican business: to turn the woefully inefficient Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) into a modern, internationally competitive telephone company by August 1996. On this date, Telmex's lucrative monopoly on long-distance and international calls runs out. Between now and then, Telmex has to meet - under pain of penalties - a series of government-mandated 'quality of service' targets. Jacques Rogozinski, who was in charge of privatising Telmex, sums up the challenge facing Slim and his two foreign partners, Southwestern Bell and France Telecom. 'The owners of Telmex have a gun at their head. By 1996, there has to be a world-class telephone service at international prices.' Or, he implies, there will be trouble. Slim, the son of well-off Lebanese parents, has become probably the country's richest businessman thanks to a series of shrewd acquisitions of under-priced Mexican companies in the mid-1980s. He describes his business philosophy as 'low costs and low overheads', to which others add tough, and sometimes ruthless, negotiating. Slim's most significant, and controversial, managerial impact has been in his negotiations with suppliers, that he says reflects the businessman's - as opposed to the public official's - concern to reduce costs and optimise investment. Last year, Telmex cut heavily inventories of cables and other equipment that in many cases were equivalent to a year's supply. This year Telmex, at the behest of Southwestern Bell, brought in a third supplier, A T &amp; T, and forced Ericsson and Alcatel, the two existing suppliers, to cut their prices for installing central offices and lines - saving about Dollars 250m a year. In the 18 months since privatisation, this strategy has done wonders for Telmex's investors. Costs have risen much less than analysts predicted, and the controlling group's original 20.4 per cent stake is now worth about Dollars 6bn, compared with Dollars 1.76bn in December 1990. However, some argue that Slim has been too keen to cut costs for the customer's good. A former Telmex director says stocks of some key parts ran out at the end of 1991 causing disruption. Slim is also criticised for centralising labour, management and purchasing decisions in Mexico City. Telmex, when in government hands, had decided to divide itself into regional and fairly autonomous profit centres. The decision to re-centralise may have cut financial and operating costs but, says the former director, it has reduced the ability of the company to respond to local telephone needs. Such criticisms are strenuously rejected by Slim, and Juan Perez Simon, Telmex's general director, but there is little argument that service has yet to improve. In 1989, the year before privatisation, Mexico's consumer protection agency received 13,277 complaints about Telmex - ranging from over-billing to shortcomings in its service. In 1991, complaints increased to 63,996, and in the first quarter this year there were another 21,822. Telmex receives about 40 per cent of all consumer complaints in Mexico. The management says, almost in unison, that the company did not deteriorate overnight and it is not going to improve overnight either. Technologically, Telmex matches the position of most US telephone companies in the 1970s - using mostly unreliable analogue technology that requires, for example, 12,000 operators to fill in by hand 8m long-distance billing tickets every month. There is still a backlog of about 1m lines, and the waiting list is more than a year. Perez Simon says that now the company has identified most of the cost savings, its priority is to improve quality. In this the management's hand has largely been forced. In return for extremely light regulation of prices and generous tax treatment, the government has required Telmex to invest Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn a year to improve service. As a public company Telmex was starved of cash and unable to invest sufficiently to improve service. Telmex is thus investing nearly Dollars 8bn from 1991 to the end of 1993 in increasing the number of lines to 7.5m, from 5m in 1990; installing 13,500 kilometres of fibre optic cables which will connect just about all long-distance calls; and replacing old central exchanges with automatic digital ones, so that by 1993, 60 per cent of local exchanges will be digital, from 29 per cent in 1991. By 1996, every city in Mexico will have digital telephones and just about all long-distance calls will be relayed through fibre-optic cables. 'Mexico,' says Perez Simon 'will have by 1996 as good as or even better telephone service than most parts of the US.' Slim evidently does not believe that this would have been possible under the old management of Telmex. Since taking over the company, he has fired 13 of the top 17 directors and brought in some of his colleagues from Grupo Carso  -the sprawling tobacco-to-telephones conglomerate that he runs from a four-man office in Mexico City. He has also brought in hundreds of managers from Southwestern Bell and France Telecom. Slim suggests tactfully that the previous managers - all public sector employees - 'did not have a vocation for business'. John Atterbury, head of Southeastern Bell's Mexican operations, puts it differently. 'The whole management style is different,' he says. The result, according to Atterbury and Slim, is a host of improvements that have cost little money, and two of which exemplify the company's commitment to better service. Before privatisation, it was difficult to report telephone faults to Telmex since there was no operator to answer the phone. So the new management negotiated with unions to double the number of operators working in this area. Now customers can at least report broken phones, even if they are not fixed any sooner. Starting in Puebla, Telmex is aiming to install phones within 30 days. By the end of this year, says Atterbury, 40 per cent of phones will be installed in under 30 days. The change in Telmex is apparent to Mexico's two main suppliers, Alcatel and Ericsson. 'Telmex is much more customer-service orientated than before,' says Rodrigo Calderon of Alcatel. 'All they now have to put in place is the hardware to meet customer needs.' Jorge Arredondo of Ericsson agrees. He cites, for example, a 'drastic change in the way they plan telephone switches. Before, if we had to install 600,000 lines we had to go to 800,000 places; now we have to go to half that many.' Both these suppliers have lost most from Slim's tough, bare-bones approach to running Telmex, with their profits dropping sharply last year. What is still unclear is whether the ultimate beneficiaries will be, as of now, the owners of Telmex stock, or Telmex's long-suffering customers.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Lines in service         1989 GDP                           per 100 inhabitants       per capita                                as of 1.1.1991        (Dollars)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mexico                                    6.1            1,990 Argentina                                10.7            2,160 Brazil                                    6.0            2,550 Chile                                     5.2            1,770 France                                   47.3           17,830 Japan                                    43.2           23,730 Poland                                    8.3            1,760 Spain                                    30.4            9,150 US                                       53.3           21,100 Venezuela                                 7.6            2,450  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Siemens, IBRD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

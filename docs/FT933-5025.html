			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (10): Unorthodox duo's initiative - Profile / how Centre Re acquired its dynamic reputation CENTRE RE has grown apace in 1993. The initial public offering in the US in the spring and the new plans to launch a new catastrophe reinsurer in Bermuda in the summer have underlined its reputation as one of the world's most dynamic reinsurance companies. The Bermuda-based company, controlled by Zurich Insurance, has shown an impressive record of growth and profitability since its launch from scratch in 1988. Premium income has increased from just Dollars 268m in 1989 to an estimated Dollars 1.1bn in 1992. Profits amounted to Dollars 65.9m in 1992, a 37 per cent increase compared with 1991, and representing a return on equity of 12.7 per cent, and by mid-1993 the combined assets of the group amounted to Dollars 4.5bn. Since its initial capitalisation of Dollars 250m in 1988, assets have risen on average by 63 per cent a year. But it is not just the speed and scale of growth that marks off Centre Re from many of its competitors. The company's founders - Mr Stephen Gluckstern, the chairman of Centre Re Holdings, and Michael Palm, the executive vice-president who heads up the Bermuda operations - are both in their early 40s and had had no experience in the reinsurance industry before launching Centre Re. Indeed their backgrounds are even more unorthodox that that. Both men have liberal arts backgrounds - Palm did academic research in English Literature, specialising in the work of the American poet Wallace Stevens, while Gluckstern is an educationalist who researched pre-school influences on the ability of children to learn. They met for the first time - in 1976 - teaching English in pre-revolutionary Iran. Ten years later - after business school and beginning banking careers - the two teamed up again, at the Philadelphia offices of Berkshire Hathaway, the US investment group led by Warren Buffet. Influenced by the climate of innovation in US finance during the 1980s, they saw reinsurance as an underdeveloped part of the financial markets ripe for new ideas. 'We wanted to take a more heavily financial approach to insurance,' explains Palm. 'This was a sector with very substantial cash flows which ought to have the same kind of stability and product sophistication as is found in other financial services.' 'We wanted to focus on stability and long-term relationships instead of cyclicality and ups and downs in pricing,' says Palm. The two men thought the answer lay to some extent in a new kind of reinsurance contract. 'We wanted to find an intersection between highly leveraged and highly risk exposed business and what had been called financial reinsurance - closer to a banking or funding deal than a traditional reinsurance contract,' he adds. 'We wanted to take a multi-year approach to insurance costs, taking volatility out of year to year deals.' The result was what Palm admits was seen as a very ambitious effort to raise Dollars 250m to support a new reinsurer. Backing came from Kemper Re, a US reinsurer, Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, JP Morgan, the merchant bank, and, in particular, Zurich Insurance, which has subsequently become a majority shareholder. Launched in 1988, Centre Re began by specialising in what Palm calls 'retrospective' financial reinsurance deals covering what is known as 'timing' and 'interest rate risks' - the possibility that claims may emerge faster than expected on a book of liability business, or that trends in interest rates may reduce the value of funds available to meet known claims. Palm and Gluckstern decided to locate in Bermuda because the territory's regulators allow its insurers to count future investment income as part of its funds to meet claims, essentially permitting companies to discount their reserves. 'The US regulatory environment introduces many inefficiencies,' explains Palm. 'Our goal to concentrate on the economics of a transaction not to do business when they didn't make sense.' The regulatory framework also helped Centre Re contain its costs. 'We don't need to get authorisation for each separate line of business which we underwrite. We can move more quickly than our competitors,' he explains. Over the past five years the nature of business has changed, with the group beginning to concentrate on more typical reinsurance risks. In 1992 only 10 per cent of reinsurance contracts underwritten by Centre Re are now 'retrospective', compared with 100 per cent in 1988. The trend will be accentuated by changes in US accounting rules in early 1993, which remove some of the advantages for ceding insurers of using financial reinsurance deals. Meanwhile, Centre Re's commitment to compete in more orthodox markets has been underlined by a decision to start a new catastrophe reinsurance company. Even so, despite the changed focus, several aspects of the company's strategy and style are likely to remain distinctive. The way that Centre Re analyses risks and underwrites its policies marks it off from some companies in the industry, for example. Its staff of just over 100 includesat least 30 actuaries, who are adept at using mathematical models to assess risk. Barely concealing his contempt for some of the underwriting practices of the Lloyd's market in the late 1980s, Palm says: 'We don't believe in subjective underwriting where you guess what the range is in which losses might fall.' He insists that the company is conservative in its analysis and pricing of risks. 'The history of the industry shows that the successful people have taken a very conservative view. Things tend to turn out worse.' By underwriting in this fashion Centre Re is able to assume more risk on its own books and therefore has more influence in the marketplace. You don't want to be a follower. It tends to underwrite 'lines' or shares of individual risks of at least 50 per cent. Centre Re also tends to favour longer-term relationships with its clients with contracts stretching on average for between three and five years. In 1992 the company underwrote just 175 contracts, each of which had an average reinsurance premium of Dollars 25m. These factors tend to mean that retention rates are higher and costs are lower. Above all Palm remains confident and observes that the reinsurance industry as a whole seems to be following in Centre Re's footsteps, with better pricing and terms in the market increasingly controlled by the industry's financially stronger companies.</p>

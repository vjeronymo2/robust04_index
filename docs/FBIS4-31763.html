			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 13 -- Defence Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk made it clear that Poland would not agree to the  privileged treatment of any country in the "Partnership for  Peace" programme. "There must be the same rules for all," he  said. Kolodziejczyk opened Monday a three-day international  seminar on "Civilian and Democratic Control over the Armed  Forces" attended by representatives of 38 countries, the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council and the supreme command of NATO  allied armed forces.    According to Poland's defence minister, the "Partnership for  Peace" is a step towards western security structures although  "it fails to secure full NATO membership and gives no full  security guarantees."    Kolodziejczyk emphasized that full membership of the Western  European Union and NATO was Poland's "strategic choice." Poland  wants to participate in the work of the two organizations, in  NATO manoeuvres and peace-keeping missions. "We are ready to  meet the "Partnership for Peace" obligations although it will  not be easy because of Poland's economic situation," he said.    "The to-date pro-east political orientation, conditioned by  the subjection to the USSR and anti-NATO security policy, does  not meet the expectations of Polish society, nor our  geostrategic situation," he stressed. According to him, Poland  faces the opportunity of "independently choosing an optimal  political option." The turn to the western democracy does not  mean, however, "breaking the to-date links with the east," said  the minister.    Kolodziejczyk stressed Poland's advantages, including good  relations with neighbours, no ethnic conflicts, many-year  experience in UN peace-keeping missions, military potential, and  the defence system.    He also admitted that Poland's "system of control over the  army is far from being perfect" and is still in the making. In  his opinion the seminar will help better tailor Polish solutions  to west European standards. The civilian control over the army  is a significant element of breaking away from the old  totalitarian structures and dependencies, said Kolodziejczyk.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICT ASKS DISMISSAL OF TEXT SUIT  </P> <P> The Capistrano Unified School District has asked a federal court in Santa Ana  to dismiss a $300,000 lawsuit that accuses the district of copying elementary  school workbooks without paying for them.  </P> <P> Educators Publishing Services Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., alleged in the suit  filed Sept. 5 that the district had routinely bought single copies of workbooks  over the last 10 years.  </P> <P> Educators sometimes order just one copy of a book to look at it and see whether  they want to buy it, but Capistrano developed a pattern of buying one copy,  said Robert Baker, a Los Angeles attorney for the publisher.  </P> <P> The company could not show that the district was illegally copying the  workbooks for classroom use until an individual, who asked to remain anonymous,  sent copies of workbooks distributed without the author's and publisher's names  to the publisher, Baker said.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that the district infringed on six copyrights over the last  year and seeks $300,000 in damages.  </P> <P> The district will ask that the suit be dismissed, based on copyright laws that  allow some copyrighted materials to be reproduced in an educational setting,  said attorney Richard Hamilton, whose Sacramento firm of Biddle &amp; Hamilton  is representing the district. A hearing is scheduled in U.S. District Court in  Santa Ana on Nov. 13.  </P> <P> Hamilton said he will also argue that the district has immunity under the 11th  Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits a citizen from suing a state  where he is not a resident. The district may be considered a state in this  case, he said.  </P> <P> He will also argue that the statute of limitations has expired.  </P> <P> "If he (the publisher) has known about it for 10 years, it may be that his  cause of action has run out," Hamilton said.  </P></p>

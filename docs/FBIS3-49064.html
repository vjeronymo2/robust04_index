			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vojislav Seselj, chairman of the Serbian </F> Radical Party, by BTA journalist Rayna Chobanova in Belgrade;  date not given: "Everyone in Bosnia Should Get Their Own State"]    [Text] At the beginning of the eighties, the 38-year-old  sociologist Vojislav Seselj was an admirer of the "patriarch of  the Serbian national school" Dobrica Cosic. In 1984 Seselj was  given an eight-year prison sentence by the post-Tito communist  authorities when a document was seized from his home that  praised the Titovization of Yugoslavia and condemned the federal  system. Freed 22 months later, he founded the Serbian Radical  Party, and a great number of dissidents flocked to support his  ideas.    Later, however, the Serbian intellectuals distanced  themselves from Seselj, frightened by the extreme radicalism of  his views: a strong government, unification of the Serbian  lands at any price, a hard stance toward the outside world, and  liquidation of all "traitorous" parties in the country.  Following the last elections his party now has 39 seats in the  new Serbian parliament (previously it had 72). It is now the  third largest party in parliament after the Socialist Party and  the opposition Depos coalition [Democratic Movement of Serbia].    [Chobanova] How do you view the situation in Serbia  following the elections?    [Seselj] The socioeconomic situation in Serbia will remain  very grave and will even worsen. How can it improve? This  government has no program nor mechanisms to solve the economic  and social problems.    [Chobanova] Can the Radical Party do anything to improve the  situation?    [Seselj] We will continue to criticize the people in power  in all fields. We will see what the results are.    [Chobanova] How did your break with the Socialists come  about?    [Seselj] We have never been together. This is a great  delusion that is widespread among the public. We simply gave  them a chance to form a minority government. We were not in a  coalition with them, and continually criticized them. Later,  when we wanted to topple the government, they dissolved  parliament.    We kept away only from Milosevic -- from the outset we did  not criticize him, only the Socialists. Even now it would have  been the same if Milosevic had not started arresting our  supporters. We started criticizing him, and therefore won so  few votes. Many people cannot stand the Socialist Party, but  for some irrational reasons respect Milosevic.    [Chobanova] Let us talk about Bosnia. Will there be an end  to the war?    [Seselj] I do not believe so, unfortunately. The Muslims  are continually spurred on by the West and their appetites are  growing.    [Chobanova] But surely they have no forces to oppose and  resist?    [Seselj] They have obtained a lot of weapons. They  delivered many weapons to them by air drops and they will try to  mount a big offensive.    [Chobanova] Perhaps they are counting on foreign military  intervention. What do you think about this?    [Seselj] They have lost on this point too, there will be no  military intervention. Who wants to die for the Muslims in  Bosnia. Furthermore, it is very difficult to intervene  militarily in Bosnia.    [Chobanova] Did the Serbian Radical Party have any soldiers  fighting in Bosnia?    [Seselj] Yes, but they were all part of the Serbian troops.  We did not have any separate units.    [Chobanova] What do you think about the West's policy toward  the Balkans as a whole, apart from Bosnia?    [Seselj] The West's policy is wrong. First, the Americans  are settling some of their own accounts in the Balkans. It is  in their interest to halt the unification of Europe. They want  to hinder the consolidation of the EC. If there were no  conflicts in the Balkans, they would dream one up, to justify  their intervention and presence here.    Second, Germany wanted to draw Slovenia and Croatia within  its orbit. This is the reason Yugoslavia split. Germany has  not yet stopped completely at this point. The Americans also  have their interests regarding Turkey, and protect it.    [Chobanova] They also have interests in connection with  Macedonia.    [Seselj] Macedonia is also connected with this, because the  Americans clearly realize that the EC will never accept Turkey  as a member. For this reason, Turkey is a convenient ally for  them to drive a wedge into the heart of Europe. Turkey also has  appetites regarding Bulgaria and Greece and wants to establish a  convenient link with Macedonia, Albania, Sandjak, and Bosnia.    [Chobanova] Today, when Macedonia is an independent state,  it cannot remain an apple of discord and will not burden the  relations between Serbia and Bulgaria.    [Seselj] It should not make these relations difficult, but I  fear there will be a big war in Macedonia, because 40 percent of  its population are Albanians.    [Chobanova] After Zhirinovskiy's victory in Russia you said  that "our man has won in Moscow." Your words received great  publicity in Bulgaria. Moreover, a few days ago Russia said  that it wants to play a bigger role in the Balkans.    [Seselj] It is in our interest for Russia to play a bigger  role in the Balkans. Russia has traditionally helped Serbia,  Bulgaria, Greece, and Romania. Always, when we were close to  Russia, when Russia intervened, we gained benefit from it. As  soon as Austria-Hungary or Germany intervened, it immediately  caused a quarrel between the Balkan peoples.    For example, look at the war between Serbia and Bulgaria in  1885: It was completely unnecessary. This war was provoked by  Austria-Hungary, and the Serbs suffered the most from it.    [Text] A short time ago Vuk Draskovic said that the  division of Bosnia would not be to the Serbs' advantage, because  it would create an Islamic state in the heart of Europe. The  Islamic countries will aid the new state and Serbia will be left  to its own fate.    [Seselj] Such a danger does exist, but when this civil war  is over, we Serbs have no intention of living with the Muslims  any longer. We did not start this war. The West persuaded  Izetbegovic to insist on complete independence.    Much blood has been shed in this war. Why should we live  together again? It is better to separate. Otherwise, we will  continue to have bad relations with the Muslims. Why should we  have a permanently unstable state? We want to have within our  state the parts that are Serbian, that are indisputably Serbian.  It never came into our minds to keep Macedonia by force. There  is no Serbian majority there. Why should we force 700,000  Bulgarians, 700,000 Albanians and God knows who else to live  together with us? No conflicts have broken out there either, no  attacks on (Yugoslav Army) barracks. Our army withdrew from  there peacefully. Why should we do it?    In Kosovo, however, we cannot retreat. For us this is sacred  ground and we cannot give it up. On the other hand, we do we  need central Bosnia, where Muslims form the majority -- in  Zenica, Tuzla, and so on? It is true that these have never been  Serbian lands, and the Muslims have never been Serbs, although  they possessed a Serbian national consciousness for several  centuries.    [Chobanova] I also wanted to discuss the prospects for  relations with Bulgaria.    [Seselj] We support having the best possible relations with  Bulgaria. When we were all in the same party -- Draskovic,  Komnenic, and me -- when those demonstrations took place in  Skopje in the spring of 1990, we sent a letter in support of the  Bulgarians. I have always been against recognizing this  fictitious Macedonian nation, and have always advocated  friendship with Bulgaria and finding a compromise solution. We  hold the view that the eastern part of Macedonia should be  handed over to Bulgaria.    [Chobanova] Do you suggest that Macedonia should be divided?    [Seselj] Yes, it should. The part populated by Bulgarians  should belong to Bulgaria. I think this would be the best  solution. And one of the reasons in its favor is the Albanian  danger. Only by such a solution will we finally eliminate  Turkey in the Balkans. If necessary, Albania should also be  given the Western part of Macedonia, where Albanians form the  majority. It is important to us for the Albanians not to become  a majority in the Vardar valley, which is a vitally important  artery for us.    There is a danger that this may come about. The Albanians  already form a majority in Skopje.</p>

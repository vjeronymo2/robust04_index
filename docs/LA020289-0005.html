			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENDING NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION  </P> <P> "Not Even One More Nuclear Nation" (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 16) is a perfect title for  Warren Christopher's timely warning about the "horrific threat" to human  survival posed by the spread of nuclear weapons to more countries -- and  eventually, if the trend continues, to terrorists as well. Technically  described as horizontal proliferation (vertical proliferation meaning addition  to existing nuclear arsenals), this creeping menace is surely one of the  pre-eminent problems of our time. And like every serious global problem we  face, the solution depends in large measure on cooperation between the U.S. and  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> In 1978, when Christopher was serving our country well in the State Department,  I was privileged to be part of the U.S. delegation at the first United Nations  Special Session on Disarmament. Time and again our delegates would be told by  representatives of the 148 other nations: The U.S. and the Soviet Union insult  our intelligence and demean our dignity by preaching nuclear abstention while  practicing nuclear proliferation.  </P> <P> The specific actions set forth by Christopher are sensible steps toward  stopping the spread of a thermonuclear scourge. But they must be preceded by an  all-important first step; the massive and continuous reduction of  Soviet-American nuclear arsenals which set the right example for others.  </P> <P> HAROLD WILLENS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

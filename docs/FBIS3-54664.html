Moral and economic  support from Sweden and the other Nordic countries is also  necessary in the new situation which has arisen, Latvian  President Guntis Ulmanis, 54, said in an interview with DAGENS  NYHETER.    In President Ulmanis' view the Latvians will not be able on  their own to get the Russian troops to leave the strategic radar  base in Skrunda in southwestern Latvia. World opinion and  perhaps a third country in the West should help to put pressure  on Moscow and Yeltsin.    It is the presence of the Russian troops which is the  biggest  problem in Latvia. It is true that the situation has improved  somewhat recently as a result of "silent withdrawal." This week  it was reported that the number of Russian troops had fallen  from 17,000 to 13,000. But Moscow is also demanding to be  allowed to keep the radar installation for at least another six  years. The Skrunda installation, whose task it is to give early  warning of intercontinental missiles, is not only a political  problem. It is also destroying the environment because of its  powerful magnetic fields. The trees in the woods are withering,  animals, birds, and even people are being affected.    Ulmanis received DAGENS NYHETER at his temporary residence,  an imposing patrician villa in Riga. The house has been lent by  a Latvian woman who lives in exile in France. The president's  security guards checked our bags. His office is enormous, the  floor in front of his desk like a small dance floor.    Ulmanis had just returned from this week's crisis meeting of  the three Baltic presidents in Tallinn. Concern after Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's great electoral success is great in the Baltic  region. At the meeting the presidents -- Estonia's Lennart  Meri, Lithuania's Algirdas Brazauskas, and Latvia's Ulmanis --  agreed on a common strategy and an appeal to the rest of the  world.    Has President Ulmanis himself met Zhirinovskiy?    "No, never, nor do I want to meet him."    The response was rapid.    "Obviously we are worried that the Russian Liberal Democrats  won so many votes. But life goes on. Now we will have to  adjust our policy. I would like NATO to undertake a real  analysis of the Russian election result and abandon its passive  policy vis-a-vis the Baltic region."    "Partnership for peace" is not enough. A first step toward  security is that the Baltic countries be given the status of  associate members, Ulmanis said. He is hoping for much from the  NATO summit early in the new year.    What does he expect of Sweden and the Nordic area?    "Moral support, to begin with, and this is something that is  not so insignificant. But we must also be given help to put our  economy in order, with capital investments and support with  credits."    Are not the requirements in the proposed new citizenship law  not too strict vis-a-vis non-Latvians? People will have to have  lived in Latvia for at least ten years, be able to speak  Latvian, and also annual quotas will be introduced limiting how  many people can acquire citizenship.    No, President Ulmanis does not think so. The draft law is  still undergoing its first reading in parliament. It will now  be scrutinized by international organizations, including the  Council of Europe. Ten years is perhaps a long time, he  admitted, adding that he could perhaps imagine a "golden mean."  But on one point it is impossible for the Latvians to give way:  the language requirement. New citizens must be able to speak  Latvian.    As a boy Ulmanis was deported to Siberia. What does he  remember?    "A lot of snow. Very cold. I cannot remember ever  satisfying my hunger. We were always thinking about a small  country far away, about Latvia where the cows were brown and the  meadows green and where people lived in harmony. That helped us  to survive."    Guntis Ulmanis was clearly moved. "These are still painful  memories," he explained.    So why has almost no one been brought to trial in the Baltic  region for crimes against human rights during the years of  occupation?    He believes that this is due to the fact that the communist  period meant so much suffering, terror, and blood that people  have still not gotten enough distance from it to be able to  judge the guilty objectively.    "But the moment when we will be capable of doing so is very  near," Ulmanis said.    What sort of Christmas is the Latvian people expecting? In  the shadow of the Russian election result? With many poor  people, even children begging on the streets of Riga? Rising  crime?    Things are not easy for the old, the pensioners. Nor will  all the farmers have a good Christmas, the president admitted.  But he still hopes that Father Christmas will come to all, that  people will light candles and forget the nationalists' successes  in Russia. Despite everything Christmas 1993 is better  economically than Christmas 1992. Economically Latvia is at  rock bottom, but it is no longer sinking. Now things are  starting to move upwards.</p>

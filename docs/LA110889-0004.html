			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DUFFY VIDEOTAPE DIRECTIVE SPURS THREAT OF SUIT  </P> <P> All members of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department are being asked to  view videotapes of a television interview in which Sheriff John Duffy discusses  his upcoming campaign for reelection, and one local attorney believes the  arrangement is a violation of the law.  </P> <P> The attorney, Everett Bobbitt, said that Duffy's request in a weekly newsletter  that his staff view the videotape from KNSD Channel 39's "Headliners" program  is similar to a previous incident in which the sheriff improperly used deputies  to pass out post cards calling for the ouster of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth  Bird from the state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> "It's strictly a repeat of the Rose Bird infraction as far as a legal issue,"  Bobbitt said Tuesday. "Only this is worse because now he's doing it for his own  political benefit."  </P> <P> In the television interview, which aired Oct. 29, Duffy criticized The Times  for reporting that he has been working for years as a private consultant and  not disclosing any of his outside income. In another segment of the 30-minute  program, he discussed the upcoming campaign, in which he is seeking a sixth,  four-year term as sheriff.  </P> <P> Duffy could not be reached for comment Tuesday. In his department's weekly  newsletter, called The Informant, the staff was told that VHS copies of the  interview "will be distributed this week to all sheriff's stations and  facilities."  </P> <P> "The unedited interview was a rare opportunity for Sheriff Duffy to respond to  adversaries in a news media setting," the newsletter said. "All personnel are  encouraged to view the tape."  </P> <P> Bobbitt, in a letter this week to Duffy, said he was outraged that  rank-and-file deputies were being required to view the videotape, which the  lawyer said was purely political and had nothing to do with law enforcement.  </P> <P> He also told Duffy that, if the Sheriff's Department does not stop distributing  the tape, he will file a lawsuit "to force you and your staff to cease  political activities."  </P> <P> Bobbitt, who performs legal services for the Deputy Sheriffs Assn., emphasized  that he would file the lawsuit as a private citizen and not on behalf of the  DSA. He said he is concerned that county video equipment was used to make the  copies of the tape, and that government employees were used to produce it and  distribute it to the staff. He also said it is improper for deputies to review  the tapes on county time.  </P> <P> "It is illegal for a public official to use public funds or equipment to  further a political cause," he said.  </P> <P> In the Rose Bird case, Duffy in 1985 had his on-duty deputies distribute post  cards as part of the campaign to remove the chief justice from the state  Supreme Court. Attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union successfully  sued Duffy over that matter on behalf of the citizens lobbying group California  Common Cause, and the sheriff and one of his subordinates were later personally  loaned $36,000 to pay the ACLU attorneys' fees in the case.  </P></p>

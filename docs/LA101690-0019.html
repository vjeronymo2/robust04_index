			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW RISES 18.32 AFTER SEE-SAW DAY OF TRADING  </P> <P> Wall Street stocks closed higher Monday after a roller-coaster session that saw  the Dow Jones industrial index fall by more than 36 points and rise by more  than 37.  </P> <P> Analysts said traders were encouraged by lower oil prices and cheaper gold.  Earlier, the index fell on worries about IBM's earnings.  </P> <P> The Dow climbed 18.32 to 2,416.34, after rising 32.92 on Friday. In the broader  market, advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 802 up, 748 down and 441 unchanged.  Big Board volume totaled 164.98 million shares, down from Friday's 187.94  million.  </P> <P> "It's been an extremely volatile day," said Alfred Goldman, technical analyst  at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons. "The conviction both among bulls and bears is so  thin."  </P> <P> Buying was boosted in the afternoon by a plunge in oil prices. Short covering  -- by traders who had correctly guessed stocks were headed lower recently --  also helped lift prices.  </P> <P> Investors also drew encouragement from President Bush's comment that he was  confident Congress would meet its Oct. 19 deadline for completing a  deficit-cutting budget blueprint.  </P> <P> "That's the type of good news we need to get a better market atmosphere," said  Ron Doran, director of C. L. King &amp; Associates' institutional trading. "But  there's the question of whether we'll get fluff."  </P> <P> In the morning session, stocks skidded when IBM announced that its  third-quarter earnings topped $1 billion, more than a 26% gain from the same  period a year ago.  </P> <P> Traders said the earnings fell within predicted estimates but that analysts  participating in a conference call with the company were concerned about  projected 1991 earnings. IBM ended the day down 1 at 99 1/4.  </P> <P> Among the highlights:  </P> <P> * Consumer products firms were among the day's better performers, as investors  continued to favor recession-safe issues. Gillette rose 3 to 55 3/8, General  Mills added 2 5/8 to 83 3/8, Wrigley rose 1 7/8 to 47 1/2, Ralston Purina  climbed 1 7/8 to 101 3/8 and Procter &amp; Gamble closed up 1 5/8 to 76 1/2.  </P> <P> * The market continued to react sharply to earnings disappointments.  Archer-Daniels lost 2 1/8 to 21 1/2. It reported first-quarter profit of 36  cents a share, compared to 40 cents a year ago. On the plus side,  better-than-expected earnings lifted Dover Corp. 2 3/8 to 31, Phelps Dodge 3/4  to 48 3/4, and Magnetek 1/4 to 7 7/8.  </P> <P> * Eastman Kodak jumped 3 1/4 to 37 7/8 on news of a smaller-than-expected  patent infringement award to Polaroid. Prudential-Bache cut its rating on  Polaroid, which plummeted 6 1/2 to 22 3/4, and Shearson Lehman cut its 1991  earnings projection.  </P> <P> * The tech sector was mixed. Compaq added 1 to 37 3/4. The company unveiled a  new notebook personal computer. Elsewhere, Intel rose 1 3/8 to 31 3/8. It  introduced microchips that it said will radically simplify the job of building  lightweight but powerful notebook-sized personal computers. But NCR plunged 3  1/2 to 46 1/2 after saying orders have been disappointing recently, and  Syntellect tumbled 5 to 7 3/4 after reporting weak quarterly earnings.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Lotus Development dropped 1 1/2 to 12 3/4 in anticipation of  third-quarter earnings to be released today.  </P> <P> * Caesars World jumped 1 7/8 to 13 7/8. The casino company declined comment on  the activity.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stocks rose sharply as investors bought up issues seen benefiting  from a stronger yen, as well as the shares of financial companies viewed as  having been oversold during recent market declines. The Nikkei 225-share  average rose 719.04 points, or 3.21%, to close at 23,109.20.  </P> <P> In Frankfurt, Germany, the 30-share DAX index ended 19.19 points higher at  1,478.89.  </P> <P> London shares closed slightly higher but below gains made earlier. The  Financial Times 100-share index closed up 1.5 points at 2,101.9.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT: Bond Prices Rise in Quiet Session  </P> <P> Government bond prices closed slightly higher Monday after a listless session.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in  face amount. Its yield slipped to 8.93% from 8.95% late Friday.  </P> <P> Government bond prices rose slightly when the market opened after rising  overseas, then slipped slightly and remained at virtually the same level the  rest of the day.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8%, up from 7.875% late Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY: Technical Factors Push Dollar Higher  </P> <P> The dollar finished up against most currencies, boosted by technical factors  that analysts predicted would be short-lived.  </P> <P> "The dollar seems more bid than it has in the recent week or two," said Charles  Wheeler of Swiss Volksbank.  </P> <P> Traders said they doubted that the dollar's rise would last due to lingering  worries over the economy and the lack of a concrete agreement to cut the  federal budget deficit.  </P> <P> The dollar closed at 1.526 German marks, up from 1.524 Friday.  </P> <P> However, the dollar fell against the yen across the board. It closed in New  York at 127.73 yen, down from 129.05 Friday. In Tokyo, it fell to a closing  128.83 yen from 129.98 yen Friday. Later, in London, it fell to 128.05 yen.  </P> <P> "Most of the activity was in cross trading with movement out of high-yielding  currencies . . . and movement mostly into yen," said Ronald Holzer, chief  dealer with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES: Oil Prices Decline Amid Profit Taking  </P> <P> Crude oil prices fell sharply as traders took profits amid the stand-off in the  Persian Gulf. Gasoline and heating oil also posted big losses.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, oil futures fell; near-term orange juice rebounded;  grains and soybeans were lower, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Monday's lower oil prices also were linked to expectations that U.S.  consumption of crude oil has begun to weaken on a seasonal basis as refineries  retool to produce more heating oil and less gasoline, said Peter Beutel, energy  analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group of Hoboken, N.J.  </P> <P> Light sweet crude oil futures settled 57 cents to $1.74 lower on the New York  Mercantile Exchange, with November at $37.95 a barrel, down $1.74; heating oil  was 2.17 to 3.29 cents lower, with November at $1.0207 a gallon, and unleaded  gasoline was 1.55 to 2.7 cents lower, with November at 94.95 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> Frozen concentrated orange juice for November delivery rose 4.5 cents to  $1.1795 a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange, rebounding from a loss of  16.45 cents Friday. All other orange juice contracts fell their permitted daily  limit of 5 cents, though, in a continued reaction to a government report that  predicted a bumper Florida orange crop.  </P> <P> Harvest pressure helped push most grain and soybean futures prices lower Monday  on the Chicago Board of Trade.  </P> <P> Analysts said dry weekend weather in the Midwest allowed farmers to get back  into their fields to resume the soybean and corn harvest, which was stalled by  heavy rains early last week.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE READER JUST SICK ABOUT LOSING BRICK  </P> <P> I am incensed, outraged, curious and baffled at the firing by Channel 13 of  sports announcer Vic (the Brick) Jacobs.  </P> <P> In a business where bland, run-of-the-mill, cast-from-the-same-mold sports  announcers abound, Vic is like a breath of fresh air. He may be a brash,  tell-it-like-it-is ex-New Yorker, but as far as my friends and I are concerned,  he was the reason we tuned in to the 10 p.m. news.  </P> <P> KIIS is not getting a former TV personality, but rather a sports announcer with  loads of personality.  </P> <P> JOAN THOMPSON  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

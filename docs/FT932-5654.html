			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Apple's claim on program copyright dismissed APPLE Computer's Dollars 5.5bn copyright infringement suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard was dismissed by a federal judge in San Francisco yesterday. The case was the biggest copyright infringement claim in the history of the computer industry. Apple agreed not to contest a motion for dismissal of the case filed by Microsoft and HP. However, Apple said that it now intends to take the case to the appeals court. In its suit, filed five years ago, Apple charged that Microsoft's 'Windows' program, which has since become a top seller used on millions of personal computers, infringes copyrights on Apple's Macintosh programs. Apple also charged that an HP program, 'New Wave,' infringes Macintosh copyrights. The case has been closely watched because the outcome could have a broad impact in the computer industry, limiting the publication of 'look-alike' programs and programs that incorporate features of existing products. The case was also seen as a threat to the development of easy-to-use graphical interface programs for IBM-compatible PCs. However, in a series of interim rulings the court rejected most of Apple's claims. In particular, the judge dismissed Apple Computer's contention that the overall 'look and feel' of computer displays should be considered in determining whether its copyrights were infringed. Instead, Judge Vaughn Walker compared specific elements of the displays and ruled that most were not original to Apple or were covered by a prior licensing agreement between Apple and Microsoft. Only a handful of display elements remained in dispute prior to yesterday's ruling. Apple said that it chose not to contest the Microsoft, HP motion for dismissal of the case 'in the interests of judicial economy'. Rather than go to trial on the few remaining issues in the case, Apple plans to reopen the case in the appeals court. Microsoft said, however, that having won the case in the trail court it would 'vigorously defend this result through any appeal'.</p>

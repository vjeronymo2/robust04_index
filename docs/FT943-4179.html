			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Shares and bonds slide after US price surge: Renewed fears of rate rise - Dollar and pound weaken against D-Mark Bond and stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic tumbled yesterday after the US government released data showing an unexpectedly sharp increase in wholesale prices during August. The figures suggest that inflationary pressure may be building up in the US economy and revived fears among investors and traders that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again soon to slow the pace of economic growth and curb inflation. The Fed last raised interest rates on August 16, the fifth tightening of US monetary policy since February. At the time, Wall Street analysts hoped it would be the last rate increase until at least November. Yesterday's data on wholesale prices, however, may persuade the Fed that it has not yet done enough to fight off inflation. The US government figures showed the largest single monthly increase in wholesale prices for nearly four years. The Labour Department said that the producer price index in August had risen by 0.6 per cent from July, the biggest jump since the 1.1 per cent increase of October 1990. The advance, in excess of market expectations, comes on top of a 0.5 per cent rise in July compared with June, when no increase was recorded. In the first eight months of this year, wholesale prices have gone up at an annual rate of 2.9 per cent. The selling on financial markets yesterday was widespread. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 33.65 at 3,874.81, and bond prices dropped steeply. The fall in bonds pushed the long bond yield, the most widely followed measure of long-term interest rates, up to 7.7 per cent - its highest level since July. The sell-off on Wall Street spread to Europe, where early gains quickly turned into losses as traders scrambled to unload the more hopeful positions they had taken earlier in the day. In London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading stocks closed down 40.7 at 3,139.30, and in Frankfurt the Dax index ended 22.52 lower at 2,155.58. The Paris CAC-40 dropped 2.2 per cent from its day's peak and 34.57 points on day, to 1,948.83. The US data also sent European government bonds tumbling as the prospect of another rise in US rates dashed any lingering hopes of further monetary easing in Europe. 'It is another nail in the coffin of those who believed that further cuts in Europe were likely,' said one bond salesman. A further worry was that the price fall was accompanied by some relatively heavy selling of cash positions, suggesting that fund managers were growing tired of waiting for a recovery in bond prices. UK gilts fell by 2 points at one stage, sending the yield on 10-year paper up by 26 basis points to 8.82 per cent, the highest since June. German government bonds were also weak, pushing 10-year yields back above 7 1/2 per cent. The big losses on Wall Street prompted a fall in the dollar, with traders fearing that the poor performance of US stocks and bonds would continue to depress an already weak US currency. The dollar was trading at DM1.5375 in the New York last night, down from a high before the figures of DM1.5620. It was also lower against the yen. The weaker dollar helped sterling, which firmed to Dollars 1.55, from Dollars 1.54 before the release of the price figures, but the pound fell two pfennings against the stronger D-Mark, to DM2.3850, from DM2.4050.

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Money Markets: High Lombard lending CONDITIONS in the German cash market remained extremely tight yesterday as banks continued to borrow through the very expensive Lombard facility to meet end-of-month requirements, writes James Blitz. The problems encountered in last week's very illiquid market continued to haunt dealers. There had been very little borrowing in last Wednesday's regular money market oper-ations on the assumption that official rates would come down. When rates stayed unchanged on Thursday, dealers found themselves short at a time when they needed to have books balanced to meet end-of-month requirements. Some DM6.3bn was therefore borrowed at the rate of 7.75 per cent on Monday, and heavy Lombard borrowing was reported yesterday. Call money was traded at a very wide spread of 7.25 per cent to 7.75 per cent. Three-month money remained at 6.55 per cent. The Bundesbank announced a repo rate for today's weekly operations at 6.80 per cent for maturities of 14 days. This was no surprise to a market which has become increasingly scep-tical about the possibility of German rate cuts being made in the next four weeks. September Euromark futures declined 3 basis points to close at 93.43, coming more and more into line with the cash level. There is similar downward pressure on the front-month French franc contracts. Yesterday, the September French franc contract fell 6 basis points to finish at 92.86. But at this level it is pricing three-month cash in two weeks' time at 7.14 per cent, some 35 basis points below yesterday's cash level. Dealers are pricing in more reductions in French rates. One dealer wondered how likely further easing was, with the French franc at the comparatively strong FFr3.49 to the D-Mark, and with a pronounced downside. Conditions in the sterling market were extremely tight yesterday, with a Pounds 2.15bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England and no takers in the early round of trading. The overnight rate conse-quently came near to the 8 per cent level, and three-month money nudged up to 5 29/32 per cent, having been at 5 7/8 per cent at the end of last week. The September short sterling contract weakened 4 basis points to 94.11. The December contract was also down 4 points, finishing at 94.56.</p>

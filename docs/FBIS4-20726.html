			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mustafa al-Basyuni: "Profiting From Science and </F> Technology"]    [Text] National industry needs more effort and input. It is  waiting for factories to be modernized and developed and for an  improvement in the quality of production in order to confront  foreign competition that has surpassed anything ever imagined.    Made in Egypt cannot remain a slogan without work  to protect it--work in which all efforts and skills join in a  concern for overall quality levels, technological development,  and greater linkage between centers of scientific research and  the various means of production.    We must learn from foreign expertise and modern designs. The  Egyptian work force must be trained in the most modern packing  and preserving methods that science has developed so that we can  break into the world's markets and compete at home.    We should be interested in good marketing, which has become  an independent science in most of the world's countries; yet we  still neglect it, despite the importance of this aspect of  selling products.    There must be skilled and honest oversight to prevent  adventurers from playing with the reputation of Egyptian  production. Tariffs should be increased on fully manufactured  goods that have a counterpart in Egypt. Tax exemptions for  investors should be bolstered.    Engineer Fu'ad Abu-Zaghlah, chairman of the committee on  energy and industry at the National [Democratic] Party's [NDP]  general secretariat, spoke first. He said that the trade  liberalization that most countries of the world have pursued has  caused a kind of intense competition to improve production  quality. It has increased the responsibility of private and  joint-sector factories and of the business sector to take an  interest in quality levels and reduced costs. This requires that  management leaders with open minds be chosen who consider all  ways to implement a system of overall quality.    He declared that the coming period will require increased  interest in technological development and greater linkage  between scientific research centers and the various means of  production in order to avoid traditionalism and bring about  modernization and improved quality in various manufactured goods.    Employees in the bodies that oversee industries must be  chosen from those who possess a good technical and ethical level  so that we can guarantee that measures are taken to prevent  illegitimate marketing methods, such as flooding the market or  using devious means to smuggle goods that do not conform to  specifications.  <H5>  Smuggling </H5>   Abu-al-Sa'ud Sultan, head of the exporters' section, pointed  out that Egyptian industry needs protection from dumping, the  smuggling game, and false invoices that are presented to  customs. Oversight bodies of ability and honesty must be  established, because total freedom without order and discipline  and without state supervision gives an opportunity to  speculators, swindlers, and adventurers at the expense of  serious investors and producers.    He stressed the need to treat Egyptian production as foreign  production is treated in its country. The Egyptian producer must  enjoy the same privileges that the foreign producer enjoys.  There must be concern for industrial oversight and in developing  its role, so as to maintain the level of the Egyptian product.  Duties should be increased on fully manufactured goods that have  a local counterpart, tax exemptions for investors should be  increased, and the banks should give more low-interest loans for  infrastructure development.    He added that Egyptian factories must be refurbished and  modernized, with the banks participating by means of  low-interest loans. The latest methods of modern technology  should be adopted, and personnel and specialists should be  trained in these methods.  <H5>  Two Lines of Protection </H5>   Engineer Hasan 'Aqil, director of the factories section of  the National Plastic Company, said that the protection of  Egyptian industry should proceed along two lines.    First, customs should be raised on imported products that  have a good local counterpart. Opening the door completely will  tend to injure many manufacturing projects that have begun to  export their product, thus threatening to halt these projects,  particularly textiles, plastics, and chemical industries. The  technological level of local factories is still modest compared  to world factories, and this will affect the quality and  competitiveness of the Egyptian product.    The second line is to modernize Egyptian factories so as to  raise quality and lower costs. In this way the Egyptian consumer  will be given an opportunity to prefer Egyptian products.    'Abbudah 'Azzam, a textile factory owner from Shubra  al-Khaymah, believes that the problem of Egyptian production  lies in low customs duties on foreign products, high taxes on  Egyptian factories, and the haphazard judgment of officials.  These things tend to impede production and hinder its  development.    He stated that the smuggling of foreign products is another  challenge now facing Egyptian industry. The competition is  unequal: these countries are known to be countries with enormous  production, and as the volume of production increases, the cost  per unit decreases.    Also, the governments of these countries subsidize their  industries so that they can invade foreign markets. These are  things we must take into account.    Hisham Hajjaj, a businessman, said that some Egyptian  products are superior to imports, but they lack packaging and  advertising. Egyptian producers should take an interest in these  aspects to assure international competitiveness.    He indicated that Egyptian production now faces many  difficulties, especially taxes, marketing, and bureaucratic  obstacles when the time to export comes.    Dr. Fawzi Babawi, a member of the NDP's economic committee,  thinks that Egyptian industry need not fear international  competition. On the contrary, such competition might help it  develop itself and prove its quality, provided that the  competition is honest--meaning that the importation of good  products of confirmed origin should be allowed, while products  of unknown origin should not be allowed.    He stressed the need to benefit from foreign expertise and  modern designs. Egyptian personnel must be trained in the most  modern packing, preserving, and advertising methods that science  has developed.    He indicated that confronting foreign industries must  concentrate on modernizing factories and supporting investments  earmarked for that purpose. Part of the participation in  development should be offered to employees, so that one does not  rely completely on loans.    He pointed to the pharmaceutical industry's success in  providing 95 percent of Egypt's medicine needs at prices lower  than similar foreign-produced drugs.    Fahmi al-Suwaydi, an exporter, called for establishing  regular maritime lines with some of the markets that absorb  Egyptian exports, such as the African and Arab market. Loading  and freight charges on ships should be reduced, so that more  Egyptian products will be exported to these countries.</p>

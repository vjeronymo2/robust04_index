			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Zagorodnyaya: "Immunity to Political </F> Events in Russia Increases: Russia in the World Markets"]    [Text] The meeting of the world's leading producers  of aluminum, which begins in Brussels today and where the volume  of Russian exports of this metal to Europe will be discussed, as  well as Yegor Gaydar's resignation, which he announced last  weekend, have presented us with a pretext for analyzing the  influence of political and economic happenings in Russia on the  results of trading at world exchanges last year. Having  evaluated the degree of such impact, KOMMERSANT experts came to  the conclusion that the state of the world market is becoming  decreasingly sensitive to political events in Russia, while  attention to economic news from Russia is on the rise. On the  basis of this, one may assume that Russia's position at the  Brussels meeting will become a major factor to influence the  state of the market in aluminum. As to a possible reshuffling in  the Russian Government, most likely they will not cause  considerable fluctuations in the rates of foreign currencies,  financial instruments, and commodity futures prices.    The idea of interdependence between economic and political  events in Russia and the state of the world markets is not new;  actually, the history of the past two years presents prominent  examples of this two-pronged impact. While keeping in mind that  Russian reforms in many respects depend on the world state of  the market, let us look at the opposite correlation: how events  in Russia influenced the world markets in 1993. I will take the  liberty of suggesting that looking at the still-recent past is  quite useful for determining the attitude toward events in which  the current week and the entire of 1994 will be rich. Having  evaluated the degree of impact that the events in Russia had on  the state of leading international exchanges in 1993 and  compared it to the analogous results of the preceding year, we  may draw the conclusion that by now world trade has developed  sort of an immunity to political news from Russia. At the same  time, reports of a purely economic nature attract great  attention among the traders. Hence, one may forecast a lack of  reaction on the part of the world markets to Gaydar's latest  statement and at the same time the significance of Russia's  position at the Brussels meeting that begins today for future  development of the price situation in the world market of  aluminum.    The most noticeable reaction of the world market  to the political events in Russia was registered after Boris  Yeltsin's television address to the Russian people on 20 March.  Let us remind our readers that on that day the president of  Russia announced that he had signed a number of edicts, among  them "On Special Rule Until the Resolution of the Crisis of  Authority," which envisaged holding on 25 April a vote of  confidence in the president and the government. On 22 March, the  indices of leading European stock exchanges dropped, gold prices  went up sharply, and the dollar rose in relation to the German  mark. For instance, at the close of trading at the Frankfurt  Stock Exchange stock prices collapsed: In one day of trading,  the exchange's index dropped by almost 3 percent, the  explanation for which, in the opinion of local analysts, was  close economic ties between Germany and Russia. Higher gold  prices were registered on that day at all exchanges trading in  this metal, without exception, and it caused a chain reaction of  rising prices for the entire group of precious metals: silver,  platinum, and palladium. At the London Metals Exchange, nickel  and aluminum prices went up, since British traders were certain  that deliveries of these metals from Russia would not proceed on  schedule. As to oil traders, they were the first to manifest the  signs of immunity to Russian political events as early as in the  beginning of 1993. Therefore, in March, when all exchange  dealers in the world were playing almost solely under the  influence of forecasts of the political future of Russia, oil  traders raised the raw material prices only slightly (by 10  cents--to $18.78 per barrel of brent-blend) and later very  quickly adjusted prices down.    Later on, a very interesting trend began to manifest itself  in the world markets: The significance of Russian events for  Russia itself kept increasing, while the intensity of reaction  to them in the world markets was waning. Some very interesting  statements could be heard at international oil exchanges at the  beginning of October. The dissolution of the Russian parliament  and the siege of the White House elicited these comments from  oil traders: "After all, the parliament is not engaged in oil  exports, and therefore there is no need to anticipate a rise."  By the way, oil prices did rise a little earlier--not as a  result of political news, but because rumors circulated in the  markets that the volume of shipping of Russian oil from  Novorossiysk had dropped.    An almost complete absence of reaction in the  world markets to the preliminary results of the 12 December  elections leads to an assumption that international financial  life has adapted itself completely to the so-called Russian  factor. On the other hand, the waning interest in Russian  political cataclysms is accompanied by intensified attention to  economic factors, especially changes in real volumes of raw  material exports, which at this point remain the main source of  Russia's foreign currency income. Such attitudes apparently will  persist in the coming year, which should be taken into account  by those Russian entrepreneurial structures that play in  international financial and commodity markets.

It corresponds to  one percentage point of change in the currency exchange rate,  commodity prices, or a stock exchange index as compared to the  corresponding average level over the week preceding the event.  Among items factored into the calculation were fluctuations of  the dollar rate in relation to the German mark and Japanese yen,  stock exchange indices in London, Frankfurt, Paris, New York,  Sydney, and Tokyo, and commodity quotations in contracts for  gold, platinum, palladium, oil, aluminum, and nickel.</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (3): Coaxing the wary investor - ANC Economic Policy THE African National Congress aims to guarantee every one of South Africa's 37m people the right to decent housing, education, health care and a job. Indeed, it plans to enshrine these Utopian rights in a new constitution. Over the past year, however, the magnitude of this task has begun to tame the rhetoric and temper the fury of even the most radical ANC economist. After years of exile in under-developed countries in Africa or the Eastern bloc, many have had their first sustained exposure to a first world economy since returning to South Africa; they have spent the past year testing ideology against the realities of high population growth and low productivity, skills shortages and poor education. All agree more work needs to be done before the ANC can finalise economic policy. Government officials welcome this flexibility, while most businessmen believe the ANC will come round to capitalism in the end - or if not, that it will lack the political power to enforce an alternative. Taking a snapshot of ANC economic policy is difficult: policy formulation has been farmed out to several dozen economists, based at universities throughout the country as well as at the ANC Department of Economic Policy in Johannesburg. The vast majority are academics; few have business experience. Mr Tito Mboweni, deputy head of the Economics Department, acts as spokesman: 'Whatever economic regeneration takes place, it must be in the context of a totally reorganised South African society, total reorganised,' he says. He is not unaware that talk of 'total reorganisation' will strike fear in the businessman's heart; but his vision turns out to be less than radical: 'A totally reorganised society must focus on asset ownership, education, skills training, research and development, special employment programmes, perhaps, to absorb some of the 5m-plus unemployed.' South Africa must no longer rely on primary commodity production; its industry must add value to the country's natural resources through greater beneficiation. Apart from the focus on asset ownership, there is little in this to shock Pretoria, which preaches similar values. Reorganisation will also include 'deconglomeratisation': reducing the extreme centralisation of economic power in few corporate hands. 'Basically, they (the top four conglomerates) are far too powerful,' says Mr Mboweni. But he points out: 'That's a political, not an economic point.' He adds: 'There's no certainty that an anti-conglomerate policy will lead to greater efficiency.' Mr Mboweni gestures at the tangle of Anglo American Corporation cross-holdings, set out in a chart on his wall, and speaks of adopting an aggressive anti-trust policy to promote competition. Only months ago, he would point to the same chart with visceral dislike, and propose a massive programme of forced disinvestment. Now he comments: 'The process of democratising the economy will be complex,' and adds: 'It's clear you need large companies to compete internationally.' He concludes: 'We're concerned that whatever policy we adopt should not destroy the productive capacity of the private sector.' These moderate comments give business little cause for alarm; but until firm policies are adopted on issues such as nationalisation, investors will remain wary. Certainly, the ANC's draft investment code will do little to entice them: it sets out a catalogue of demands foreign investors must satisfy, including forced reinvestment of profits and obligatory affirmative action, yet offers only vague reassurances on expropriation and repatriation of profits. The ANC says it is committed to a mixed economy, but the nature of the mix remains unclear. Mr Mboweni, in a recent paper in which he declares himself in favour of a Swedish-style social democratic economy, asserts: 'It will be unavoidable in South Africa . . . that a future state will own and control a significant percentage of productive resources.' He argues for redistribution of income, of educational opportunities, infrastructural spending, 'power relations on the shop floor', land and economic resources. But if there are social democrats in the ANC, there are also leading members of the South African Communist Party, who argue that a period of 'economic dislocation' will be inevitable to eradicate the gross inequalities of South African society. Nobody can yet be sure whose vision of the economic 'mix' will dominate; ANC economic policy remains in the balance.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Account closes with further setback WEAKNESS overnight in Tokyo and New York added to the misery of the UK stock market which suffered further losses yesterday and barely managed to hold on to the FT-SE 2,350 mark as the equity trading account came to its close. For most of the session, London shared the general misfortune of the other European bourses, but rallied after Wall Street came in with an early gain of 17 points on the Dow Average. Footsie 2,350 is an important testing level for the stock market; it was first achieved in February 1991 and if it is lost, the charts show little support above the 2,150 mark. The warning was conveyed to traders at morning meetings of the leading securities firms and thence to institutional clients. At Strauss Turnbull, for good measure, Mr Ian Harnett said that the firm was cutting its year-end forecast on the Footsie to 2,650, on the view that its previous, more bullish forecast, now required too many positive developments. Share prices opened lower against the backcloth of a 408.17 drop in the Nikkei and 24.6 fall in the Dow Averages overnight, but then turned significantly lower as the Footsie 2,350 mark came into play. With this benchmark level soon lost, the market fell into gloom and there was little further move until Wall Street came to the rescue with a gain of 17 Dow points in London hours. The UK market rallied thankfully from the day's low of 2,344.9 to close at 2,350.1 for a net loss of 27.5 on the day. The trading account which ended last night has seen the Footsie shed just over 1 per cent, with most of the fall suffered this week as the cut in BP's quarterly dividend and the heavy loan loss charges at Barclays Bank have shaken the confidence of investors. Trading volume has remained moderate, although Thursday's equity retail total increased to Pounds 1bn. Yesterday's Seaq volume of 480.3m shares was above recent totals but the figure includes intra-market business. BP continued to fall and gloom over the economy and UK interest rates brought further losses among store, building and construction issues. However, Unilever stood out well after disclosing quarterly trading results and ICI, Grand Metropolitan and Rank Organisation were also firm. Sharelink, Britain's largest execution-only stockbroker, commented yesterday that private investors were, on balance, buyers of equities. Retail volume has continued to disappoint, as investors shy away from the flow of unsettling trading reports from leading companies.</p>

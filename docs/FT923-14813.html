			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / An icy wind chills accountants' offices: How UK firms are facing the impact of recession After more than a decade of rapid growth, Britain's accountancy firms - from the largest downwards - are having to face up to the realities of recession, from which they were for so long shielded by their clients. With two mergers announced within the last month, attention is increasingly focusing on whether the existing number of medium-sized firms is sustainable. Their larger competitors are equally under pressure. The figures in the recently published Financial Times top 25 accountancy firms table tell a clear story. The rapid expansion of the last decade has evaporated. The fee income growth of most firms has struggled to keep pace with inflation this year, while only four managed to achieve growth above 10 per cent. Four reported a drop in fee income. That included Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's biggest and one of its most aggressive practices, which fell by 0.52 per cent to Pounds 577m. The figures reflect a year of painful change for the firm. Mr Brandon Gough, Coopers' senior partner, is telling his colleagues that - with profits down, 20 fewer partners than the 735 of a year ago, and professional staff 15 per cent down - there is further cost-cutting to come. 'We were a little bit slow to face up to the realisation that the business had to shrink,' says Mr Gough. 'We were hoping 12 months ago that the recession would end. We saddled ourselves with a higher cost base than necessary.' The recession could not have hit accountants at a worse time. Just when costs and expansion plans were running at peak levels, demand for business shrivelled. In the past decade, the firms had become huge businesses. Total fee income from the largest firm in 1984 was just Pounds 74m, and from the top 21 firms only Pounds 738m. This year the top 21 firms generated Pounds 3.3bn in fees. Practices have gone through a phase of mergers: Coopers with Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Whinney with Arthur Young, Peat Marwick with Thomson McLintock. This saddled firms with extra costs including superfluous staff, redundant buildings and duplicative systems. Suddenly, the impact of the economic downturn hit. Corporate finance work dried up with the dearth of merger and acquisition activity. Companies cut consultancy budgets, and began tendering for contracts more frequently. The accountancy firms intensified competition against one another in a scramble to maintain clients. At the same time, with unemployment in the financial service sector rising, fewer employees were willing to leave voluntarily. Staff turnover dropped sharply as a result, leaving many department managers with the double worry of excessive head-counts on top of shrinking demand. Equally, partners have faced demoralising questions over their competence as auditors in the wake of a series of high-profile corporate collapses. Attention has turned more than ever to the threat of legal action against auditors - and its reflection in rising professional indemnity insurance premiums. Cost-cutting has become a way of life at many of the big firms. In the secretive world of the partnerships, none will reveal much about either costs or profits. But Price Waterhouse said earlier this month that it had reduced its cost base by nearly Pounds 30m last year. In the same period, KPMG Peat Marwick closed six of its 53 regional offices. 'We are much more aware of costs than we used to be,' says Mr Jim Butler, Peat's senior partner. In such a people-heavy business, the principal means of cost-cutting is through job losses. Nearly every firm has had to reduce its workforce, first by natural wastage but increasingly by redundancy. Although technically partners can only be dismissed on a full vote of their peers, many have been 'encouraged' to retire early or leave because their aims and those of the firm are no longer compatible. The process has caused no little bitterness. Mr Gough says: 'There has been great sadness at some of the mechanisms required. Redundancy is something very foreign to all of us. It is a step I regret but it has been necessary. We have moved away from the certainty of extended employment.' He believes that the next 12 months will remain very uncertain for the firms, and expects to continue 'pruning back' costs. But he also points out that partnerships are fragile structures that depend on team-work, which is very difficult to maintain under the shadow of job losses. Conventional wisdom has it that only the counter-cyclical rise in insolvency income in the last year has saved the firms from a far worse fate, as their specialist arms have expanded to take on a large number of receiverships, administrations and financial restructurings. In fact, while insolvency-related income in most large firms has grown sharply, even this year it contributed a small proportion of total revenues. The picture of decline has to be put in perspective. Average growth in the top 20 firms was 13.83 per cent last year. This year it is still 4.62 per cent. Hasty expansion has been replaced by more measured increases. And at Arthur Andersen, revenues rose 23 per cent last year - a figure which, says Mr Roy Chapman, senior partner, 'surprised us a little bit'. He has managed to increase staffing, not least aided by a very strong computer consulting arm. Overall, the larger accountancy firms have been expanding market share. The top six firms grew by an average of 8.37 per cent this year, and received 75.7 per cent of the income going to the top 25, against 74.4 per cent last year and just 51 per cent in 1978. The figures drop consistently, so that the seven smallest of the top 25 grew by just 0.43 per cent, and had 2.7 per cent of the market, down from 2.9 per cent in 1991. This suggests that some of the smaller practices may not be able to survive independently for much longer - a point perhaps heralded in the merger of Stoy Hayward and Finnie last week. For most firms, the talk now is of quality, professionalism and attention to clients. Like the companies they serve, they are concentrating on providing core services. After a decade of acceleration, they are changing gear. As Mr Butler says: 'I think the double-digit growth of the late 1980s is a thing of the past.'</p>

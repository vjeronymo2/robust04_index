			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONDOS BURN IN DRUG FACTORY EXPLOSION;  </P> <P> 10 IN SYLMAR LEFT HOMELESS AFTER FIRE CAUSES $250,000 IN DAMAGE  </P> <P> A Sylmar condominium being used as a clandestine drug laboratory exploded and  caught fire Friday, leaving 10 people homeless, authorities said.  </P> <P> The explosion occurred shortly after 6 a.m. in the 12600 block of Ralston  Avenue, Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said.  </P> <P> It was ignited by an electric heater being used to dry reconstituted cocaine in  a walk-in closet, Los Angeles Police Detective Bill Felix said. As the drugs  were drying, they emitted fumes from acetone, a flammable chemical used in the  process of diluting cocaine, he said.  </P> <P> "It must have been a heck of an explosion," Police Lt. Gary Rogness said. "The  whole face of the top part of the condo is blown out." No one was hurt, and  authorities do not think anyone was home at the time. A suspect is being  sought.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 16 Pounds of Cocaine Found  </P> <P> Investigators found 16 pounds of cocaine in the damaged condominium, where  evidence was found indicating that at least 400 pounds more had recently been  moved or sold, Felix said.  </P> <P> Friday's explosion was on the second floor of the condominium, he said.  Substantial amounts of acetone were found on the first floor and in the garage.  If the explosion had ignited all of the acetone, deaths and serious injuries  could have resulted in the 25- to 30-unit complex, he said.  </P> <P> The street value of the cocaine found in the condominium was estimated at more  than $1.5 million, and the entire lab "was a multimillion-dollar operation,"  Felix said.  </P> <P> The fire caused about $250,000 in damage to the complex, destroying the unit  where the lab was and slightly damaging another, Wells said. Firefighters  extinguished the blaze in about 15 minutes, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lidiya Kostrova, chairman of the Board of </F> Radiotekhbank for the city of Nizhniy Novgorod by Vladimir  Noskov, RT correspondent: "Intelligent Bank Transactions. The  Nizhegorod Way"]    [Text] Lidiya Kostrova is a professional banker. She  is married and has a school-age daughter. Since 1990 she has  been the chairman of the Board of Radiotekhbank for the city of  Nizhniy Novgorod. Vladimir Noskov, our correspondent, interviews  her.    [Noskov] Lidiya Aleksandrovna, there are almost three dozen  commercial banks in operation in Nizhniy Novgorod today. Tell us  please, in what way does Radiotekhbank differ from all the rest?    [Kostrova] It certainly is different. After all, as far back  as its creation in 1990, we set ourselves this task: our bank  should engage primarily in extending credit to industrial  enterprises. As we know, territorially we are in the Oka region,  and it is here that the so-called "defense factories" are  located. Just imagine the position these industrial enterprises  would be in if it were not for our bank.    The point is, the investments in all the enterprises of the  defense complex used to come totally from the state treasury.  Now their products are of no use to anyone. More precisely,  quite a few customers could be found, I am sure of it. But  foreign ones. Our state has begun to consume less of the output  of the military plants, but they are not permitted to trade in  them directly. As a result, the "defense factories" have found  themselves in genuine time-trouble.    There are quite a few of these plants in Russia today, and  they have either totally shut down or are operating on a reduced  schedule. There is not a single enterprise in our region which,  as it were, has stood or been on the brink of closing, because  the enterprise comes to our bank at a time of crisis and obtains  preferential credit.    [Noskov] If it is not a trade secret, tell us the interest  rate at which you give money?    [Kostrova] It is not a secret. We issue credit at 30 percent  annually. I am sure that not a single bank, not only in our  city, but in all of Russia, has a rate like this. Just bear in  mind that we offer preferential credit to enterprises and  organizations which are the founders of our bank. There are  about 200 of them today.    [Noskov] Pardon me, but I must ask you: then how does your  bank survive? After all, if you give credit at such low  interest, this means that the bank has no revenue at all?    [Kostrova] On the contrary, our bank is one of the thriving  ones in the city. The expert evaluation of the workers in the  Central Bank of Russia attests to this.    The revenue is not, however, formed only from receiving  interest on the credit extended to enterprises and  organizations. After all, our bank also engages in other types  of activity. For example, it attracts the funds of legal and  physical persons into deposits, conducts an accounting service  for its customers, transfers money for very short terms,  performs legal and economic consultation, etc. And, of course,  we render various services to the people of our city. We have  also begun to do this through our branches in Kirzhach, Arzamas  and Valakhna.    [Noskov] Does this mean that your borrowers may be not only  enterprises, but also ordinary citizens?    [Kostrova] Unfortunately, it is not quite this way. There  are, of course, so-called financial persons among our founders.  They account for less than five percent of the bank's charter  capital, however.    The main shareholders, though, are the enterprises of the  defense complex, which play a leading role in the economics, not  only of the Volga-Vyatsk region, but also on a Russia-wide  scale. The conversion measures being carried out by these  enterprises and the cutback in state orders make additional  investments necessary. These enterprises, having found  themselves without the support of the departments and the  government, and having worked out unique programs for conversion  and business plans, are experiencing a sharp lack of internal  funds to carry them out. The main direction, therefore, was and  remains extending credit to the conversion programs which, as a  rule, require long-term investments.    By decision of the bank's board, a so-called credit line was  opened for these enterprises. The Nizhegorod Television Plant  was the first to make use of this. Having obtained credit from  us, it efficiently put money into re-equipping its production  facility. In a very short time it began to produce fourth  generation color television sets of the Chayka brand, sound  recording video players, woodworking machine tools, tea and  coffee pots and telephone equipment.    The bank makes credit investments calculated to bring a  rapid  return, not only when fulfilling conversion programs. Last year,  for example, we gave loans to other vitally important sectors of  the national economy, which are, under the conditions of the  radical transformations taking place in the country's economy,  experiencing a serious financial crisis. These are enterprises  in procuring and processing agricultural products, kolkhozes and  the pharmaceutical industry.    [Noskov] Under the conditions of the industrial enterprises'  lack of money, however, is there not a danger that the bank will  not recover the credit issued in the period established?    [Kostrova] Unfortunately, this danger is becoming a reality.  The production slump in industry increases daily. This situation  is very alarming. After all, how could we not sympathize with  the industrial workers, when for us the interests of all the  bank founders are of paramount importance. They must hope that  the bank workers, its specialists, will not permit our other  clients to suffer because of the insolvency of one of the  borrowers.    On the basis of these considerations, and in view of the  fact  that the process of privatizing securities is being developed,  the bank's potentials for ensuring the repayment of the loans  are expanding. We have begun to introduce various types of bank  credit into our practical work: promissory notes, overdrafts,  credit for a current account, etc.    [Noskov] What services do you render rank-and-file citizens?    [Kostrova] Just like other commercial banks, we are working  with the investments of the people. In addition, we are dealers  for many investment funds, the shares of which any person may  acquire from us, with no problems. Incidentally, before 1 June,  vouchers can be exchanged for them at our bank.</p>

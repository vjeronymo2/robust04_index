			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Japanese emergency economic package could be worth Y14,000bn THE emergency economic package which Japan's government is drawing up to stimulate the flagging economy could be worth Y14,000bn (Pounds 81bn), Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the senior politician in charge of co-ordinating the plans, said on television at the weekend, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. Details of the package are to be decided in the next three weeks before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, visits Washington for talks in mid-April. They are still to be debated, but are likely to include tax cuts for housing and investment in small businesses, a public works programme which could be worth more than Y8,000bn, and a special investment programme to develop the country's telecommunications infrastructure. A package worth Y14,000bn would be by far the largest ever introduced by the Japanese government. Its scale is a mark of the political pressure the government is under, domestically and internationally, to revive the economy.</p>

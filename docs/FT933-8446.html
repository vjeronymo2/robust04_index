			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / One-day strike at ECGD today CIVIL SERVANTS at the Export Credits Guarantee Department's main office near Tower Bridge in London will stage a one-day strike today in protest at a consultant's report recommending staff reductions. The CPSA, which will be taking action with the NUCPS, the other main Civil Service union, said the Department of Environment still believed there were too many support staff working at the ECGD, which provides export assistance, in spite of staffing cuts already announced.</p>

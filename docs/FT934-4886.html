			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Pomicino admits funding Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino, a former Christian Democrat budget minister and one of the party bosses in Naples, yesterday admitted in a Milan court to receiving L5bn (Pounds 2m) in illicit funds from the Ferruzzi-Montedison group. Mr Pomicino, until recently protected by parliamentary immunity, is the first senior minister to have admitted receiving illicit funds. The admission was part of evidence in the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial consultant close to the Socialist party who is charged with helping the Ferruzzi-Montedison group distribute money to obtain political favours. According to Mr Pomicino, the funds were handed over in the form of treasury bills. These were then cashed by Mr Franco Ambrosio, the Neapolitan businessman who controls Italgrani, the grain group. Mr Pomicino said the funds were used for campaigning; but more than L1bn was passed on to Mr Salvo Lima, the powerful Christian Democrat politician who represented Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former premier, in Sicily. Mr Lima was murdered last year in a Mafia assassination and has since been identified as having Mafia links.</p>

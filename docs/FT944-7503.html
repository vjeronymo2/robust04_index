			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Dow but not out Wall Street has defied gravity all year. Though world bond markets and most other equity markets have tumbled, the Dow had stayed remarkably steady. One could view this week's slide as Wall Street catching up. Compared with bond yields of 8 per cent, the 3 per cent pay-out on shares was looking a bit mean. It also seems reasonable to shade down estimates of corporate earnings growth to take account of the latest rise in short-term interest rates. The growing feeling that a Republican Congress was more of a menace than a boon to industry hardly helped. The knock-on effect on British and other European equities seems less to do with fundamentals than sentiment. True, any slowdown in the US will harm exports and reduce the earnings multinationals receive from their American subsidiaries. But UK equities have already fallen this year. Moreover, the spread between gilts and Treasury bonds has narrowed in recent months. So the ratio between bond and equity yields in Britain is not as stretched as in the US. The same is true in much of the rest of Europe. Perhaps one should not even be too worried about Wall Street. Two promising features this week have been the rally in US bond markets and the firmness of the dollar. If they continue, funds which have been flowing out of US markets all year may start returning. Japanese investors, in particular, may be tempted back into dollar assets. It will not take a very large bond rally for Wall Street to look reasonably priced.</p>

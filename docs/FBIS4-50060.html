			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Xinjiang has entered the  era of mechanical farming, a group of officials from the  Ministry of Agriculture concluded after a recent visit to the  northwest China autonomous region    The officials said the region's level of agricultural  mechanization had reached the year-2000-goal set by the ministry  for the nation's agriculture as a whole.    A report released by the regional agricultural department  says that Xinjiang now has 340,000 tractors and other farm  machines, worth 2.2 billion yuan.    The report says 85 percent of the region's 3.1 million ha of  farmlands is now ploughed by tractors, and 74 percent are sowed  by machines.    Other farm work, such as harvesting, laying plastic sheet,  transportation and preliminary processing of farm products have  also been mechanized to a large extent, the report says.    According to the report, Xinjiang now tops all other Chinese  regions in the mechanization of sowing and plastic-sheet cover  of crops.    The mechanization of farm work has resulted in a great  improvement in productivity. The report says that Xinjiang's  agricultural output value has been increasing at an annual rate  of 6.4 percent over the last 16 years.    With an output of 680,000 tons of cotton, Xinjiang was  China's No. 1 producer of cotton in 1993. It was also a major  producer of oilseeds, sugar crops and fruit.    Meanwhile, the region has developed a wide network of  farm-machine marketing, maintenance, management and other  services, employing a total 230,000 people, says the report.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Schering slides on news of Hoechst group drug Bourses recovered from their early afternoon lows, but this was ascribed to domestic and technical factors, rather than the international influences advanced earlier this week, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT fell further over the official session with the DAX index 39.27 lower at 2,110.70, compared with 2,128.07 at the end of the post bourse on Tuesday. However, the Ibis-indicated DAX recovered in the afternoon to close at 2,126.82. Mr Glen Liddy at Kleinwort Benson said that traders were squaring their positions in the afternoon, after the drop from an intraday peak of 2,187.28 on Monday, and that volume was thin by then. Over the next two days, market professionals will be seeing details of the Gatt deal, Bundesbank decisions on money supply and interest rates today, and triple witching in the futures and options market tomorrow. Yesterday's worst drop among the blue chips looked ahead to Monday. Schering fell another DM63, or 5.9 per cent to DM1,010 after the Hoechst subsidiary, Behringwerke, called a Monday press conference on its multiple sclerosis drug, Deoxyspergualin (DSG). Less than two months ago Schering hit a high of DM1,170 on prospects for its own ms drug, Betaseron. Stock market turnover rose from DM9.2bn to DM9.9bn. The drip, drip of bad news from Daimler-Benz continued with a nine-month group loss of DM2.05bn according to US accounting methods. The shares slid DM17, or 2.3 per cent to DM737.50, Mr Liddy observing that the decision to produce the new 'baby' Mercedes model in Germany, rather than abroad, sat strangely with the group's cost-cutting ambitions. PARIS showed a gentle recovery at the end of a volatile, and busy day, the CAC-40 index closing 6.13 higher at 2,162.63 after a high of 2,180.19 and a lower of 2,137.43. Turnover climbed from FFr4.82bn to an estimated FFr6bn. Canal Plus slid FFr151 to FFr1,109, having been suspended limit-down at one point in the day. James Capel put a sell note out on the pay TV group yesterday after a late Tuesday warning from the company that 1994 earnings could be down by as much as 20 per cent. Canal Plus corporate shareholders include Havas, down FFr19.60 at DM436.20, and Generale des Eaux, FFr21 lower at FFr2,707. There were signs that the late 1993 gamble on cyclicals was being shelved for the time being and that defensive stocks were coming back into the reckoning, L'Oreal rising FFr30 to FFr1,230 and LVMH by FFr43 to FFr3,758. However, Rhone Poulenc and Institut Merieux were hit by delays in their mutual merger plans, falling FFr4.80 to FFr143.70, and FFr205 to FFr2,097. MILAN surged in the last 45 minutes, prompting suggestions of window dressing on the last day of the December account. The Comit index added 3.23 or 0.6 per cent to 595.00, but the late rise was more clearly reflected in a 227 or 2.2 per cent advance to 10,551 in the real-time Mibtel index. Mediobanca, the merchant bank, found strong demand, adding L540 to L14,793. Interest was also high among the telecommunications issues with Stet L88 ahead at L4,169 and Sip L54 firmer at L3,458. Among industrials, Olivetti rose L18 to L1,971 as the post and telecommunications minister, Mr Maurizio Pagani, said that the winner of Italy's second mobile telephone franchise will be chosen by the end of April next year. For the January account, 52 new companies join the automatic trading system, including Pirelli, Calcestruzzi and Alitalia, bringing the total traded on screen to 152. ZURICH continued its consolidation, although low volume tended to exaggerate movements. The SMI index, 1.2 per cent lower at one stage, picked up as investors were attracted back by the lower prices to finish 17.2 or 0.6 per cent easier at 2,850.6. Nestle, the most active issue, shed SFr15 to SFr1,237. SMH, the watchmaker fell SFr14 or 6.2 per cent to SFr209, and bearers in Swiss Re and Winterthur by SFr28 to SFr740, and SFr23 to SFr855. Moving in the opposite direction, BBC added SFr15 to SFr1,028 and Holderbank put on SFr10 to SFr885. MADRID recovered from intraday lows on late futures-related buying, the general index easing 0.15 to 305.07. Banesto dropped Pta45 to Pta2,215, after a low of Pta2,125, after Standard &amp; Poors lowered the banking group's short term rating. Volume was boosted by basket trades to Pta26.6bn. AMSTERDAM recouped ground lost earlier in the day to finish flat. The CBS Tendency index ended unchanged at 139.3, but up from a low of 138.8. OSLO fell 1.1 per cent with investors uncertain about the outlook, partly because the current low prices for Norway's North Sea oil make further interest rate cuts unlikely. The all-share index dropped 6.34 to 568.9 in thin turnover of MKr372m. Norsk Hydro lost NKr4 to NKr204 while Saga Petroleum A shares dipped NKr0.5 to NKr69.5. ISTANBUL rose another 2.4 per cent as demand for privatisation shares continued to lift the market. The composite index added 439.7 to 18,583.2 for a cumulative two day rise of 7.1 per cent.

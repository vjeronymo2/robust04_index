			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Babangida says he offered to quit presidency PRESIDENT Ibrahim Babangida yesterday told Nigeria's National Assembly that he had offered to resign as president and chief of the armed forces, but refused to say whether he actually planned to leave office. His speech, which had been keenly awaited, failed to remove the uncertainty about the country's political future that followed Gen Babangida's decision to annul the June 12 presidential election. Despite hopes that he might use the address to outline his own plans and the government's future, he told Nigerians that they 'should see the present political situation as a temporary problem and rethink our journey so far, and our future'. The president has said he will turn over power to an interim government made up of civilians and soldiers, but has not said whether he will step down on August 27, his long-promised deadline for democracy. Speaking to a joint session of both houses of the National Assembly in Abuja, the president stressed the interim government was not an extension, but a replacement of the military regime. He said he would announce its composition 'in the next few days'. Defending his position, he said that there was no alternative to the choice of a president for Nigeria by democratic election, but the interim government was 'the most feasible' arrangement under the circumstances. The president's address to the National Assembly was the first in eight months. He said he had run the most documented administration in his country's history and would place before Nigerians a full account of his stewardship during the period of the interim government. 'I shall also be prepared and ready at the end of the interim government to pass on my experience in defence and security matters and any information relevant to the state,' he said. The political crisis has raised regional, religious and ethnic tensions in the country, triggering three days of riots that killed more than 100 people in Lagos last month and a general strike last week that shut the city down for three days. Thousands of people have fled to their ethnic homelands in anticipation of widespread civil unrest. Gen Babangida has repeatedly reneged on promises to return the nation to democracy. Nigeria has been ruled by the military for the past decade and all but 10 of its 33 years of independence from Britain. Editorial comment, Page 17</p>

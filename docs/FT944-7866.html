			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Interest rates edge up in Japan The cost of borrowing in Japan has started to rise again after three years of easier monetary conditions. The government's Housing Loan Corporation said yesterday it would raise its mortgage rates by up to 0.25 per cent next month. The decision, which follows recent increases in other public sector loan rates, comes as commercial banks struggle to avoid a rise in lending rates that would further reduce demand for loans. The upward pressure on lending costs stems from the gradual rise in money market interest rates since the summer. Having fallen steadily since late 1991 as the economy plunged into recession, the overnight call rate - the principal very short-term money market figure - touched bottom in July, reaching 2 per cent. Since then it has edged up to nearly 2.3 per cent this week. This rise has been reflected in an increase in bank deposit rates - three-month certificate of deposits have moved in line with the overnight rate. The higher cost of funds has further trimmed banks' razor-thin lending margins - the short-term prime lending rate has been unchanged at 3 per cent for more than a year. The upward drift in banks' borrowing costs has been caused by a shift in sentiment in financial markets that the economic recovery, which has so far been sluggish, is set to strengthen. The Bank of Japan, which has adopted a bullish stance on economic prospects has allowed rates to rise in line with its own expectations of improving growth prospects. As bond prices have fallen in line with global bond markets, long-term lending rates have risen and that has added to the pressure on short-term rates. Banks, however, are caught in a vice between increases in their borrowing costs, and limited demand for lending. They have been reluctant to raise their prime rates in a stagnant loan market.</p>

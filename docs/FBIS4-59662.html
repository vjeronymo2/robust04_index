			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible military source at the Defense  Ministry has stated the following:    With God Almighty's support and guidance to the courageous,  loyal heroes in our valiant Armed Forces, the forces of  protecting unity and Constitutional legitimacy, and with the  willpower of the valiant fighters, units of the Armed Forces  continued to fulfill their combat tasks against the  secessionist, rebellious forces in the Socialist Party  leadership, and those who are following its orders and who lost  their willpower and logic and all sense of responsibility,  inflicting heavy losses on them on all axes and sectors.    On the Shabwah axis, our troops completed the mopping up of  Bayhan district from the elements of secession and apostasy in  cooperation with the honorable citizens of Bayhan district. Our  forces yesterday regained control of Mulhim Brigade with its  heavy and medium weapons, including 22 tanks, five katyusha  BM-21 vehicles, a number of armed crews, and a large quantity of  ammunition. A number of officers, NCO's, and soldiers from the  Mulhim Brigade joined the legitimacy troops, announcing their  adherence to unity, democracy, and Constitutional legitimacy.    On the Abyan axis, our Armed Forces continued their advance  and are now closing on al-'Alam point.    On the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah axis, the 14th Battalion of the  22d  Infantry Brigade, with all its ordnance, joined the forces of  Constitutional legitimacy. All members of the battalion  announced their refusal to fight with the forces of rebellion  and the gang of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party  leadership.    At the same time, the forces of legitimacy continued their  advance toward al-'Anad Base and took control of the area in  which the base is located on the Ta'izz-Aden-al-Dali'  crossroads. They then completed their seige of the base from  all the directions to allow the elements deceived by the gang of  apostasy and secession at the Socialist Party leadership the  opportunity to join the forces of Constitutional legitimacy.    Today, our Air Force pilots carried out their missions in  the  battlefield, achieving the set objectives. All planes returned  safely to base.    Our Armed Forces units continue to receive in succession the  officers, NCO's, and soldiers who are joining the Armed Forces,  the forces for protecting unity and Constitutional legitimacy.  They voiced their rejection of the instructions and hegemony of  the secessionist, rebellious forces and their denunciation of  that gang and its major crimes against the people, the Armed  Forces and security troops. They also expressed their readiness  to sacrifice for the sake or unity and to protect Constitutional  legitimacy and democracy in the country.    Here we underline the dark fate which the secessionist  rebels  must meet thanks to the heroism of the entire Yemeni people,  headed by those who take pride in belonging to the Armed Forces  and security troops, who defend the people and the homeland and  its eternal achievements, and who confront any one who may be  tempted to infringe on them. They are, and will always remain,  the men protecting the lives of all citizens and the homeland's  security and stability and protectors of property, freedoms,  rights, and honor in all governorates and cities.    Those who circulate lies and spread false rumors will only  fail.    In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful: And  soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their  affairs will take. [Koranic verse]</p>

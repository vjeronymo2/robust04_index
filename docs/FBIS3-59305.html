In addition, over one-half of the  residents agreed that the governor should submit his political  reform proposals to the Legislative Council by the middle of  October.    The Hong Kong University Social Sciences Research Center  announced yesterday the results of a public opinion survey it  conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday [28, 29 Sep] this week. The  survey was based on telephone interviews completed with 516  respondents in a random sample, with a completion rate of 53.8  percent.    The survey revealed that three-fourths of the interviewees  agreed the governor should disclose the content of the  Sino-British talks in his legislative proposal, while only  one-tenth disagreed.    One-half of those interviewed agreed that a cutoff date  should be set for the Sino-British talks, while three-tenths  disagreed. Among those who agreed to set a time limit, 34  percent thought the cutoff date should be as early as possible,  20 percent clearly hoped the cutoff date would be before the end  of this year, and 21 percent considered more than one year  should be allowed before ending the talks.    When asked whether they agreed that the governor should  submit his political reform proposals to the Legislative Council  by mid-October, over one-half of the sample agreed, but 27.6  percent disagreed.    A somewhat larger than one-third of the interviewees felt  that the political reform proposals the governor submitted last  year should be completely revised, but 28 percent thought they  should be turned over to and decided at the Sino-British talks;  only 11 percent felt that the political reform proposals should  be submitted without change.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Business Travel (Update): British rail strike A strike planned for Wednesday by British railway signal staff could severely disrupt train services for the third time in as many weeks. The staff are staging weekly one day strikes over a complex pay and productivity deal. Railtrack, which operates the rail infrastructure has been able to run only limited services during both of the previous one day strikes.</p>

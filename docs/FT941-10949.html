			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: China plans Yn5.5bn share issue this year China plans to issue Yn5.5bn (UDollars 634m) worth of domestic shares this year to enliven its flagging securities markets. The planned figure is the same as last year. This only refers to A-shares for Chinese nationals. No figure was provided for USDollars -denominated B-shares, restricted to foreigners. 'The figure has been set after fully considering the stock market's capacity,' said Mr Ma Zhongzhi, a senior official of the State Council's, or cabinet, Securities Policy Committee. He said 22 Chinese companies have been selected for overseas listing this year. Officials said these were preliminary choices and it was likely that only a few on the shortlist ultimately would be allowed to list abroad.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Algerian Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] has its  rearguard in France. The police have uncovered a rear-guard  logistics network for the Algerian murderers. On 21 and 22  March, police arrested two FIS sympathizers in Lille, and  discovered a large cache of false identity papers and other  documents. A routine drug search led detectives to this  important terrorist network. Eric Young has the details:    [Young] For the first time, a police investigation appears  to  prove the existence of links between FIS sympathizers and the  drug world. The network first came to light with a routine  police investigation of a drug trafficking network. Detectives  from the Lille police force spent several days tracking two  suspects called Shahib and Ahmed. One is Algerian, the other  French. On 21 March, they were arrested, and it was only during  their first search that detectives realized they were dealing  with something bigger. They found more than 1,000 false  administrative papers at the home of one of the men, including  500 blank Algerian identity cards. Enlisting the help of their  Parisian colleagues, the Lille police then carried out a second  search, this time in Persan-Beaumont in the Val d'Oise, at the  home of Ahmed. Their haul was enormous. They found documents  in Arabic linked to the FIS, perfect imitations of Algerian  official stamps, several handguns, an assault rifle, and a  significant amount of ammunition. They also found a list of  telephone numbers, several of which corresponded to people on  file for drug trafficking. A third man was thus arrested, a  certain Hassan.    It therefore seems clear that the FIS has set up a network  of  dealers in France to finance its movement and its actions. The  sixth division of the criminal investigation department,  responsible for the repression of threats to state security and  of subversive activities, has been given the task of  investigating the affair, under the direction of Judge  Jean-Louis Bruguiere. It remains to be seen how important this  network is and to prove how exactly it is passing on its support  to the clandestine movement in Algeria.</p>

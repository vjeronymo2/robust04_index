			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): India and Japan are bright spots - Investment trusts / In a relatively quiet quarter, new launches consisted mostly of specialised single-country funds, plus the heavily marketed 3i The last quarter has been a subdued one for the investment trust industry, after the frenzied activity of the last few months of 1993 and the first month or two of this year. Investment trust share prices have taken a tumble, along with most world stock markets, since the shock of the rise in US interest rates in February. The FT-SE investment trust index has fallen by about 17 per cent since the February peak, but is still up on the year. Similarly, the average investment trust discount, which hit a 20-year low of around 4 per cent in January, has widened to fluctuate in the band of roughly 7 to 9 per cent over the past few months. At the beginning of July, it was at the lower end of this range, and showed signs of possibly widening further. However, to put this in perspective, in July last year the average discount was more than 10 per cent. 'The second quarter has been relatively unexciting,' says Philip Middleton, of brokers Smith New Court. 'The febrile conditions of the three months before it have evaporated. But it was far stronger than most quarters I can remember in terms of new-issue activity.' New trust launches consisted mostly of highly-specialised single-country funds - the last three months have seen the launch of the first ever UK-listed investment trusts concentrating on India, South Africa and Italy, for example. The response to Fleming's India fund showed that there was still money out there looking for a home, but investors have become far more selective. The Pounds 84m the trust pulled in through a placing and public offer was short of its original Pounds 100m target, but still a respectable total by any standards other than those of the overheated market in the first couple of months of this year. Japan has been another bright spot in the past few months. Existing trusts have been trading at premiums, and there have been a number of successful new fund launches this year. Schroders raised Pounds 125m for its Japan Growth Fund, which was modestly oversubscribed. Schroders' existing expertise in the area - it runs several Japanese unit trusts - helped boost investors' confidence, in addition to the widely-held view that Tokyo was one of the few stock markets likely to see much growth this year. The most heavily marketed new issue of the quarter has to be 3i, the venture capital fund - something of an oddity in the investment trust sector. It is the largest investment trust ever launched, with a total market capitalisation of Pounds 1.58bn at the offer price, although only Pounds 711m-worth of shares were offered to institutions and the public. Unlike most new investment trusts, it has been operating for decades and came to market merely to float its existing portfolio, rather than raise new money. The quarter also featured a few disappointments. Murray Johnstone was forced to abandon its planned launch of a smaller-company and venture capital trust, after it had become clear during the initial launch period that there was insufficient demand. Analysts blamed the problem on a combination of factors, largely the generally unsettled market conditions and also a recent flurry of smaller company fund launches. The imminent arrival of 3i on the market may also have overshadowed Murray Johnstone's much smaller offering. Johnson Fry had hoped to repeat the success of its two split-capital utilities trusts with a third split-capital trust specialising in European utilities. But rather than the Pounds 100m it hoped to raise, it attracted only Pounds 15m, some of which was generated internally. One factor in this disappointing result may have been that it sounded too similar to the two European privatisation trusts, which have not been as much of an immediate success as people had expected. As usual, among existing trusts, some sectors did better than others in the poor market conditions. Those which fell more than expected may now offer good value, while those which held up better than average could look overpriced for new investors. Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst with SG Warburg, warns in particular that the share prices of many split-capital trusts are artificially inflated at the moment. They have not fallen as far or as fast as the rest of the market, and this has led to anomalies such as the gross redemption yields on some income shares being less than those of gilts; whereas normally they would be at least two percentage points higher, to reflect their greater risk. Aaron says this may be because people are buying solely for the immediate yield, and not taking into account total returns. Philip Middleton agrees. 'It is a very inefficiently priced market. Most people don't understand split-capital shares.' Other high-income or income growth trusts have also held up relatively well in the falling market, for similar reasons: the headline yield figure attracts investors who do not look at all the relevant factors. Market anomalies can work both ways, however. Middleton points out that some general Far Eastern trusts could be worth a look at the moment, as they can offer a substantial amount of Japanese exposure while trading at a fairly wide discount, but specialist Japanese trusts are often at a premium.

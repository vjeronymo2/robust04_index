			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Arts: Newman and Baddiel - Comedy On Friday the comic duo, Newman and Baddiel, announced that they were splitting up. Unfortunately they still went ahead with the final show that evening. You can see why: it was the big one, Wembley Arena, where no comedians had ever ventured before. A 12,000 crowd, a Pounds 100,000 plus pay off.' There was a definite air of excitement: this was a new experience. The stage was set in the round, a vast space on which egos could easily be slain. But the crowd, mainly young girls currently bereft of a worthwhile fantasy pop star, was in a fever of excitement. Two and a half hours later, after the last exposure of Newman and Baddiel's most famous sketch featuring two bickering history professors, the audience faded away in silence. It was bitterly disappointing. There is no physical chemistry between the two 29 year olds (like many double acts they are not friends), and on the rare occasions when they shared the stage there was an 'how many minutes more of this stuff' feel to the exchanges. In the main they do solo spots of mixed quality. Of course neither Newman nor Baddiel tell jokes - where have you been. They are staunch members of the 'quirky observations of the passing scene' school of humour, with particular reference to private functions. David Baddiel is the laddish one, with jokes about football, or, rather Graham Taylor, and the perils of disco dating. He revels in the scatalogical, majoring in pornography. Compared to Ben Elton or Frank Skinner it is all quite refined but it managed to extract embarrassed shrieks. In contrast Robert Newman is almost sophisticated, throwing words like existential and conceptual into anecdotes about the problems of being a punk in a small village. He also has the best character, a languid pervert in a smoking jacket who positively boils over at the prospect of providing a bed for homeless lads over Christmas. Newman is also happy to be politically incorrect, with a sketch on psychopaths released into the community, and the tease that in his blanked out television utterances Gerry Adams is actually instructing the nation's lip reading deaf to mix the Semtex. In this tired performance Newman and Baddiel were not good enough for their audience. It says much for educational progress that the most anticipated spot is built around bickering dons. The idea is that their discussion on the pagan origins of Christmas should be sidetracked into personal abuse at the level of the infants playground. Like much of Newman and Baddiel, like Friday night itself, it was one sketch too far. The fact that they were being slowly revolved on the stage to give everyone a view took away some of the intensity, but even so the exchanges were as limp as yesterday's lettuce. An audience of a hundred in a pub comedy club might have reckoned they had a fair evening. At Wembley Arena this particular comedy bubble burst.</p>

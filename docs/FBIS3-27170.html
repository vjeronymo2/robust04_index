			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Athens, February 18 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today that the Bosnian Serb  decision to pull back their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo  signaled that the Bosnian war is coming to an end.    He added: "I am satisfied with their response. President  Yeltsin is at this moment speaking over the phone to German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and extensive phone calls are being made  to other ministries."    "There is now a growing mood to seize the momentum and end  the war," Kozyrev said further.    Kozyrev stressed that it is important for Russia to  encourage  the Serbs keep to the agreement and for the U.S. and other  nations to persuade the opposing sides not to try and exploit  the Serbian withdrawal but use the situation as the chance for  opening peace talks.    He added that it was now most important for joint efforts to  be made to bring the warring sides to a real peace compromise.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said yesterday that the  Serbs had agreed to withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo  after Russia pledged to provide 400 troops in the area.    "We do think that the war in Sarajevo is finally over,"  Karadzic said in the city of Pale, close to Sarajevo.    NATO is threatening the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes  unless  they neutralize or remove heavy guns around Sarajevo by midnight  on Sunday.    After a meeting in Athens with German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel, Kozyrev told reporters last night that the Serbs had  agreed to pull back all heavy artillery following an appeal by  Russian President Yeltsin and his pledge to send Russian  peacekeeping troops to the area.    Kinkel and Kozyrev are here to attend the crucial EU troika  meeting this morning with their Greek and Belgian counterparts  Karolos Papoulias and Willy Claes, to discuss the Bosnian crisis.    U.S. Special Envoy to the former Yugoslavia Charles Redman,  who arrived yesterday unexpectedly in Athens, will also attend  the meeting.</p>

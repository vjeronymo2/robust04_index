			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Consumers are buying more  imports as the yen's appreciation makes foreign goods cheaper,  according to an Economic Planning Agency (EPA) report published  Thursday [17 February].    The survey said 24.8 percent of those polled said they buy  imports more frequently than before, up 10.2 percentage points  from the previous survey taken in May.    Asked whether the yen's rise has helped cut the prices of  imports, 65.4 percent answered yes, against 43.9 percent in the  May poll.    People who answered they see no price changes despite the  stronger yen accounted for only 18.8 percent of respondents,  sharply down from 35.8 percent, a finding indicating that  importers have been passing on the high-yen benefits to  consumers.    The poll was conducted in mid-December on 4,200 people  nationwide, of which 92.3 percent responded.    More than half -- 57.9 percent -- also wanted to see price  cuts on everyday goods rather than luxury goods.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SELLERS NEED TO GET REAL  </P> <P> As a realtor for 16 years, I've experienced two other "off" real estate  markets. Each of those were off for different reasons, but there was one  consistent trait: the sellers' resistance in accepting a changing market.  </P> <P> Our multiple listing service shows that it's taking an average of 115 days to  sell a home, with seven out of 10 listings expiring. Yet, no matter how much we  try to educate the sellers, most think they are immune to the current trends,  and that some "miracle" buyer is going to pay whatever price the seller has  placed on the property, regardless of what the home is really worth.  </P> <P> Today's buyers are not as committed to a property as in the past, and when they  make an offer, that's usually it. When the seller counters, the buyer walks  away!  </P> <P> I'm consistently reading where sellers are quick to criticize agents for the  kind of job they are doing, are willing to change agents every 30 days, ask  agents to spend time and money on open houses, advertising, lunches, expensive  brochures, etc., and then in addition ask the agent to reduce the commission,  even if the seller has overpriced the property to start with!  </P> <P> Agents want to sell homes for the highest price possible, but agents are not  miracle workers. It's time the sellers face reality. According to our multiple  listing service, homes are selling within 5% of their asking price, so  properties that are priced right, sell.  </P> <P> ROBERT RUSTIGIAN  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

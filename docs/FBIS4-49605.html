			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] Shenzhen, China's most economically dynamic city,  has vowed to tighten ideological control in its bold drive to  catch up with the "little dragons" in the regions. Plans for  the strengthening of ideological work were laid down by its  municipal Communist Party Secretary Li Youwei in a speech  delivered at a municipal work conference last week.    According to his speech published by Shenzhen's official  media, Mr. Li said ideological work in the border city could  only be boosted -- not weakened -- in the course of seeking  economic prosperity. He hinted that the closeness of Shenzhen  to Hong Kong made it more vulnerable to bad influences.    "We should have a sober mind to see that thoughts of  money-worshipping, hedonism and extreme individualism have been  prevalent among some people," said Mr. Li. This, he said, had  given rise to malpractices including trading power for gains.    He pointed to the grassroots sector of villages and  townships, where political indoctrination was weak and lax.    Mr. Li also accused some cadres of paying lip-service to  ideological work, and others of downgrading its significance.  "We must grasp with both hands our economic construction and  ideological work," he said.    Mr. Li called on party cells at all levels to take the lead  in learning Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on socialism. They should  take forceful measures to enhance the ideological education and  quality of the 93,000-strong party members in the city he said  in a Shenzhen Special Zone Daily report.    Government cadres above the division level should return to  party school in the next two years to be educated on the  socialist dogmas, said Mr. Li. He singled out management cadres  in enterprises as important targets.    "They should consciously resist the infiltration of thoughts  of 'money goes first' and decadent lifestyles....They should  handle well the proper relationship between public interest and  individual interest," he said.    Mr. Li urged cadres to widen their prospective and abandoned  outdated thoughts. He admitted reforms had hit a snag where  cadres considered their own interests first, and warned this  would "obstruct or delay" reform.    Mr. Li said propaganda officials should constantly spot  problems facing the people and take prompt measures to deal with  disputes.</p>

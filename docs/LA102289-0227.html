			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DON'T BLAME KELL FOR COAST CLUB LOSS  </P> <P> This letter is in response to the letter of Joe Galliani (Times, Oct. 12),  which attempts to lay the blame for the demolition of the Pacific Coast Club at  the feet of Mayor Ernie Kell. The Coalition to Preserve Historic Long Beach  devoted countless hours and thousands of dollars to try and find a way to  preserve this local landmark. As chairpersons of the coalition since its  inception, we would like to set the record straight.  </P> <P> The Pacific Coast Club fell to the wrecker's ball because of unsolvable  economic problems and the legal complications of building a private hotel on a  public beach. When local preservationists were working with developer Rob  Bellevue to find a way to save this important part of Long Beach history, Mayor  Kell directed the city manager and staff to work with us and to do whatever was  necessary to preserve the club. Alas, it was hard economics and not a lack of  will that caused the club's demise.  </P> <P> Galliani's broadside attack on the insensitivity of the mayor to preservation  issues is also misplaced. In addition to the creation and staffing of the  Office of Neighborhood and Historic Preservation, other pro-preservation  measures have been supported by the mayor. He has directed the drafting of two  ordinances for consideration by the City Council.  </P> <P> The first would prevent the demolition of landmarks until approved plans and  financing agreements for replacement projects are in place. The second would  require developers of historic sites to pay for adaptive reuse feasibility  studies as part of the environmental review process.  </P> <P> Also, surveys have been ordered to identify buildings worthy of recognition to  put both preservationists and owners on notice that these structures have  special meaning to our citizens and that their demolition will be permitted  only after exhaustive review and attempts to incorporate them into the city's  urban fabric. The list of successes goes on; preservationists have never had it  so good.  </P> <P> All this is not to say that we have not had our unconsolable losses, the  Pacific Coast Club and Jergins Trust Building among them, and that the battle  has been won. Eternal vigilance is the price we must pay if we wish to  incorporate the most evocative of our city's past into its future. The  stewardship of Mayor Kell and City Manager Jim Hankla have made that watch  easier.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS W.

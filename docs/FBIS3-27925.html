The figures were up 0.5 percentage point from the increase  recorded a year earlier for consumer prices and 0.7 percentage  point for producer prices, largely due to higher oil, cigarette  and farm prices. Farm prices rose 3.7 percent and livestock  prices went up 1.7 percent, while fish prices dipped 0.3  percent. Fresh food prices as a whole surged 3.9 percent  compared with the 3.6 percent registered in January last year.    Processed food prices inched up 0.7 percent and public  utility charges increased 1.3 percent.    Steel prices rose, while the prices of whiskey, video-tape  recorders and ready-made concrete fell.    Chong Chae-yong, the Economic Planning Board official in  charge of price policy, on Tuesday blamed higher cigarette and  oil taxes and the lean crops caused by last year's cold summer  for the sharp consumer price hike in January, but said prices  would stablize in the second quarter to record a six-percent  increase for the whole of this year, the same inflation level as  last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] At the present time, people in Kompong Chhnang  Province do not have timber resources to live off. The forests  in this province can only provide firewood. And now, even the  firewood is disappearing. Nearly one-half of the population of  the province had made a living by cutting and selling firewood  as a permanent occupation especially in the Tuk Phos, Samakki  Meanchey, Kompong Tralach, and Rolea Pier districts. The  decline of the forests in Kompong Chhnang Province to the level  where all the forests are unable to grow means that the forests  which have been cut grow back and then are repeatedly cut.  Therefore these forests cannot grow large. This is only one  part of the population. Another part is a group of merchants  who go up into the mountains to cut the big trees illegally; the  provincial forest wardens fear this group and do not dare arrest  them because when they leave the forest they always have  carloads of armed guards to protect them.    Mr. Sarun, Deputy Chief of Agriculture responsible for  provincial forests has reported that they do not know what steps  to take to effectively solve this problem and keep the forest  from further deterioration. At the present time, the Khmer  Rouge is gradually moving to use these forests very intensively.  And the collecting of taxes by the Khmer Rouge is increasing.  As for the province, they have admitted to the anarchy that  they are unable to protect the forests from destruction. When  the Cambodian government gets new legal powers or there is an  armed force to assist the province, only then will the province  be effective.    The chief of the provincial forest wardens has pointed out  that while the province did not have large trees to saw, there  were sawmills in 56 locations including 16 legal mills. In the  days of the Sangkum, there were only three sawmills in the  province, and ll of them received timber from Pursat Province.  Every day timber flows from Pursat Province into Kompong  Chhnang by the hundreds of logs. The province does not know how  to close down all these sawmills and everyone seems to be  waiting for a change in conditions in the country.    As for the flood plain forests, Mr. Sarun found out that 20  percent has been destroyed yet the provincial water products  [department] seems not to have taken an interest in the problem  because the prevention of the destruction of the flood plain  forests is more dangerous than the prevention of other  violations. Furthermore, there is the problem of planting young  trees. It is not a ve ry effective strategy. That is, it is  only one way without a strategy. If we spend millions of riels  on the planting of new trees, it will not be any more useful  than our spending money to protect the natural trees. If the  province learns how to protect the natural trees so that they  can grow well, it will be better than planting new trees. The  natural trees are already there and we will only have to spend  money to increase protection as the best solution.</p>

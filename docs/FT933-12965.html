			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Pakistan equities rise by 2% KARACHI yesterday recorded one of its biggest gains this year, with the KSE index breaking through the 1,300 level, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. The index finished 26.69 stronger at 1,307.43 in response to assurances from Pakistan's interim government, led by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the new prime minister, that liberal economic policies would remain on track. Mr Nasir Ali Shah Bukhari, chief executive of brokers Khadim Ali Shah Bukhari, said the market was picking up because 'short-term uncertainties were over' with the ending of the six-month long political crisis.</p>

The trip follows the first meeting between President F.W. de  Klerk and President Robert Mugabe in Gaborone, Botswana, on  January 26, ending 14 years of arms-length diplomacy between  Pretoria and the man seen as Africa's most bitter critic of  apartheid.    The one-day trip comprises meetings with Zimbabwe Justice  Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa, Defence Minister Moven Mahachi and  Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa.    Mr Coetsee told reporters on arrival at Harare airport that  he would be discussing the administration of justice between the  two countries including re-establishing their extradition  treaty, which expired in 1986. "We have determined an agenda  which will support the better administration of justice in our  region," he said as his meeting with Mr Mnangagwa opened in the  parliament building. "We have so many issues in common." Mr  Mnangagwa noted that there were "no more obstacles to us to meet  and exchange views".    Mr Coetsee, who was accompanied by Justice Department  Director General Jasper Noeth, denied reports that he would  raise the issue of five South African-hired secret agents --  three Zimbabwean citizens and two Britons -- serving life  sentences in prison for their involvement in espionage,  assassination and sabotage directed against African National  Congress targets in Zimbabwe in the mid-eighties when  ex-president P.W. Botha's campaign to "destabilise" South  Africa's black-ruled neighbours was at its height. The issue  was "definitely not on our agenda", he said.    Mr Coetsee, invited by the Zimbabwe Government, is the third  South African cabinet minister to visit Zimbabwe in less than a  year.    Public Enterprises Minister Dawie de Villers was first when  he visited in may last year for the low-profile signing of an  agreement to allow Zimbabwe to draw power from Eskom's  [Electricity Supply Commission] Matimba power station.    Finance Minister Derek Keys went later in the year for a  meeting on trade issues that was kept secret until weeks  afterwards.</p>

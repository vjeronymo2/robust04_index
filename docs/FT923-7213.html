			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Efim bank talks to resume in London ITALIAN treasury officials and foreign bank creditors of Efim, the state holding company put into voluntary liquidation last month, have arranged to meet in London next week to try to resolve the severe differences which have emerged over how to treat the group's large borrowings. However, a treasury official yesterday denied the meeting implied the Italian authorities were ready to change the conditions on bonds for creditors announced last week. The decision to hold a meeting followed a hastily arranged two-hour session in Rome on Monday night between senior treasury officials and foreign bank representatives at which the two sides exchanged views, but reached no immediate decisions. The meeting was convened after last week's decision by foreign bank creditors to declare Efim in default on its borrowings and their threat to take similar action over Italy's four biggest public sector groups, which have just been transformed into joint stock companies. The escalating tension between the foreign banks and the Italian authorities over Efim followed last week's decision by the treasury to set the interest payments on the bonds to be issued to cover Efim's borrowings at substantially below current market levels. While the five-year lira bonds would pay interest at 7.25 per cent annually, those in Ecu would have a 4 per cent coupon. Monday night's meeting included Mr Mario Draghi, the senior civil servant in the treasury, as well as Mr Enrico Granata, one of the ministry's five director generals and its top lawyer. Also present were Mr Alberto Predieri, the special administrator appointed to run Efim, and a representative from the Bank of Italy. Treasury officials yesterday took pains to point out that no commitment had been made to raise the interest rate on the bonds, one of the creditor banks' main demands. 'The aim of the meeting was to exchange views and fix a working programme for further talks in London,' said a spokesman. A concession on the interest rates would represent a large climb down by the Italian authorities, which have argued that creditor banks should have been aware of Efim's perilous financial position. However, the heavy borrowings of the four big public sector groups transformed last week has left the new government exposed This is particularly the case in view of the role foreign financial institutions are likely to play in its accelerated privatisation programme.</p>

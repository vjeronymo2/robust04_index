They also said that the central bank will not support  Chinese- funded enterprises engaging in real estate speculation  in Hong Kong; that foreign banks will be allowed to carry on  renminbi business once conditions and the climate mature; and  that, after the foreign exchange trading market begins operation  on 1 April, foreign banks can participate in the market if they  are trusted by customers.    The above remarks by bank Vice Presidents Zhou Zhengqing,  Dai  Xianglong, and Chen Yuan, were made at a news briefing held by  the "Two-Session" News Center for the People's Bank of China  [PBC].    Answering a question asked by a reporter about whether Hong  Kong currency will continue to be used in the Zhu Jiang delta,  Zhou Zhengqing said: Any sovereign state in the world will not  allow foreign currencies to circulate in its country. When  exchange rates were unified in China, the relevant authority  unequivocally indicated that foreign currencies were forbidden  from circulation within the borders. As to the specific  problems encountered by Shenzhen during the transition period,  as it is a special economic zone which has many contacts with  Hong Kong and Macao, we will adopt some specific measures to  resolve them by considering the advantages of economic  development with Hong Kong and Macao. As to the impact caused  by the substantial amount of Hong Kong dollars flowing back into  Hong Kong, Zhou Zhengqing said they were aware of the situation  as the Hong Kong monetary administrative authority had informed  China's central bank of the matter.    When asked about the central bank's views on Chinese-funded  organizations which engage in real estate speculation in Hong  Kong, Chen Yuan definitely said that the central bank opposed  conducting such speculative activities because China is a  country which practices exchange control and which is seriously  short of funds for construction. However, if a few  Chinese-funded enterprises needed to increase office and  residential premises because of their business expansion, they  are allowed to buy some properties so long as they are not  involved in speculation. With regard to property mortgages  extended by the Bank of China [BOC] in Hong Kong, Chen Yuan  disclosed that the BOC conducts its business activities in Hong  Kong independently without being restricted by the PBC, so it  may carry on property mortgage business according to the market  conditions, for which the PBC will not show any special concern.    Regarding the issue of allowing foreign banks to carry on  renminbi business, Zhou Zhengqing said: Taken from the reform  orientation and from a long-term perspective, it is necessary to  resolve this issue gradually. However, this requires certain  conditions. For example: First, it is necessary to ensure that  after foreign banks carry on renminbi business, they must be on  an equal footing with the Chinese banks in terms of tax  requirements so that there is a foundation for equal  competition. Second, our commercial banks have just been  established and they need a process of gradual development and  perfection. Third, our banking laws and regulations are not yet  sound, and we are now speeding up the formulation of a series of  banking laws and regulations including the "law on central  bank," "law on commercial banks," "securities law," "bills law,"  "insurance law," and so on. When these conditions mature, the  issue of carrying on renminbi business by foreign banks will be  promptly settled.    Discussing the foreign exchange trading market that will  begin operations on 1 April, Zhou Zhengqing said the 13 domestic  banks [as published] will all enter this inter-bank foreign  exchange trading market, and foreign banks, if entrusted by  their customers, may also enter the market and engage in trading  according to foreign exchange regulations.    Although a well-known economist strongly appealed to change  the current phenomenon of negative interest rates in order to  reduce the adverse impact on the economy, Zhou Zhengqing thought  it better for the mainland's interest rates on deposits to  maintain stability rather than making readjustments now because  deposits are still increasing by a large margin and there is a  favorable situation in the withdrawal of currency from  circulation in January and February, which is conducive to  economic development.    He stressed that, as the objective of monetary reform this  year, China will institute three systems and achieve genuine  results in two aspects. The three systems are: a macroeconomic  regulation and control system for the central bank which carries  out monetary policies independently under the leadership of the  State Council; a monetary organizational system under which  policy banks are separated from commercial banks and multiple  financial institutions co-exist, with state-run commercial banks  as the main body; and a financial market system characterized by  unified openness, orderly competition, and strict management, so  that the PBC will be a genuine central bank and the commercial  banks will be run as genuine commercial banks.    He further pointed out: In order to realize the major  targets for China's macroeconomic regulation and control this  year, the principal duty of the central bank this year is to  stabilize the currency. To this end, the central bank will  adopt the following four measures in 1994: 1) Strictly control  the increase of total credit volume of the state-owned banks and  the base currency of the central bank and strictly control loans  for fixed assets in particular. 2) Strictly control loan supply  and vigorously organizing withdrawal of currency from  circulation. 3) As of this year, suspend the overdrafts and  loans of the Ministry of Finance from the central bank, and from  this year onward, depend on treasury bonds to make up for the  balance of financial revenue and expenditure of the central  bank. 4) Intensify monetary supervision and control and  maintain normal monetary order. As for the concrete measures  for controlling inflation, he summed up the following three  points: 1) Strictly control investment in fixed assets. 2)  Ensure the comprehensive development of the rural economy,  particularly the production of daily necessities including  grain, cotton, edible oil, and so on. 3) Ensure the basic  equilibrium of total demand and supply.    Dai Xianglong said emphatically: Since the second half of  last year, the central bank has practiced a "steady" monetary  policy -- neither stringently tightening up money supply nor  excessively easing it. At present, the ratio of provision in  commercial banks is relatively high, and there is a fairly large  scope of credit. The credit scope for the second quarter will be  fixed and assigned very soon. He added: "In a bid to guarantee  a steady economic growth, we do not practice a retrenchment  policy."</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Sales to Iran face tighter controls BRITAIN IS tightening controls on sales of defence-related equipment and so-called dual-use technology to Iran, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, announced yesterday. The Department of Trade and Industry will not approve licences for items on international lists of banned military or atomic energy equipment. Licences will also be refused for attempted exports of any equipment 'where there was knowledge or reason to suspect that it would go to a military end-user or be used for military purposes'. There will be two exceptions to new guidelines, announced in a written answer to a parliamentary question: goods judged essential for the safety of civil aircraft and radioactive material for medical use. The Foreign Office would not elaborate last night on the reasons for the changes but it is thought they are aimed at blocking potential loopholes in the old guidelines. These were announced in 1985 and applied to equipment which the government felt 'significantly enhanced the capability' of Iran and Iraq following the outbreak of their territorial conflict. Iranian groups have approached UK exporters recently for military parts to replace equipment lost or damaged over the last 10 years, and some western officials have expressed fears of a new military build-up. Last month UK customs officers interviewed a number of UK businessmen after seizing about 12,000 counterfeit engine parts for US-made Iranian jet fighters. The Foreign Office said last night that Tehran's continuing death threat against the author Salman Rushdie remained a 'factor in our bilateral relations', although the issue was not directly related to yesterday's announcement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 Apr (INA) -- Foreign Minister Muhammad  Sa'id al-Sahhaf has said Iraq has fulfilled its international  obligations, particularly Resolution 687, which stipulates, in  return, that the Security Council should immediately lift the  Iraq embargo in line with Paragraph 22.    In an interview with Egyptian television screened last  night,  al-Sahhaf said it is the right of the Iraqi people and  government, in line with international law, to take measures  that keep them alive and ensures their future if pressure on the  Security Council persists in order to prevent the lifting of the  embargo.    He said lifting the Iraq embargo is necessary and is  stipulated by Resolution 687, Paragraph 22, and that any talk to  the contrary is obvious manipulation of the resolutions and  their contents.    Regarding the allegations of the Kuwaiti regime about  missing  persons, the foreign minister said Iraq had cooperated with  three envoys sent by the Arab League, the Security Council, and  the International Committee of the Red Cross, and that Iraq  holds no Kuwaiti people at all.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Merck role for Medco chief MR Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck, the US's largest pharmaceuticals group, said he planned to push through a rapid integration of Medco Containment Services, the drugs distribution company which Merck is buying for Dollars 6bn. He also outlined a role at Merck for Mr Martin Wygod, the Medco chairman, which suggested that he will play a central position in the enlarged group. Mr Vagelos' comments came as Medco shareholders voted in favour of the takeover by Merck, completing the first large-scale combination of a drugs manufacturer and distributor which has rocked the rest of the US drugs industry. At a Medco shareholders' meeting, Mr Vagelos refused to detail plans for integrating the two company's oper - ations. But he said: 'I can assure you the two companies are linking their major elements very rapidly.' Mr Vagelos' comments indicated that, rather than operate as a separate distribution subsidiary of Merck, Medco will play a role in collecting information on the usage and benefits of drugs and help to shape Merck's drug development. The Merck chairman added that he would work closely with Mr Wygod - who built Medco into the US's biggest drugs distributor - to bridge the gap between Merck's research and development laboratories and the patients who use its drugs. He added that Mr Wygod will play a key role in the group, adding to speculation that the Medco chairman could be in the running to succeed Mr Vagelos when he retires next year.</p>

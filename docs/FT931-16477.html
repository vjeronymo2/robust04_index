			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP hurt by US selling REVIVAL OF long-running market stories that British Petroleum could be about to launch a massive rights issue, together with several other bearish tales, left BP shares floundering. However, BP dismissed suggestions of an impending fund-raising exercise. Oil analysts agreed, arguing that, although the company might announce a rights issue later in the year, a cash call now is unlikely. 'BP will not be forced into issuing shares too cheaply, that is for certain,' said one broker. The stock closed 9 1/2 down at 236 1/2 p on 9.7m traded. Dealers said the weakness in BP developed just before US markets opened with US brokers big sellers. US investors have been strong supporters of BP since the middle of last year and now speak for around 21 per cent of the equity. CJ Lawrence, one of the most influential US brokers in the oil sector and a long-time bull of BP, was said to have turned a seller. The latest slide in oil prices to below Dollars 18 a barrel, a weak dollar and a story in the US press about US opposition to the sale of a BP chemicals plant to Iran, brought additional pressure. Another suggestion was that the apparently keen support for the shares last month might have represented no more than end-year 'window dressing'. Strauss Turnbull, long-time bears of BP, reaffirmed its downside target of 170p. 'Switch into Shell,' said Mr John Toalster. ICI stands out Support from James Capel, the leading UK agency broker, ensured that ICI stood out in a weakened FT-SE Index yesterday. The shares rallied 15 to 1085p in spite of negative comment from a rival house and falls in a number of internationally traded stocks. Mr David Ingles, Capel's chemicals analyst, raised his recommendation on ICI to a buy from a strong hold. He has maintained his 1993 profits forecast at Pounds 800m, around the top end of expectations, and is 'conscious that the news from the company will be bad'. But he argues that most of that bad news is already in the share price and there is little downside from present levels. He has the support of Nikko Europe, which is a buyer of ICI for its recovery prospects. However, County NatWest issued a sell note and cut its 1993 forecast by 21 per cent to Pounds 600m. County believes weak demand in mainland Europe, particularly Germany, is maintaining heavy pressure on the group's materials and industrial chemicals businesses. Redland firm The market continued to register approval of the asset sales announced by Redland on Monday, the shares outpacing both the building sector and the overall market. At the close, the stock was 10 higher at 433p, making a two-day advance of 26. Turnover was heavy, with 3.4m shares dealt. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the Swiss-owned stockbroker, was said to have been one of the strongest supporters of the shares. Mr David Taylor, building analyst at UBS, labelled the shares a buy because of growing confidence that the 1993 dividend would be paid. 'There are not many Footsie stocks offering an 8 per cent yield with the dividend likely to be maintained,' he added. Redland's preliminary figures are expected in April. Good pre-Christmas trading at Marks and Spencer helped the shares put on 8 to 333p. In briefings to analysts, the stores group said that second-half sales were ahead of expectations, although no specific figures were given. However, some in the market had feared that sales, and more crucially margins, might have fallen in this period and had been ready to downgrade. Turnover was a healthy 13m. Positive sales figures from Circuit City, leading electrical retailer in the US, sent Dixons sharply forward, raising hopes that Silo, its US subsidiary and Circuit City rival, may return to profitability. Dixons shares closed 10 up at 274p. Boots tumbled on profit-taking after rising last week on US approval for its Manoplax drug. The shares fell 14 to 545p. Abbey National attracted selling pressure after hints of a profits downgrade, the shares closing 11 off at 381p on turnover of 5.6m. Concern about yet more provisions against property losses left Barclays 3 off at 386p. But Standard Chartered responded to a broker buy recommendation, improving 15 to 603p, the highest since February 1990. Extremely active markets and the prospect of a bumper year for rights issues and takeover bids gave a boost to some merchant banks. Hambros appreciated 12 to 261p and Kleinwort Benson 7 to 329p. Insurance brokers Sedgwick advanced 5 to 182p and Willis Corroon 9 to 201p, reflecting the Kleinwort Benson buy recommendations. Dollar-influenced stocks were generally affected by weakness in the US currency, as well as the sidelining of defensive stocks. Glaxo was the main casualty, with Lehman Brothers becoming the latest US house to point out the stock's premium to its growth rate. Lehman was advising clients to switch into companies such as Astra, Roche and Wellcome. Glaxo fell 35 to 764p, accounting for more than seven points of the slide in the Footsie. Wellcome improved 3 to 982p. Other internationals to suffer included BAT, Rothmans International and RTZ. Rights issue talk surrounded food manufacturer Unilever, although analysts were sceptical, choosing to blame a large seller in Amsterdam for the fall of 24 in the shares to 1093p. United Biscuits spent Dollars 75m strengthening its US biscuit arm with the purchase of Bake Line. UB added 2 at 364p. A busy food retail sector shrugged off last week's price war worries as strong seasonal sales talk continued to be heard. J. Sainsbury moved 3 ahead to 577p, bolstered by upgradings from BZW and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Rumours that discount specialist Kwik Save would announce Christmas sales growth of 13 per cent helped the shares gain 8 at 786p. Tesco, expected to announce similar news, firmed 2 to 258p. Hoare Govett was positive on Iceland Frozen Foods and the shares rose 13 to 636p, but Hoare's downgrade of Morrison Supermarkets led to a fall of 6 to 161p in the shares. There was no dimming of takeover speculation around Owners Abroad, which put on 1 1/2 at 109p in turnover of 3.5m, with rival tour operator Airtours still favourite to make a 120p-a-share bid. Airtours edged forward a penny to 321p. Thorn EMI fell 21 to 860p. Smith New Court decided the stock had overrun and advised clients to take profits. The SG Warburg media team sent out a review of the publishers which advised clients to remain overweight in the sector. The house likes Carlton Communications, which gained 5 at 783p. Among the second liners, Warburg advised picking up Daily Mail, Emap and Trinity. Newspaper group Ports-mouth &amp; Sunderland climbed 15 to 565p following a substantial buy order from an institutional client carried out by Credit Lyonnais Laing. Bank note printer De La Rue languished 12 lower at 645p after SG Warburg Securities reviewed the paper and packaging sector. The house believes that the stock is expensive in the short term. It feels the choice buys are Bunzl, a penny firmer at 122p, and Bowater, steady at 480p. Powell Duffryn rose 18 to 484p after the company announced a Pounds 3.5m acquisition. Speciality chemicals group Laporte fell 20 to 629p on fears that its declared interest in adhesives group Evode might prompt some form of fund-raising exercise. Laporte said it intended to pick up 10 per cent of Evode shortly after conglomerate Wassall increased its offer to 95p a share. Wassall fell 10 to 207p and Evode firmed a penny to 104p. Index buying helped textile group Campari International recover 11 to 270p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (199). AMERICANS (5) Ford Motor, Rep. NY, Rockwell, Sun, Tenneco, BANKS (5) Bk.

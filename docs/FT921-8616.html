			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Winter of despair, spring of hope: Ford needs short-term repairs in the UK and a long-term overhaul across Europe to be a survivor in the 1990s It is the best of times and the worst of times for Ford in Europe. Never has its performance in the world's biggest car market been painted in such stark colours of success and failure. It achieved record car sales in western Europe last year and yet collapsed into a record loss, compounding the huge losses it had also racked up in the US. The world's second-largest vehicle maker captured its biggest ever shares of the Italian and French car markets and achieved its highest-ever sales volume in Germany. In the UK it suffered its lowest car sales since 1977 and, most alarmingly, its UK market share sank to its lowest level since 1975. At Ford of Britain - traditionally the milch cow of its European operations  -record profits of Pounds 437m (on ordinary activities) in 1988 have been transformed in three years into a staggering loss (on ordinary activities and before extraordinary gains) of Pounds 920m in 1991. In the US parent company's books Ford made a net automotive profit of Dollars 284m last year in continental Europe. The surplus was obliterated, however, by the losses of Dollars 761m at Ford's established British operations and losses of Dollars 354m at Jaguar, plus the heavy financing costs - Dollars 247m - of the Jaguar acquisition. The result was a European automotive loss of Dollars 1.079bn. The woes of Ford's mainstream operations in the UK have been compounded by the medium-term financial disaster of the Jaguar takeover. The Pounds 1.6bn proudly paid by Ford at the end of 1989 to acquire the UK luxury car maker is rapidly looking like the sting of the century for Jaguar's former shareholders. Exacerbating Ford of Europe's management discomfort is the sight of General Motors, its arch rival and for long the loss-making laggard in Europe, accelerating past it to a succession of bumper profits. Ford and GM both sold just over 1.6m cars in western Europe last year. While GM is expected to unveil record net profits for its European operations of about Dollars 2bn for 1991 - dwarfed unfortunately by GM's huge losses in the US - Ford has only red ink to show for its efforts. The reasons for the crisis that has engulfed Ford in Europe can be found in large part in the UK recession. Urgent emergency roadside repairs are now being carried out at Ford of Britain, but the broader European problems are more deep-seated. Ford of Europe is confronting severe structural challenges as it seeks not only to recover the ground lost to its European rivals, but also to prepare for the Japanese onslaught. Most immediately it must staunch the haemorrhaging in the UK. Ford of Europe executives, pressed to explain the financial woes, point first to the failure to forecast the depth of the UK recession. Mr Bill Fike, the aggressive president of Ford of Europe, says simply: 'The market fell away from us so fast we had excess stocks. Each month the industry was falling away faster than our forecasts.' Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman and managing director and another new arrival in Ford's European management blood-letting, said last week: 'We were building vehicles for a market that did not exist.' Faced by the task of 'liquidating' its bloated stocks, Ford embarked on a ruinously expensive price war in the UK last summer. Marketing costs jumped in the UK last year to the shocking level of 24 per cent of revenues from 14 per cent in 1990. These costs range from discounts and low-cost finance to special fleet deals. 'We need a better balance,' said Mr McAllister last month. 'We have elected to reduce our volumes (sold) to the daily rental fleets in 1992 rather than just turning over metal. It is not economic.' Ford of Britain was taking action, 'so that we are not laundering vehicles through dealers into used car fleets,' he said. With the zeal of the newly converted he insisted: 'I don't see the point of chasing registrations for the sake of it.' After two years of trailing the recession downwards Mr McAllister insists that the UK operations have touched bottom, although he refuses to indicate when the company might re-emerge into the black. There is a long way to go, however. Last year, excluding Jaguar, Ford of Britain's traditional operations slid to a pre-tax loss on ordinary activities of Pounds 430m from a profit of Pounds 61m a year earlier. As marketing costs escalated, production has had to fall to bring stocks under control. Ford is creaking under the burden of fixed costs. The British operations, excluding Jaguar, used only about 70 per cent of their plant capacity last year. The Halewood, Merseyside, Escort/Orion plant suffered 110 'down days' with no output. The Southampton Transit van plant suffered 50 'down days'. Only Dagenham of the three assembly plants escaped such costly production cuts, thanks to its ability to produce left-hand-drive cars for continental Europe. More than 50 per cent of Dagenham's Fiesta production was exported last year. In a glaring oversight Ford had failed to equip Halewood for left-hand-drive Escort/Orion car production. Trapped in the confines of the UK market it worked a three-day week for most of 1991, and car output totalled only 127,117 last year compared with 188,804 in 1989. (In 1990 Halewood output was hit by a seven-week strike). Belatedly the mistake has now been made good and car export shipments from Halewood started this month. The Halewood mistake was exposed by the pattern of new car demand in Europe. While there was famine in the UK, formerly Ford's biggest European market, there was feast in Germany. The imbalance was exacerbated by a shortage of the right mixture of engines and gearboxes, says Mr Fike. Ford is investing heavily to catch up with its rivals' engine programmes - the first units from its Dollars 2bn Zeta engine development programme have started coming off the assembly lines at Bridgend, South Wales - but last year it was left having to push 'brown' engines to unwilling customers in Germany because of the lack of 'green' engines equipped with catalytic converters. Ford was left with capacity where it had no sales in the UK, but with demand in Germany which it did not have the capacity to satisfy. Mr Lindsey Halstead, Ford of Europe chairman, insists this will improve in 1992, when sales finally begin to pick up in the UK, and as the abnormal demand generated in Germany in the wake of reunification subsides. 'That will put us in a better financial position.' For the longer term, the Ford of Europe top management seeks to attack the daunting structural challenge. Last week the message went out from Ford of Europe's Warley, Essex, headquarters via its private television network to the workforce of nearly 100,000 that the company was 'leaving no stone unturned to find ways of improving the international competitiveness of our European operations'. The comforting reassurances are being followed by tough actions. 'The battle in Europe has begun - and truly only the fittest will survive,' Mr Fike told more than 300 senior Ford managers recently. In the past year he says Dollars 500m of costs have been taken out of Ford's European operations. For the first time for decades the European workforce is now below 100,000. In 1979 a workforce of 150,000 produced 1.4m vehicles; last year a 100,000 workforce produced 1.8m units. The screw is being tightened further. Another 2,100 jobs will be cut in the UK alone this year. Layers of senior management are being taken out as Mr Halstead works to flatten the pyramid of the Ford hierarchy and aims to cut indirect salaried staff across Europe by a third. Mr Halstead believes that part of Ford's current lack of competitiveness stems from its supplier structure. (Some 50 per cent of the costs of a car are bought in from outside suppliers.) Now the numbers are being cut radically and remaining suppliers will have to shoulder much more of the research and development burden. The number of suppliers has been cut by 15 per cent to 900 since 1988; Ford plans to shrink the total by another 33 per cent by 1995 to 600. Ford is aiming to achieve a 25 per cent cut in its investment spending by 1997 without reducing the quality of the investment. Involving component suppliers early on in product development, getting designers and engineers to work simultaneously and asking consumers what they want sooner are all considered vital to gain greater investment efficiency. It is working again towards improved productivity and quality at the UK Dagenham and Halewood vehicle assembly plants, coupled with dire warnings to the workforce of a failure to catch up with Ford's equivalent continental European operations. 'It isn't the facilities that are different, there is not a damn thing wrong with the Halewood facility. It is the way labour is organised and the way labour functions . . . You have to close the gap (with continental Europe) eventually, or you have to shift capacity because otherwise you will have to say to hell with it,' says Mr Halstead. Ford is seeking to reduce the complexity of its model range. At the same time it has the ultimate ambition of reducing new model development times from the 72 months of the recent past to only 36 months by adopting radically different Japanese-style 'heavyweight' project management teams. Under this system each major car product line would become its own mini-business area. He admits that Ford has been cost-driven rather than customer-driven. At the same time it has been 'awfully compartmentalised' with a vertical structure of sales and marketing, manufacturing, product development, finance and human resources all reporting upwards. Instead Mr Halstead is seeking a horizontal structure with decision-making responsibility pushed down in the organisation. 'It will take five more years to get where we want to be,' he admits. 'The Japanese are still the low-cost producers and they have more horizontal structures.' Mr Halstead accepts that Ford is hampered by having its research and development efforts divided between two sites in the UK (Dunton, Essex) and Germany (Merkenich, Cologne) but declares that recent speculation that Dunton could be closed is 'ludicrous. From 1985 to 1992 we invested Pounds 156m at Dunton. Now tell me we are going to walk away from that.' Instead the Halstead vision calls for the 'co-location' of development teams working on a specific project at a single site. 'There is a 10 per cent cost penalty of having two sites. We carry about 250 people more than we need, so we must re-organise to make the two sites stand more alone.' Beyond the radical structural reforms Ford also needs a healthier sales balance in western Europe by cutting its earlier overwhelming dependence on the UK. For several years it has been plotting a strategy for conquering market share in southern Europe, and its actions are now yielding fruit. It has moved in on Fiat's domestic fiefdom in Italy and has managed to push its share of the Italian car market to 11.1 per cent last year from 7.7 per cent in 1990 and 4.8 per cent in 1989. In the midst of its current woes Ford's success in Italy shines as one of the most considerable coups that any car maker has pulled off in the European arena. Fiat has claimed that Ford has simply bought market share, but Mr Halstead insists: 'That is wishful thinking. We made money in Italy.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FORD'S BREAKDOWN  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ford Europe car sales* 1991                 Volume    Market                               share (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany              426,454   (10.3) UK                   385,944   (24.2) Italy                259,107   (11.1) France               175,388    (8.6) Spain                120,619   (13.6) Western Europe     1,600,000   (11.9)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Excluding Jaguar  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Automotive Industry Data  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Western Europe Passenger car sales 1991       Market                      '000     share (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- VW group            2,222      (16.5) Fiat group          1,728      (12.8) GM group            1,627      (12.1) Peugeot/Citroen     1,617      (12.0) Ford group          1,610      (11.9) Renault             1,356      (10.1) Total              13,488     (100.0)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Automotive Industry Data, Industry provisional estimates  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ford production Europe Cars &amp; light commercial vehicles                     1991        1989  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany          951,735     999,018 UK               451,996     503,267 Spain            341,302     310,440 Portugal           9,560      21,682 Karmann (Germany) 19,660      21,052  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total          1,774,253   1,855,459  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Hospitals fail to meet cash target A GOVERNMENT programme to encourage hospitals to make money from activities such as retail services has fallen far short of its financial targets, a National Audit Office report shows today, Alan Pike writes. The income generation scheme was introduced in 1988 and the government hoped it would raise Pounds 75m a year. According to the report, however, health authorities and hospitals generated only Pounds 25m in 1991-92. Even so, the NAO believes income generation has 'significant potential' in the National Health Service and says that, in principle, the Pounds 75m target should be attained. It believes one reason for the failure to met targets so far has been managers giving their first priority to introducing the 1991 health service reforms. Income Generation in the NHS, National Audit Office. HMSO. Pounds 7.40.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng,  in meeting with U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen at  Zhongnanhai's Purple Light Pavilion today, said China and the  United States should seize the current opportunity and take  practical steps, in order to push Sino-U.S. relations back onto  the normal track of development at an early date.    Bentsen arrived here this afternoon for a four-day official  visit at the invitation of Chinese Minister of Finance Liu  Zhongli. During Bentsen's visit, he and Liu Zhongli will  cochair the eighth meeting of the Sino-U.S. joint economic  commission, which last met in 1987.    Li, calling Bentsen "an important member of the U.S. cabinet  and a senior statesman," said his visit will strongly promote  the development of Sino-U.S. relations.    "From a realistic as well as a long-term perspective, a wide  range of common interests exists between China and the United  States, who should maintain a healthy and good relationship and  enhance mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields," Li said.    China and the United States should seize the opportunity  created by the meeting between President Jiang Zemin and  President Clinton last November, and do something in a practical  and down-to-earth manner, so as to push Sino-U.S. relations back  onto a normal track of development at an early date, Li said.    While differences exist between the two countries, this  should not affect the expansion of bilateral ties, which has  overall importance, and the differences should be handled  through dialogue and consultations, Li said, noting that  emphasis should be placed more on the common points.    As for differences in ideologies and concepts of values, the  two countries should seek common ground while reserving  differences, in the spirit of mutual respect, he added.    After a brief account of China's economic development,  reform  and opening-up, Li noted that China has a huge potential market  and takes interest in American technology and equipment which  are advanced in many fields.    With strongly complementary economies, the two countries  will  be able to greatly expand their economic and trade relations, he  said.    Bentsen said that as he was dispatched by President Clinton  on this visit, it showed the importance the U.S. Administration  attaches to developing relations with China. Bentsen expressed  the wish to seek ways to further U.S.-China ties, especially  economic and trade ties, through the visit, according to a  Chinese official.    As the biggest developed country and the biggest developing  nation, the United States and China can cooperate in many  fields, Bentsen said.    The U.S. Treasury secretary, who visited China in 1978,  observed that the Chinese Government has done a lot to improve  people's welfare.    The United States believes that a strong and prosperous  China  will do good to the United States and the world in general, the  Chinese source quoted Bentsen as saying.    Also, Bentsen said that the Clinton administration "strongly  feels" that the United States should be involved in the economic  growth and development of Asia, particularly China.    Li, voicing agreement, said a strong and prosperous China  will pose no threat to any country. "We only want to take good  care of our 1.2 billion people and our land of 9.6 million  square kilometers. We are constantly willing to contribute to  world peace and development," he said.    Earlier this afternoon, Bentsen and Liu Zhongli had a  30-minute meeting.</p>

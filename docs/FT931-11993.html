			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Letter: No conspiracy by independent financial advisers on competition Sir, I enjoyed reading Barry Riley's 'Long View' (January 23) because it put the independent financial adviser in a new light, which is always refreshing. I agree with his point that it would be a shame if IFAs a were 'eliminated', thereby reducing consumer choice and removing yet another distinctive British tradition. However, on other points I disagree. IFAs were and are a much less organised and cohesive group than he suggests. As a manager of a network of over 1,000 of them, I can attest to their disparate natures; about the only thing they have in common is their pride and belief in independence. . Barry Riley would have us believe that IFAs were not only vocal but successfully conspiratorial in their bid to introduce polarisation into the legislation as a means of restricting banks and building societies from retailing investment products. As a group, IFAs just did not have the necessary institutional arrangements in place to effect such a plot. IFAs ought now to feel threatened by those banks and building societies which are getting into ownership and distribution of their own brand of life and investment products. And surely their only way is to respond exactly in line with what Barry Riley implies has been going on, ie they must get ideas 'above their station' if they are to differentiate themselves from the mass consumer marketing which threatens to overwhelm them. My observation is that IFAs see both the threat and the opportunity. Some will inevitably leave the arena, but new entrants are coming in, often from the ranks of tied agents. These people are now required to pass an examination before putting up their brass plate. Many IFAs are responding by joining networks, the ultimate test of which will be their ability to help members meet their own aspirations and the needs of clients. The other test will be how well they cope with the increasingly tight regulatory environment presaged by the debate on the future of the Personal Investment Authority. If they can cope with all, then the threat of extinction, as implied by Barry Riley, will have been avoided.

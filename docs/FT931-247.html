			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Watchdog criticises councils' tendering LOCAL AUTHORITIES must review their compulsory competitive tendering practices to make them more responsive to consumers, according to a report published today. The report by the Audit Commission - local government's watchdog - says some services that are contracted out are breaking down or of a poor standard. In a survey of 150 schools, a third expressed dissatisfaction with services such as cleaning and catering supplied by contractors. Poor contract conditions, lack of competition for contracts and authorities' ignorance of consumer needs had contributed to a tendering initiative 'fraught with problems', says the report. Since the 1988 Local Government Finance Act, Pounds 2bn of local authority services, mostly refuse collection and school catering, have been subject to tendering. The report says three-quarters of companies that expressed an initial interest in contracts failed to bid. Almost 85 per cent of contracts were awarded to councils' own direct services organisations. In spite of an overall reduction of 7 per cent in the cost of contracted services, the scarcity of private sector tenderers could be hindering greater efficiency and value for money, according to the report. Recommendations to attract private sector bids include regular meetings between authorities and their present contractors, and more precise contract framing. There should also be greater consultation between authorities and schools and colleges before contracts are drafted. 'It's necessary to consider the needs of consumers rather than the client department,' the report says. Realising the Benefits of Competition. Audit Commission. HMSO. Pounds 8.50.</p>

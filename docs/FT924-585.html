The Council on Japan-US Economic Relations, comprising prominent Japanese academics and executives, also proposed a new economic policy council be set up to supersede the bilateral Structural Impediments Initiative, designed to remove 'structural' obstacles to trade. In the report to Mr Michio Watanabe, foreign minister, the council suggested the two countries study their trading patterns, and Japan 'frame a theory' to explain its positive business practices, such as long-term planning and worker management. The ministry intends to use the document to review its US policy, and will present the recommendations to other ministries, as the council conceded Japanese decision-making lacks transparency and the distribution system needs reform. Several US deficiencies were described. The council suggested policies be considered to encourage personal savings and capital spending, and improve the patent system, said to offer 'excessive' protection. The council, which includes Mr Akio Morita, Sony chairman, and officials from the Bank of Tokyo, Mitsubishi Corporation and Toyota Motor, gave reasons why Japan has been unable to exercise political influence equal to its economic might. 'For Japan to take the initiative in fulfilling its new role as a responsible international leader, it is vital reform be implemented in the Japanese political and administrative systems. A revolution in people's thought at grass root is required, since leadership in external relations must go hand in hand with leadership in the domestic sector.'</p>

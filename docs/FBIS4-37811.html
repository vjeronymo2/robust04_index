			<p>BFN     [Text] Colombo, June 20 (AFP) -- Sri Lanka President  Dingiri Banda Wijetunga on Monday [20 June] reinstated a senior  minister sacked after his refusal to accept a new portfolio in a  mini reshuffle, official said.    Ruling party stalwart Alick Aluvihare was sworn in as  minister of Public Administration, the job he refused Friday  after his Shipping and Ports ministry was given to a newcomer.    Officials said Wijetunga's United National Party (UNP) had  been concerned over opposition moves to woo Aluvihare ahead of  presidential elections due later this year.</p>

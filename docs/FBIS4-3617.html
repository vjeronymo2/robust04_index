			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Is This a `Reasonable, Habitual Practice of </F> Reporters Worldwide'?"]    [Text] Chris Patten made irresponsible comments [shuo san  dao si 6141 0005 6670 0934] regarding the Beijing municipal  judiciary's completion of the trial on the Xi Yang  secret-stealing case by saying that "the sentence was completely  disproportionate to the charge." Shortly after that, the U.S.  Consulate General in Hong Kong issued a statement: "According  to what is known to the U.S. Government, it seems that Xi Yang  merely collected data by the reasonable and habitual  professional means used by reporters worldwide and his sentence  was far more serious than the crime he was accused of  committing." The two sides expressed themselves in different  ways but the meaning was the same. They were echoing each other.    In the British Parliament report, highly praised by Patten,  a  passage stated: In its China policy, Britain "should adopt the  same policy and carry out cooperation with other countries in  the world, especially the European allies and the United  States." By linking these words with current happenings, people  may ask: Was Britain trying to carry out "cooperation" with its  allies against China by using the Xi Yang case?    Here, we may first quote the "Proclamation" of international  law: "A country does not have the right to directly or  indirectly interfere in the internal and foreign affairs of  other countries for whatever reasons; therefore, armed  interference or interference in other forms, or attempts to  threaten another country's dignity or political, economic, or  cultural affairs must be condemned."    Was the handling of Xi Yang's secret-stealing case by the  municipal judicial organs of Beijing Municipality an internal  Chinese affair? Did the criticism of China's handling of the Xi  Yang case in the form of making comments and issuing a statement  constitute interference and should this be condemned? China has  never made comments on the handling of criminal cases inside  Britain and the United States but Britain and the United States  have often attacked China's handling of criminal cases according  to its own laws. Why so? Can Mr Patten answer this?    Here, we can analyze "what was known to the U.S.  Government."  According to the United States, "Xi Yang just collected data by  the reasonable and habitual professional means used by reporters  worldwide." If that was the case, Xi Yang should not have been  found guilty but should have been given credit. Would there  still then be any difference between good and evil in the world?  Would there be any rule-of-law society?    In June and July last year, Xi Yang did not collected  so-called "data" in Beijing but secrets. This is a plain fact.  Some people said that China did not clearly define "secrets"  and demanded that the state give the definition. This is  untrue. Like all other countries, China has its own secrets and  the degrees of confidentiality are determined by their influence  regarding state security and state interests. The state will  not maintain things which need not be kept confidential as  secrets. Being a reporter, especially one who has lived and  worked on the Chinese mainland for many years, Xi should be well  aware of this. Xi Yang was not unaware that he was collecting  secrets; on the contrary, he was well aware that the documents  about the printing of banknotes, the People's Bank of China's  decision on selling gold on the international market and  adjusting the interest rates, and the "Explanation of the  Interim Rules for the Renminbi Business Operation of  Foreign-Funded Banking Institutions" were all confidential  documents. Therefore, he pried into such information and stole  the secrets by taking surreptitious action and coming into  secret personal contact with the information supplier.    As for the "means," Xi Yang adopted the means of stealing  secrets rather than the means of gathering news. Lumping these  two things together and even describing secret-stealing as the  "habitual means used by reporters worldwide" is just an insult  to reporters worldwide.    Reporters are not supermen and superwomen free from the  control of the law. When gathering news in any country or  region, reporters must abide by local laws and the international  norms and practices. Naturally, when gathering news in China,  reporters from outside the mainland should abide by China's  laws. When covering news in Britain and the United States,  Chinese reporters should also abide by the laws of Britain and  the United States. Would Britain and the United States allow  foreign reporters to freely pry into their secret information  and steal their secrets by despising their laws? The means is  always linked with the purpose. By seeing whether a means is  proper and legal, we should link the means with the purpose.  The means aimed at stealing secrets constitute illegal means  and must not be regarded as news covering.    A country has its national dignity, a newspaper has its  reputation, and a person has his or her personal dignity. Being  a reporter with personal dignity, he or she must not do things  which violate the rights and interests of other people in order  to curry favor with his or her employer, or do things  endangering the security and interests of a country or even his  or her own motherland! A provision of the international  convention specifies that when citizens exercise their right of  "freedom of speech," they "have to be subject to certain  constraints," including the need to "respect other people's  rights and reputation" and to "guarantee national security,  public order, or public health and morality." Is it not true  that reporters worldwide should abide by this norm? Can they  behave like Xi Yang in doing what is harmful to their  motherland's security and interests for the self-interest of  themselves and their newspapers? Is this the "reasonable and  habitual professional means used by reporters worldwide?"    When covering news in China, reporters from outside the  mainland can dispatch as many reports as they like. The Chinese  authorities do not censor such reports and do not require them  to only report good news and cover up bad news. Are they not  free enough? If some people say that they are still not free  enough, does this mean that they should be allowed to freely pry  into the state's secret information and steal state secrets?  Would there be such freedom in any part of the world?    It seems that it is not true that the sentence "was  disproportionate to the charge" in Xi Yang's case; instead,  Patten's interference was very disproportionate to his status.</p>

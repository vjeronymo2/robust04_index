			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Pharmaceuticals feature as Dow trades quietly Wall Street A QUIET day on Wall Street saw US equities trading in a narrow range as investors waited for details of the Treasury's refunding next week, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 10.73 higher at 3,234.12 on unexceptional volume of 182.1m shares. Advancing issues had a very slim edge on those declining. Among broader market indices, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.74 higher to close at 409.53. On Friday, the Dow closed 21.47 lower at 3,223.39. There was little reaction to the release of the purchasing managers report for January or to a decline in US construction spending in December, both of which painted a picture of a contracting economy. Drug companies dominated big board trading. Glaxo eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 30 1/2 , Bristol-Myers Squibb held steady at Dollars 79 7/8 and Upjohn added Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 43 on the back of a positive analysts' comments about preliminary studies of the company's lazaroid drug. Digital Equipment advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 52 1/8 after Merrill Lynch highlighted the buying opportunity of the stock and raised its rating. Ashland Coal rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 31 1/4 after the company said it would buy Dal-Tex Coal for Dollars 250m. Up to Dollars 50m can be paid in stock. Food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco was one of the most heavily-traded issues on the New York Stock Exchange, adding Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 10 3/8 . The company turned in fourth quarter net earnings of Dollars 368m or 22 cents a share compared with a net loss of Dollars 429m or Dollars 1.11 a year earlier. Safeway edged Dollars  5/8 lower to Dollars 18 after turning in disappointing fourth quarter results. Among actively-traded blue chip issues, IBM advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 91 3/8 , Mobil added Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 64 1/8 and Pepsico lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 33 1/2 . Dow Chemical edged Dollars  1/8 lower to Dollars 54 1/8 while Corning advanced Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 63 7/8 after Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint venture, turned in fourth quarter earnings of Dollars 28.9m including a Dollars 25m pre-tax charge for costs associated with the company's silicone breast implants. US Biosciences was one of the biggest losers of the day on the American Stock Exchange, plunging Dollars 13 1/2 to Dollars 17 3/4 after its ethyol drug for use in chemotherapy failed to get Food &amp; Drug Administration approval. In the secondary market, the Nasdaq composite rose 3.22 to 623.43 in late trading. Alliance Pharmaceutical was one of the most active over-the-counter stocks, jumping Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 35 3/4 following favourable comments on the stock on a television programme. Microsoft climbed Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 125 on news of a corporate restructuring. Among other active over-the-counter issues, Apple Computer rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 65 3/4 and Intel eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 . Advanced Interventional jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 19. The stock was halted on Friday ahead of news that the FDA had approved its angioplasty laser system. Canada TORONTO ended a lacklustre session showing little change. The TSE-300 was down 1.72 to 3594.40. Declines led advances by 291 to 269. At 24.9m shares, volume was similar to Friday's 24.7m, while trading value was CDollars 272.7m, up from CDollars 296.7m. Canadian Pacific, which announced a fourth quarter loss of CDollars 887.6m, closed up CDollars  1/8 , at CDollars 18 1/8 . Renaissance Energy fell CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 13 1/4 after reporting lower fourth-quarter and full-year earnings.</p>

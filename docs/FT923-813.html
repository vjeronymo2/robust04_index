			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Books: Bank built into a legend THE BUNDESBANK: THE BANK THAT RULES EUROPE by David Marsh Heinemann Pounds 18.99, 354 pages ONE EVENING in the late 1970s, as a guest of the President of the Berlin Landeszentralbank, I sat in on a discussion between him and a very senior trade union official. The argument was whether the money supply target for the ensuing year should be 3.5 per cent or 4 per cent. The trade unionist lost, of course. But what struck me was the seriousness of his belief that the argument mattered: that a half per cent more or less on the target would affect the wage settlements he would be able to achieve. One of the many merits of David Marsh's excellent (and wonderfully timely) book is that it spells out clearly and convincingly the point implicit in that evening in Berlin: though statutorily independent, the Bundesbank rules by consent. It is as much an emanation of German attitudes as a controller of them. History and a determination not to repeat it have been fundamental. Warned by the past and deeply conscious of its responsibilities, the Bundesbank has built itself into legend. Dedication and professionalism have played a large part in this. The consistent application of rigid dogma has not. In the Bretton Woods years the Bundesbank fiercely resisted a revaluation of the deutschmark despite the inflationary consequences of maintaining the parity. In the 1970s came an intellectual conversion and the preference for an upward floating mark, a preference partly modified by the experience of the ERM. Money supply targets have been important policy tools since 1974. But they are often over-shot and often over-ridden. Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank from 1980 to 1991, once said a central bank only takes its money supply targets seriously when seeking excuses for a decision to put up interest rates. He is known for flippancy, but here is current president Helmut Schlesinger, the who is not: 'Pragmatic monetarism as accepted in the Federal Republic must not be confused with adherence to scholarly doctrine.' Even the Bundesbank's stated target for its fundamental objective - a long term inflation rate of around 2 per cent - is refreshingly practical and un-messianic. The Bundesbank has indeed often been surprised by the extremism and dogma of British policy, especially on the exchange rate. Both in 1980 and again on the UK's entry to the ERM, it regarded sterling as seriously over-valued. The Bundesbank has made itself greater not only than any particular one of its policies but also than any of the individuals within it. The institution moulds its leaders, whatever their past. It is nice to learn that within the Bank they describe as the 'Becket effect' the process whereby the loyalties of the friends of politicians appointed to the Council are unreservedly transferred to the Bundesbank. But the Bank is not homogenous. Dr Schlesinger - serious, didactic, formal - contrasts sharply with his predecessor Pohl - informal, urbane, amusing and fond of parading a semi-feigned idleness. Many of the Land Presidents are card-carrying politicians from different parties. All are strong and opinionated. This can lead to fierce arguments which the President, with only one vote, may find hard to resolve in the direction he wants. And as usual when collective responsibility enforces a decision against the wishes of a minority, there is a tendency to use the safety-valve of individual public utterance. Marsh is concerned that since the Bundesbank's power rests so heavily on its reputation, the consequences of a blow to that reputation could be disproportionately severe. He sees particular dangers in German and European monetary union. On German monetary unification, the Bundesbank was not listened to, was proved right and is now blamed. Kohl seized his political opportunity like a statesman but undermined his own triumph by major economic miscalculations. Since 1990 it has been the Government's fiscal policy which has led to the Bundesbank's interest rate policy. On plans for European union, the Bundesbank was slow to realise that an important reason for EMU is to reduce, not strengthen, the power of the Bundesbank. Now that the Germans are fully alerted, Marsh believes that EMU is unlikely over the next decade. But he is concerned that geopolitical pressures on the Bundesbank will grow (we saw some last week) and prove hard to handle without damage to its standing. That would be a loss for Europe as well as Germany. This book deserves a wide readership, both among those who see the Bundesbank as a dragon which has just brought down St George; and among those who, as other nostrums fail, reach for an independent central bank to perform the elusive economic miracle. It would indeed be better if the Bank of England were independent of the Treasury, but hopes not informed by a full understanding of the historical, political and institutional context will again end in tears.</p>

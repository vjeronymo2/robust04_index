			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / Chief may face assault charge Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, South Africa's home affairs minister and Inkatha Freedom Party leader, could face an assault charge after barging into a Durban television studio on Sunday night and forcing a political opponent, Prince Sifiso Zulu, off the air, Mark Suzman reports. Chief Buthelezi, who had been watching the programme in an adjoining studio, apparently took exception to some remarks by Prince Zulu, and, with bodyguards, forced his way into the interview room. Prince Zulu said he intended to press charges against the chief. The entire incident was carried live on the main current affairs programme.</p>

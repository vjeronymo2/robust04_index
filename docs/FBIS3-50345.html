In open  talks, they exchanged views regarding the improvement of  bilateral relations between Serbia, i.e. the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, and Hungary, and also issues of importance for  stability in the region.    Both sides concluded that they were interested in the  development of good-neighborly relations based on the observance  of equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in internal  affairs. Special emphasis was placed on economic relations  between the two countries for which conditions exist. It was  stressed that economic sanctions against Serbia, i.e. the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, have been inflicting damage on  the economies of both countries and that it was in their mutual  interest that they be abolished as soon as possible.    Serbia attaches great importance to the potential for  economic cooperation with Hungary, particularly in the sphere of  energy, traffic, trade, and tourism. The Danube, as the largest  European waterway, which links Serbia and Hungary and also other  countries of the Danube region, represents an important economic  advantage for both countries. In addition, as regards the  overall development of traffic, it is important to construct a  fast rail line from Belgrade to the Hungarian border, and also a  modern Belgrade-Subotica highway that will enable the extension  of more efficient economic links between partners in both  countries.    It was also pointed out that the Hungarian and Serbian  national minorities in the two countries objectively  strengthened their interest in maintaining stable interstate  relations and building mutual trust. It was emphasized that  members of the Hungarian national minority in Serbia enjoyed all  the rights guaranteed by the Serbian Constitution, in conformity  with the highest standards prescribed by the CSCE documents and  international law.    The two men also discussed efforts to wind up the peace  process for former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bearing in mind that the  Republic of Serbia had made a great contribution in this  respect, and that the Serb side had fulfilled its share of  responsibilities stemming from the agreement reached with the  European Union, hope was expressed that the international  community would abandon its one-sided approach to the Yugoslav  crisis and lift the economic sanctions. This means that Hungary,  a neighboring country, should adopt an objective stance in line  with its latest views on this subject, which would facilitate  the surmounting of open questions and have a positive impact on  the development of bilateral relations.    The meeting was also attended by Yugoslav Foreign Minister  Vladislav Jovanovic, Serbian Assembly deputy [and leader of  Vojvodina Hungarians] Andras Agoston, and others.</p>

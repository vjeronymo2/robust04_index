			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Arts: Schoenberg's Moses und Aron - Edinburgh International Festival EDINBURGH has a new festival director, Brian McMaster, previously boss of Welsh National Opera. On the musical side the programme (though perhaps lighter on fully-staged operas than it may be in future) displays to impressive effect the patterns of his finely imaginative artistic needlework in its properly festive blending of the popular and the recherche. Tchaikovsky is the main focus of the programme - a particularly fruitful subject, since in his work-list there are copious amounts of both kinds to make up a rich and satisfying festival mixture. But the opening concert, at the Usher Hall on Sunday (broadcast live on Radio 3), was a McMaster salvo of a different sort: a concert performance of Schoenberg's Moses und Aron, given by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Edinburgh Festival Chorus and a superbly well-chosen selection of principals (including such notable young talents in smaller roles as Rebecca Evans, Paul Charles Clarke and Alastair Miles) under Richard Armstrong. In place of the big choral splash-pieces that past years have produced, the choice seemed intended to 'make a statement' - and, at the same time, to make a case for this craggy, thorny masterpiece as a musical drama so utterly forceful and gripping that a packed Usher Hall might be absorbed in it without a murmur. That was triumphantly the case on Sunday: everything in the performance seemed geared to seizing the audience with main (though never excessive) force and thrusting them into the burning centre of its argument. The Word is its subject - the eternal, and eternally topical, struggle at the heart of the comedie humaine between abstract ideas and the 'approachable' images into which those ideas must almost always be turned for mass consumption. The word, its audibility, sense and purpose, was certainly at the heart of this performance: I have never before heard a Moses und Aron so intelligible and, therefore, so meaningful. It was sung in Allen Forte's English translation (as Schoenberg, a believer in artistic communication in the language of the audience, would have wished). The utterance of the large chorus, which must mingle passages of speech, song, and the Schoenbergian Sprechgesang in between, indicates long weeks of the most concentrated and purposeful preparation: whether in fine-brush murmurs or full-throated cries the delivery possessed the authority of fiercest conviction. Likewise, the orchestra, though lacking weight of string tone, really grasped the purpose and direction of their notes and lines. It is one of the paradoxes that makes Moses und Aron a living, breathing work of art, not just a vehicle for artistic debate, that the score's sound-world should be at once so expressively denuded and so graphically suggestive. Armstrong, who has conducted outstanding performances of Salome and Elektra in the theatre, caught the Strauss post-echoes in the Golden Calf orgy without ever underlining them. His mature, balanced approach was masterly. As Aaron the veteran American Heldentenor William Cochran used all his long experience to paint a rounded, many-sided portrait of sweet reason and silver-tongued articulacy - high-register phrases were not exactly suave, but the style dictating their shape was excellently assured. Willard White, making his first approach to Moses, had already learnt (from Shakespeare's Othello and Wagner's Wotan, inter alia) how to alternate thunderously ringing and gravely despairing tones of voice. At the centre of a splendidly significant festival achievement he provided an ideally commanding point of focus. The concert was sponsored by Scottish &amp; Newcastle plc</p>

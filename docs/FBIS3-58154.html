Speaking after talks of more than an hour with French  President Francois Mitterrand, Chretien said that Canadian and  French troops were playing "a very useful role in extremely  difficult circumstances," and that the question of their mandate  would be discussed at next week's NATO summit in Brussels.    Earlier this week, the prime minister said Ottawa was  considering withdrawal of its troops, who are blocked in the  Moslem enclave of Srebrenica. On Friday, he said there would be  a debate in parliament before a decision was taken.    "Canada has always been there for peacekeeping but it is not  peacemaking because we do not have the means to do that and it  is a kind of in-between, not much military in many ways, it is  more Red Cross type of work," Chretien said Friday.    He added: "It seems to be a conflict that has no solution at  this moment. The United Nations have passed resolutions but we  do not have the means to enforce their decisions so peacemaking  does not exist. In Bosnia it is not a question of peacekeeping  because there is no peace."    Chretien was due to lunch with Premier Edouard Balladur  later  Friday. He arrived in Paris late Thursday at the start of his  first official visit to France, after a short stay in London.    Canada is in dispute with France over fishing quotas allowed  to the French archipelago of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, in  Canadian territorial waters off Newfoundland.    The French consider the quotas insufficient and after  negotiations broke down, Canada imposed a moratorium on cod  fishing for both its own and French fishermen to allow  reconstitution of stocks.    After a private stay in Paris, Chretien was to travel to  Brussels on Sunday to attend the NATO summit.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Seek trade support, Paris told FRANCE was urged yesterday to seek support from developing countries to counter the Cairns group of food exporters, which has sided with Washington in the dispute over farm trade subsidies. The suggestion was put to Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, by Mr Luc Guyau, leader of FNSEA, the main French farmers' union. Mr Guyau said France should invite developing countries to a conference on the Gatt agricultural issue, to show that 'defence of French and European agriculture is not directed at them, but rather constitutes a factor of world balance'. France has long argued that a hungry world needs French food. But Mr Guyau's idea stemmed as much from a desire to replicate in agriculture the success that President Francois Mitterrand had over a cultural issue on Sunday, at the summit of French-speaking countries in Mauritius. The president got leaders of 47 countries and regions to side with French demands that broadcasting and films should be protected from US 'cultural imperialism' and excluded from any Gatt accord. Meanwhile, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, urged continued flexibility from both the US and the European Commission yesterday in their negotiations to conclude the Gatt round. In a telephone call to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, he called on both sides not to 'dig themselves into their present positions'. No details emerged of his apparent mediation effort, but a German official said there appeared some possibility of movement on tariffs and customs duties concerning textiles on the US side and non-ferrous metals on the EC side. Germany is clearly concerned at the apparent lack of flexibility on the US side in the talks, fearing that the negotiations to finalise the North American free trade area make it impossible for Washington to make any other Gatt concessions. Mr Rexrodt is apparently seeking any area of possible movement in the talks, even if it does not directly affect the most difficult issues of farm trade. Mr Balladur yesterday saw the complete spectrum of French political, farm, industry and show business leaders in seeking a consensus for his negotiating position in the Gatt trade talks. After conceding on television on Sunday that Gatt was 'a trap for his government', offering it only a choice between an international or a domestic crisis, Mr Balladur called a succession of leaders and opinion-formers to his office, the Matignon. Over the weekend Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, made a rare public intervention in the Gatt debate, warning France of the risks of isolating itself over farm trade.

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / PM scorns Thatcher views on Europe MR JOHN MAJOR dismissed Lady Thatcher's views on Europe last night as those of 'little England' after she used her maiden speech in the House of Lords to launch another attack on the Maastricht treaty. His harsh words came in a speech designed to rally Tory MPs behind the government on Europe and the economy. The prime minister admitted that he shared their concerns about the sluggish pace of economic recovery. But he said the government had secured the prospect of an 'end to inflation' during the present parliament. Mr Major, who had earlier faced a direct attack from Lady Thatcher over his determination to press on with ratification of Maastricht, said he would keep Britain at the centre of decision-making in the Community. In what was taken as a sharp rebuff to his predecessor, he said: 'I do not want us to be little England, impoverished, sour in isolation, bereft of hope, languishing on the sidelines of Europe, on the sidelines of history.'

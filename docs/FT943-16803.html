			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Concern for the homeless Sir, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary ('Gummer moots council housing change', June 30), leaves me with deep concerns over the future for homeless people. His statement that local authorities should not automatically provide accommodation for homeless people leaves little hope for the 135,000 households officially accepted as homeless last year, nor for the 8,000-plus people who sleep rough every night, the 5,000 families in bed and breakfast accommodation, or the 38,800 families in other temporary accommodation. With the government's green paper on homelessness generating controversial debate, I await uneasily the white paper later this year.

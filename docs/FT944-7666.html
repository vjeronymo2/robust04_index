			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: 'Progress' in congressional talks on Gatt deal President Bill Clinton said yesterday progress had been made in negotiations with Senator Robert Dole, the Republican Senate leader, whose support is vital to passage of the Uruguay Round trade deal in the US Congress. Clearly hoping for bipartisan amity on trade, at the very least, Mr Clinton praised Senator Dole's 'constructive approach' on 'substantive issues surrounding the Gatt.' However, he rejected the senator's attempt at the weekend to link passage of the Round package with a cut in the capital gains tax. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, has been in constant contact with Senator Dole, who must appease his party's right wing which professes to fear an encroachment by the proposed World Trade Organisation on US sovereignty. Senator Dole has reportedly proposed a panel of retired federal judges who would review decisions by the WTO dispute settlement panels. If the panels rule against the US improperly three times, within a certain period of time, then Congress could vote to withdraw from the WTO. Time for a deal is running short. The House is due to vote next Tuesday, and the Senate three days later. The four-day Thanksgiving holiday intervenes, starting tomorrow. This leaves little time to build momentum in favour of the Round. Lobbyists say once Senator Dole signs on to a deal, the political dynamic changes. Unwilling to be seen as a leader who cannot deliver, he will work hard to bring fellow Republicans with him. In the House, where the legislation has been expected to pass easily, many members have become edgy about casting a controversial vote when the legislation may not make it to the Senate floor. A number of Republicans who want the Uruguay Round out of the way for their own agenda next year have opposed its linkage with the capital gains tax cut. 'Dole wants to demonstrate that he is not insensitive to the concerns of the conservatives,' said one former senior trade official. 'At the end of the day he will not want to be seen as the one who brought Gatt down.' Questions that opponents have raised about the WTO impinging on US sovereignty have already been answered with some safeguards. The deal reached in Geneva would allow any country to withdraw from the WTO after six months' notice.</p>

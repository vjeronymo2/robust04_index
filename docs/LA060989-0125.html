			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> STOP CONSTRUCTION OF SETTLEMENTS, QUAYLE URGES ISRAEL  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle, in an interview with the Jerusalem Post published  Thursday, urged Israel to stop building Jewish settlements in the occupied  territories.  </P> <P> "These announcements of new settlements are politically problematic even if  they don't go through with it," Quayle was quoted as saying.  </P> <P> He reaffirmed Washington's strong support for Israel but said new settlements  help Israel's critics in the United States to put pressure on the Jewish state  to make concessions to the Palestinians.  </P> <P> "It just gives them (the critics) fodder for the cannon fire, and believe me,  they want to unload on Israel," Quayle said.  </P> <P> In a blunt speech last month that surprised American Jews and Israelis,  Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged Israel to stop settlement in the  West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> The Israeli government last December approved between five and eight new  settlements in occupied areas, but Cabinet wrangling over budget allocations  and a timetable for starting the settlements may delay them.  </P></p>

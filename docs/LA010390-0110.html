			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: EL TORO;  </P> <P> CITYHOOD CAMPAIGN SCHEDULED TO OPEN  </P> <P> Organizers of an effort to create a city out of three South County communities  north of Mission Viejo are scheduled to announce today that they are launching  a petition drive in an effort to qualify for the November election.  </P> <P> Proponents of the plan to incorporate El Toro, Lake Forest and Portola Hills  have called a 3:30 p.m. press conference in front of Heritage Hill Historical  Park on Serrano Road near Lake Forest Drive, said Helen Wilson, president of  Community Coalition for Incorporation.  </P> <P> If incorporated, El Toro would become the 30th city in Orange County and the  third South County community to incorporate in as many years.  </P> <P> "We are just going to announce to the world that we are ready to go forward,"  Wilson said.  </P> <P> Organizers are expected to release updated results of financial studies that  show the proposed city to be financially able to support itself, Wilson said.  </P> <P> An earlier financial feasibility report showed that if the communities were  incorporated into one city in fiscal year 1988-89, the local government would  have a $5-million surplus, she added.  </P> <P> Fred Christiansen, an Oceanside financial consultant, is expected to complete a  full financial-feasibility study within two weeks.  </P> <P> That study, which compares anticipated city revenues with expenses, should show  a 25% to 30% reserve in the proposed city's first year of operation, Wilson  noted.  </P> <P> Coalition members are expected to begin gathering signatures at area shopping  centers on Saturday, Wilson said. The group needs to gather signatures from 25%  of the area's 28,000 registered voters to qualify a ballot measure for the  November election.  </P> <P> Once the feasibility study is complete, the group will approach the Orange  County Local Agency Formation Commission to formally apply for cityhood.

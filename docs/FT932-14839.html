			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Wings of song bring Argentaria to market: Spain's big privatisation, overshadowed only by the coming election OPERA lovers recognise the swirling music as the Slaves' Chorus from Verdi's Nabucco. Spaniards, who now hear it incessantly on their radio stations, are being roused by the chant into becoming shareholders of a state-controlled banking corporation. With just a week to go before the subscription period opens in the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) partial privatisation of Argentaria, well over 300,000 members of the domestic public have, in less than a month, telephoned to register their readiness to invest in its equity. Argentaria's chairman, Mr Francisco Luzon, said in February that he hoped to have 200,000 shareholders in the planned placement of up to 25 per cent of the banking corporation's stock. He could now have double that number. Around 12m Argentaria shares, representing some 42 per cent of the equity being privatised, are being offered to the home retail market. Spaniards may invest a minimum of Pta25,000 (Pounds 143) and a maximum of Pta8m (Pounds 45,700) in the shares which will be priced, within a range of Pta3,500 to Pta3,950, on or around April 23. There is a second Spanish tranche aimed at the institutional market, a third for Argentaria's employees and a further four tranches, totalling some 8m shares, to be placed in the US, the UK, continental Europe and the rest of the world. Spain's would-be shareholders seem undeterred by the snap general election on June 6, which was called after the share offering was announced. Should it be won by the opposition centre right - currently neck and neck with the ruling socialists - the new government could in theory replace Argentaria's present management team. Following the placement, the group will make up as much as 7 per cent of the capitalisation of the Madrid stock market, making it the biggest stock after Telefonica, the state-controlled telecommunications group. Argentaria, a federation of state-controlled financial institutions with 14 core business units, reported net profits of Pta67.4bn in 1992, its first full financial year, and average total assets of Pta9,717bn, the second largest among Spain's banking groups. Analysts expect it to overtake Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, currently ranked eighth among financial institutions in the FT's European Top 500, to become Spain's leading bank group. Created in May 1991, Argentaria is the only Spanish financial institution with both commercial bank and savings bank subsidiaries. This gives it a strong domestic customer base, enhanced by the fact that Caja Postal, its saving bank unit, is the only caja in the country that is not tied to a specific region. Argentaria is run in a strikingly decentralised fashion. At the centre is Mr Luzon, with a staff of 40, setting group strategy and co-ordinating the individual business units. These include a merchant bank, a bank dealing with local government financing and another serving the agri-business sector, three 'para-banking' companies dealing with brokerage and fund management and a further four non-banking ones that provide insurance and property services. Each unit has its own board of directors and its own profit and loss account. In the long run, the test will be whether Argentaria is able to combine this decentralised management with the cross-selling opportunities it hopes for. As an example, the group points to the way Banco Hipotecario Espanol (BHE), Argentaria's property financing unit and the only specialist mortgage bank in Spain, has got together with Caja Postal to offer savings accounts to home buyers. BHE has only 50 offices; until now, most of its 800,000 mortgage holders have held their accounts elsewhere. Last year 85 per cent of BHE's 40,000 new clients opened accounts with Caja Postal. Argentaria hopes to make gains on costs, too, citing the way it has trimmed its seven information systems down to two, saving Pta2bn a year in capital spending and a further Pta2bn a year in running costs. In the short run, the biggest influence on Argentaria's results will be the extent to which it can extend across the group the gains in efficiency already achieved by Banco Exterior, its flagship. Mr Luzon, formerly managing director at the merged Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, was appointed to run Banco Exterior in 1988. His brief from the government was to convert Exterior from an export credit agency into an aggressive international bank. Mr Luzon raised the bank's return on assets from 0.33 per cent in 1988 to 0.75 per cent in 1990 and 0.83 per cent in 1992, a figure on a par with its private sector rivals. Those gains achieved, analysts are now forecasting modest growth for Exterior, which provided 49 per cent of Argentaria's pre-tax profits in 1992. The task of rapid profits growth now falls to the group's other units, which only came under Mr Luzon's aegis in May 1991. Likely priorities include: Argentaria Bolsa, the group's broking unit. The size and strength of the group's balance sheet should allow this unit to boost its derivatives and capital markets activities. Trading volumes at Argentaria Bolsa rose 40 per cent last year. The mutual funds managed by the insurance unit. Argentaria is currently ranked only fifth among Spanish banks in the volume of mutual funds under management. It plans to raise these funds by 40-45 per cent this year, from their current level of Pta330bn. Mr Luzon is a Socialist government appointee and a close friend of Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister. Though he has strengthened the group's management by hiring more than 70 former Vizcaya executives, he remains the key to Argentaria's future. It is ironic, therefore, that the flotation coincides with an election that could cost him his job. Moral: companies that link their fate to opera must expect a little last-act melodrama.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS aluminium shake-out seen continuing MORE NORMAL conditions are likely to return to the depressed aluminium market by the end of 1994, Mr Allen Born, the chairman and chief executive officer of Amax said yesterday. Amax is in the process of effecting a merger with Cyprus Minerals in the course of which Amax will spin off its large aluminium arm, Alumax. Mr Born, speaking in London, said that this year and next would see a continuing shake-out in the former Soviet Union where excess capacity was depressing the aluminium markets. He believed that the Russians might close some of the capacity down, and develop more fabricating operations to absorb output. 'There is a need for more discipline in these markets,' he said. Mr Born also said the outlook for copper 'looks good', though only for low cost producers.</p>

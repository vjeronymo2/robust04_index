The trial against the defendants will begin within a  month in the military court in Sarajevo. Most of the accused  soldiers, who belonged to the deactivated 9th and 10th Sarajevo  brigades, have been detained; a detention order was issued for  the remainder.    The soldiers are charged with an act of rebellion to return  their former commanders, Musan Topalovic-Caco, a former 10th  Mountain Brigade commander, and Ramiz Delalic-Celo, a former 9th  Motorized Brigade commander, to their positions. Caco, Celo, and  three other commanders used their units to blockade Sarajevo.  They placed a cannon on the Bistrika mountaintop and aimed it at  the 1st Corps building housing the security services and the  city jail. According to the bill of indictment published by  OSLOBODJENJE, the defendants are accused of planning an attack  on the Bosnian Presidency Headquarters and several police  stations in Sarajevo on 2 July and 2 October.    The rebellion was mercilessly suppressed during the night of  26-27 October. Three police, six military police personnel, and  eight civilians were killed in the operation against Celo and  Caco. According to the Bosnian Government's statement, Caco was  shot while trying to escape arrest.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michael J. Inacker report: "The Inspector General Calms </F> the Troops"]    [Text] Bonn -- In spite of the suspension of the plan to  reduce the armed forces and compulsory military service, the  Bundeswehr leadership expects considerable changes within the  Bundeswehr by spring 1995.    A coalition round stopped the "conceptional guidelines" by  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) as  recently as last week, according to which the strength of the  Bundeswehr was to have been reduced from 370,000 to 340,000 or  320,000 men, and the length of compulsory military service from  12 to 10 months. This was the Defense Ministry's response to  the drastic cuts in the defense budget, and it wanted to raise  money for an increase in investments. Also, the fact was to be  taken into consideration that about 40,000 recruits would be  missing in the second half of the 1990s to preserve a strength  of 370,000 men.    According to information received by WELT AM SONNTAG, the  inspector general of the Bundeswehr, General Klaus Naumann,  prepared the armed forces in an "internal troop information" for  the fact that there will be no restructuring in the election  year 1994, but that fundamental changes are to be expected in  1995. With the telex that was sent to the troops on 21/22  April, the inspector general wanted to eliminate the unease  among the troops that was caused by the public debate.    The telex states that a political consensus and a  corresponding "planning order" for the restructuring of the  Bundeswehr are to be expected by the summer.    Moreover, the general hinted that it might be possible to  reduce the armed forces "to a limited extent," while at the same  ensuring an increase to the original extent. Compulsory  military service "might" also be reduced, Naumann announced,  without mentioning details.    However, a "decision on the implementation" of the plans in  the Bundeswehr is not to be expected "before spring 1995," the  general told his troops.    Thus, Germany's young men are facing changes. If the  Ministry's plans should be implemented, the young men will be  able to organize their military service in a more flexible way  than in the past:     -  If they join the "main defense forces,"  they will do a "condensed" military service of 10 months, but  not be trained for full serviceability.    -  If they want to join the  crisis-reaction forces, they can chose between a 12-month active  service or service as "soldiers who sign up for a certain number  of months" (SaM), with the option of between 15 and 18  months.    -  In addition, the conscripts can sign up for a certain  number of years (SaZ) -- between two and 12 years.    As early as the second half of 1994, some of the conscripts  that are found unfit are likely to be called up for service,  too. Changed fitness criteria should reduce the annual average  number of 80,000 young men that are unfit for military service  by up to 30,000. Whether they will actually join the  Bundeswehr, whether they will refuse to do military service, or  whether they will make use of other alternatives is unclear.  Initial calculations at the Defense Ministry proceed from a  number of at most 10,000 additional recruits with a  "serviceability related to a certain activity."    Whereas the duration of the military service is to remain  unchanged, there will be certain exceptions regarding the  training of those who are only fit to a limited extent, which,  however, will not make the training of the "healthy" conscripts  easier. WELT AM SONNTAG learned that the Bundeswehr has  prepared a total of 4,000 positions (primarily positions on the  staffs) for those who are only fit to a limited extent.    Because of the drastic increase in the number of young men  refusing to do military service, the discrimination against  soldiers as compared with conscientious objectors is to be  reduced. After the defense commissioner noted a growing  inequality between those doing military service and those opting  for alternative national service in his most recent report, the  Federal Government is to draw up a report on the actual  situation. Investigations by WELT AM SONNTAG revealed that, in  some cases, graduated doctors fulfill part of their hospital  training during their alternative national service.    In an interview with WELT AM SONNTAG, the defense spokesman  of the Bundestag group of the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union, Paul Breuer, suggested increasing  the value of military service vis-a-vis the national alternative  service. Breuer stated: "Only the young men who have done 12  months of basic military service must be prepared to defend the  peace and the freedom of our people with their own lives."  Thus, "no service in peacetime, however moral and noble it may  be," can compare in any way to "risking one's life."    Breuer complained that, in its current form, the  alternative national service is no longer the "cumbersome  alternative" that it should be according to a ruling by the  Constitutional Court. Improved material incentives, the  possibility to choose the place and type of work, that fact that  the young men do not have to spend the night in barracks, but  can stay with their families and girl-friends have improved the  "quality of the alternative national service at the expense of  military service" in the eyes of the young men.    Breuer pointed out that the high reputation of those who are  doing alternative national service mainly stems from the idea  that they are taking care of extremely handicapped persons. The  truth, however, is "that only 4 percent of all those doing  alternative service are active in this sphere -- which is  approximately 4,000 of a total of 100,000 young men doing  alternative service."    Thus, those "who do not want to adapt the duration of the  alternative national service to that of the basic military  service and who do not want to clearly tighten the permit  procedures are not acting on the basis of the constitution,"  Breuer stated with a view to SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany] calls for a reduction of the alternative national  service.</p>

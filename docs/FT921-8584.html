			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / International Company News: Jacobs offers SFr34.6m for rest of Allgemeine MR Klaus Jacobs, formerly head of the Jacobs Suchard coffee and chocolate group, has offered SFr34.6m (Dollars 23.5m), or SFr300 a share, to the minority shareholders of Allgemeine Finanz, in a move to buy the remaining 48 per cent of the Zurich investment holding company. The price is much lower than what he paid last March in acquiring just over 50 per cent of the company. Union Bank of Switzerland, which advised Mr Jacobs on the transaction, said the offer reflected the recent market price for the shares, which traded on Monday at SFr300. UBS also pointed out there was a put option, providing shareholders with the option of selling the shares for SFr390 after April 3, when the main offer expires, and up to June 30, 1994. It expected many shareholders would take this option. Mr Jacobs bought a 50.1 per cent stake of Allgemeine from a subsidiary of UBS for SFr52.7m, or about SFr430 a share. At the time, the shares were trading at about SFr400. He has since raised his stake in the company to 52 per cent. Analysts said this was not the first time that Mr Jacobs had been associated with discrepancies in prices offered to majority and minority shareholders. In July 1990, many institutional shareholders in Jacobs Suchard complained that the offer by Philip Morris to minority shareholders was much lower than that offered to Mr Jacobs for the majority. Switzerland has no effective code to protect minority shareholders' rights in the event of takeovers. Allgemeine said its net income in 1991 had jumped to SFr13.4m from SFr2.8m in 1990. Total assets rose to SFr91.7m from SFr65.9m. Asset value per share jumped to SFr443 at the end of 1991 from SFr378 a year earlier, because the company changed its strategy and sold off many of its investments at a profit. An unchanged dividend of SFr15 a bearer share, as well as a one-time bonus of SFr5 reflecting the good results, will be paid.</p>

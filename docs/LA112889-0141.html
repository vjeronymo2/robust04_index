			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FIAT TO PRODUCE CARS WITH SOVIET UNION;  </P> <P> TRADE: THE DEAL CALLS FOR PRODUCTION OF 300,000 CARS A YEAR. ITALIANS ARE  HOPING FOR A BONANZA.  </P> <P> Italian motor giant Fiat signed a landmark car production deal with the Soviet  Union today, setting the tone for what the Italian government and industry hope  will turn into an export bonanza to the East Bloc.  </P> <P> Fiat Spa will set up a joint venture with the Soviet Union to produce 300,000  cars a year for both the Soviet domestic market and export to the West, Fiat  Managing Director Cesare Romiti told reporters.  </P> <P> The deal is the largest of several to be signed with the Soviet Union this  week, with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev due to start a three-day visit to  Italy on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Many other Italian companies are signing new contracts or taking existing deals  a stage further, often resulting from contacts made during a major trade  exhibition Italy staged in Moscow last year.  </P> <P> Italy is Moscow's fourth-biggest Western trading partner and has a long history  of economic ties with the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Under the Fiat deal, production at the Yelabuga plant, southeast of Moscow,  would start in late 1993 or early 1994. Fiat is taking a 30% stake in the  project and the Soviet state-run company Elaz the remaining 70%.  </P> <P> Romiti, who signed the accord with Soviet Automotive Industry Minister Nikolai  Pugin, said the joint venture's A-93 car would not be based on the Fiat Panda  but would be a new vehicle developed jointly by Soviet and Italian technicians.  </P> <P> He said it would be a three-door or five-door sedan model, 11 feet long, with a  maximum speed of 95 m.p.h.  </P> <P> "It's a new car which should be able to compete with Western vehicles but is  also adapted for use in the Soviet Union," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Golden silence surrounds Ulster talks 'You not speaking to us any more, Sammy?' shouted a radio journalist from the temporary barrier beside the Stormont parliament building outside Belfast. Mr Sammy Wilson, the youthful, straggly-haired and normally loquacious press officer of the Democratic Unionist Party turned and smiled. But he said nothing. Silence and discretion were the better part of historic talks on the future of Northern Ireland which started yesterday. Reporters were unable to get within 50 yards of the participants - except for staged pictures of arrivals, or by chasing the processions of polished Ford Granada and Rover saloons that sped through the 300 acres of landscaped gardens around Stormont. It did not go quite to plan. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, missed the entrance set aside for delegations. He drew up his slate grey Granada in the car park, forcing him to walk through the waiting media circus. 'Be patient,' he urged. A lone protester, Mr Cedric Wilson, former DUP mayor of Castlereagh, scrambled up the grassy banks around the parliament building to shout: 'No surrender to Dublin rule.' The SDLP was the first party to hold bilateral talks with Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary. Unionist leaders will not meet him officially until Friday with the first round-table discussions starting probably early next week. The date of the Irish government's involvement is yet to be determined. Later, a hunched Mr Hume fumbled with his car keys, trying to avoid questions. He would say only that talks had been about 'setting out the machinery and agenda for the talks'. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader, sucked his pipe as he got in the other side. By afternoon the arrangements had been sorted out. Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule, as silent as the classical Greek columns of the 1920's parliament building. Before 1972, Stormont was a living parliament. Now, empty but still majestically overlooking Belfast suburbs, it is a monument to two decades of direct rule from Westminster. all sides should keep discussions confidential, through fear of raising passions by misunderstandings. That the parties have followed suit underlines apparent determination to give the talks a chance of success in spite of difficulties. It is the first time nationalists and unionists have sat at the same table for 15 years. Mr Brooke himself said nothing to the press all day. The media have been confined to portable cabins erected beside the west wing for the duration of talks for which 11 weeks have been set aside and extensive preparations made. There are vending machines, fax machines and photocopying facilities. The Northern Ireland Office, at least, is not expecting an early breakdown.</p>

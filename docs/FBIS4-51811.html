			<p>BFN     [Text] Pusan, April 28 (YONHAP) -- The labor union of the  Hanjin Heavy Industry Co. on Thursday seceded from the  Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) in protest against the  recommended wage increase of 5 percent for this year earlier  agreed on between the FKTU and the Korea Employers Federation.  It is the third major trade union to leave the FKTU. The two  others are the Association of Hyundai Group Unions and the  Council of Daewoo Group Unions.    The Hanjin union decided on the secession in a vote  participated by 46 union delegates. Of them, 41 voted for the  withdrawal and two against. Three others abstained.    "The wage increase recommended by the FKTU and Employers  Federation is something that undermines the development of trade  unions. The cessation reflects the anger of all our unionists  at the recommended wage hike," a union official said.</p>

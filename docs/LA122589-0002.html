			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACKERS NOW COUNTING ON BENGALS;  </P> <P> PACKERS: AFTER 20-10 VICTORY OVER DALLAS, THEY STILL HAVE A CHANCE FOR THEIR  FIRST PLAYOFF BERTH SINCE 1982.  </P> <P> The Packers put themselves in position to win their first divisional title in  17 seasons and brought an end to the Dallas Cowboys' second-worst season.  </P> <P> Green Bay beat Dallas, 20-10, Sunday and would win the NFC Central and go the  playoffs for the first time since 1982 if the Minnesota Vikings lose to the  Cincinnati Bengals tonight.  </P> <P> Green Bay was eliminated from wild-card contention when the Rams beat New  England, 24-20. The Packers saw the end of the Ram-Patriot game on television  and were disappointed when the New England failed to score from the Rams'  five-yard line at the end.  </P> <P> "We're big Cincinnati fans now," Lion Coach Lindy Infante said.  </P> <P> Green Bay's 10-6 record was its best in 17 years. It was the 14th consecutive  home loss for Dallas, an NFL record.  </P> <P> "We knew this wouldn't be an easy one, coming into a place where you are  supposed to win is never easy," Infante said. "We've been playing sudden death  football for six weeks now. Regardless of what happens we have a lot to be  proud of."  </P> <P> Dallas finished at 1-15 in Jimmy Johnson's rookie year as coach. The only  Cowboys team to do worse was in 1960, when they finished 0-11-1.  </P> <P> "Well, it's behind us," Johnson said. "The Cowboys will have better days in the  future."  </P> <P> Johnson said that the season for Dallas was to assess everything for the  future.  </P> <P> "It was a season of evaluation, " he said. "It was a situation where we sat  back and watched. Next year we will take care of business."  </P> <P> Green Bay's go-ahead touchdown came on a five-yard scoring pass from Majkowski  to tight end Ed West with 3:58 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Mark Murphy's fourth-quarter fumble recovery at the Green Bay 30 set up a  63-yard drive that ended with Chris Jacke's 24-yard field goal with 3:24 left.  </P> <P> The Cowboys tied the score, 10-10, on former Trojan Jack Del Rio's 57-yard  fumble return with 6:51 left in the third quarter. Jon Carter caused the fumble  when he hit Brent Fullwood, who was attempting to handoff on a reverse.  </P> <P> A crowd of 41,265 fans watched in 35-degree cold. The Cowboys announced 55,000  tickets were sold.  </P></p>

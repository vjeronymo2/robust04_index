			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 OF O.C.'S 6 DRIVE-INS MAY HAVE HAD THEIR LAST PICTURE SHOWS  </P> <P> Three of Orange County's six remaining drive-in theaters have closed, including  the fabled one in Orange where televangelist Robert H. Schuller began preaching  atop the refreshment stand, Pacific Theaters &amp; Drive-Ins announced  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Schuller, now host of the weekly "Hour of Power" TV show from the Crystal  Cathedral in Garden Grove, rented the theater for outdoor services in 1955,  soon after arriving from Iowa.  </P> <P> In recent years, the Orange Drive-In has featured Spanish-language films and  Sunday swap meets.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based chain also closed theaters in La Habra and Buena Park on  Monday. The La Habra theater has one screen, the Buena Park theater has three.  Pacific closed a drive-in in Burbank the same day.  </P> <P> Company executives could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but an employee  who provides the chain's listings to The Times confirmed the Orange County  closings. A small sign appeared at the Burbank theater.  </P> <P> Pacific continues to operate two other drive-ins in Orange County, the Hi-Way  39 in Westminster, with four screens, and the Anaheim, with three screens,  along with about a dozen others in the Los Angeles area. Century Theatres,  based in San Francisco, operates Orange County's only other drive-in, the  Stadium in Anaheim, with six screens.  </P> <P> For the last four years, the number of drive-ins in the county has dwindled. In  1985, three drive-ins closed, including Pacific's Mission in San Juan  Capistrano, which became the site of a shopping center. The Harbor in Santa  Ana, another Spanish-language venue, closed several years ago.  </P> <P> Still, although the number of drive-ins in the country is down sharply from a  high of 4,600 screens in 1955, the drive-in business has stabilized in recent  years, according to Mary Ann Grasso, executive director of the National Assn.  of Theater Owners.  </P> <P> Grasso said this is especially true in Sun Belt states, where the climate  permits year-round operations.  </P> <P> As of Jan. 1, 1989, there were 1,497 screens in the United States. The Fox  Theater chain in Reading, Pa., opened a new drive-in this month, Grasso said.  </P></p>

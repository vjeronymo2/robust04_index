			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has spoken out in  favor of a political dialogue with the Russian nationalist  leader Zhirinovskiy. In an N-TV interview, Kinkel explained the  conditions that might lead to an entry visa being issued for the  right-wing extremist:    [Begin Kinkel recording] I would not be worried about  getting  involved in a discussion with him, not be concerned that we  could not be a match for him and for his extremist theories and  arguments. I did not say, however, that I was prepared to invite  him to Germany tomorrow for a discussion or to take part in a  discussion. However, if he does get invited, for example, to  take part in a specific discussion by a political foundation or  is invited by someone here in Germany at some point, if we have  the opportunity to tell him quite clearly what we think of his  theories, and if the right people would debate him, then I would  say we could and should think about it at least.

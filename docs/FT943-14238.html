			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Tesco's tasty titbit By valuing William Low on a multiple of 5.6 times historic earnings and a yield of 6.2 per cent, it was clear that the market had given up hope for the Scottish grocery chain. Thankfully for Low shareholders, Tesco thinks otherwise. By annexing the 57-store chain to its empire, Tesco will double its market share in Scotland overnight. It should be able to make quick efficiency gains by knocking out Low's head office and rationalising its distribution network. Tesco could also lift sales by pushing its own cheaper products through the stores. The economies of scale are such that Tesco can offer a 33 per cent bid premium and still promise the deal will enhance earnings next year. The transaction is like the food retailing acquisitions of old. Tesco has performed this trick several times before. Indeed, the purchase makes so much sense that it would be surprising if the logic did not appeal to others. J. Sainsbury, in particular, has been expanding in Scotland but has run into obstacles. Stricter planning rules have made it hard to buy greenfield sites while competitors, such as Argyll, have bid up the prices of available plots to keep Sainsbury out. Buying a big chunk of infrastructure in Scotland must appeal, given its most northernmost distribution centre is outside Manchester. The possibility of Sainsbury launching a hostile bid seems remote. But it is certainly puzzling why Low's financial advisers, Baring Brothers, which conducted such an effective auction for the toy-maker Spear, did not try to entice Sainsbury into the frame as well.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Arts: The Return of the Prodigal The best theatrical revival in London is not Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, admirable though it is; it is The Return of the Prodigal by St John Hankin at the Orange Tree in Richmond and comes from a slightly later date. St John Emile Clavering Hankin, to give him his full name, was born in Southampton in 1869 to a family that was plainly not badly off. He was well educated: Malvern and Merton College, Oxford. As a journalist, he had a spell on the Indian Daily News, then wrote theatre criticism for The Times. He committed suicide, much in the manner of Virginia Woolf, at the age of 39, possibly in the belief that his own plays were not adequately appreciated. In the meantime, he had completed seven of them, of which The Return of the Prodigal was the second. It was first produced at the Royal Court, directed by Harley Granville Barker, in 1905. There was a revival with Sir John Gielgud in 1948, though not much is remembered of it. The new production at Richmond, directed by Peter Leslie Wild, should go a long way to making amends to a writer who has been unjustly neglected. Like Granville Barker at his best, Hankin wrote adult plays for adult people. They are literate: they are articulate; there are no concessions to emming and erring, still less to effing. At the end of the play, you have been through an intelligent discussion of the issues of the day, whether the role of women, the limits to charity, the rise of Germany and America or the nature of the Conservative Party. Unlike Shaw, Hankin did not invent characters merely to spout views: some of his characters, such as Amanda Royle's Violet in The Return of the Prodigal, have genuine feeling. The influence of Oscar Wilde is there: how could it not be, the periods being so close? Hankin, however, is more interested in society as a whole than the narrow definition of the term. Eustace, the key figure in The Prodigal and the part once played by Gielgud, is an amiable drop-out. He has been given Pounds 1,000 by his father to go to Australia, and lost it in a mixture of sheep-farming and gold-mining. (The same sort of people, he observes, make money in Australia as make money in England.) Eustace returns like the prodigal in the biblical story, to be welcomed by his mother and sister if less so by his father, who is standing for parliament, and his brother who is helping to run the family mill. In the end the father is persuaded to give him an allowance to live in London and stay out of the way, but there is no suggestion in Hankin's writing that Eustace is especially culpable - that's just the way he is, no good at making money yet lucky enough to have a rich family to fall back on, much in the way that a progressive society provides for the poor. The word used for drop-out is loafer. 'I disapprove of loafing on principle,' says the father (Frank Moorey). 'There's far too much of it in England today. That's where the Germans are ahead of us'. You may have heard that sort of language before, in more recent times. Yet where Hankin scores again is that he does not seem particularly to condemn the father either: he records life in a well-off family, where the women are better educated than the men but have less to do, and some of the problems are genuine dilemmas, especially in a society trying to be liberal. Meanwhile, Hankin takes a wonderful satirical swipe at both the the local doctor and the local clergyman. There is much more besides. Timothy Watson plays Eustace; the company as a whole is outstandingly good. This is a production that anyone who likes theatre must make an effort to see. Orange Tree, Richmond until May 8.

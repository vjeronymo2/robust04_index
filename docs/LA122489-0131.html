			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'CRITICS SAY SAT CAN BE USEFUL BUT IS OVERRATED'  </P> <P> Your article "Critics Say SAT Can Be Useful but Is Overrated" (Dec. 10) sheds  new light on the subject of the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Being a high school  student, I feel a great amount of pressure toward this one test. I realize this  test can significantly affect my college career and my life after college. I  understand that this test is a way for college admission officers to evaluate a  student's aptitude, yet I can't help feeling that this is unfair.  </P> <P> How can one test evaluate several years of education? It's scary knowing the  score you earn on this test will determine your life. Many of my schoolmates  sometimes are more concerned with the grade they receive in a class than what  is learned. Making the grade, sad but true, seems to be one of the highest  priorities to any college-bound student.  </P> <P> How can anyone expect students to perform well on the SAT if grades, not  quality learning, is stressed in today's educational system?  </P> <P> KAREN VILLANUEVA  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

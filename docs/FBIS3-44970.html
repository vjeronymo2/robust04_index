Ren  Jianxin, member of the secretariat and secretary of the Central  Commission on Politics and Law of the CPC Central Committee,  pointed out during the meeting: The major tasks of the politics  and law front in 1994 are to implement the guidelines of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; adhere  to the strategic principle of "building both material and  spiritual civilizations and attach equal importance to both";  meet the demands of establishing a socialist market economy;  improve and reform the work of politics and the law; strengthen  the functions of the people's democratic dictatorship; strike  resolute blows at hostile forces and crime; step up the  investigation and handling of major cases during the  anti-corruption struggle; make great, comprehensive efforts to  improve public order; provide more effective legal protection to  socialist market economy; and take a further step toward  maintaining political and social stability.    Luo Gan, state councillor and deputy secretary of the  Central  Commission on Politics and Law, presided over the meeting and  conveyed to it the important instruction on improving the work  of politics and the law issued recently by the Central Political  Bureau Standing Committee. Present at the meeting were nearly  200 responsible people from various provinces, autonomous  regions, municipalities, the People's Liberation Army, and  departments concerned.    Ren Jianxin said in his speech: The "Decision of the CPC  Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of  a Socialist Market Economic Structure," adopted by the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, is China's  general plan for establishing a socialist market economic  structure. It is our economic restructuring action program, as  well as work guidance for our politics and law front.    He pointed out: It is necessary to further mobilize the  force of the whole of society and pay attention to implementing  measures for comprehensive management of public security in the  new circumstances. He said: In the new circumstances in which  we are establishing a socialist market economic structure, the  comprehensive management of public security must be further  strengthened, not weakened even a bit. We should continue to  adhere to the principle of integrating special projects with the  mass line, mobilize more thoroughly forces in all quarters of  society to work on projects together at the grass-roots level,  and implement the measures for comprehensive management of  public security at the grass-roots level. We should seriously  study the new situation and new problems at work, overcome  difficulties and resistance, actively explore, and forge ahead.    Ren Jianxin fully affirmed the efforts made by the politics  and law front in cracking down on crime, maintaining stability,  and promoting reform, opening up, and economic construction over  the past year. After analyzing the current situation at home  and abroad, Ren Jianxin said: Next year will be a very  important and extremely crucial one for deepening reform and the  tasks of maintaining stability will be heavier and more urgent.  Following the continuous deepening of reform and the adjustment  of the relationship of interests, some new contradictions and  problems are bound to crop up. We must keep a clear head,  correctly analyze and size up the situation, be prepared for  danger in times of peace, and meticulously do a solid job of  maintaining social and political stability in order that we may  ensure the smooth development of a socialist market economy.    Ren Jianxin said: We must have a correct understanding of  the dialectical relationship of mutual promotion and mutual  integration among reform, opening up, economic development, and  social stability. It is definitely necessary for party and  government leaders at all levels to persist in the strategic  principle -- "attach equal importance to promoting reform and  opening up and to cracking down on all sorts of criminal  activity, and take a tough stand on both types of work" -- at  meetings, in documents, and, above all, in action. While  working successfully to implement reform and promote  development, they must conscientiously do a good job of building  spiritual civilization, improving the work of the ideological  and cultural fronts, and shouldering the political  responsibility of maintaining stability in a down-to-earth  manner.    Ren Jianxin stressed: We must correctly and properly handle  the contradictions among the people under the new situation and  enhance our capability of dealing with every contingency. Party  and government leaders at all levels must earnestly study the  characteristics of contradiction among the people under the new  situation as well as their forms of manifestation, the  conditions leading to their escalation, preventive measures, and  the methods to deal with them; they must spend time immersing  themselves in the masses to resolve contradictions, actively  prevent their escalation, and solve problems at the level of  grass roots units in a timely manner before they become too big.    Ren Jianxin called on the politics and law front to take an  active part in the anticorruption struggle and to concentrate  efforts on investigating and dealing with such big and important  cases of economic crime as corruption, bribery, and so on. He  said: As the politics and law departments undertake an important  task in the anticorruption struggle, they must not fail to  accomplish their mission and must live up to the expectations of  the people. It is necessary for party committees at all levels  and their politics and law commissions to strengthen leadership  in a down-to-earth manner, directly supervise the handling of  big and important cases, and support the politics and law  departments in breaking through various resistance, eliminating  all interference, and strictly enforcing the law. In compliance  with party discipline and national laws, they must mete out  stern punishment to those who stand in the way of the handling  cases and harbor corrupt elements.    Ren Jianxin pointed out: In a sense, there are more problems  concerning the management of public security now than those in  the period before the "harsh crackdown" drive was launched in  1993. Politics and law departments must resolutely correct the  problem caused by the ineffective crackdown, conscientiously  raise the level of the "harsh crackdown," and improve its  results so as to provide an environment in which the masses of  the people can live and work in peace and contentment. The  "harsh crackdown" in 1994 must focus on "cracking big cases,  dealing gangsters a blow, and chasing escaped criminals."  Directed against problems that stand out, strong and effective  measures must be taken to organize a concentrated crackdown or  special struggle to check the momentum of a sharp increase in  the number of big and abominable cases.    In addition, Ren Jianxin also expressed his views on the  issues of accelerating reform of politics and law work,  improving the discipline and work style of the political and  legal contingents, and strengthening and improving the party's  leadership over the politics and law work.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Two share 45% of new road contracts TWO CONTRACTORS have won nearly half of the main new motorway and road contracts awarded in the current fiscal year, David Owen writes. Balfour Beatty and Tarmac Construction won Pounds 161.6m of contract awards between them, equivalent to about 45 per cent of the total of more than Pounds 350m total. Two years ago the top two contractors - Balfour Beatty and Fairclough Civil Engineering - secured less than 29 per cent of work available, which amounted to more than Pounds 500m. The figures for the top 20 contractors in each of the past three years were a response to a written question by Mr Peter Pike, Labour MP for Burnley.</p>

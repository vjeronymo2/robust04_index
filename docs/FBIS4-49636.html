			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Every penny of the  income from the land sales, which is kept by the Land Fund on  behalf of the Chinese side of the Sino-British Land Commission,  belongs to the Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government of  Hong Kong, a Chinese official said here today. Lu Ping,  director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State  Council, was speaking at a discussion with members of the  preliminary working committee for the preparatory committee of  the future SAR, deputies to the Chinese National People's  Congress and members of the national committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference from the Hong Kong  region. The annex 3 to the Sino-British Joint Declaration says  that from the entry into force of the joint declaration until  June 30, 1997, premium income obtained by the British-Hong Kong  Government from land transactions shall, after deduction of the  average cost of land production, be shared equally between the  British-Hong Kong Government and the future SAR government. As  the future SAR government has not come into being, the share  belonging to the SAR Government is temporarily kept by the Land  Fund entrusted by the Chinese side of the Sino-British Land  Commission, Lu said. After the transfer of power in 1997, the  Sino-British Land Commission will be dismissed and the land  income kept by the Land Fund for the Chinese side will all be  immediately handed over and subject to the disposal to the SAR  government.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by O.K. Sklyarov; UDC 681.7.068] </F>   [Abstract] A new two-position optical lightguide switch has  been developed. The new switch is smaller and faster than  conventional optical switches based on electro-optical and  electro-acoustic effects. Specifically, the switch has a  relatively high speed, high beam deflection (on the order of  30), and low (no more than 0.1 W) control signal power. It  consists of a lightguide that serves as a common channel, has  the customary core and sheath, and is positioned coaxially with  a second lightguide. The plane of the exit end of the first  lightguide is sloped to its axis at at angle of  (_ps_-)/2-_P_,  and the plane of the entry end of the second lightguide is  normal to its axis. Alongside the second lightguide is a third  lightguide whose axis is sloped to the axis of the first two  lightguides at some angle _a_. As is the case for the second  lightguide, the entry end of the third lightguide is plane and  normal to its axis. The exit end of the first lightguide is  located some distance from the entry ends of the second and  third lightguides and forms an air gap. The lower part of the  gap is filled with an immersion fluid whose refractive index  n[.sub]1[/]' is selected to equal the refractive index of the  core n[.sub]1[/]. The amount of liquid is such that its  surface is below the lightguides' core. The path of radiation  entering and leaving the first lightguide is determined by  whether or not the fluid in the air gap expands to fill the  entire gap, thus blocking access to the entrance end of the  second lightguide. The fluid's expansion is in turn dictated by  the temperature to which the fluid is heated. The influence of  the capillary effect that is inevitable given the dimensions of  the lightguides used in fiber-optic communication is eliminated  by filling the space under the fluid with air at a positive  pressure of 1.5-2 atm. In addition to eliminating any capillary  effect, this positive pressure also helps accelerate  displacement of the fluid to its initial position after the  heating has ceased. Quartz lightguides with a refractive index  of 1.48 may be used for all three lightguides, and ordinary  anhydrous glycerin with a refractive index of 1.478 may be used  as the immersion fluid. The serviceability of the new switch as  a common, coaxial, and side channel was confirmed experimentally  by using lightguides with a core diameter of 200 m. It was  stressed that the immersion fluid need not be vaporized in order  for the switch to be serviceable; heating to temperatures of  50-70C is sufficient to increase the fluid's initial volume  sufficiently so that it will reach the top level. Such  temperatures may be reached in only 10-20 ns with a pulse energy  of no more than 10 J, which is easily accomplished by using  widely available semiconductor lasers.

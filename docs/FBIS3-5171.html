Army Col. Rudolfo Lorayes, 603rd Infantry Brigade chief, was  named as chairman with Capt. Filemon Saria and Sgt. Filemon Rowe  as members representing the government in the Maguindanao Joint  Cease Fire Subcommittee (MJCS). The MNLF counterparts are rebel  Colonel Hamid Piang, chairman, Major Abas Kalipha and Mustapha  Abdulwahab, members.    The MJCS, housed at the provincial capitol complex in Sultan  Kudarat town, was formed on 21 February, two days after the  MNLF-GRP main cease fire committee came here to probe the  renewed armed rift between Moro rebels and logging firm guards  in Maguindanao. The planned probe, however, has been stalled due  to the non- arrival here of some Indonesian Embassy officials  from Manila to represent the Organization of Islamic Conference  in the probe, local MNLF sources said.    It was not known whether the MJCS will be the one to pursue  the stalled probe as members of the GRP-MNLF main joint cease  fire committees had returned to Zamboanga after the MJCS was  formed.    The probe was sought by MNLF Secretary-General Muslimen  Sema,  who had expressed alarm over the renewed rift between Moro  Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels and guards of the  Cotabato Timberland Company, Inc. (CTCI) in Buldon and Barira  towns.    The skirmishes recurred when MILF rebels reportedly raided  last 27 January three CTCI checkpoints and an Army detachment in  Barira town, killing a CTCI guard and wounding another. [passage  omitted]    The MILF had accused the military of being "partisan" with  the CTCI in the rift, which stemmed from the MILF's objection to  the CTCl's alleged intrusion into MILF lairs and watershed areas  in Buldon and Barira towns. The military denied the accusation,  saying its presence in the area was for "peace keeping" as  sought by the people there.    The CTCI and the MILF had recently forged a peace truce with  the intercession of some Muslim leaders. But Murad said the  rift will remain until the CTCI leaves Maguindanao. Maguindanao  Governor Norodin Matalan has also demanded the cancellation of  the CTCI's timber License Agreement and its ejection from his  province.</p>

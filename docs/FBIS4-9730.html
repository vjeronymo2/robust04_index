			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico and Canada have signed an agreement to  initiate mobile satellite communication tests and a program to  check cellular phone services to be provided through the  Solidaridad-1 satellite's L-band. These services include radio  frequency links, radio communications networks for ships at sea,  and monitoring systems for mobile units. The agreement was  signed on 24 March by Telecommunications of Mexico (Telecom) and  TMI Communications, Inc., a Canadian telecommunications  enterprise.    Meanwhile, the trilateral transport meeting scheduled to be  held by Emilio Gamboa, Federico Pena, and Doug Young, the  transport secretaries for Mexico, United States, and Canada,  respectively, was postponed yesterday. The meeting planned to  study the possibility of facilitating the transit of cargo  between the three countries. "In solidarity with the Mexican  people's mourning, however, the ministers of Canada and United  States asked the Mexican secretary to postpone the meeting," the  Communications and Transport Secretariat has reported.    The tests outlined in the agreement between Mexico and  Canada  will be conducted with the Solidaridad satellite and the  Canadian enterprise's control center, and they will serve to  check the operation of various types of L-band mobile telephones  throughout national territory. This band permits mobile phone  communications and the transmission of data for ground, air, and  maritime units, as well as rural telephone communications to  small and faraway communities.    Meanwhile in Vancouver, Sheila Copps, Canadian deputy prime  minister and minister for environment, and Carlos Rojas  Gutierrez, Mexican secretary for social development, reached an  agreement on the installation of the Environmental Commission of  North America, which will be created in accordance with NAFTA's  Parallel Agreement on Environment. The commission's initial  duty will be to make proposals in the areas of ecosystems  conservation and protection, to hold consultations related to  NAFTA, to enforce regulations, to prevent pollution, to  stimulate technological cooperation and institutional training,  and to deal with border issues.</p>

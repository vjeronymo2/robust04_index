			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER TITLE ISN'T IN CARDS AS STANFORD LEFT OUT IN THE COLD  </P> <P> Stanford, two-time defending national champion, was not included in the 48-team  Division I field for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball tournament  announced Monday.  </P> <P> Included are USC, Pepperdine, Cal State Long Beach and Loyola Marymount.  </P> <P> Eight six-team regionals will begin Thursday and Friday, the winners of the  three-day, double-elimination tournaments advancing to the College World  Series, June 2-10 in Omaha, Neb.  </P> <P> USC (41-23), 11-time national champion, is seeded third in the Midwest Regional  beginning Friday at Austin, Tex. The Trojans, third in the Pacific 10 Southern  Division, open against Western Michigan (38-13-2), in a regional that also  includes Texas, Oklahoma State, New Orleans and Sam Houston State.  </P> <P> Pepperdine (41-17-1), West Coast Athletic Conference champion, is seeded fourth  in the West II Regional at Fresno. The Waves open Friday against Michigan  (47-14) in a regional that includes Wichita State, Fresno State, Portland and  Notre Dame.  </P> <P> Long Beach (46-13), co-champion of the Big West Conference and seeded third in  the West I Regional Friday at Tucson, Ariz., opens against Hawaii (40-25).  Loyola (37-22), WCAC runner-up, plays Oklahoma (43-17). The regional also  includes Arizona and Eastern Kentucky.  </P> <P> Unlike the last two years, when it selected four teams from the Pac-10 Southern  Division, the selection committee bypassed Stanford, which will miss a regional  for the first time since 1980.  </P> <P> Stanford (30-28) was 12-18 in conference play and 27-28 against Division I  opponents. The Cardinal, however, won nine of its last 10 and played 46 of its  58 games against teams that were ranked in the top 30 at some point in the  season, including 32 against teams that were in the top 10.  </P> <P> Arizona State, five-time national champion with a 40-17 record, has not  traveled to a regional in 25 years, but is seeded second in the Northeast  Regional at Waterbury, Conn. The Sun Devils will play George Washington (30-22)  Thursday.  </P> <P> Notre Dame won four games in 22 hours 9 minutes last Saturday to win the  Midwestern Collegiate Conference tournament at South Bend, Ind., qualifying for  the NCAA tournament for the first time in 19 years.  </P> <P> The victory run began at 1:38 a.m. and included wins over Dayton (20-4),  Evansville (11-2) and a doubleheader sweep (4-1 and 21-10) of the University of  Detroit that ended at 11:47 p.m.  </P> <P> The Dayton game ended at 4:21 a.m. with about 200 fans -- culled by radio  announcements and campus word-of-mouth -- in the bleachers. The Irish were back  in uniform at 2:30 for the game with Evansville.  </P> <P> The Irish, who beat Butler in the conference tournament opener last Wednesday,  needed to win five straight games after losing to Detroit in 10 innings on  Thursday. Friday night, they beat St. Louis, 10-6, before a 4 1/2-hour rain  delay postponed the scheduled start of their game against Dayton.  </P> <P> Notre Dame (47-17-1) meets ninth-ranked Fresno State (42-17) in the West II  Regional Friday at Fresno.  </P></p>

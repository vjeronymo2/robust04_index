			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> RAMPAL FLUTE RECITAL AT AMBASSADOR AUDITORIUM  </P> <P> Flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal's appearance at Ambassador Auditorium Thursday  evening added little that was especially notable to his outstanding, 44-year  career. Although it is evident that he is still a commanding virtuoso, the  evening was not without problems.  </P> <P> His frequent sniffling and coughing between movements indicated that the  68-year-old Frenchman was suffering from a cold. The ailment undoubtedly  contributed to a general lack of concentration and weak tone throughout most of  the first half of the recital, dedicated to sonatas by Handel and Leclair.  </P> <P> Yet the spirited attention Rampal gave Telemann's Sonata in F affirmed his  reputation as an enthusiast of the Baroque era, though not a purist. His style  of precise phrasing, consistent in every octave and dynamic level, continues to  offer dazzling displays, not sacrificing refinement.  </P> <P> The only 20th-Century offering, David Diamond's Sonata (1986-87), added mild  spice to a program that otherwise offered few surprises. Written for Rampal,  the four-movement, neo-classic study playfully deals with an austere choice of  melodic elements, sometimes overstating them.  </P> <P> Rampal gave the work an apt reading, soaring through difficult passages  competently.  </P> <P> John Steele Ritter offered reliable, steady accompaniment on the piano. His  work on harpsichord during the Baroque set also impressed with his seamless  phrasings and finesse.  </P> <P> The sumptuousness of Kuhlau's Introduction and Rondo, Opus 98, and extended  techniques of Akio Yashiro's quirky flute arrangement of Antonio Bazzini's  violin show-piece "Le ronde des lutins" proved flashy additions. Three encores  of popular classics completed the program. GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

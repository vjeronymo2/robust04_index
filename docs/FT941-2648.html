			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Vinten hit by exceptional costs - Pounds 6m fall after losses on disposal of electro-optics operations Vinten, the restructured camera mountings and surveillance systems group, yesterday reported a decline in pre-tax profits in 1993 to Pounds 4.21m after exceptional charges totalling Pounds 10.4m - mostly related to the disposal of the lossmaking electro-optics operations. The fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.2m in 1992 came despite operating profits up 38 per cent to Pounds 15.6m. This reflected strong growth in the core broadcast systems and photographic businesses, acquisitions and exchange rate movements, which added about Pounds 2m to profits. Turnover grew by 21 per cent to Pounds 93.4m (Pounds 77.3m), including a Pounds 18.1m contribution from acquisitions and Pounds 3.58m from discontinued operations. Earnings per share fell to 6.1p (21.7p). Nevertheless, a 5.7p final dividend is recommended making a total of 7.8p (7p). The broadcast systems division, strengthened by the acquisitions of Internet Videocommunications in the UK and Total Spectrum Manufacturing in the US, reported trading profits up 42 per cent to Pounds 4.49m on turnover which grew by 39 per cent to Pounds 33.8m. In the photographic business, which now accounts for more than 50 per cent of group profits, Gruppo Manfrotto based in Italy had another strong year. Trading profits increased by 40 per cent to Pounds 8.53m on turnover up 53 per cent to Pounds 35.9m. W Vinten also performed well lifting the surveillance systems profits by 28 per cent to Pounds 21.89m despite a 4 per cent decline in turnover to Pounds 20.1m. Despite spending Pounds 14.2m on acquisitions - excluding the TSM acquisition which was funded with shares - year end net debt increased by just Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 11.4m, equivalent to gearing of 44.9 per cent. COMMENT Yesterday's 6p rise in Vinten's shares to 520p was well deserved and reflected market satisfaction with the group's underlying performance. The exit from the lossmaking defence-related electro-optical businesses in September was welcome. Meanwhile Vinten has made astute acquisitions in areas it knows well and which should have good growth prospects. The UK and Italian manufacturing operations should continue to benefit from soft currencies helping the group further expand its US and east Asia sales which already account for 62 per cent of the total. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 16.5m look possible this year generating earnings of 33.4p. The shares are trading on a forward multiple of 15.6 and look moderately cheap.</p>

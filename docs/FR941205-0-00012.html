			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many other comments criticized this provision as unduly punitive because many asylum applicants have limited education, are unfamiliar with United States laws, and rely on those who claim to be qualified to assist them with their asylum applications. Such applicants should not be subject to prosecution if there are errors in the application. Some comments asserted that this provision will prevent applicants from obtaining help in completing their applications. In addition, one comment claimed that those assisting applicants might fear reprisal from their own governments if their role in assisting asylum applicants were known. Another stated that organizations may not wish to sign the forms because of their unwillingness to incur potential liability for an inaccurate representation not known to them. One comment argued that subjecting persons other than the applicant to penalty of perjury places an undue burden on attorneys and translators who are assisting applicants but can do little to verify the veracity of the applicants' statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments made several recommendations directed at protecting applicants and the individuals and organizations who assist applicants. One comment recommended that only the preparers, not the applicants, should sign the asylum application subject to a penalty of perjury because genuine asylum-seekers, particularly those that do not speak English, may be unaware of the actions of an unprincipled preparer. One comment advocated that those who prepare asylum applications without charging the applicant a fee should not be required to sign the form. Another comment suggested that if an improperly prepared asylum application is not signed by the preparer, the asylum officer should ask the applicant who prepared the application. With the applicant's permission, the asylum officer then could relay the information about the preparer to the appropriate local INS enforcement division.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, two comments asserted that the signature requirement is too broad. The comments claimed that the signature requirement in the proposed rule is more sweeping than the requirement on the form itself, and that it fails to specify the degree of assistance that triggers the necessity to sign the form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response and Disposition:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirement that the applicant and outside preparers sign the Form I&hyph;589 under penalty of perjury is necessary and appropriate for several reasons. An asylum applicant is seeking an important benefit and should be required to provide only truthful information to the Government. The evidentiary rules for adjudicating asylum applications treat the credible testimony of the applicant as sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of proof and thus there should be appropriate consequences for making false statements. Those who assist in preparing applications also should bear these consequences if they have knowingly included false information on the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fact that a signature is made under penalty of perjury does not, of course, alter the Government's burden to establish the elements of the crime in the event of prosecution. Many of the objections raised in the comments would apply to situations where perjury could not be proved. Nevertheless, those applying for asylum and those who assist others in doing so should have the same obligation to make truthful statements as persons who make other applications to the Government. These provisions of the proposed rule will be adopted in the final rule, with amendments for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> e. Incomplete Applications (8 CFR 208.3(c)(5) and 8 CFR 208.3(c)(6))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 208.3(c)(5) of the proposed rule stated that an application that is incomplete or lacks a response to each of the enumerated questions may be referred to an immigration judge for adjudication or may be denied by the asylum officer. Section 208.3(c)(6) defined an incomplete application as one that does not include a response to each of the questions contained in the Form I&hyph;589, that is unsigned, that is unaccompanied by the required materials specified in paragraph (a) of this section, or that is unaccompanied by the required fee or application for fee waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous comments criticized these provisions for establishing overly harsh penalties and for not including a sufficiently clear definition of what constitutes an incomplete application. The comments claimed that an application may be denied or referred because minor or irrelevant questions were not answered. The comments suggested that the applicant be given a chance to remedy such an omission. The comments also questioned whether an application would be deemed incomplete if certain questions were answered but the responses lacked substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments agreed that incomplete applications should not be adjudicated and recommended amendments to the rule. One comment suggested that this provision be moved to a new subsection and labelled ``Summary Disposition_Action on Incomplete Forms.'' Another comment suggested that the term ``incomplete'' be deleted from the final rule in order to restrict the rule to allow denial or referral only when the applicant has been completely unresponsive to a question. A third comment advocated that incomplete applications be returned to the applicant, rather than denying them or referring them to an immigration judge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

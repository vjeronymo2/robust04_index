			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA notes that the ``amenable'' spectrophotometric methods,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASTM D2036&hyph;91B and SM 4500&hyph;CN&hyph;G, also require distillation prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to either free or total cyanide measurements. To further clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's intent to require manual distillation for all spectrophotometric determinations of cyanide, these methods will be listed at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 141.23(k) in today's rule under the phrase ``Manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distillation followed by''. Immediately following this phrase,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rules specify use of SM 4500&hyph;CN&hyph;C to conduct this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distillation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Microbiological Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The vast majority of comments on the eighteenth edition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> version of microbiology methods concerned the maximum time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between sample collection and analysis (transit time) of drinking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water samples. Commenters opposed reducing this time from 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours (16th edition of Standard Methods) to 24 hours (18th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> edition of Standard Methods). The Standard Methods committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced the transit time because of its concern about coliform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> die-off in the sample over time. Commenters opposed reducing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time because it would (1) be logistically impractical if not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impossible to do, (2) increase costs for sample transport and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resampling, (3) cause hardships in sample collection, and (4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complicate and decrease laboratory flexibility. A few commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimed that the reduced transit time is not supported by data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coliforms usually die off over time, especially when water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperatures are warm, but EPA recognizes that there is debate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among investigators over the rate of that decline. EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently conducting additional studies on this question, using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fecal coliforms and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and results are anticipated by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of 1994. Given the logistical and other problems that might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result by decreasing the transit time to 24 hours, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deferring a decision on whether to reduce the transit time until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more data become available. For the time being, the Agency has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added a footnote to the Table in &sect;141.21(f)(3), allowing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum transit time of 30 hours. If EPA decides that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction from 30 hours is warranted, the Agency will work with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the States to minimize the hardships identified in the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments. Meanwhile, EPA strongly encourages States and systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to review their procedures and identify practical alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for providing samples to laboratories more quickly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters objected to the requirement in the 18th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> edition of Standard Methods to hold samples at less than 10  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during transit. The Standard Methods committee specified this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value because of its concern about coliform die-off in the sample  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at higher temperatures, where the bacterial metabolism of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coliforms and non-coliforms alike is normally greater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters objected to any EPA requirement that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require them to keep samples cool during sample transit. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asserted that this requirement would (1) be unnecessary and would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complicate sample transport logistics, (2) increase sampling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs and shipping costs for both systems and laboratories,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because coolers and ice packs cost money and samples are heavier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and thus more expensive to ship, and (3) lead to problems with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frozen samples or a significantly increased number of invalid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> samples. Commenters also stated that under the presence-absence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concept, sample cooling was less important than under the earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule based on coliform density.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is deferring a decision on sample transit temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until the Agency initiates a review, and possible revision, of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Total Coliform Rule. For the time being, the Agency has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added a footnote to the Table in &sect;141.21(f)(3) encouraging, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not requiring, systems to hold samples at less than 10  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transit. Nevertheless, the Agency strongly encourages systems to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cool their samples during transit, especially during warm summer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months, to minimize coliform die-off. The Agency is currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducting additional studies on this question, using fecal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coliforms and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and results are anticipated by the end of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994. If EPA decides that a reduction is warranted, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will work with the States to minimize the hardships identified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

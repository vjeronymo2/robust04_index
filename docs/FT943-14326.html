			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / MPs say recycling can be harmful Recycling waste can be more harmful to the environment than incinerating it, the Commons committee on the environment said yesterday. In its report on recycling the committee strongly urges the government to investigate the merits of burning waste in order to recover energy. The report's 46 recommendations also encourage households and companies to reduce the amount of waste they produce by improving efficiency. The committee says government targets of recycling a quarter of household waste by the year 2000 are 'helpful in achieving a step-change in the level of recycling' but it warns of the danger of 'a counter culture of recycling for its own sake, no matter what the cost is in energy or money'. Recycling is one of the government's most popular environmental policies. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said yesterday that '94 per cent of people (are) convinced that recycling is important'. Industry groups such as the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors say that some recycling, particularly of household waste, consumes more natural resources than it saves. Many local authorities which promote recycling have found it difficult to identify markets for the products. The committee says the case for recycling 'appears to be most clear for metals'. Recycling aluminium, it says, consumes 95 per cent less energy than manufacturing aluminium from bauxite ore. But in some schemes for recycling paper and plastics 'the energy consumed in cleaning, collecting and recycling the material may be greater than that used to manufacture the same product from virgin material'. The report says that while 45 per cent of glass collected in bottle banks is green, mainly from wine bottles, there is limited demand for products made from green glass. The committee argues strongly against the imposition of a levy on landfills, a measure ministers are considering in order to encourage recycling. New regulations on landfill management, which came into force on May 1, will in any case raise landfill costs, it says. Recycling - Second Report. Environment Committee. HMSO. Pounds 15.60.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / EC concedes Bosnia plan is in tatters: Izetbegovic to meet ministers on drive for new settlement THE European Community was last night struggling to salvage something from the wreckage of its Bosnian peace plan as Lord Owen urged it to focus its efforts on the creation of a 'viable mini-state' for the Bosnian Moslems. Meeting on the eve of today's Copenhagen summit, EC foreign ministers heard a call from the Community's peace envoy for a determined effort to end the war in the former Yugoslav republic before the winter. Bosnia's Moslem President Alia Izetbegovic will fly to Copenhagen today for talks with EC ministers about the latest efforts to agree a peace settlement. Lord Owen indicated to ministers that the international community had no choice but to acknowledge, if not condone, the realities imposed by Serbian aggression. He said pressure on Serbia and Croatia should now be directed towards securing a viable state for the Moslems. He said the EC should strengthen his hand in this week's resumed Geneva peace talks by agreeing to keep sanctions in place until such a deal was agreed by Serbian and Croatian forces. The new Moslem state would need guaranteed access to the Adriatic and to the River Danube  - a guarantee that the EC should underwrite by, if necessary, threatening Croatia with the imposition of economic sanctions. Lord Owen's comments  - marking public recognition that the Vance-Owen plan for a multi-ethnic Bosnian republic cannot be resurrected  - left EC leaders with the unenviable task of packaging the failure of the strategy launched two years ago in Luxembourg. The peace envoy, who saw any remaining hopes for the original Vance-Owen plan undercut by last week's partition deal in Geneva between Serbia and Croatia, admitted the creation of a Bosnian republic for the Moslems would leave Serbia with the rewards of aggression. But he said: 'You can't hold out for the ideal when you are not going to get it. . . This thing has got to be settled. The war has got to be brought to an end before the winter'. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, yesterday voiced the fears of several leaders that public recognition of Bosnian partition would create 'unimaginable' precedents. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, defended the EC's role in Bosnia and said the Community would focus on new methods to prevent a recurrence of the conflict in former Yugoslavia.</p>

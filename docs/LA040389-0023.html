			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN AFGHAN ACT II, LET U.S. BE WARY OF FRIENDS' AIMS  </P> <P> With the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the curtain fell on Act I of  Afghanistan's latest drama. Act II, the competition of outsiders for influence  over the new government, is now under way. How Afghanistan's future is resolved  -- Act III -- will depend on whether influence becomes domination.  </P> <P> The outcome may be even more important for the region's politics than was the  superpower struggle over Afghanistan itself. Overreaching by some of the  regional contenders for influence could prove destructive in terms of their  broader security and other interests. The United States could lose much if the  ambitions of its regional allies lead to developments that, instead of  stabilizing Afghanistan, help to destabilize the entire region.  </P> <P> There is precedent for this prediction. During the 1970s, Saudi Arabia and Iran  tried to transform Afghanistan's politics and its foreign-policy orientation,  in particular to bring about greater distance between Afghanistan and the  Soviet Union. But this attempt only contributed to events that finally produced  the Soviet invasion of 1979.  </P> <P> Now there is risk that efforts by outsiders to impose a government of their  liking in Kabul could have other unforeseen and potentially damaging  consequences. At the very least, such efforts would delay national  reconciliation in Afghanistan, and they could even lead to endemic civil war  along the lines of Lebanon.  </P> <P> It is no secret that the interim government, formed by seven rebel groups, does  not enjoy the support of the majority of the Afghans. For example, Shiite  Muslims, who make up 15% to 25% of the population, are not represented in this  government. Even the relatively moderate Afghan groups in Peshawar are not  totally behind it, nor are many of the local rebel commanders.  </P> <P> This lack of cohesion is caused in part by traditional Afghan rivalries. But  the interim government is also widely viewed as the handmaiden of a  collaboration between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and therein lies its cardinal  weakness.  </P> <P> Both countries are pursuing major goals. Pakistan aspires to gain dominant  influence over a future government in Kabul, in part to avoid difficulties like  the persistent Afghan efforts to create an independent "Pushtunistan" out of  Pakistani territory. The Saudis chiefly want to block any increase of Iranian  influence. In addition to supporting the interim government, the Saudis have  been promoting fundamentalist Wahabbi missionary activity in Afghanistan as  part of broader religious proselytizing in south and central Asia.  </P> <P> Such aggressively pursued ambitions are bound to generate responses by other  states in the region. India is unlikely to sit still in the face of Pakistani  efforts to turn Afghanistan into a satellite. Nor would Iran acquiesce to the  disfranchisement of Shiite Muslims by the Sunni Muslim majority in a  Saudi-Pakistan dominion over Afghanistan.  </P> <P> It is conceivable that India and Iran would cooperate in blocking  Saudi-Pakistan ambitions. Such cooperation would be facilitated if the current  trend in Soviet-Iranian rapprochement continues, especially if their reported  arms deal materializes. Backed by the Soviet Union, an Indo-Iranian alliance  would shift the balance of regional power against Pakistan and would put it in  a difficult strategic position by flanking it with two hostile neighbors. India  and Iran could also manipulate Pakistan's Pathan and Baluchi minorities, thus  increasing the chances for internal instability.  </P> <P> Rather than risking these consequences, Pakistan should develop an Afghan  policy that serves its legitimate interests. It does have a right to demand  that a future Afghan government unequivocally recognize the current border and  abandon any ambitions to create an independent Pushtunistan. But if Pakistan  goes further, or if it aids and abets broader Saudi objectives, it will be  asking for trouble -- for itself and for others, including the United States.  </P> <P> Creating stability in Afghanistan and keeping its problems from spilling over  onto the rest of the region require respect for two basic rules. First, a  future Afghan government must be as representative of the country's diverse  ethnic and religious makeup as possible, and it must not be dominated by a  single group or political or religious tendency. Second, that government must  be nonaligned, not only in regard to ties with the superpowers, but also in its  relations with countries in the region.  </P> <P> For its part, the United States is legitimately entitled to an adequate  presence in a nonaligned Afghanistan. Beyond this goal, however, U.S. interests  and the ambitions of its regional allies do not necessarily coincide.  Certainly, the United States has no interest in seeing religious extremism  spread in Afghanistan and Pakistan, whether Shiite or Wahabbi. Nor does it have  an interest in seeing Pakistan's relations deteriorate with two important  neighbors, India and Iran. And an Indo-Iranian cooperation blessed by the  Soviets would not serve U.S. interests in South Asia.  </P> <P> The United States is thus in the difficult position of relying on others to  determine whether its interests in Afghanistan will be protected. While it  attempts to sort out just what it wants there, it must be clear about what it  does not want: to be misled by the parochial interests and ambitions of  regional allies.  </P></p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Bonds on the block Gilts auctions are turning out to be a poor indicator of what the future holds. Disappointing bidding at last month's auction was followed by a sustained rally. Healthy demand for the Pounds 3.5bn stock on offer yesterday was not enough to stop gilts prices sliding back. The Bank of England should anyway be pleased with the outcome of its biggest ever auction. With Pounds 40bn funding in the bag, and the long end of the market still hungry for supply, it can well afford to skip an auction in November. Still, one might wonder whether yesterday's setback carries a warning. The proximate cause was weakness in European markets. Investors concluded - with encouragement from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president - that continental interest rates will not fall as rapidly as hitherto expected. The bull run in European bond markets has been supported by fickle international investors. That trend is clearly evident in UK gilts and yesterday's auction seems to have attracted its fair share of footloose international cash. These investors will be quick to switch allegiance if expectations of lower interest rates look likely to be disappointed. The latest gloomy CBI survey if anything strengthens the argument in favour of lower UK base rates. Expectations of falling unit costs among manufacturers suggest inflationary pressures remain subdued. But with a half-point cut already priced into short-dated gilts, it may take more than a token easing to keep the bargain-hunters keen.</p>

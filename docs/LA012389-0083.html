			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRAMA WAS HIGH, BUT NOT VOICE  </P> <P> A new Queen of the Night brought dramatic and textual insights hitherto lacking  in the role at New York City Opera's second (and final) presentation of  Mozart's "Die Zauberflote" Friday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center  in Costa Mesa. But the vocalism was far from ideal.  </P> <P> As the arch-villain of Mozart's Masonic opera, Virginia Sublett revealed new  aspects of character each time she appeared -- from plaintive, grief-burdened,  sly manipulator (first aria); to coercive, forceful tyrant (second aria); to  cold, contemptuous, even petulant conspirator (finale).  </P> <P> It was an insightful, valuable tracing of character.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, although she offered rich, sonorous, dark-hued vocalism in  mid-range, Sublett experienced severe problems whenever she ventured too far  above the staff. Pitch and focus blurred whenever the voice ascended to a high  C and above. She also had problems with agility and connected phrases, although  she recovered nicely in "Der Holle rache" after some unfortunate sequences of  wide-spreading tone.  </P> <P> The rest of the cast was previously reviewed. Sergiu Comissiona again  conducted. CHRIS PASLES  </P></p>

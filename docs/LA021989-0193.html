			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON IS FORCED TO GO TO OT TO BEAT SAN JOSE STATE, 70-69  </P> <P> Tom Desiano's shot was nothing more than a 12-foot jumper, but it made the  Civic Auditorium crowd come alive.  </P> <P> It came with 55 seconds left in San Jose State's game against Cal State  Fullerton Saturday night, and it gave the Spartans a one-point lead, their  first of the game.  </P> <P> It also put victory into the minds of most of the crowd of 1,874, who  ultimately were let down. San Jose State, a team made up mostly of football  players, a team manager and assorted other walk-ons since 10 players started a  boycott in protest of Coach Bill Berry last month, has lost its last 13 games,  including eight since the walkout.  </P> <P> This one, a 70-69 Fullerton victory in overtime, was the closest yet. Johnny  Johnson, who as a Spartan tailback led the Big West Conference in rushing, hit  the first of two free throws with 8 seconds left to tie the score. But he  missed the second, and the game went to overtime.  </P> <P> San Jose (5-19, 1-14) had a 69-67 lead as overtime ran down, but Fullerton's  John Sykes rebounded Cedric Ceballos' miss in the final seconds and went up for  a backwards dunk. An official called a foul on the play, and Sykes hit a free  throw with 1 second remaining, saving the Titans the humiliation of becoming  the first team to lose to San Jose State's makeshift bunch.  </P> <P> "Games like this, you wish nobody lost," said Berry, whom the boycotting  players accused of extreme verbal abuse. "Under the situation, under the  circumstances, I may be doubly disappointed that we couldn't get over the hump  just for the kids. I certainly could have used the boost, too."  </P> <P> Craig McPherson led San Jose with 20 points. Derek Jones, who with Cedric  Ceballos led Fullerton with 19 points, said the team had improved "maybe 100%."  </P> <P> The Titans (12-11, 7-7) had to hang on to win despite shooting 56% in the game,  their highest percentage of the season. Fullerton took a 27-13 lead at the  outset, making 12 of its first 13 shots, with the only miss because of  offensive basket interference.  </P> <P> San Jose trailed by only three at halftime, but was down by 10 with 12 minutes  to play.  </P> <P> "There are a million things you can say, 'What if, what if,' Berry said. "I'll  be doing that tonight. I just hope (the players) don't."  </P></p>

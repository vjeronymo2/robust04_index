			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Kashmir--Amanullah's Role"] </F>   [Text] Amanullah Khan, Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front  [JKLF] Chairman, has announced that his political ideology is  guided by an ideology based on the spirit of freedom,  patriotism, and complete sovereignty of the Jammu and Kashmir  state. He emphasized that not only the JKLF leadership but also  a majority of members from other parties are in favor of the  "third option." He added that he has been supporting this  ideology for three decades. So far as his statement that he has  been propagating the ideology for the full sovereignty of  Kashmir for three decades is concerned, it is imperative to note  that the "third option" rubbish is both illogical and  unjustifiable. This is due not only to the fact that it is  against Pakistan's security, the formula for the partition of  the Indian subcontinent, and UN resolutions, it is also against  the spirit of the Kashmiri people witnessed in the form of a  freedom movement since the time of the Dogra rulers. The  Kashmiri people have also been shown this spirit in the hoisting  of the Pakistani flag in occupied Kashmir on Pakistan's national  day, ignoring the rain of bullets and curfew restrictions.  Until today, the Kashmiri people have raised only one voice,  that is, annexation with Pakistan through a plebiscite.  Amanullah Khan, who is raising his voice for a sovereign  Kashmir against this "popular will" of the Kashmiri people, is  actively clamoring for it at a time when the United States is  also exerting pressure for some solution. And the American  attempt is apparently aimed at imposing India over China's head  through a sovereign Kashmir [sentence as published].    Even if we accept that Amanullah Khan has been recommending  the third option for three decades, he cannot be justified in  propagating this idea. Which democracy permits the domination  of a baseless ideology of any so-called leader against the  wishes of the people and the interest of the nation? The  reality is that the people of Kashmir are opting to join  Pakistan. Of course, if any leader wants the third option, it  is entirely a different matter which has nothing to do with the  spirit of the Kashmiri people. The sole objective of having a  sovereign Kashmir state is to make this region a base for  American conspiracies against Pakistan and China. The people of  Kashmir also have faith in the ideology of the father of the  nation, the great leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah, that Kashmir is  the jugular vein of Pakistan. In addition to the parties taking  part in the freedom movement, every Kashmiri wants to seek help  from Pakistan alone at this delicate moment. The reason is that  every Kashmiri considers himself a Pakistani and the basic  element of their freedom movement is exercising the right to  self-determination and making Kashmir a part of Pakistan. In  the craze for building his own sandcastle, Amanullah Khan cannot  mutilate the history of the freedom movement of Kashmir, nor can  the so-called ideology he has recommended get the approval of  the people of Kashmir. The JKLF itself in the occupied valley  does not support a sovereign Kashmir. The viewpoint of the  Kashmiris is quite clear.  *</p>

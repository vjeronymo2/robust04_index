			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has reached these conclusions based on modeling analyses of the impact of emissions reduction strategies for this region. For purposes of its modeling studies, EPA considered the impact of various strategies in the year 2005. Focusing first on the impact in 2005 is reasonable because by then all control measures explicitly mandated in subpart 2 of part D of the Act will be in place. EPA can thereby analyze more precisely what reductions beyond those already explicitly required will be needed. Since two of the three core severe nonattainment areas in the urban corridor along the East Coast from Washington D.C. to Boston have an attainment deadline of 2005, it is by this date that the Clean Air Act mandates severe area controls to be in place. These areas are the Baltimore and Philadelphia areas. The New York-New Jersey-Connecticut severe area has the slightly later attainment deadline of 2007 due to its higher ozone design value. EPA also focused on this year in its studies in part because the OTC's modeling committee asked that EPA do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to note, however, that for purposes of this step in the analysis, the year that is the subject of the study does not affect the magnitude of necessary emissions reductions. This is because the precise question in this step is what reductions are needed from a 1990 baseline emissions inventory in order for each of the nonattainment areas in the OTR to come into attainment. For purposes of this analysis, EPA assumes that all growth in emissions since 1990 must be neutralized in addition to achieving the requisite emissions reductions from the 1990 baseline. That is, EPA's conclusion is that emission reductions on the order of 50% to 75% in VOC (primarily in the urban areas and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (regionally) are needed in the OTR to reach attainment, and that growth in emissions since 1990 must be neutralized in addition to the 50% to 75% reductions. Of course, in later years the amount of growth that must be neutralized on top of the 50% to 75% reductions will increase. But the conclusion that 50% to 75% reductions from the 1990 baseline are needed remains constant over time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Analytical Modeling Tools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two basic atmospheric modeling tools are used to analyze the need for and effectiveness of various emissions reduction strategies to attain the ozone NAAQS. These are both photochemical grid models into which information regarding the atmosphere and emissions is input for subunits in a grid that encompasses a particular area, or ``domain.'' The model is designed to measure the impact of changes in emissions input for each subunit on the grid. An important aspect of the models is the set of assumptions regarding the air that enters the modeling domain at its boundaries, commonly referred to as ``boundary conditions.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The two basic models used to analyze ozone pollution in the northeast United States are the Urban Airshed Model (UAM) and the Regional Oxidant Model (ROM). The key differences between these models are the size of the modeling domain and the resolution of information about subunits in the photochemical grid. The resolution depends on the size of the overall domain. As their names indicate, the UAM is an urban scale model that yields more precise information about particular urban areas, and the ROM is a broader regional model that is more useful for assessing regional impacts. The UAM generally involves a modeling domain on the order of 200 km on a side, with a horizontal resolution of five km or better and five or more vertical layers. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  EPA is using a ROM to analyze the domain encompassing the United States east of 99W longitude, covering approximately the eastern half of the country. Horizontal resolution is approximately 18 km, with three vertical layers considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Grid models, such as the UAM and the ROM, entail superimposing a 3-dimensional box over the area to be modeled. This box is subdivided into grid cells. The model predicts average concentration within each cell for each hour of a simulation. The spatial resolution possible with a model is defined by the size of these individual grid cells. The models do not allow one to draw conclusions about concentrations averaged over areas which are smaller than the size of the individual grid cells.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The UAM is particularly useful to demonstrate with fine resolution whether urban areas will achieve attainment using a particular emissions reduction strategy, based on assumptions about the boundary conditions of the UAM domain. The ROM is useful for assessing the relationship between UAM domains and what is happening in the broader region to determine appropriate boundary conditions for UAM modeling. The function of ROM applications for developing attainment strategies is to provide boundary conditions for the UAM analyses. Essentially, boundary conditions are estimates of the amount of ozone and ozone precursors entering each of the UAM domains from upwind. Boundary conditions reflect the cumulative effect of pollutant transport as well as control measures and growth applied in upwind areas. Upwind areas for purposes of the ROM analysis include upwind UAM domains, portions of the OTR outside the UAM domains, and the eastern U.S. outside the OTR. The boundary conditions resulting from these ROM simulations serve as an important input to the states' UAM analyses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Modeling using the UAM and ROM tools is an iterative process. First, UAM yield information about the strategies and impacts of strategies in smaller areas. The information from these models can then be fed into the ROM to yield information about the collective impact of the UAM assumptions throughout the region. The strategies in each area impact other areas downwind as the air moves from one area to another. The ROM then yields information about the appropriate boundary conditions to be input into the next round of each area's UAM. Each iteration in this process yields more refined information about the effect of strategies in the UAM domains and the appropriate boundary conditions for each UAM domain. In sum, the UAM is useful to assess the precise strategies in isolated nonattainment areas; the ROM is useful to assess the relationship between areas in light of their interdependence because of a common transported air mass throughout the region and to provide boundary conditions for further UAM modeling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Clean Air Act requires that the states submit modeled demonstrations of attainment to EPA on or before November 15, 1994. As described, states will be using the UAM with input from the ROM applications to make these modeled demonstrations, though none have yet been completed and submitted to EPA for review. In the OTR, the states will model four urban areas using the UAM: (1) New England; (2) New York City/Connecticut/northern New Jersey; (3) Philadelphia/New Jersey/Maryland; and (4) Baltimore/Maryland/Washington D.C. These urban areas are so close together and so inter-dependent that each of these four UAM modeling domains overlaps portions of at least one of the other four. EPA does not expect the states to complete UAM modeling analysis for the four urban areas that demonstrates that a particular control strategy will achieve attainment (relying on ROM applications through the iterative process discussed above), until well after November 1994. EPA's analysis of the need for the LEV program relies principally on several past and ongoing ROM studies. While EPA could use the complete UAM studies to refine the analysis, EPA believes ROM is the more important modeling tool for assessing transport. EPA further believes that certain conclusions can now be drawn about the outcome of the UAM analyses with respect to transport.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has used the ROM over the past several years to study national policies and strategies for reducing ozone. Because of the large domain subject to a ROM analysis, this tool is well-suited for assessing effects of regional strategies on regional transport of ozone and its precursors. ROM provides vital information for the states to consider in choosing sets of individual measures within each nonattainment area for purposes of their attainment demonstrations. EPA has applied ROM in various studies since 1988 to assess regional effects of control strategies. For purposes of assessing the amount of reductions needed to attain the ozone NAAQS throughout the OTR, EPA reviewed the results of these ROM studies. These studies analyzed impacts of various control strategies using data from the actual ozone exceedance episode in July 1988. During these particular episodes, the ROM model predicted that two sub-regions in the OTR would have hourly ozone concentrations over 180 ppb (50% over the ozone NAAQS), even after application of the control measures specifically mandated in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

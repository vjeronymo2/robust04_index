			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Almost a law unto themselves: A look at the work of the US Supreme Court, where a vacancy has arisen It is never easy to get a seat to watch the US Supreme Court at work. Two Mondays ago, the galleries were packed with the likes of Howard Davies, head of the Confederation of British Industry, as the world's most celebrated bench assembled to hear oral arguments on one of the biggest cases on its calendar this year - which happened, unusually, to involve a foreign company, Barclays Bank, in its case against California's system of unitary taxation. The mood was not entirely one of reverence. It took the marshal's whistle to silence the veteran court watchers making a book on which justice would be first to interrupt counsel, who are given precisely 22 1/2 minutes to argue their cases. The court marched in, the nine Justices taking their seats in order of seniority on either side of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, presenting an arc of styles, mannerisms and convictions. It was the mild-mannered Justice David Souter who scooped the pool, confounding the heavy odds on the voluble Justice Antonin Scalia, who invariably spouts Latin and discourses on Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Papers. The diminutive Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court's newest member, sat bolt upright on Mr Rehnquist's far left and peppered the lawyers with questions, interrupting, and thus annoying, some more senior colleagues, including the other woman justice, the courteous Sandra Day O'Connor. At the other end of the row, Justice Clarence Thomas, eighth in precedence and the only black, sat back and rocked gently, his booming voice never heard. Unusually silent on this occasion was the oldest member, 85-year-old Harry Blackmun, but he, perhaps, had something else on his mind. On Wednesday, the country discovered what that was, as Blackmun, one of two remaining liberals on the bench, announced he was retiring after 24 years marked by a crusty independence, mostly in the minority. It was, comfortably, the biggest US story of the week, as it invariably is when a justice steps down. The Supreme Court remains an abiding fascination, both because of what it is, the third and equal pillar of the US government along with the presidency and Congress, and because the greatest of its 110 names - Marshall, Harlan, Frankfurter, Holmes, Brandeis, Warren, Black - are embedded in US history. Appointed for life, and often serving into their 80s, justices can help shape the nation long beyond the times and political circumstances of their appointments. William O Douglas was named by FDR in 1939 because he was an expert on financial regulation. But in 36 years on the court he rarely faced such a case and was free to develop his trenchant liberalism. Even when they do retire, some justices remain around the court in offices provided for them, wielding influence behind the scenes. Chief Justice Rehnquist, a conservative, is sometimes said to be near apoplectic at the way Justice William Brennan (1956-90) still insinuates his eloquent liberal arguments over morning coffee with the likes of Justice Souter, a Bush appointee. Many of the court's judgments have had monumental impact. Dred Scott (1857) legitimised slavery and thus, in the eyes of the South, the civil war; Plessy (1896) upheld public segregation by race; Brown (1954) undid Plessy, and made the reputation of Thurgood Marshall, later the court's first black member; Miranda (1966) established rights for criminal suspects and changed the way the police went about their business; Roe (1973), associated, if not entirely accurately, with Justice Blackmun, protected women's right to abortion. Given all this, it is hardly surprising that every president slavers at the opportunity to shape the court. Bill Clinton was unfairly criticised last year because he took 85 days to name a replacement for the retiring Justice Byron White. His selection process might have been messy but the mere prospect of being the first Democratic president since 1967 able to appoint a justice was enough to militate against haste. In the event, the popular Ginsburg nomination proved a turning point in Mr Clinton's sagging fortunes last summer. Similarly, court nominees, subject to confirmation by the Senate, often prompt serious opposition, irrespective of the popularity of the president. Messrs Reagan and Bush each lost a candidate, Mr Nixon lost two in a year, and Mr Johnson could not elevate Justice Abe Fortas to the Chief's position. In each instance, ideological objections, plus reservations about legal competence and other issues, were decisive. As a rough rule, Republican presidents have tended to name conservative judges to the court, on the assumption that they will stick to the limited letter of the constitution and roll back the frontiers of federal power. Democrats, with fewer recent chances, have naturally preferred the reverse and also shown more partiality to practising politicians, as witnessed by Mr Clinton's current interest in Senator George Mitchell from Maine. The glittering exception was President Eisenhower's appointment of Earl Warren, the Republican governor of California, to be Chief Justice in 1953. Mr Warren's subsequent direction of the most activist liberal court this century, starting with the Brown ruling, prompted Ike to confess it was the 'worst appointment I have ever made'. He later added Justice Brennan, whom he named just before the 1956 election simply to shore up the Irish Catholic vote, to his list. Justices are frequently unpredictable once on the bench. President Nixon thought Mr Blackmun a safe conservative and was proved wrong, while Justice White, a Kennedy nominee, moved increasingly to the right. Of the present court, all Republican appointments except Justice Ginsburg, only Messrs Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas have consistently lived up to conservative expectations. They do not constitute a majority, which explains why the Reagan revolution, including repealing the Roe ruling, ultimately languished at the highest judicial level. The court does go through phases of activism followed by consolidation, often contra-cyclical to the prevailing political mood. The present bench has the reputation for not breaking much new ground. Perhaps aware of its own internal fault lines, it has tended to choose cases for judgment mostly of a dry, technical nature, though many may have wider subsequent implications, especially in the area of workplace law. On controversial cases, such as last year's judgment on Pennsylvania's more restrictive abortion laws, it offered so many opinions that Justice O'Connor confessed she had no idea what the court had decided in the end. It is also not as busy as it used to be, taking on about 120 cases this year, 50 or so less than a generation ago. Probably its two most important current cases concern the redrawing of constituency boundaries to improve representation of racial minorities and the issue of California's system of unitary taxation, opposed by Barclays. Both have received recent oral hearings prior to definitive written judgments, usually handed down 3-6 months later. The public sessions, supplementing mountains of written briefs, are not necessarily decisive, but more of an opportunity for the justices to strut their stuff before arguing it out in private. This may be just as well for Barclays, for the thrust of questioning from the bench was not in its favour. And the court's word is law.</p>

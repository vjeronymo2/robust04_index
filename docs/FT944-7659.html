			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Lilley rejects call over pensions Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, last night rejected demands that the new private pensions regulator should be financed by the taxpayer. He insisted it was 'proper' that the cost should be met by occupational pension schemes. He emphasised that not all taxpayers benefited from such schemes and did not see why they should meet the cost. In the first vote of the new parliamentary session the government defeated Labour calls for regulations to control the mis-selling of private pensions and for the abandonment of the jobseekers allowance by a majority of 37 (309-272). Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, underlined the need to ensure that the new regulator was seen to be independent. He warned: 'He will not have that independence if the industry is seen as his paymaster.' Mr Lilley looked to the encouragement of increased self-provision of pensions and the reinforced incentive to work provided by the jobseekers allowance to limit the cost of social security provision. Earlier, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, brushed aside suggestions that policy decisions on limiting tobacco advertising had been influenced by lobbying organisations. She was challenged about a report in The Guardian newspaper referring to a meeting between Mr Keith Mans, her parliamentary private secretary, and the Outdoor Advertising Action Group. Mrs Bottomley said Mr Mans, who is Conservative MP for Wyre, had no recollection of such a meeting. She insisted no holder of her office would be able to do the job unless used to 'energetic lobbying' from people concerned with particular policies. The six-day debate on the Queen's Speech ends today.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed VF/JR: "Bern Adheres to the UN Sanctions </F> Against Haiti -- Switzerland Will Enforce an Extensive Trade  Embargo"]    [Excerpt] Bern, 23 Jun (ATS) -- Bern has decided to  implement the new UN sanctions against Haiti that entered into  force on 22 May. The federal counselor approved an extensive  trade embargo and restrictions in the field of air and maritime  transportation. These measures add up to those already taken by  Switzerland on 30 June 1993. They enter into force on Thursday  [23 June].    In addition, the individuals who took part in the 1991 coup  d'etat as well as their relatives will not be allowed to enter  Switzerland until further notice. This restriction also applies  to the members of the government in power since 1991 and to the  members of the Haitian police and Armed Forces. In a joint  communique released on Thursday, the Federal Department of  Foreign Affairs and the Federal Department of Public Economy  announced that a visa would be mandatory for the holders of  diplomatic or special passports.    The Swiss trade embargo against Haiti now applies to all  imports and exports between Switzerland and Haiti. However,  medicines, food stuffs, and publications such as newspapers,  periodicals, or books are excluded. Bern has been banning the  sale or the export of weapons, oil, and oil products for one  year already.    Swiss ships are no longer allowed to navigate in Haitian  waters and the use of the Swiss or Haitian airspace by aircraft  [not specified] is prohibited. This measure does not apply to  international flights. The freeze on the funds and capital  goods of the junta in power is extended. This measure also  applies to the assets of individuals who are under the direct or  indirect control of the military government. [passage omitted]</p>

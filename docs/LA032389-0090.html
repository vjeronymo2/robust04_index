			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH STAYING OUT OF ETHICS FIGHT -- WRIGHT  </P> <P> House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), branding as "ridiculous" and "outrageous" a  proposal that the Justice Department seek an independent counsel to investigate  him, Wednesday declared that President Bush has given him personal assurances  that his Administration will take no part in the controversy over possible  ethics violations by the Speaker.  </P> <P> The Democratic-controlled Senate's bruising rejection of Bush's nomination of  former Sen. John Tower to be defense secretary had led to concern among  Democratic leaders that the Administration might retaliate by joining House  Republicans in pressing ethical allegations against Wright to weaken him or  strip him of the Speaker's post.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assured by Bush  </P> <P> But the Speaker, in an hourlong interview with The Times, said that Bush  personally told him that he would have nothing to do with the ethics  controversy. Sources close to the President also said that the President had  made clear that he wants his Administration to stay out of the House fight.  </P> <P> Conservative activist Paul M. Weyrich, whose allegations of drunkenness and  womanizing against Tower contributed to the Senate's rejection of his  nomination, has sent a six-page letter to Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh urging him  to seek appointment of an independent counsel to investigate Wright. He said  that such an independent inquiry is warranted because "it would be impossible  for the executive branch to be immune from the political pressure and threats  of political retaliation" from the Speaker.  </P> <P> Wright, lashing out at what he termed an increasingly "meaner" political  environment in Washington, blamed "vicious" right-wing Republicans for his  problems. But he said that he has refused to seek revenge and has "talked  various Democratic members out of bringing retaliatory ethics charges against  five different Republican members."  </P> <P> "I told them I thought that was unnecessary and unbecoming and it would simply  raise the decibel level of bitterness and anger and would not be productive to  the institution, and I talked them out of it," he said.  </P> <P> The Speaker, a fierce partisan who has many political enemies on Capitol Hill  and some critics in his own party, said that the political environment "is mean  and it's been turning that way for several years, and it has gotten meaner. I  regret that. I have not been a party to it, certainly not intentionally or  knowingly. I regretted what was done to John Tower . . . I thought he got a bum  rap on a couple of things."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Letter Based on Allegations  </P> <P> The Weyrich letter rested heavily on allegations presented last May 26 to the  House Ethics Committee by Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). It contended that the  charges amount to "specific and credible information" alleging a violation of  federal criminal law, a condition required before an outside prosecutor can be  sought.  </P> <P> David Runkel, a Thornburgh aide, said that Weyrich's letter has been referred  to the "proper people," presumably the Justice Department's public integrity  section. The section has 15 days to decide whether the information is both  specific and credible.  </P> <P> Weyrich said that the current House committee's investigation does "not include  investigation of criminal law" and it "is institutionally incapable of making a  fair and impartial determination concerning criminal violations by one of its  own members."  </P> <P> He charged that Wright "has brought enormous political pressure on members of  Congress to exonerate him of his wrongdoing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Claims GOP Supporters  </P> <P> Wright, interviewed in the Speaker's office, declared that he has not even  asked his colleagues to speak up in his defense. He professed to be heartened  by Democrats who have spoken out voluntarily in his behalf and added that even  some Republicans in the House have told him privately: "Jim, we're sorry you're  having to endure this vicious attack. We know in our minds that you've not done  anything wrong. We'll be glad when it's all over with."  </P> <P> Leaning forward and angrily shaking his finger as he responded to a question  about the Weyrich proposal, Wright declared: "It's ridiculous! Outrageous!  We've had an outside counsel in the House. He has taken nine months. He's gone  over the last 40 years of my life. He's had the power of subpoena and $1.6  million with which to do it. Nobody could say this was anything but the most  exhausting investigation that's ever been made, I guess, of any member of the  House . . . ."  </P> <P> The House Ethics Committee, which has been poring over a bulky investigative  report by independent counsel Richard Phelan, a Chicago attorney, is expected  to make its recommendations in early April. Under House rules, the committee  could exonerate Wright or find him guilty of violations not serious enough to  justify sanctions. Or it could issue a statement of alleged violations similar  to an indictment and invite him to reply at a committee hearing.  </P> <P> If violations are found, possible penalties include a reprimand, censure or  expulsion from the House.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denies Violating Rules  </P> <P> The Speaker, insisting that he expects to be exonerated of any serious  wrongdoing, said: "I have not knowingly violated any House rules, and I don't  believe that I have unknowingly violated a House rule. I know I haven't done  anything dishonest."  </P> <P> Although conceding that he has made "slips in judgment," Wright said that, if  the House wants "a person of flawless and impeccable judgment and knowledge for  Speaker, if they want the immaculate conception in the Speakership, then it  isn't I. I'm very human. Of course, I make a lot of mistakes as I go along . .  . I've done a lot of things which in retrospect I wish I hadn't done."  </P> <P> Wright suggested that Phelan, despite conducting a thorough investigation,  "probably misunderstood some of the rules of the Congress" concerning ethics.  </P> <P> "If Mr. Phelan misunderstands some of the rules, if he thought it would be a  violation of the rule for a member of Congress to intercede in behalf of  constituents, then he just has not been familiar with the practice here,"  Wright said.  </P> <P> If Phelan believes that the rules forbid a House member to use "an aide to  assist him in compiling and putting together his own writings in a book, the  congressman's own writings, then he thoroughly misunderstands," he added.  </P> <P> Among the allegations before the Ethics Committee are that Wright pressured  federal bank regulators on behalf of Texas savings and loan firms that were  under federal investigation and that he may have improperly evaded limits on  outside income when he arranged for publication of his slim volume,  "Reflections of a Public Man." The book was published by his political campaign  printer and he received $55,000 under an extraordinarily lucrative royalty  contract.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cites 52 Other Books  </P> <P> Wright disclosed that he had presented to the committee 52 books in which  congressional authors, including Gingrich and other GOP conservatives,  "acknowledge in the forward assistance from members of their staff."  </P> <P> In Wright's case, however, the allegation involves not only a staff member's  help in compiling the book but the charge that he evaded a House limit on  honorariums through bulk sales of the book to lobbyists.  </P> <P> Wright, dismissing concerns by some Democrats that his support in the party is  eroding and that he could lose his Speaker's post if the Ethics Committee finds  any violations, said that his colleagues have assured him he will emerge from  the ethics controversy "stronger than ever."  </P> <P> "I walk out there on the (House) floor," he declared, "and, before I get off  the floor, a dozen colleagues will come and pat me on the back and say: 'Hang  in there. We're with you. We know there's nothing to these charges. We're with  you hell or high water. Hang in there. This will pass and you're going to be  stronger because of it.'

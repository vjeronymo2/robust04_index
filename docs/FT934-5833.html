			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Motoring: Pedal policy Mention of pedal cycles in a motoring column is guaranteed to produce a reaction. Even if pro-bike, motorists complain - justifiably - about a minority of cyclists who behave disgracefully. They cite riding on pavements; foul language or threats of violence to pedestrians who protest; ignoring traffic signals and one-way streets; and riding unlit at night. Cyclists, also justifiably, complain that some drivers behave thoughtlessly, even aggressively toward them as though they had no right to be on the road at all. The fact is that cyclists have a perfect right to use highways (but not motorways) freely, although whether they are always wise to exercise this right is open to question. But they also have responsibilities. Insurance is a prime example. Few cyclists have any, yet a third of the 20,000-odd accidents involving them each year are held to be their fault. In law, they could be responsible for dam-age and injury, even legal fees. This Christmas, about 1m children will wobble forth on their new bikes. Many, thankfully, will wear safety helmets. But even more important would be a RiderBike* policy (Pounds 12 a year for an individual, Pounds 20 for the family) bought with the bike from independent cycle dealers. Last year, 24,800 cyclists became road casualties in Britain, 3,787 with serious injuries. Of 204 who died, 48 were children. While insurance cannot prevent accidents, it can at least make the results of many of them less distressing. * Information on RiderBike from 061-795 4905.</p>

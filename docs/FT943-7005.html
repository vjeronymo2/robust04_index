			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Higher advertising revenues lift Fairfax John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper publisher in which three media magnates - Mr Kerry Packer, Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Conrad Black - hold stakes, nearly doubled its profits in the year to the end of June, to ADollars 110.7m (USDollars 81.4m), it revealed yesterday. The figure, which is reached after tax but before abnormal items, compares with ADollars 67.1m in the previous year. Revenues rose by 9.8 per cent to ADollars 845.8m, and earnings per share (on a fully-diluted basis) totalled 13.99 cents, against 9.01 cents previously. Below the line, Fairfax also enjoyed a ADollars 75.2m abnormal tax benefit, taking attributable profits to ADollars 185.7m, up from ADollars 67.2m a year earlier. The group is raising its final dividend to 5 cents a share from 4.5 cents, making a total for the year of 7.5 cents. Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne Age and Financial Review, said that it had seen increased advertising volumes and revenues, although it also attributed the improvement to productivity and efficiency gains. Classified advertising volumes were up by 9.7 per cent at the Herald and 10.9 per cent at the Age, while display ad volumes rose by 10.6 and 3.8 per cent respectively. Advertising volumes at the Financial Review were 'steady'. Operating costs increased by 6.8 per cent, but the company said that this was mainly due to promotional activities, new operations and higher newsprint costs. With these items excluded, it said that the rise would have been 3.6 per cent. Fairfax also benefited from lower interest charges, down from ADollars 54m to ADollars 37m. The company added that it was 'pleased with the results to date in the 1995 trading year'. The company has been the focus of much speculation recently, because of its potentially unstable share register. Canadian Mr Conrad Black holds almost 25 per cent of the shares, but is barred from going higher under Australia's restriction of foreign ownership of print media assets. Mr Packer has just under 15 per cent, but is also pegged at this level because of media cross-ownership rules. Mr Murdoch appeared on the share register in June and is thought to hold around 2 per cent of the shares. Mr Tony O'Reilly's Australian Provincial Newspapers, a regional newspaper publisher operating mainly in Queensland and New South Wales, yesterday reported profits after tax and abnormals of ADollars 8.11m in the half-year to end - June, an increase of 25.3 per cent over the same period of the previous year. Sales rose by one-third to ADollars 89.7m.</p>

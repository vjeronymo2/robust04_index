			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has proposed  that the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] take over the  administration of kwaZulu to deal with the situation there. The  chairman of the ANC in southern Natal, Mr. Jeff Radebe, said in  Johannesburg that the time had come for the TEC to take charge  so that free and fair elections could take place. The ANC's  candidate for the Natal premiership, Mr. Jacob Zuma, said at the  same news conference that the ANC did not want to prescribe to  the TEC, but that it had to act. Mr. Zuma also said that there  were signs that people in kwaZulu were tired of Chief Minister  Mangosuthu Buthelezi's rule, which he described as autocratic.</p>

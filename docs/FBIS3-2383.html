Figures from the municipal foreign economic relations and  trade commission show that 256 of these foreign-funded projects  are in industry, with a total contractual investment of about  320 million U.S. dollars.    Other popular sectors, such as real estate and public  utilities services, which last year absorbed most of the foreign  funds flowing into Shanghai, in February attracted the smaller  proportion of the total overseas investment.    However, experts say that overseas investors will still take  interest in the real estate sector as Shanghai is stepping up  the construction of an international financial and trade power  houses.    "Anyway, the amount of foreign investment in real estate  this  year will not be less than 1993's," they predicted.    Official statistics show that though the number of  foreign-funded projects in February was sightly higher than in  the same period last year, the total of contractual foreign  investment was 150 million U.S. dollars less than last year.    According to sources from the commission, Hong Kong is  currently ranking top among investors, pouring some 410 million  U.S. dollars into 136 projects, accounting for 64 percent of the  total overseas investment.    The sources said that Japanese businesses have expanded  their  investment in Shanghai this year. In February, they invested  more than 50 million U.S. dollars in Shanghai, up 54 percent on  the same period last year.    Countries which each have invested more than ten million  U.S.  dollars in Shanghai include the United States, Britain,  Singapore and the Philippines.    Official statistics show that to date, business people from  56 countries and regions in the world have invested in Shanghai,  involving a total investment of some 14.9 billion U.S. dollars  in 7,547 projects.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Fashion: Watch, wait, pounce - Avril Groom says clever shoppers know how to use the sales The most undignified sale I ever saw was a private one, at the showroom of a top British designer. Women who usually meet smiling over the champagne glasses were snatching frocks from each other's grasp and building up stashes of possible bargains. Any garment tried and deemed unsuitable was tossed aside after which they returned to the fray in their lingerie. My initial reaction was to feel comforted that even well-known actresses wear holey vests and greying bra straps. My second, more disquieting one, was to wonder why women needed to behave in that way. But that was in the mid 1980s, when money was more easy come, easy go and sales were the tinsel on the tree. It hardly mattered what you bought, as long as it had a good markdown on the price tag and the right designer name on the label. Those were the days when the media faithfully recorded the queue of people camped outside Selfridges in Oxford Street and the crashing crockery in the crush at the start of Harrods' sale. Now it is all much less jolly. The media still goes to Harrods - but to film the latest celebrity brought in by the store's promotions department to keep the sales excitement alive. This week it was American film actor Richard Gere, who generated a large and noisy crowd. But serious shoppers are a more dour bunch who bide their time with an end in view, rather than trippers out for fun and a few unpremeditated bargains. Recession has both debased the sales and made them the main source of shopping for many. Now that half the high street has permanent sale notices there is no need to wait to buy unless you want something absolutely specific; the chances are that somewhere you will find an acceptable equivalent already reduced. Those keenly anticipated sales just after Christmas and in late June have become irrelevant. Many sales start in mid-December to cash in on seasonal trade. But for those who do want a specific item, the starting dates of the remaining genuine store sales have more significance than ever. Harrods says selling has been slow in recent years, yet its sales have been remarkably successful. The first day of last January's was its best trading day. The recession has concentrated the mind of the intelligent shopper. The only justification for a sale is saving money, not spending it, by enabling consumers to buy much-coveted items at prices they consider reasonable when the original price seemed unreasonable. The strong-minded watch, wait, case the joint and then pounce. They discover in advance how much the sale reduction will be. The even stronger-minded then wait for more, hoping for further reductions but risking the sale of their bargain. This is all nerve-racking stuff but the dedicated sales shopper has never been faint-hearted. Now that people are more prepared, of necessity, to play the waiting game, the atmosphere is coolly competitive rather than frenetic. Real strength of mind comes in the reckoning with yourself over what you buy. The best bargains are lasting, quality classics, in fashion terms an easier brief for men than women, although items such as a half-price Aquascutum cashmere coat, a Mulberry briefcase or a Pringle cashmere sweater seem to fit the bill, and all are in sales now. Another approach is to go to the sales of top, very expensive designers  - Chanel and Ralph Lauren (both start today) are fashion Meccas at sale time - and hope their innate taste and elegance carry you through. But beware. Even here there are design duds and they naturally have the biggest markdowns. Buying fashion hits in a sale is trickier but more fun because a wardrobe full of serious investments would be a dull place. Go for quality and clothes you can visualise wearing in the future - even if styled in a totally different way. And you have to be tough with yourself. For instance, velvet has been the fabric of the season - which is precisely why it will not be next winter. Yet, I can still justify buying Margaret Howell's long black velvet skirt (sale now on) because it is so simple and beautiful it will be a classic. I can even justify Martin Margiela's evening sheath of crinkled metallic silver with deconstructed raw-edge details (from Browns, sale starts today) because it is so startling that it is above the whims of fashion. But much as I would love to own one of Vivienne Westwood's corset tops (sale late January) I must draw the line. Occasions where 18th century ball gear is appropriate are rare in my life. And although it would do incredible things for my figure, even at sale prices it is too much to pay to make mountains out of molehills.</p>

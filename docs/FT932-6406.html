			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Letter: High definition and digital TV battle unresolved Sir, The news that three consortia in the US high definition television contest have agreed a 'grand alliance' which will submit a single digital standard to the Federal Communications Commission is welcome ('US deal will speed start of HDTV', May 25). The choice of the more flexible digital terrestrial system undoubtedly gives HDTV its greatest chance of success and marks a considerable technological achievement for the Americans. All is, however, not lost for Europe's beleaguered consumer electronics industry. One must, for example, remain sceptical about the size of HDTV's potential market. It is not clear how much the viewer will value improved picture definition. HDTV is, in the short to medium term at least, likely to be confined to niche premium markets, such as film and live-sport channels. Our own estimates for this niche suggest a worldwide receiver market of Dollars 5.53bn by 2004 - considerably less than dedicated HDTV advocates would have you believe. Rather more significant is the impact that digital technology will have on normal definition services. Digital TV is more efficient; it uses less band-width. This means viewers will be able to receive many more channels. Since viewers value programme choice and quality above picture quality, it is to normal definition digital television that Europe's consumer electronics industry should now turn its attention.

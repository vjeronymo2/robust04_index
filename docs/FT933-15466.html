			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Domestic growth helps lift Daewoo Electronics 25% DAEWOO Electronics, South Korea's third-largest consumer electronics manufacturer, yesterday reported a 25 per cent rise in net profits, to Won14bn (Dollars 17.5m) during the first half of 1993, on the back of brisk domestic sales, writes John Burton in Seoul. Sales grew 15 per cent to Won997bn, including a 17 per cent rise in domestic sales to Won425bn. In the Korean market, sales of microwave ovens were up 58 per cent; washing machines 28 per cent; and televisions 17 per cent. Exports, which rose 13 per cent to Won572bn, were bolstered by the Korean won's depreciation against the Japanese yen. Microwave ovens, washing machines and refrigerators all posted growth above 30 per cent in foreign markets. Daewoo also announced it had acquired for Dollars 1.4m an audio production facility in the Chinese province of Shandong which it had leased since last August. The facility has capacity to produce 50,000 sets of cassette stereos, CD players and headphones annually. The company plans to transfer the production of cheap audio products from South Korea to the Shandong plant to take advantage of low labour costs.</p>

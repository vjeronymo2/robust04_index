			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / East Midlands takes Pounds 130m hit Profits for last year at East Midlands Electricity will be depressed by Pounds 130m after the company yesterday disclosed the consequences of widely-criticised diversifications shortly after privatisation. More than 700 jobs will be lost, some almost certainly through enforced redundancies, as the company closes three of the six contracting companies which emerged after acquisitions three years ago. The 'business re-alignment' includes write-offs in the company's security and retailing businesses as well as its contracting arm. The policy of strong growth of the security business is to be discontinued. East Midlands' statement, from Mr Nigel Rudd, new chairman, represents the first significant admission of diversification failure by a power company since privatisation. East Midlands' announcement came just 10 days after Mr John Harris stepped down as chairman. Although Mr Harris, 54, went voluntarily, there was uneasiness within the company about his chairmanship and this could eventually have led to moves to unseat him. Analysts yesterday revised forecasts for East Midlands' 1993-4 profits from about Pounds 185m to Pounds 55m. However the Pounds 130m reduction included goodwill write-offs which had previously been set against reserves. The company's actions yesterday will result in a more palatable one-off cash outflow of Pounds 30m. The company said its dividend policy would remain unchanged. Investors were also heartened by a statement from Mr Norman Askew, chief executive, that the company would concentrate on its core businesses. They marked the company's shares up 13.5p to 561p. Yesterday's action means net assets at March 31 will be reduced by Pounds 80m (after related tax relief of Pounds 18m). Some Pounds 61m of the pre-tax total relates to contracting, Pounds 17m to security and Pounds 20m to the Homepower retailing division. Last year's profits will also reflect a Pounds 31.5m charge representing the value of the goodwill associated with businesses acquired in 1991 and 1992. Because of previous write-offs this will not affect net asset totals. Mr Askew said the provisions would have a minimal effect on gearing. Results preview, Page 30</p>

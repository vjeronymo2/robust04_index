			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Observer: Nice try The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is maintaining a stiff upper lip. No, Rob Andrew of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks was not picked as young chartered surveyor of the year because he is a brilliant rugby fly-half. He was nominated on the grounds that he was 'destined, on business qualities alone, to become a leading member of the profession'. And as for his recent move to Toulouse, where young Rob seems to be playing a lot of rugby, the RICS says it has added a 'continental dimension' to his business involvement which has 'brought great credit to the institution'. Hear, hear.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Seeds of peace fall on inhospitable ground: Laura Silber on prospects for the Vance-Owen initiative THE international peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina aims to reinvent a state on the ashes of war. But the chances for the treaty to take root remain remote. Under intense pressure from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and increasing threats of military intervention, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, on Sunday caved in and initialled the Vance-Owen peace plan. If implemented, the agreement would abolish his self-proclaimed Serb state, which covers nearly 70 per cent of Bosnia. Mr Karadzic tomorrow will have to persuade hardline deputies to the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament to back the plan, which last week they unanimously vetoed on the grounds that it transformed a 'brilliant military victory' into a defeat. The plan calls for Bosnian Serbs to give up nearly half the territory they now control. Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators, detailed at the emergency summit this weekend 'clarifications' to their plan which calls for the division of Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces roughly along ethnic lines. At the assembly session Mr Karadzic is likely to point to these clarifications as 'concessions' which have made the plan acceptable. Bosnian Serb leaders have stressed the importance of a corridor, running across northern Bosnia to link Serb-held territories in Croatia and Bosnia with Belgrade. The mediators have also won an undertaking that Moslem or Croat troops will not be allowed to return to provinces allocated to their ethnic groups where there are Serb communities. Instead, they will be policed by UN troops. But western diplomats say the apparent concessions are little more than a face-saving mechanism to enable Serb leaders to present the plan as a victory for Serbian interests. Lord Owen's strategy, in part, was based on driving a wedge between leaders from Serbia and Bosnia. Tough new sanctions were imposed on the rump Yugoslavia after Bosnian Serb deputies rejected the plan, which heightened Belgrade's fury against the Bosnian Serbs. 'If you look at the fine print, the concessions do not match Serbian claims, or as they appear in Milosevic's speech,' said a diplomat referring to a strongly-worded letter from the Serbian president and his Yugoslav counterparts. In the first public criticism of Bosnian Serb leaders, they warned that the intransigence was endangering 10m citizens of Yugoslavia, comprised of Serbia and Montenegro. Further, Mr Milosevic clearly exerted pressure on deputies to the Serbian parliament in Belgrade to vote in favour of his letter, which was tantamount to their approval of the Vance-Owen plan. Bosnian Serb leaders previously rejected the plan as it did not give them adequate guarantees of a secure northern corridor joining territory designated as Serb. The plan in its endorsed form envisages a 10km, increased from 2km, demilitarised zone around a UN-monitored throughway. The agreement prohibits the transport of troops or military equipment in this zone. It also names 10 other UN 'blue routes' in Bosnia which will link ethnic provinces. Serb leaders also heralded the proposal on troop withdrawal as another concession. It is relevant only in areas designated as Moslem where the Serbs are in full control and proscribe Croat and Moslem troops from moving into areas assigned to their control in 'province five', the area along the strategic Drina River valley, even after the planned withdrawal of Serb troops. Peace negotiatiors have called for the despatch of 70,000 UN troops, to be drawn up from Nato, including the US, and possibly Russia to protect minority groups, in this case Serb communities. 'Province five' was mostly Moslem until a year ago when Serb forces expelled or killed tens of thousands of people in the valley. Critics of the Vance-Owen plan point to the weaknesses of the peace plan in Croatia, agreed in January 1992, which failed to demilitarise Serb paramilitary troops and enable the return of refugees. It is likely the agreement will be dogged at every step by the spectre of the UN peace deal in Croatia. UN officials defend the Croatian plan for stopping mass killing and destruction, but concede it was weakened by the lack of political negotiations. Conference negotiators have set out to avoid this pitfall by writing a detailed political formula calling for elections to be held in each of the 10 provinces within 18 months. The UN troops will protect the minorities at least until then. The plan's success hinges in part on the extent to which Serbs are ready to give up their idea of uniting Serb-held territories within a Greater Serbia. It also hinges on whether Croatia will allow the independence of adjacent Croat-designated territories. Sarajevo, the besieged Bosnian capital, is to be demilitarised under the plan. Over the next week it will be an indicator of whether Serbs are ready to reach a peace in Bosnia. If the plan is approved, the key to implementation will be how quickly the UN Security Council responds to troop deployment. Negotiatiors are also aware that the chance of reversing the horrors of war is slim. As Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the peace talks, said: 'We have now done the easy part.'</p>

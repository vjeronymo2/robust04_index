			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFICIT OFFSETS GOOD GNP, INFLATION NEWS  </P> <P> The nation's economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.5% while inflation fell to  2.9% in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. But the  favorable combination was accompanied by the worst quarterly trade performance  in three years.  </P> <P> A surge in domestic consumption caused imports to soar at an annual rate of  15.1%, while exports of U.S. goods neither grew nor declined. As a result, the  trade deficit increased by $22.9 billion, the biggest deficit since the second  quarter of 1986.  </P> <P> The 2.5% growth rate in the gross national product matched the rate posted  during the second quarter and followed a 3.7% annual rate during the first  quarter of 1989, indicating that the economy has continued to slow without  stumbling.  </P> <P> Inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP, fell to an annual rate  of 2.9% in the third quarter from 5% in the second, the department said,  underscoring other indications that prices are moderating after big gains  earlier this year.  </P> <P> While the combination of temperate growth and declining inflation was hailed by  the Bush Administration, the Dow Jones industrial index fell 39.55 points as  financial markets focused on the worsening trade picture and an anemic 1.4%  annual growth rate in final sales.  </P> <P> "This is exactly the kind of GNP composition the Federal Reserve (Board) does  not want to see: strong domestic demand, high consumer spending and a sharp  deterioration in trade," said Giulio Martini, an economist with Sanford C.  Bernstein &amp; Co. of New York.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported that personal consumption, which had increased  at a modest annual rate of barely 2% during the first two quarters, ballooned  to 5.8% in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Martini noted that the jump in consumer spending was fueled by a 15% increase  in purchases of durable goods, mostly autos and trucks, and other big-ticket  items that many economists would categorize as investments rather than  consumption. Without those purchases, the increase in spending would have been  about 4%.  </P> <P> Martini said the collapse of export growth, which fell to zero after gaining at  an annual rate of about 18% in the first half of the year, was an anomaly  attributable to the dollar's recent strength against foreign currencies.  </P> <P> Analysts took some comfort from the fact that Thursday's report, an advance  estimate subject to revision, consisted of July and August data that was  projected into September. In July and August, U.S. business invested heavily in  foreign capital goods and U.S. consumers splurged on motor vehicles, many of  them imports.  </P> <P> Both trends are believed to be unsustainable and may not have continued into  September at the same rate.  </P></p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Bucharest steps back from a market economy: Moves to compromise over reform in Romania are unsettling budding entrepreneurs ROMANIA'S third post-Communist government has distanced itself from the 'fast track' market reformers of central Europe. Instead, it has opted for a compromise 'social market economy' which opposition parties have already denounced as a step backwards. Mr Nicolae Vacariou, the prime minister, heads a minority government formed by the Democratic National Salvation Front (DNSF), which won most seats in general elections two months ago. He argues that Romania needs a more gradual approach which takes into account social costs. A slower approach worked for the new prime minister's predecessor, Mr Theodor Stolojan, who was drafted in after miner-led riots in Bucharest toppled the radical reformist government of Mr Petre Roman in September 1991. The Stolojan administration managed to implement monetary reforms without destabilising the economy. The leu, Romania's currency, was partially liberalised, leading to a 140 per cent devaluation, and subsidies on basic foods and domestic energy were more than halved. But inflation has dropped from 265 per cent last year to 133 per cent in the first 10 months of this year. By the end of October, exports had risen 26 per cent over the same period last year, and there are signs that industrial production may have ceased falling after declining 50 per cent since 1989. Output increased by 2.6 per cent in October, the third monthly rise in a row. Mass privatisation has been slow to start, but many new companies have sprung up. By October there were more than 380,000 companies with private capital, and the private sector accounted for 44 per cent of retail sales and 27 per cent of services. Mr Stolojan's consolidation of reform has helped improve the country's image with foreign investors, who say they are beginning to look more seriously at Romania. 'The country suffers from a credibility gap. The economy is not as different from those in the central European countries as is supposed,' says Mr David Nussbaum, a director of Charterhouse Bank, who recently brought a group of senior western financiers to Romania. 'We are not unduly worried by the political situation: the core legislation for a market economy already exists.' The country's budding entrepreneurial classes, however. have been shaken by the DNSF's victory. 'This is a government of ex-Communist bureaucrats: they do not understand the needs or importance of a private sector. Worse still, they encourage the population to fear the transition and to be suspicious of successful entrepreneurs,' says one businesswoman. So far, the new administration has done little to dispel this view. President Ion Iliescu, who was re-elected on the DNSF ticket, recently reiterated that the state should strengthen the social security network and protect the population against 'savage capitalism'. Meanwhile, Mr Vacariou, who before 1989 worked at the Communists' central economic planning institute, talks of implementing reform through administrative measures. He believes he can tighten control over state enterprises and still encourage initiative. 'Spontaneous reform and privatisation would only lead to anarchy,' he claims. Mr Vacariou says he wants to end the 'financial blockage' caused by some Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) of inter-enterprise debt by closing unprofitable state enterprises and compensating others. He plans to revive industry - more than 90 per cent state-owned - through increased investment raised from higher taxes. Profitable private businesses say that, with the base rate at 70 per cent and corporate tax up to 45 per cent, they are already starved of capital. In the short term, however,the greatest opposition to Mr Vacariou's plans is likely to come from within the DNSF and its supporters in parliament. The DNSF holds 34 per cent of seats, well short of a majority, and depends on the 18 per cent of seats held by Communist and nationalist parties to govern. Even the most cautious attempts at reform are likely to run into opposition from the DNSF's satellite parties, the hardline nationalist Greater Romania Party and the Communist Socialist Labour Party. Their leaders, Mr Corneliu Vadim Tudor, one of deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's top propagandists, and Mr Adrian Paunescu, are among Romania's most skilled politicians. They appear to exercise more influence over the DNSF rank and file than Mr Vacariou, who like many in his cabinet is a newcomer to politics. Much depends on the two main opposition groups, the Democratic Convention, a loose anti-Communist coalition, and the National Salvation Front led by Mr Petre Roman, which together hold 44 per cent of seats in parliament. Both groups favour a rapid transition to a market economy but, so far, internal divisions have prevented them from providing a viable alternative. They have agreed to try to form a constructive opposition over the difficult winter months. Otherwise, they fear the economy will worsen, giving rise to increased social tensions.</p>

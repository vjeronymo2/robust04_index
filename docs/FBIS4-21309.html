			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Title: "Anti-Drug Police Raid Boatmen Camps--Surrounded by </F> Dozens of Vietnames Refugees--Police Reinforcements Arrive,  Seize HK$1.6 Million Worth of Heroin"]    [Text] Yesterday evening when members of the Special  Service Team of the Tuen Mun Police Headquarters went to the  Wang Hou Shih [2598 0683 4258] refugee camp area to carry out  its anti-drug mission, they were obstructed and surrounded by  about 40 Vietnamese men, some wielding self-made weapons. The  special team members called back to headquarters for support.  Soon a large number of police arrived and took the situation  under control. In a unit of Camp No. 33, the police seized eight  kilograms of a drug, suspected to be No. 4 heroin, with an  estimated value of 1.6 million Hong Kong dollars. No one was  arrested. This is the largest amount of drugs the police has  seized recently in the Vietnamese refugee camps.    According to an initial investigation made by the police,  the  above location is a drug dilution and distribution center. The  drug comes from Sham Shui Po District, and is sold mainly to  addicts among the refugees in the camp area.    The police investigation also reveals that the suspects  belong to an active Vietnamese drug trafficking group in Hong  Kong. Currently, the police are searching for the suspects based  on the information provided by the refugees. In the past drug  traffickers used to conduct small transactions, each with a  small amount. The recent large dealings might be an indication  that the number of addicts in the camp area has increased to  such an extent that small supplies can no longer meet their  requirements. Accordingly, the traffickers have taken risks to  carry out large transactions. The police are making in-depth  investigations to determine if this is the case.    The Wang Hou Shih refugee camp area where the drugs were  seized is an open camp area. All the Vietnamese living there  have undergone screening before being granted the refugee  status. They have been assigned to settle there and are free to  go in and out. Security administration in the area is rather  lax. The camp leader is responsible for maintaining the area's  public order. Guards are placed at the gate.    The Special Service Team of the Tuen Mun Police Headquarters  kept a constant watch on the security situation in the Wang Hou  Shih refugee camp area. Investigations revealed drug trafficking  activities in the camps. Several searches were conducted in the  past, but without marked results.    About a month ago, the Special Service Team received a tip  to  the effect that drug trafficking had escalated in this camp  area. According to the tip, a considerable amount of drugs were  stored in this area, and a drug dilution and distribution center  had been set up there. Upon receipt of this information, Chief  Inspector Tsai Chia-shih, Inspector Li Wei-chuan, and Captain  Chang Wen-sheng decided to lead the policemen to investigate the  case.    Recently, the team was prepared to take action and obtained  a  search warrant from the court. At 5 p.m. yesterday it began  making final arrangements for a raid on the camp area. At 7 p.m.  the team arrived in the area. When Inspector Mai Wei-chuan [name  as printed] and Captain Chang Wen-sheng led policeman Lo Ssu-min  and three other policemen and two policewomen to proceed to a  unit of Camp No. 33, several refugees were playing cards at a  nearby store. Thinking that the police had come to arrest  gamblers, they tried to escape. This alerted the Vietnamese man  who was keeping watch for the drug trafficking group. Suddenly,  the police were obstructed and surrounded by a group of about 40  Vietnamese, some of whom threatened with homemade weapons.  Fearing that the situation would become chaotic, the police  asked their headquarters for support. Shortly afterward, a large  number of police arrived. They dispersed the rioting Vietnamese  and proceeded with the search. They tried to enter a unit, but  the door was closed. They knocked at the door, but nobody  answered. After telling the camp's responsible person of their  mission, the police broke the door with a steel bar. No one was  inside. The police found some suspicious materials in the  kitchen and the living room, including some granulars contained  in a dried milk can and two bags of blocks in a blue plastic  bucket. It was suspected that the granulars were a dilute form  of drug and the blocks were high-purity No. 4 heroin. Also found  were tools for diluting drugs, including blenders and packaging  tools.    Since the TV and kitchen range in the unit were still on, it  was believed that the drug traffickers had escaped barely before  the police broke in. Presently, the police are searching for  suspects. The seized drugs, totaling eight kilograms, are valued  at about $1.6 million.</p>

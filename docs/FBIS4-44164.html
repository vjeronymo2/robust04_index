			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Opposition to Another Dutchman for </F> European Commission"]    [Text] The four major political parties are divided on the  question as to whether the Netherlands should put forward a new  candidate for the presidency of the European Commission. The  VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] and the CDA  [Christian Democratic Appeal] consider that the Netherlands  should not knuckle under following the failure of the candidacy  of outgoing Prime Minister Lubbers. The PvdA [Labor Party] and  D66 [Democrats 66]) on the other hand find it "unwise and  inopportune" to submit a new Netherlands candidate.    Following the failure of Corfu, the political parties are  united in their disappointment at the failure of Lubbers to  succeed Jacques Delors as president of the executive arm of the  European Union (EU). They are all also critical of the  intransigent stance of German Chancellor Kohl on the Netherlands  candidacy and of the British veto against Belgian Prime Minister  Dehaene.    But The Hague is politically divided on the question as to  whether the Netherlands should once again enter the battle.  Deadlock again seems likely at the special summit now planned  for 15 July. The German presidency of the Union (from 1 July)  remains committed to Dehaene while Mr. Major's Conservative  government in Great Britain is equally committed to its veto  against the Belgian prime minister.    If Dehaene sees the lack of consensus as grounds for  withdrawing his candidacy, the battle is then thrown open again,  Second Chamber members Weisgals (VVD) and De Hoop Scheffe (CDA)  believe. They will then call upon the PvdA, the CDA, the VVD,  and D66 leaders to consider a new Netherlands candidate.</p>

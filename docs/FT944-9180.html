			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (10): A sound recovery - Bang &amp; Olufsen Bang &amp; Olufsen can be likened to a French chef, says Mr Anders Knutsen, the group's chief executive: he buys the best-available raw materials in the market, and his reputation is based on the way he mixes them to produce exquisite dishes. The Danish producer of up-market audio and video products does something similar. It buys much of what goes into its products from outside, but it puts them together in such a way - with a substantial input of its own technical flair and software - that the product is exceptional. If this were a process anyone could do successfully, B&amp;O would not be the only surviving independent manufacturer in Europe that produces a full range of both audio and video products. Indeed, a couple of years ago, after the group had suffered three successive years in the red, B&amp;O's own survival hung in the balance. It has staged a remarkable recovery under of Mr Knutsen, who was made chief executive in the autumn of 1992 after a 20 years with the company. In the year ending last May 31, the group made a profit of DKr125m, against a loss in the previous year of DKr42m, and sales were up to DKr2.40bn from DKr2.12bn. The first half of the current year is expected to produce an equally good performance. The financial market's confidence in the group has returned. The share price, which plunged to around DKr200 in 1992-93, is now at DKr1,200. At the groups' headquarters in Struer, a small town in north-west Jutland, Mr Knutsen attributed its long-term success to 'a unique combination of technological excellence and emotional appeal' - the emotional, or aesthetic, appeal arising from the superb design which, more than anything, has generated a brand-name awareness of B&amp;O products. To rebut the suggestion that B&amp;O merely presents conventional technical solutions in brilliant packaging, Mr Knutsen darted from the room to return a moment later with the insides of two television sets, a standard product from Philips and a B&amp;O set - a graphic way of illustrating the difference in complexity and performance between the two sets. This autumn the company turns another corner with the launch of an ingenious all-in-one television and video set, known as the Avanta, the first such product set to reach the market. In typical B&amp;O design, it will grace the most elegant of drawing rooms, though at a price which less choosy consumers may find steep. The recovery in the company's fortunes is the result of a combination of factors; but one explanation which Mr Knutsen does not accept is that it is riding high in a cyclical recovery in the market. The Danish market recovered in 1993, but the other European markets did not. Yet, in Germany, where the market is still depressed, says Mr Knutsen, the company has this year boosted sales by 28 per cent. Clearly, a lot of things have been put right to achieve this kind of growth in a stagnant market. The starting point was a 'break point' programme launched in the autumn of 1992. Group employment was reduced by 700 to 2,300. Production was rationalised by centralising the electronics production and the mechanical engineering operations respectively in one plant. The sales and marketing structure was changed, cutting costs substantially. Direct ordering and direct distribution has been introduced. A retailer in, say, Madrid places an order, using his personal computer, with B&amp;O in Denmark. B&amp;O distributes directly from its store. If the model ordered is not in store, the Danish company undertakes to deliver in five days - two for manufacturing and three for transport. Flexible production and low inventories are keywords. The production range has been broadened, introducing TV sets at the relatively low price of about DKr10,000, extending through a complete range to surround-sound audio systems which lighten the pocket by around DKr100,000. Productivity in the manufacturing divisions of the company improved by 15 per cent in 1993-94 from the previous year, and the aim is a further 10 per cent improvement this year and next. This is the result partly of a programme to improve logistics and the production structure, which began six years ago, but it is also a result of a programme to involve the workforce to an ever-increasing degree in bringing about production improvements. Two layers in the management structure were eliminated by Mr Knutsen, so there are now four, from shop-floor to board of management. Foremen (or supervisors) and shop-floor workers have been given greater responsibilities, which has required an intensive process of education and training. It also involves Mr Knutsen - or Anders, as everyone in Struer calls him - in a heavy programme. He meets every employee at least once a year in groups of 50 at a time, which means about 50 meetings annually. He makes sure that everyone understands the strategic vision and the management's goals, and he receives direct feedback in the form of questions and comments. 'It is a hard programme, but it is a good investment,' he said. It quickly becomes apparent to a visitor to Struer that the change of top management has been very important. Mr Knutsen says it himself, explaining the significance of having a board of management which is in full agreement about where it wants to take the group and how to get there. But it is the unsolicited comments from everyone else one meets that are most telling, from the secretaries and the shop floor upwards. 'The present directors know what they are doing, and when they take a decision they stick to it,' observed one secretary.</p>

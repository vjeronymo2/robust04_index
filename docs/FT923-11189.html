			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Anger flares on rundown urban estates: The background to the summer riots NO police officer has been injured in Hillfields, Coventry, in the past week. No police vehicle has been damaged. Such forebearance from the more aggressive residents is unusual. Outwardly this inner-city district with its high-rise flats and small council houses is calm. Certainly policemen are out on the beat as normal, but there are suggestions of in-fighting among the district's drug barons and there is fear among the peaceable. 'I wouldn't go out on the streets at night on my own,' says Ms Pauline Jacques, who chairs The Chantries Tenants and Residents Association. Hillfields, just north of the city centre, was one of the two Coventry districts where youths clashed with police in May in a series of disturbances which proved to be the start of a summer season of unrest in British cities from Bristol in the south to Stockton-on-Tees in the north. The districts have in common unemployment and deprivation. Hillfields, together with its northern neighbour, Foles-hill, were the subject of Coventry's abortive bid for extra government funding through City Challenge, the scheme run by the Department of Environment to encourage towns and cities to compete for finance for urban redevelopment and regeneration projects. The two districts have the highest unemployment in Coventry. The rate in St Michaels, a ward of Hillfields, is 28.3 per cent while in Foleshill it is 24.7 per cent. Male unemployment is respectively 34.9 and 29.3 per cent and rising. Recession is trapping the skilled and unskilled alike in districts where housing is poor, crime is high and the industrial infrastructure is crumbling. Local resources to combat the rise in unemployment are running out. Mr Davinder Panesar, training and development manager at the Indian Community Centre in Foleshill, says: 'Every day we will have several dozen people who are made redundant and have basic skills. The training provision is full. Even middle management is being made redundant. There is no hope of a job unless you buck up your skills and go into something new.' Ms Jacques, who herself is unemployed, adds: 'I don't honestly know where people would start in finding jobs. There isn't anything.' For the black population of Hillfields and Foleshill, the situation is more complicated than simply being the result of the recession. Coventry's City Challenge document noted that 'nearly half the population of the area are black. They have particular needs and experience problems of discrimination and racism.' Employment prospects among ethnic minorities are being undermined by racism, says Ms Julia Sudbury, co-ordinator of the Osaba Women's Centre, an Afro-Caribbean group. 'There is racism in training and education, there is discrimination at the point of recruitment.' Poverty exacerbates communal unease. Cahan, a local group set up to combat racial harassment, said it had received five complaints of harassment on Friday last week alone. Mr Panesar observes that many in the Asian community of Foleshill had 'a rural background in Pakistan', had been in unskilled work and had not needed to know English. She says: 'Their skills are not relevant to the UK and its culture.' Such disadvantages mean that 'for them to be in the mainstream, they have to have something extra'. The City Challenge bid for Pounds 37.5m over five years was a means of providing that 'something extra'. Based on four flagship projects, it sought to create jobs and provide the training so that those jobs could be filled by Hillfields and Foleshill residents while, in the background, smaller grassroots schemes would tackle other problems. The government's refusal last week to support the bid left Coventry City Council angry. The reasons for refusal, Mr Brian Clack, the leader, told the environment department, were 'spurious'. He said the reasons were an attempt to justify 'what is clearly a decision to favour other authorities on party political grounds'. But it also left the council with a serious financial problem. Its sources of funding for Hillfields and Foleshill are narrowing. Mr John Fletcher, deputy leader of the city council, says that the government's decision this week to rein in public spending means, that 'we're in for a really hard time'. The authority made its own budget cuts for this year to avoid capping. Next year it will have to cut at least a further Pounds 3m from its overall spending. Its capital spending is in any case constrained. But it is also receiving less from the government's Urban Programme, which provides regeneration funds for 57 local authorities. Funding this year of Pounds 4.6m, most of which was spent on Hillfields and Fole-shill, was down 10 per cent on 1990-91. Next year's spending is likely to be in the region of Pounds 4m. The more the government spends on City Challenge, the less it has for other Urban Programme activities. Since 1987, the government's Task Force, a series of inter-departmental teams helping to revive local economies, has spent Pounds 13.1m - Pounds 6.4m from its own budget with the rest coming from other sources  - in Hillfields and Foleshill. But the Task Force is being withdrawn next March. Although it leaves a legacy of training programmes and an enterprise fund which in five years has helped 190 young businesses and created about 460 jobs, community leaders are bitter about its departure. Mr Fletcher says he wonders why aid is leaving when the problems have not. MORE THAN 60 people were arrested during a further night of disturbances in three northern towns on Thursday. In a second evening of trouble in Blackburn, Lancashire, 40 people were arrested after rival groups of youths turned against the police. About 3,000 youths had been on the streets at one time, police said, and 51 petrol bombs had been found. In Burnley, Lancashire, 22 people were arrested in a fifth night of disturbances on the Stoops estate. Police said that fewer than 50 youths were now thought to be responsible for the continuing violence. In Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, police officers were pelted with stones and petrol bombs on the Brackenhall estate in the early hours of yesterday. Firefighters were also pelted with bottles and stones during the unrest, which lasted for 3 1/2 hours in spite of pleas from community leaders for peace on the estate. A police officer was treated in hospital but there were no arrests. There has been unrest in eight towns since the early summer.</p>

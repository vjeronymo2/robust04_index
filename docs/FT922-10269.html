			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Letter: Lib Dems fit the bill Sir, In your editorial 'The challenge for the Labour party' (April 30) you say that a party which could beat the Tories would have to be a 'party that . . . espouses democratic reform, champions the consumer, outflanks the Tories in its zeal for competition, thinks afresh on the environment, and finds some room for targeted help for the poor'. You say that this is what Labour must be. But what you describe is what the Liberal Democrats already are. Paddy Ashdown, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs in demand Market optimism ahead of the regulatory pricing review due next week continued unabated, further sharp gains being recorded by the regional electricity companies (recs). Offer, the industry regulator, is due to report on the new price structures for the recs and there are market rumours that the review will be favourable to the companies. Investment bank Strauss Turnbull added its weight by launching a call warrant on a basket of five recs. The cost of the warrant - which allows investors to exercise an option to buy the shares at the price on the day of purchase - is Pounds 5.08 based on a basket price of Pounds 31.95. Investors then have until February 1996 to exercise their warrants, which are, in the meantime, tradeable in the market. Among the most prominent rises, Northern added 20 at 725p, Norweb 25 at 728p, South Wales 18 at 702p and Eastern 18 at 688p. PowerGen continued to benefit from the bullish mood and the start of its planned share buy-backs on Tuesday, climbing 6 1/2 to 552p.</p>

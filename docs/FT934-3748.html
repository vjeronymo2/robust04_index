			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Options for divorce reform put forward Quick, no-fault divorce after a year's separation, where partners do not have to make any accusations, was one of the options for divorce law reform outlined yesterday in a government green paper. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, launching the consultation document, said he was aiming for a system which was 'better at identifying savable marriages'. Couples should be encouraged to face the consequences of divorce before ending their marriages. But where divorce was unavoidable the system should minimise the bitterness and conflict between parties and reduce the trauma for children, he said. About 75 per cent of the 150,000 divorces a year in England and Wales are granted for adultery or unreasonable behaviour. The green paper suggests a one-year 'cooling-off' period before divorce is granted on these grounds.</p>

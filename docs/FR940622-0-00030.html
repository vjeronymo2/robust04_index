			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under these provisions, the hospital would be responsible for treating and stabilizing any individual, regardless of eligibility for Medicare, who presents himself or herself with an emergency condition at the hospital, and for providing such care until the condition ceases to be an emergency or until the individual is properly transferred to another facility. We interpreted this to mean, for example, that if a hospital were to admit and then transfer an individual before his or her condition is stabilized, except as provided below, it would be a violation of section 1867 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;Transfers and restrictions_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an individual at a hospital has an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized or the individual is in active labor, the hospital could not appropriately transfer the individual unless one of the following conditions exist:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The individual (or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf) requests the transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _A physician (or other qualified medical personnel if a physician is not readily available in the emergency department) has certified in writing that, based upon the reasonable risks and benefits to the individual and the information available at the time, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at the other facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual's medical condition from the transfer.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We considered a transfer to be appropriate only if the receiving medical facility has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the individual and has agreed to accept the transfer of the individual and to provide appropriate medical treatment. The transferring hospital would have to furnish the receiving medical facility with timely appropriate medical records (for example, copies of the available history, examination, and treatment records as well as any available reports of diagnostic studies performed). The patient would have to be accompanied by qualified personnel during the transfer; transportation arrangements would have to include the use of necessary and medically appropriate life support measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the statute authorized the Secretary to find that the transfer must meet ``other requirements'' in the interest of the health and safety of individuals transferred, we did not propose to adopt any. We did, however, specifically invite public comment concerning any ``other requirements'' the Secretary should consider adopting regarding the health and safety of emergency department patients being transferred between medical facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We proposed to include in &sect;489.24 the following definitions as included in the statute, without interpretation_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;``Active labor'' means labor at a time when delivery is imminent, there is inadequate time to effect safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or a transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the patient or the unborn child.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;An ``emergency medical condition'' means a medical condition manifested by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in: (a) Placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy; (b) serious impairment to bodily functions; or (c) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;``To stabilize'' means, with respect to an emergency medical condition, to provide the medical treatment of the condition necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from the transfer of the individual from a facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;``Stabilized'' means, with respect to an emergency medical condition, that no material deterioration of the condition is likely, within reasonable medical probability, to result from the transfer of an individual from a facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

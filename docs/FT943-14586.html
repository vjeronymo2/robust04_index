			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / US oil loses its clout: A troubled industry finds political support hard to come by One of the maxims of political life in the US is that Big Oil can grease any jammed government wheel in Washington. If so, some US oil executives and entrepreneurs must be wondering whether they have lost their touch. Last March, more than 100 federal lawmakers requested a meeting with President Bill Clinton. They were concerned that low oil prices were accelerating the decline of the industry, which has seen daily average production fall from 10.245m barrels in 1983 to 8.565m last year. The lawmakers also feared that the accelerating pace of lay-offs in the industry - 22,000 jobs have been shed since November 1993 - would depress regional economies. Some also feared that US dependence on foreign oil, which now accounts for more than 50 per cent of daily consumption for the first time, jeopardised national security. That meeting was not held until June 16, when Mr Clinton and other administration officials sat down behind closed doors with more than 80 members of Congress to review ways of bolstering the domestic oil industry. Mr Clinton listened to dozens of proposals, ranging from tax incentives to regulatory reform, but offered no firm commitments, according to those at the meeting. That cautious approach has characterised the administration's dealings with the sector, a fragmented mix of companies that includes the largest US corporations as well as some of the smallest. Some analysts say the often conflicting needs and expectations within such a diverse industry has hampered its ability to get a strong message across to the administration. They cite the gulf between the concerns of an Exxon, and those of the freewheeling entrepreneurs or the small 'Ma and Pa' oil companies that operate across the 'oil patch' states of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, California, Colorado. 'Independent (producers) get all their investment from well revenue,' says Ms Denise Bode, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, a lobbying group for many of the small producers. 'They need something that can stabilise these erratic prices that are beyond our control. A modest sense of security is the least the government can do to provide a little downside protection.' Tax incentives to keep operating the 15 per cent of US wells defined as marginal - producing less than 15 barrels a day - if oil prices fell below Dollars 20 a barrel and the wells' viability were in jeopardy, have won tentative approval from the White House. But Mr Clinton said any incentives should not increase the budget deficit. The requirement that any help be 'revenue neutral' also affects proposals aimed more at the 50 or so big independents and oil majors that account for almost three-quarters of total US oil production. Mr Clinton endorsed the concept of royalty relief and tax incentives for operations employing new drilling methods or those undertaking oil exploration - including the deep-sea drilling which promises to unlock big new oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Relief would only be granted, however, if the interior department determined that drilling would not otherwise occur, according to Mr Bill White, deputy energy secretary. But details of such schemes have yet to materialise, and many industry figures remain sceptical that the administration will offer anything more than marginal relief. 'I think there has been a tremendous amount of sympathy expressed but we haven't seen a lot of action,' said Ms Bode. The debate over whether to lift the 20-year old export ban on Alaskan North Slope oil exemplifies the dubious political rewards of getting too deeply involved in oil issues. Amid warnings that the US would be running foul of international free trade provisions, Mr Clinton has offered tentative support to a deal between oil producers and some labour unions to lift the export restrictions. The prohibition was a 1973 oil crisis trade-off for congressional approval of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. The ban has since been championed by a range of groups, including environmentalists who fear further exploitation of the Alaskan wilderness. Under an arrangement engineered mainly by British Petroleum, the largest Alaskan oil producer, the ban would be lifted on condition that only US flagged and crewed tankers be used for export. But international shipping groups have warned that such a restriction would be prohibited under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and might interfere with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development negotiations on shipping liberalisation. Mr White said Mr Clinton was aware of the 'substantial' trade complications lifting the ban poses and would only support eliminating it if these issue were resolved.</p>

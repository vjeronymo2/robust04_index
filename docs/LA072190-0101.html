			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AMATEUR;  </P> <P> DUNCAN BATTLES HEAT FOR ONE-SHOT LEAD OVER STANKOWSKI, VOGES  </P> <P> Paul Stankowski of Oxnard and Mitch Voges of Simi Valley had to settle for a  second-place tie on Friday midway through the 91st Southern California Golf  Assn. Amateur Championship.  </P> <P> On a day hot enough to wilt a shrub, the only man to play two better rounds  than they did was a landscape architect.  </P> <P> Pat Duncan, 32, of Rancho Santa Fe put together rounds of 67 and 72 over the  tight, 6,531-yard Wilshire Country Club course to take the lead. Stankowski,  20, had rounds of 67 and 73, and Voges, 40, shot 72-68 to trail Duncan by a  stroke.  </P> <P> Charlie Wi of Thousand Oaks, the 18-year-old who stunned the state's amateur  golfers a month ago by winning the California Amateur on the Monterey  Peninsula, struggled in the 100-degree heat. He shot an opening-round 73 and  then stumbled to a 76. His total of 149 also was the 36-hole cut. He and 31  others advanced to today's second round. The championship round is Sunday.  </P> <P> Among those who did not advance were Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys, who lost to  Wi in the semifinals of the state championship and was the 1988 SCGA amateur  champion. He shot rounds of 72 and 80, with a nine on No. 17, a par-four,  during the afternoon.  </P> <P> Stankowski, a junior at Texas El Paso, won the tournament last year at the  Glendora Country Club. He tied for low medalist honors in this year's state  amateur tournament before being ousted in match play by Wi.  </P> <P> He said the heat wore him out after his morning-round 67.  </P> <P> "I really felt (it) at the end of the first round," he said. "I was really  tired. I sat in the shade for an hour between rounds and then didn't even want  to get up again. Later in the day I think it started to bother me. I lost my  concentration a little bit and my focus wasn't there.  </P> <P> Stankowski won the Oxnard City championship by eight strokes three weeks ago  and said he knew he would have to bring his best game into the SCGA tournament  to win it.  </P> <P> "There is a stronger field here than there was for the state amateur," he said.  "This tournament just has better golfers. I knew I had to bring my A-1 game to  win this one. And I think I have."  </P> <P> Voges, who plays out of the Wood Ranch Country Club in Simi Valley, finished in  the top five in last year's SCGA Mid-Amateur Championship and made it to match  play of the 1990 state amateur.  </P></p>

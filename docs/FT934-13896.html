			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Belgian social pact tohit benefits system BELGIUM will today begin the formal stage of talks between government, employers and unions aimed at reforming the social security system, improving the competitiveness of Belgian companies and reducing unemployment. An outline agreement, submitted to the Belgian government yesterday, envisages far-reaching changes to the social security system. The brunt of efforts to reduce expenditure would fall on health and unemployment benefits. Without immediate action, the report forecasts that Belgium's social security deficit could rise to BFr100bn (Pounds 1.9bn) by 1996. The report also proposes freezing real salary increases between 1994 and 1996, although it says the country's basic system of wage indexation should be maintained.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / London bus crews strike for a day ABOUT ONE third of London's buses stayed in their depots yesterday as crews staged a one-day protest strike over pay and conditions that a majority of them have already accepted. London Buses said no buses ran in some parts of the capital. Unions claimed the strike - over pay cuts averaging Pounds 30 a week and extended hours - was an 'overwhelming success'. They warned of another strike on Wednesday unless management agreed to talks. Mr Ollie Jackson, a TGWU transport union official, said his members had signed new contracts and indicated that a prolonged dispute was unlikely.</p>

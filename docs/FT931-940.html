			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Yakuts ponder identity in a post-Soviet world IN TSARIST Russia, the main role of the remote republic of Yakutia was to accommodate exiles banished by the authorities. After 70 years of socialism brought it literacy, some industry and the status of an autonomous Soviet, socialist republic, Yakutia is proceeding towards a new chapter in its history. It has become one of the big players in current attempts to transform the so-called Russian Federation (proclaimed by the Bolsheviks, but never realised) into a genuine federal state. So far, relations between Moscow and individual republics have been a question of messy bargaining, with President Boris Yeltsin trading economic concessions for political support. The striving by Yakutia - or Sakha, as it named itself when declaring sovereignty last year - for the right to run its own affairs is mirrored elsewhere in the Russian Federation. Some of the concessions it has won from Moscow are in the spirit of the federal treaty, for instance in giving it more rights over its considerable natural wealth, which includes 98 per cent of Russian diamond production. The urgency of the process was underlined yesterday at the Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow when the leader of Karelia, another constituent republic of Russia, called on the parliament to quickly adopt laws to implement a federation treaty signed this time last year. The treaty, conceived to avoid a Soviet-style collapse of Russia, divided up responsibilities between the federal and local governments in 89 constituent republics and regions. That call received strong backing from Mr Yuri Skokov, the secretary of Russia's Security Council, who told deputies the state was already collapsing: 'We do not have a crisis of power, we have a crisis of statehood. Our life depends on the regions.' Yakutia has set up its first diamond-polishing factory in association with a Japanese company, Arda, in an attempt to make more of its wealth. And Mr Afanasy Stepanov, adviser to the Yakut president, said plans are under way to offer diamonds as collateral to encourage foreign investment in other sectors of the economy. Apart from gold and diamonds, the republic has oil, gas and coal. But some of its strivings for more independence reflect its desire to save itself from the chaos of economic crisis in the absence of effective federal reform. Mr Stepanov said the republic wanted its local branch of the Russian central bank to have the right to license commercial banks to take into account its specific conditions. He cited the fact that the republic was sparsely populated, extremely cold and that its only form of transportation was by aircraft. In practice, the banking demand is aimed at allowing Yakutia to set its own reserve requirements for local banks and to set lower interest rates. Although Moscow has reason to resist excessive decentralisation which could break up an already primitive financial system, it has other tasks, including the fight against inflation. Its other responsibility is to make the banking system more efficient. With money transfers taking weeks to go through Moscow and then further afield, Yakutia wants the freedom to set up accounts with foreign banks and its own clearing system. The specific conditions of Yakutia are also used as an excuse to slow privatisation as decreed by Moscow. But while Yakutia has declared a state monopoly over all its natural resources, it has yet to come up with an efficient and transparent system for managing that monopoly. If he survives his battle with Congress, President Yeltsin's next challenge will be to combine effective economic reform, binding for the whole country, with decentralisation that is seen to be fair.</p>

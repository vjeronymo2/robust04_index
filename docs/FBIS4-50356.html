			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, secretary  general of Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee,  hoped that Sino-Japanese good-neighborly relations and mutually  beneficial cooperation will be continuously furthered.    He made the statement when meeting with a delegation from  the  Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), headed by its  secretary- general, Kubo Wataru, here today.    Jiang, who is also China's president, said: "I have met with  leaders of your party many times in Beijing and Tokyo," adding  that constant contacts between leaders of the two parties are  important for enhancing understanding and friendship.    He hoped the SDPJ can further bilateral relations.    Jiang noted that the development of good-neighborly  relations  and cooperation was not only in the interests of the two peoples  but also beneficial to peace and development in Asia and the  world, and so the two countries should further develop such  relations.    Jiang spoke highly of the SDPJ's efforts during the past  years to promote Sino-Japanese friendship, saying that the SDPJ  had made important contributions to the normalization of  Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and the healthy development  of bilateral relations.    Wataru said that his party attaches great importance to the  ties with China, and the treatment of history is a big issue in  bilateral relations, adding: "We have all along advocated that  Japan should take a road of peaceful development, and maintain  and promote friendship between the two countries."    He said that the main purpose of their current China visit  was, through celebrating the tenth anniversary of the  establishment of relations between the SDPJ and CPC, to further  bilateral friendly relations.    Jiang said that not long ago, there were inharmonious tones  in Sino-Japanese relations, which was denying history and  against the will of the two peoples, and should be condemned.    He continued that only rightful treatment of the past and  advocacy of Sino-Japanese friendship could make the two peoples  maintain friendship from generation to generation.    Wataru said that the SDPJ, in power or out of power, would  continue to conduct friendly exchanges with the CPC and the  Chinese people, so as to make efforts for peace and development  in Asia and the world.    Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of  the CPC Central Committee, was present at the meeting.    Yesterday morning, Li held talks with the Japanese visitors  on furthering relations between the two parties.    Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the national committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, met with the  Japanese guests here this evening and hosted a banquet in their  honor.</p>

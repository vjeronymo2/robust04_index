			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SILENCE BROKEN  </P> <P> As one of the many thousands of hearing-impaired people who are totally  dependent on closed captioned TV for "hearing" programs, may I offer my  congratulations to the broadcasters who offer "Arsenio Hall" (KCOP, weeknights)  as captioned. Also to the TNT Network, which is captioning its new movies. It  is such a pleasure to be able to participate in watching and understanding what  is happening.  </P> <P> Eila Henriksen, Ojai  </P></p>

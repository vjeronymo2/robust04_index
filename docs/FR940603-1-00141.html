The Owner shall have the right to require the Contractor to increase the number of his employees and to increase or change the amount or kind of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner; but the failure of the Owner to give any such directions shall not relieve the Contractor of his obligations to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this Proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The manner of construction of the Project and all materials and equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection, tests, and approval of the Owner.

Any such condemned material or equipment shall be immediately removed from the site of the Project by the Contractor at the Contractor's expense.

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie 3,100 swept away in turbulent market - Market report Political worries, interest rate concern and uncertainty in US markets combined to take the heart out of the London stock market yesterday. The Footsie 3,100 mark, lost at the market's opening, was briefly regained later but only to be swept away again when the market fell at the close as the Dow Industrial Average shed 40 points in early deals. The final reading of 3,092.4 on the FT-SE 100 Index left a loss of 31 points on the day. The initial damage was done by the overnight drop of 63 points on the Dow and the rise in US long bond yields above 7 per cent. Moving in line with other European bourses, the Footsie was 36 points off at the opening and quickly extended this loss. But London was additionally hurt by the slide in sterling as foreign exchange markets reacted sharply to the political storm in the UK House of Commons prompted by the government's acceptance of the changes in the EU voting structure - and particularly to attacks on Mr John Major, the prime minister, from his own parliamentary supporters. Weakness in sterling presents a further threat to prospects for a cut in UK base rates and the short sterling market quickly took fright. Little selling pressure developed in the stock market, however, and a rally then set in, encouraged first by a further reduction in rates at the Bundesbank repo tender and then by the favourable outcome to the auction of Pounds 2.5bn UK short-dated securities. Led by improvement in European bond markets, which responded to a modest rebound in US Federal securities, equities regained most of their losses and the Footsie touched 3,117.7, still 5.7 off on the day. The last hour-and-a-half of business saw the revival in confidence abruptly quelled when the early setback on Wall Street hit Europe. Nervousness in London was reflected in a heavy seller of the June future contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, and in rumours that an influential New York guru had cut ratings on the US market. The June Footsie future fell to a massive discount against the cash market - but rebounded after the close of the official futures market. Erratic trading this week has been blamed on the approach of the Easter weekend, when securities houses will be unwilling to hold positions open. This week's data on US consumer confidence has reinforced concern that a strengthening economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten credit policy sooner rather than later. European investors have become increasingly nervous ahead of Good Friday, when most markets will be closed but important US statistics on employment will be announced. Seaq volume jumped to 765m shares from 677.3m on Tuesday as nervous holders got out of the market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed above the day's worst but showed a loss of 21.7 at 3,767.1, indicating that selling pressure had not been confined to the blue chip sectors, which are linked to stock index futures. Weakness in sterling was identified as the new factor in the market equation; easing in Bundesbank rates and tighter credit policy by the Federal Reserve have both been largely taken on board by the UK stock market, which has continued to hope for a further cut in domestic base rates. But the prospect of continued pressure on the pound if overseas investors take a negative view of the UK political situation will prompt a hurried reappraisal of the UK base rate theory.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Tokyo's old, new wedding PREPARATIONS FOR today's royal wedding in Tokyo have provided an effective diversion from Japan's worst economic downturn for almost two decades. For the country's political leaders it has had the added allure of distracting attention from the scandals undermining them. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is impatient to declare the worst over - understandably, since the problems of the past two years have provoked calls for restructuring throughout society. In politics reformist groups are attempting to force changes in Japan's corrupt electoral system. Three years of declining profits have obliged Japanese manufacturing companies to slash investment, rewrite the terms of the social contract based on lifetime employment, and revise many of the management strategies fashionable in the the late 1980s. It will take several years for Japan's banks to restructure in response to their mounting bad debts, while the securities industry is still in parlous health. Nor have Japan's international relations been left untouched. The slump in demand for imports has helped to expand the Japanese trade surplus, and the US wants to renegotiate its trade relationship with Japan. Many western critics believe all this presages sweeping change: a challenge to the LDP's dominance; liberalisation of the financial system and rationalisation of the weakest banks and securities companies; a rise in the cost of capital for manufacturing companies which will have to focus more on profitability rather than expansion of market share; a loss of social cohesion brought on by a rise in unemployment; the opening to international competition of closed Japanese markets. Not much of this wish list is likely to be fulfilled. Where there is change it will make Japan's western competitors uncomfortable. Japanese manufacturing companies could emerge in two years with much lower costs and higher productivity. Some Japanese car companies have set out to cut costs by 40 per cent in the next three years. The financial system is finely balanced. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's redoubtable governor, favours market disciplines to enforce restructuring, but many in the banking industry want the Finance Ministry, often a willing accomplice, to manage the crisis to avoid painful changes. The prospects for far-reaching political change are even more limited, partly because the main opposition parties would suffer at least as much as the LDP under proposed electoral reforms. As far as social values are concerned, the slowdown is not provoking a challenge to the established order, quite the opposite. It was the brash, individualistic ethos of the 'bubble era' which threatened traditional values. Now there is a new conservatism in the air, particularly for women, who are first to lose their jobs in a downturn. Ms Masako Owada's decision to forsake her career as a diplomat to marry Crown Prince Naruhito may bring a modernising influence into the Imperial Family but it also symbolises the strength of tradition in Japan. That mixture of modernisation and conservatism is likely to remain the hallmark of Japan for years to come.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Carey outlines his path for the EC: The archbishop of Canterbury tells David Marsh of his reservations about Maastricht FOR Dr George Carey, ecumenism a la Maastricht has its limits. Although the archbishop of Canterbury gives a general blessing to European integration, he draws the line at the idea of monetary union leading to the head of his Church disappearing from English pound notes. 'I want the Queen's head on the banknotes,' Dr Carey says. 'The point about national identity is a very important one. For me being British is deeply important. I don't want to become French or German.' Speaking squashed into a window seat overlooking Westminster Abbey during the Church of England synod this week, the archbishop spelled out his vision of how Britishness and Europeanness could come together. 'To be British is not in competition with being European,' says Dr Carey, who developed the theme during a visit last week to Strasbourg and Brussels to see leaders of the European parliament, the Council of Europe and Nato. His talks showed him: 'There is a great anxiety and desire for Britain to belong to Europe and be committed to it. 'We as a nation come across to mainland Europe as reluctant Europeans. We are brought into it squealing rather than rejoicing . . . Our future is in Europe. Away from Europe we would decline into a little offshore island because America is not going to do very much for us and the rest of the world isn't (either).' Dr Carey displays studied benignity towards Maastricht's arch-opponents. 'I think the Maastricht treaty is rather like Stephen Hawking's A Brief History Of Time and the Satanic Verses. People have got very fixed opinions about it without having read it. I think we need to help people understand the general shape of it.' Asked about Lord Tebbit's distinctly Biblical description of the treaty as a 'foul abomination', Dr Carey rejoins: 'I respect Norman Tebbit as a clear thinker. We need to pay close attention to his views. We mustn't rubbish people. We need a real debate. We need to educate people. We need to help one another to realise that where there are fears which are bogus, they need to be laid.' The archbishop takes a similarly understanding view of the FT's disclosure last year that nearly Pounds 500m has been wiped off the value of Church of England property investments as a result of heavy borrowing to finance speculative property developments. Dr Carey set up an inquiry, due to report after Easter. 'I'm grateful for the Financial Times. I want an open church in an open society. Largely as a result of that (the FT report) I've set up this inquiry of very able people who will report. I can promise we're not going to whitewash it. The church people who have given the money need to know where the money is going to.' Dr Carey added, a touch archly: 'I hope the FT will not only look at the Church of England but also at other big businesses which probably have greater portfolios than ourselves, where more people are likely to go to the wall than the dear old Church of England.' Dr Carey says his Church, along with churches elsewhere in Europe, has a central role in steering Europe down the path of righteous integration. 'When you are European in the Community you are member of a trading community. But one of the points I've been putting out there is that you have to move from selfishness to altruism. Most of us are in the Community for selfish reasons, for economic reasons, for materialistic reasons. That's not a good enough reason to belong. There have got to be cultural and spiritual reasons . . . If we end up with a fortress Europe, that's not a Christian Europe.' The archbishop voices support for EC emphasis on subsidiarity - allowing government decision-making to be carried out at the lowest level. 'This is deeply important . . . It comes from a Christian philosophy. You only do together what you have to do together. It respects some degree of sovereignty for the state.'</p>

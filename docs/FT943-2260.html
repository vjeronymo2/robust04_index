			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traders sceptical about cocoa output curb Plans by the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) to cut cocoa output by 375,000 tonnes over the next five years look good on paper but will have little immediate impact on the market, London traders said yesterday, reports Reuters. Members of the organisation agreed on Saturday to implement a five-year plan aimed at cutting 75,000 tonnes a year, beginning in the 1994-95 season, in an attempt to bolster prices. 'They are good intentions but Indonesia is not part of the agreement. . . and as a cocoa producer it has the major growth record,' one pointed out. However, Mr Guy-Alain Gauze, Ivory Coast's commodities minister, told reporters after the ICCO talks ended in London on Saturday that 'Indonesia has said it will not take any decision against producers'. Indonesian observers at the talks said they were monitoring the progress of the production management plan and, based on that, would eventually decide whether or not to join the pact. Indonesia, which is forecast to produce about 250,000 tonnes cocoa during the 1993-94 season, has registered an average growth rate of 20 per cent a year over the past five years. Apart from the question mark over Indonesia, traders said the volume of stocks available to the market would also offset any attempt to cut supply. 'There are many stocks to get rid of,' said one. 'There has been a lot of cocoa surplus in the world and producers get impatient for higher prices,' one said. If the plan does materialise, 'it will be interesting to see how they implement it and finance it', commented a London-based analyst.</p>

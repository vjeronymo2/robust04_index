			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / State of the Art: The verbiage of creativity that is. . .mad, bad and dangerous to use - Pop music is dead; long live pop music WITHIN weeks of the arrival of Bill Haley and his Comets in the mid-1950s commentators were speculating on what would replace this irksome new craze, rock and roll: would it be calypso or a return to the romantic ballad? The idea that an art form was emerging that would create a multi-billion dollar industry; a shared global experience; and have the most profound impact on the culture, morals, even the politics of the rest of the 20th century, was beyond comprehension. But I think we can now start to ask whether pop, in its more pretentious, aesthetic form, has not exhausted its relevance. It will not disappear, but like classical music, art, dance, and the theatre, become an art form which lives off its back catalogue, its former creativity. It will do this very well. It is one of the ironies of pop that something so temporary, so fickle in taste and style, has a reverence for its past that is quite absent from other 'art' forms. Any artist, any trend, in pop's forty year history is integrated into its sacred text. There might be a brief time in the shadows but death is guaranteed to restore the reputation of the most insignificant musician, and nostalgia the revitalistion of any fad. Pop rejects nothing. Today ABBA, the personification of glib, transient, commercial, singles, are regarded as a major ikon; even glam rock has been allocated its altar in the pantheon. This acceptance of everything in the canon goes along with an obsession with the most trivial facts. There are more books on pop statistics - best selling singles; artists with most chart entries; first blind singer to have a top ten album - than on any comparable subject, including cricket. If you want, you can easily discover what all four Beatles were doing on a particular day in 1963; or unearth the birthday of the first drummer in The Sweet. It is nonsense to argue that pop will die, but not so idiotic to suggest that is going through a severe crisis. Now that the pop generation embraces virtually the entire population outside pensioners - observe the disco at the Conservative Party Conference - a reaction was bound to set in. There is a band cleverly called Pop Will Eat Itself. It will not; instead it will continue to sustain a flourishing industry in critical nostalgia. Eight of the ten best selling albums in the UK last week contained the re-cycling of archive material, including albums by ABBA and the dead Freddie Mercury. This suggests that mature fans are re-living their past, and a younger generation favours the music of the 1980s, 1970s, 1960s, rather than contemporary sounds. Pop is failing to replenish itself. Contemporary youth is growing up on a pop music that is far removed in relevance from that of preceding generations; a pop music that is less significant to their lives. Pop has become boring, jaded, old fashioned, establishment. It is the music that their parents enjoy. Like so many aspects of contemporary society it has become subsumed inside a life style. To the young music is no more important than fashion, or alternative electronic developments, like computer games. The absence of new creative figures, like the Bob Dylan of the 1960s, the Elton John of the 1970s, or Bruce Springsteen of the 1980s, has forced teenagers to see pop as dance music, sounds to which to rave. Drug culture has added to this trend. Pop is part of the experience; it is no longer the most important thing on earth. Suddenly contemporary pop is boring. Its very success in making itself accessible to all - any Brixton youth can set up as a rapper; any electronics freak can pick and mix snippets from previous records, add in synthesised rhythms and sounds, and produce an acceptable background noise - has destroyed the development of creative artists. Studio engineers have replaced musicians; a myriad of minority tastes has seen off the new idea, be it punk, or pomp rock, or singer-songwriters, that swamped the memories of past generations. The development of the CD player enabled a prosperous older generation, in work, to re-purchase the music of their youth in a new format and widened the gulf with teenagers, still hooked on the vinyl single. It is not only outside forces that have reduced pop music to a mindless pap. Pop became a career for some of the brightest minds of the 1960s and 1970s. It became intellectualised. The new Penguin Book of Rock and Roll Writing includes contributors who happily link black soul singers with the writings of Barthes; who deconstruct the lyrics of a Rolling Stone song with the determination of a Derrida. Professors of music have compared the Beatles with Schubert; poetry lecturers have placed Dylan alongside Byron. These intellectuals are appalled by the superficiality of current pop. They are pulling up the drawbridge, washing their hands of the young, like their parents in the 1950s. Pop began to self-destruct as soon as it was taken seriously. It is only relevant in the individual imaginations of the young, in its ability to communicate on behalf of the incoherent and the illiterate. Pop is currently passing through an intellectual and an artistic crisis, but there is no likelihood of it disappearing. It will re-invent itself to suit the demands of a new generation.</p>

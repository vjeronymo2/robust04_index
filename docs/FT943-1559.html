			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Japanese coalition agrees to reduce income tax Japan's ruling coalition of conservatives and socialists last night agreed a package of income tax cuts worth Y16,500bn (Pounds 107bn) over the next three years, to be followed by a rise in sales tax, bolstering the fragile economic recovery and giving the government added stability. The unpopular sales tax - similar to Europe's value added tax - will rise in April 1997 from 3 per cent to 5 per cent. It is needed to compensate for an expected decline in the income tax base caused by the tax cuts and an ageing population. Agreement between the three parties in the coalition paves the way for the end of a divisive year-long argument over fiscal reform. It marks new stability in the coalition, which had looked shakier than its short-lived predecessors on taking office at the end of June. Until a few days ago, the Social Democratic party of Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, opposed an increase in sales tax. But Mr Murayama changed his mind in return for a promise from the Liberal Democratic party - his enemies until the SDP joined forces with them three months ago - to spend the extra revenue on welfare. Washington has been pressing for tax cuts to stimulate domestic demand in the hope of reducing the trade surplus, but wanted Japan to defer the rise in sales tax for as long as possible. Accordingly, the deal drew a cautious welcome from the US. Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan, said the package was positive but not perfect. The income tax cut consists of a Y3,500bn per year permanent reduction, plus Y2,000bn annually of temporary cuts, to last until March 1997. The government will decide six months before then whether the temporary cuts should continue. At the same time it will review whether to change the size of the increase in sales tax. That will depend on the amount of savings in administrative spending achieved by then, in response to a demand by the New Harbinger party, the coalition's smallest member, which is led by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister. The government will submit the tax reform package to the next session of parliament, starting at the end of this month, and hopes to pass it into law by the end of the year, in line with a promise to Japan's Group of Seven industrialised country partners at their summit in July. Fresh legislation will be needed if the review results in a change to the agreed rise in sales tax. Background, Page 5 Clinton renews sanctions threat, Page 7 See Lex</p>

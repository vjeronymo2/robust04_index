In a 15-minute telephone conversation with Hosokawa,  Clinton said the premier pushed through his reform legislation  with courage and determination, the top government spokesman  told a news conference.    The government's political reform package cleared the Diet  on  Saturday after Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party, reached a compromise on  revising it in the regular Diet session, which opened Monday.    The reform package is intended to root out graft in Japanese  politics through a new system for House of Representatives  elections and stricter controls on campaign funds.    Clinton also told Hosokawa that they should both do their  utmost to make a success of their summit in Washington on  February 11, Takemura said.    The U.S. President reportedly voiced hope that Japan make  efforts for progress in the bilateral framework trade talks and  for additional pump-priming measures. The premier, who has  twice met Clinton, replied he wants to demonstrate his  leadership in tackling the issues, Takemura said.</p>

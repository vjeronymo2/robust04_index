			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Judge Enters Judgment Against Hilton: A federal judge in Las Vegas entered a  final judgment against Hilton Hotels Corp. of a jury award of $38.8 million for  37 dealers and floor men fired from the Las Vegas Hilton in 1983. The jury  awarded the money March 9 in a case in which the dealers and floor men claimed  age and sex discrimination. The award, including attorneys fees and interest,  has now climbed to $44.8 million. Hilton attorneys have 10 working days to file  motions for a new trial and for a judgment of acquittal. If those motions fail,  the company could appeal the case to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in  San Francisco.  </P></p>

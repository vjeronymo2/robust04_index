			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'GODDESS' STATUE DAMAGED BY VANDALS TO BE REPAIRED  </P> <P> The "Goddess of Democracy" statue in Chinatown, destroyed by vandals last week,  got a new lease on life Saturday as the artists responsible for the crudely  fashioned wood and plastic-foam monument gingerly gathered up its remains and  took it in for repairs.  </P> <P> Artist Tom Van Sant, who created the statue, said the goddess will emerge anew  after spending about three weeks in the Santa Monica Canyon studios of the  Artists Equity Assn.  </P> <P> "We built the first one for only $700, so I'm sure we can repair it for about  the same amount of money," Van Sant said. "We may even make it stronger this  time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ropes Cut  </P> <P> The 1,000-pound statue, perched in front of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent  Assn. headquarters on Broadway, was a replica of the one erected by Chinese  students during mass pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tien An Mien  Square in June. The original was destroyed when Chinese troops moved in and  crushed the rebellion in a bloody crackdown.  </P> <P> The replica suffered a similar fate Monday when unknown vandals sliced through  the ropes that anchored the 23-foot-tall monument to a building and toppled it.  The goddess's head was severed in the fall and its foam torso splintered into  dozens of pieces.  </P> <P> Van Sant said some pieces may have to be replaced. Early Saturday morning, as  he and Charles Sherman, president of the nonprofit Artists Equity Assn., loaded  the statue onto the back of a flatbed truck, there remained signs of tension as  two passers-by shielded their faces from television cameras and others kept  their distance from the recovery work.  </P> <P> Van Sant said many Chinese-Americans fear reprisals against relatives in China.  "People are still intimidated," the artist said. "That's why this sculpture is  so important."  </P> <P> No one can say where the goddess will go next. It came to Chinatown last month,  receiving the red-carpet treatment from Chinatown civic leaders, after city  officials evicted it from its Civic Center footbridge perch on grounds that it  represented a safety hazard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Get New Home  </P> <P> Now a safer location may have to be found. Sherman noted that community leaders  in Chinatown will have much to say about the statue's eventual resting place.  There was no one from the Chinese-American community on hand Saturday as the  statue was carted away, but Sherman said the Chinatown community has been very  supportive of the artists' efforts.  </P> <P> Van Sant said he is not surprised that the goddess has had such a turbulent  time of it.  </P> <P> "This doesn't feel good," he said. "But it's understandable. We're dealing with  a fight over people's rights. So I guess that we have to expect these types of  things."  </P> <P> Van Sant hopes to eventually build a more permanent monument to the Chinese  uprising. He is seeking $300,000 in private funding for a marble version of the  goddess that will be offered to the people of China, though he does not expect  the Communist government to accept it.  </P></p>

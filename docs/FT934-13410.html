			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STRENGTH returned to the Footsie futures yesterday, with trading sending the December contract upwards for most of the session, writes Christine Buckley. It opened a point up from the previous day's close at 3,149 and pushed on with a rally that gained momentum until it touched 3,183 at midday. Traders were mainly in a positive mind with their sights set again on anticipated interest rate cuts. The retail sales figures further buoyed their optimism. After lunch there was a small change of fortune, mainly triggered by selling from independent traders wishing to send the contract lower. But with most investors resisting similar action,it showed little signs of a downward intention. The independents then tried to recoup losses and began buying the contract. December finished at 3,177 - a gain of 28 on the day and just over 5 points ahead of its fair value premium to the cash market which stands at about 15 points. Volume was 9,149 - slightly above the average for recent sessions. Traded options again saw a significant amount of action in the index options as traders hedge in anticipation of next month's Budget. Of the total of 35,965 lots dealt in traded options, 11,850 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 5,063 in the Euro FT-SE.</p>

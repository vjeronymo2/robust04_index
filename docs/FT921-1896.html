			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Books: Courage to stay out of the closet EUROPEAN GAY REVIEW, VOLS 8/9 Verlaine-Rimbaud Publishers Pounds 11.95 WOULD YOU read a journal with such a title in the crowded compartment of a train? It is a sad truth, but as editor Salvatore Santagati has found to his literal cost, the blazoned word 'gay' is a great loser of subscriptions. I put myself to the test for the purposes of this review, and only with difficulty restrained the impulse to hide the cover of this thick new double issue as I browsed through it on the Northern Line. That is a pity, for Santagati has created and sustained (for some six years now) an interesting, readable, importantly eclectic and cosmopolitan publication, always conscientiously 'European' if not outrightly global, 'gay' in an unfrivolous, untitillating, wide-ranging sense. The epithet here betokens an informing sensibility rather than an absolute specificity of subject matter or a political project, and though the various essays, stories and poems tend to further the journal's ongoing broad inquiry into homosexuality, they are offered firstly for their literary merit, and ask to be read by all. For a time Santagati agonized about the propriety of dropping the troublous titular word altogether - plain The European Review would still be an honest description of the organ - and it was not an Arts Council funding stipulation or anything like that which induced him to keep it, but a belief in sticking to his guns. In fact he has ceased applying for Arts Council support: meeting the bureaucratic conditions cost more money than the grants were worth. The Review does attract a small amount of approving high-class sponsorship, notably from Yves Saint-Laurent; but essentially it has to pay its own way, and apparently breaks even. Among our enduring literary journals - they are precious few - the EGR stands out both for its content and elegant design. William Cookson's Agenda and Miron Grindea's Adam have alike an appearance of white plainness, and the content of the respective latest issues might be described in a not dissimilar way. The London Magazine looks smarter and maintains a certain interest, but is almost too old a friend now; while Granta has succumbed to glossiness both of form and content. I should declare my hand - I have contributed to a previous issue of the EGR. But I do not think I am biased in singling out the journal's appearance for praise, or in suggesting that its content is more wide-ranging and rewardingly unpredictable than that of its rivals. I have in any case criticisms on both counts. For instance, though the cover, type-face and illustrations of the latest issue are beautifully chosen, the text itself is a litter of misprints, a record of over-hasty proofing. The contributions are as stimulatingly varied as in previous volumes. Big names are again jostled by lesser ones, and the majority of items are special to their context rather than Granta-like slices of forthcoming books. Santagati has been remarkably successful in persuading famous writers to produce for him, Thom Gunn's essay on Allen Ginsberg in Volume 5 being an outstanding example; and if there is nothing here of quite that calibre, we can satisfy ourselves with translations of work by three distinguished deceased Italians: poems and a little story by Sandro Penna, a letter to Penna by Eugenio Montale ('I love your aphrodisiac poetry a lot'), and a vivid emotional review of Penna's stories by Pier Paolo Pasolini. There is a substantial chunk of the editor himself - two stories, a suite of poems and photographs, and a reworking of a passage from St. Augustine. Santagati is an Italian who has elected to write in English as a matter of creative vocation, and achieved results that, while often risking bathos, have a raw and sensual directness of utterance and a formal simplicity that are original. 'Frosted Eyes' does not quite work as a story but powerfully expresses an appalled urban weariness. The autobiographical 'A First Spring in Sicily' is the pure quivering of an unbandaged soul. Perhaps the editor obtrudes himself more than is seemly; but there are many other items here to ponder on, whether Andrew Holleran's amusing and sad New York story, 'Pornography and Funerals', Gregory Woods's discussion of the poetry of Yannis Ritsos, the fiction and conversation of Swiss writer Christoph Geiser, or Jeremy Reed's fruitcake of an essay about Proust's reliance on drugs. One will after all be too absorbed in reading to notice the looks of strangers on a train.</p>

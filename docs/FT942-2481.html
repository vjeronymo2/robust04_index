			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Books: History with a pinch of salt - Fiction THE RAGGED LION by Alan Massie Hutchinson Pounds 15.99, 240 pages OLIVER'S TRAVELS by Alan Plater Little, Brown Pounds 15.99, 315 pages Alan Massie in The Ragged Lion says: 'Novelists after all are liars. We seek to persuade our readers that an imaginary event has the force and significance of the real world . . .'; or rather he puts those words into the mouth of Sir Walter Scott. Massie is himself a liar in the above sense because he pretends to have discovered a lost manuscript by Scott that he is transcribing from a faded parchment. He confesses to a measure of scepticism about the authenticity of this manuscript now to be made public for the first time. It reached him (he says) from an Italian contessa to whom he gave English conversation lessons in Naples in 1964. She in turn is supposed to have inherited it from her great-grandmother who had an extra-marital affair with Scott's son Charles, its first owner. Massie gets around the main stumbling-block to his strategy by suggesting that when Lockhart came to write his life of Scott he used the original of this manuscript but suppressed those parts of it he considered discreditable to Scott, and then destroyed it, unaware of the copy. Here, then, is an unauthorised life of the laird of Abbotsford by a modern Scottish novelist of great distinction. It is a quietly enjoyable read. Massie is outstanding for his use of fiction as a commentary on history and contemporary society. His novel about Vichy France was called A Question of Loyalties, which would do just as well as a title here. Massie presents a stalwart Scottish patriot who had a catch in the throat when he spoke of the 'Fifteen and the 'Forty-Five, yet has a similar fierce pride in arranging the ceremonial for the royal visit to Scotland of 1822. Scott comes across as a born Tory with many Whig friends and attitudes; a lawyer who became a poet - a rhymester and balladeer who invented the historical prose novel - to mention but a few of the contradictory loyalties Massie uncovers. He delights in the pride Scott took in administering his own huge estate, his sense of creating a truly hierarchical community there. If Border Country was Scott's location it is also Massie's, who since 1982 has lived six miles away from Abbotsford. The novel is scant of plot, but is correspondingly strong on ideas. Hubris comes when Scott lost his entire fortune in the collapse of the Ballantyne printing works in which he had invested heavily. Massie shows him recalling the intricacies of this disaster and his recovery from it. More original is a supernatural strand that Massie weaves into the tapestry involving a ghostly manifestation in a murky close in Edinburgh Old Town where the hero suffers remorse for his past in a head-on confrontation with a childhood phantom. Alan Plater was born in Hull and made his name a quarter of a century ago with his script Close the coalhouse door. It was a lively entertainment that unfolded the troubled mining history of the North East in the Joan Littlewood musical style. Since then Plater has had dozens more successful scripts and novels to his credit. His latest picaresque novel Oliver's Travel's follows a former university lecturer with a passion for anagrams moving around Britain on the trail of some very unsavoury operators, and partnered by a policewoman suspended from duty. Their happy plight is clearly modelled on the pair handcuffed together in Hitchcock's Thirty-Nine Steps movie (the earliest version). The text is both stiff with wisecracks and soggy with nostalgia but in spite of this Plater keeps his show on the road and leaves us in no doubt of his disgust at the current state of the nation.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASY ROAD FOR GOVERNMENT MISDEEDS;  </P> <P> WHY DO WE DO A ROTTEN JOB OF POLICING THE PUBLIC SECTOR?  </P> <P> It is too early to speculate whether "error in judgment" will prove too  charitable a label to paste over the scandal now playing at Los Angeles' City  Hall. But while we are waiting for the verdict, let's ask why, when it comes to  enforcement of law, standards of decency and plain good sense, we do such a  rotten job policing our public sector?  </P> <P> This may sound strange coming from someone who has long urged tightening up the  laws we wield against business corporations. But in choosing a legal  environment in which to play, the corporate polluter and the inside trader  would pick the public bureaucrat's ballpark any day. The bucks may be bigger in  the private sector, but the law is cushier in the public.  </P> <P> The indications of this dual standard are pervasive. The management of any  major business corporation has a team of independent accountants poking around  under foot. We know that they can be fooled and even co-opted. But no  private-sector auditor ever missed a mess of the magnitude unraveling at the  Department of Housing and Urban Development. Could a business corporation get  away with telling its shareholders their losses in the obscure dribs and drabs  we taxpayers are getting about our expected liabilities from the  savings-and-loans muddle?  </P> <P> When governments legislate worker safety and health rules, they commonly exempt  themselves. Ditto with selected environmental, labor-relations and securities  law provisions. Under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, municipalities and  other units of government can be sued only with the government's consent and  subject to the limits that the government imposes. As individuals, government  officials are barricaded behind a wall of legal doctrines that those in the  board room can only envy.  </P> <P> When it is all put together, the public- sector employee or the tenant of a  public- housing project has fewer legal protections than his neighbor whose  employer or landlord is a private firm. The Environmental Protection Agency has  had a far harder time bringing city governments to heel than it has business  corporations. Politically and in the courts, it is easier to beat up on the  firms.  </P> <P> There are several explanations why this imbalance persists. Many people assume  both that the private sector overshadows the rest of the society, and that  there is less to fear from the generally well-intentioned public sector than  from their greedy corporate counterparts. Wrong on both counts. Statistically,  governments (and nonprofit corporations) are growing faster than the for-profit  corporations -- as employers, consumers and wealth distributors. And government  has done things in the name of science, national defense and the public  interest that the greediest corporation would shrink from.  </P> <P> In the 1930s and '4Os, the U.S. Public Health Service studied the "natural"  course of syphilis in 400 poor black males, even after penicillin had become  available and might have cured them. But curing them would have ruined the  study. And 107 of the "subjects" proceeded to die from the disease.  </P> <P> In the 1950s, the Army allegedly exposed soldiers to nuclear-weapons tests in  order to determine how humans would function "in the shadow of a . . . nuclear  cloud." Veterans trying to prove that leukemia was the price they paid for the  military's curiosity have been barred a hearing on the charges: the federal  Torts Claims Act does not permit veterans to bring suit for injuries suffered  in uniform against the government they fought for.  </P> <P> More recently, it was disclosed that for decades our nuclear-weapons plants  have been disposing of nuclear and chemical wastes with methods that the  private sector was told were criminal. When asked why the dumpings were so long  kept secret, the Department of Energy intoned "national security."  </P> <P> The suggestion is that corporate executives, leery of their own motivations,  may be more prudent with risks than their public-sector counterparts, who can  quiet their consciences with glib rationalizations about "public necessity."  </P> <P> There is something else to consider. The people who run major business  corporations are not only under the gaze of myriad federal and state  regulators, so that their financial dealings, for example, are subject to  continuous disclosure. The whole system enjoys supplemental policing by  shareholders and, more realistically, a bar of "shareholders' attorneys" that  earns its livelihood raking over the corporate filings and jumping into  situations that look fishy.  </P> <P> When we turn to the public sector, what takes the place of the shareholders'  bar? The theoretical retort is that we don't need extra legal accountability  because we get our accountability at the ballot box. But that is just theory.  By the time the HUD and S&amp;L fiascoes broke, our national CEO had served out  his time in Washington and was back on the ranch.  </P> <P> There is no one cure for the many facets of public sector mischief. But there  is a clear starting point. We have to reexamine the dual standard point by  point. In what ways are the laws and procedures more permissive in the public  sector, and with what justification?  </P> <P> Such a quest would turn up many control techniques commonly accepted in the  private sector that merit copying and applying to governments. But without some  pushing from the public, it is an idea that will move with all the vigor of a  self-investigation at City Hall.  </P></p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Italy's corruption probe forces out third party leader THE LEADER of Italy's Liberal party resigned yesterday. He is the third party head in a month forced to step down after being implicated in the corruption scandals that have rocked the country. Mr Renato Altissimo's move came after he was warned on Monday he was under investigation by Milan magistrates for allegedly receiving L50m (Pounds 22,500) in illicit funds from Enel, the national electricity authority. Mr Altissimo, who denied any wrongdoing, was one of 10 parliamentarians this week advised they were under investigation over Enel payments. The small Liberal party is a partner in the four-party government coalition led by prime minister Giuliano Amato, but Mr Altissimo's decision is not expected to affect its stability. Nevertheless, it underlines again the extent to which the corruption scandal is eroding the credibility of the traditional parties and removing well-known figures from public life. Already Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, and Mr Giorgio La Malfa of the Republicans have had to step down after being accused of accepting illegal payments. Mr Amato again came under fierce attack in parliament yesterday. There were chaotic scenes in the Chamber of Deputies, where opposition MPs from the populist Lombard League at one stage dangled a hangman's noose at government benches. Mr Amato was frequently interrupted by members from the neo-fascist MSI party and the Lombard League as he concluded the debate on how to confront the crisis caused by the wave of corruption being exposed by an increasingly assertive judiciary. He urged parliament to adopt a bipartisan approach to dealing with corruption. But it was still unclear how the parties would agree on legislation to achieve a political solution to the corruption scandals. In another development likely to undermine even further the old politico-economic system, Milan magistrates began late yesterday to leak excerpts of a confession by Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the head of Eni, the state energy and chemical company, arrested a week ago. He is said to have confirmed that Eni made a series of illicit payments to political parties before he took over in 1990 and during his period as chairman. The magistrates have long regarded Eni as the heart of the system of illicit party funding. The scale of parliamentary involvement in the scandal has also been underlined this week by the fresh action of Milan magistrates and also by magistrates in Naples and Reggio Calabria.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada's Cambior wins Peru copper concession Cambior of Montreal has won the concession to develop the Peruvian copper deposits known as La Granja, in the northern department of Cajamarca. It outbid three other Canadian companies - Cominco, Teck and Placer Dome - as well as Cyprus Minerals of the US at public auction in Lima on Monday. Cambior will invest Dollars 25m over a maximum of five years, with an additional payment of Dollars 1m a year for the exploration option. It also offered the Peruvian state a 5 per cent royalty on all future sales. La Granja has mineral reserves of around 320m tonnes, averaging 0.78 per cent copper and four grammes of silver a tonne. If feasibility studies prove positive Cambior could invest Dollars 450m in an initial leaching operation to produce copper cathodes. A concentrator plant would follow. Mr Raul Otero, president of Mineroperu, the state company that owns the deposit, said anticipated sales could top Dollars 300m a year. That would mean Dollars 15m a year in royalty payments.</p>

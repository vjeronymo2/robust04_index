			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Plan for maritime aircraft SIX EUROPEAN aircraft makers have grouped to produce a maritime patrol aircraft. The initiative comes from Dassault Aviation of France and British Aerospace, with Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, Construcciones Aeronauticas (CASA) of Spain, Alenia of Italy and Fokker of the Netherlands. Through a new 'industrial group', Europatrol, they plan to seek government agreement on a common aircraft and mission system for use throughout Europe; they hope the aircraft will be exported worldwide and the new mission system be suitable for updating current aircraft. France has been pressing for a joint maritime patrol project through the Independent European Programme Group (IEPG), made up of Nato members. The companies will lobby governments to set up an outline IEPG 'staff target' for the aircraft. The UK has been considering Dassault's Atlantique 2 as an option to replace its ageing Nimrod patrol aircraft.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Days off sick cost employers Pounds 13bn a year ABSENTEEISM because of sickness is costing employers Pounds 13bn a year, says a survey published today by the Confederation of British Industry. The survey shows that the average worker is absent from work for eight days in the year because of sick-ness. Workers in the National Health Service and local government took the most time off. In those two sectors absenteeism was 41 per cent higher than the national average. Percom, the personnel software company that carried out the survey, suggested that the result may have been caused by private companies monitoring and controlling absence from work more effectively than the public sector. The differences in absenteeism could also be related to the composition of work forces, with the public sector employing large numbers of blue-collar workers. According to the survey, full-time blue-collar workers in both manufacturing and service sectors had almost double the level of absenteeism of white-collar workers. However, absence rates through sickness are falling. Mr Robbie Gilbert, the CBI's director of employment, said: 'Sickness absence overall fell sharply last year by almost 0.5 per cent of working time from the 1991 figure of 4 per cent. This compares with the 1987 figure of 3.6 per cent, which rose to 3.9 per cent for both 1989 and 1990.' Most companies used computers to keep track of staff absences, with 94 per cent having notification procedures; 83 per cent enforced disciplinary procedures; and 82 per cent operated recruitment checks to eliminate work-shy candidates.</p>

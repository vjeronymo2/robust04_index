			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Selin Caglayan: "Moscow's Obstruction of </F> Turkmenistan's Natural Gas"]    [Text] It has been ascertained that Russia has made  initiatives to obstruct the laying of a pipeline for  transporting Turkmenistan's natural gas to Turkey and Europe.  Russia has been buying Turkmenistan's natural gas at a very low  price and selling it to Turkey and Europe for three times as  much as it pays for it. Obviously, it neither wants to lose that  resource nor to allow Turkmenistan to become wealthy and rid  itself from Moscow's influence.    It is reported that allowing Russia to become a member of  the  pipeline consortium--which has been established by Turkmenistan,  Iran, and Turkey--was powerless to obstruct Moscow's influence.  Although Turkey is a member of that consortium, BOTAS [Pipelines  and Petroleum Transportation Corporation] does not have any say  in it. Meanwhile, planning work cannot be carried out because of  Russia's bureaucratic obstructions. No concrete project has  been drawn up yet. Consequently, the funds that are required for  the laying of the pipeline have not been acquired. Some $5  billion are required for the project.    President Suleyman Demirel held talks with President  Saparmurad Niyazov in Ankara yesterday. He informed him that it  is of vital importance to supply Turkemenistan's natural gas to  Turkey within two years at the latest. Demirel also asked  Niyazov to use his influence to overcome Russia's obstructions.</p>

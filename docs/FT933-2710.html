			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Productivity deal may go ahead NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned power group, is planning to implement an employee productivity deal this year which has been held up as a result of the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit for public-sector workers. The company secured union approval for the deal just before the government announced the pay limit last November. Its implementation would have led to a significant improvement in the company's efficiency, but would have increased earnings by considerably more than 1.5 per cent. Such delays have been highlighted by government opponents who say rigid pay policies can hurt employers as well as employees. The government's latest pay policy, announced this week by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, means any public-sector pay rises will have to be paid for in improved productivity. While that is tougher on employees than the existing policy, it suggests that Nuclear Electric's productivity deal, which would reform pay bargaining and erode demarcations, may be feasible. Mr Bob Hawley, Nuclear Electric's chief executive, speaking as the company published its annual report and an environmental audit, said the company would implement the deal if it could. Even without the deal the company has improved productivity, measured in sales of electricity per employee, by 23 per cent. In addition, many employees have received pay rises of more 1.5 per cent in the past year because they have benefited from 'gain share' schemes at power stations. These rewarded productivity and were in place before last November. In the new productivity scheme the company would introduce single-table bargaining in which all unions would negotiate in one forum. There would also be greater teamwork. The company could not say yesterday how much productivity would improve if it was introduced. The annual report showed that the pay of Mr John Collier, the chairman, increased from Pounds 188,000 in 1992 to Pounds 210,000 in 1993. The figures included a bonus for 1992 of Pounds 29,000 and for 1993 of Pounds 45,000. Mr Collier said the 1.5 per cent limit would apply to his pay rise this year.</p>

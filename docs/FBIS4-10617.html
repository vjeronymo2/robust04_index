			<p>BFN     [Text] Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia and the minister vice  president of Corfo [Production Development Corporation], Felipe  Sandoval, announced this afternoon at a news conference the  government's decision to privatize Lan-Chile [Chilean National  Airline], Edelnor [Northern Electricity Company], Empremar  [State Maritime Enterprise], and Transcontainer [branch of  Empremar], which will allow, said Minister Garcia, increasing  the public resources needed to improve the opportunities of  Chileans with little resources.    Garcia added that the privatization process of Lan-Chile for  the sale of about 35 percent of its shares has begun. He added  that keeping Lan-Chile will only introduce distortions and make  competition in the air market too rigid. It also was announced  that the contract the government will sign with a brokerage firm  for bidding on Lan-Chile was sent to the General Comptroller's  Office. The call for bids to privatize Lan-Chile and the other  companies will be made at the national and international level.    Minister Felipe Sandoval referred specifically to the case  of  the Empremar Company, which has a branch, Transcontainer:    [Begin Sandoval recording] This company has a legal  restriction imposed during the military regime that prevents the  state from selling more than 35 percent of the company. What we  will do in the next few days is to submit a bill to remove that  restriction on the company in order to allow its capitalization,  to allow its association with the private sector in order to  solve its economic problems. [end recording]    Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia was asked if this decision  that is being made only one month after the new government was  inaugurated was a bit too hasty, too fast.    [Begin Garcia recording] As we said, our intention is to  have  the markets operate efficiently. And we believe market  conditions will allow the efficient operation of these companies  through the private sector. [end recording]    Garcia said the government will guarantee an appropriate  price for the sale of public companies, thus safeguarding  workers' legitimate interests and giving them the option to  participate in their purchase. He also said this privatization  process is the first in this administration and the idea is to  continue with the privatization of public companies because it  is the best way, Garcia emphasized, to safeguard the interests  of all Chileans, especially the poor.</p>

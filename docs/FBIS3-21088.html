			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vera Rich: "Take Your Partners, Please"] </F>   [Text] Russia is attempting to salvage something of the  high-energy physics programme that it inherited from the Soviet  Union, with more than a little help from its foreign friends.  At the end of October, a new scientific and technological  cooperation agreement was signed by Russia's science minister  Boris Saltykov and Carlo Rubbia, the then director-general of  the CERN [European Center for Nuclear Research] European  particle physics laboratory.    The agreement, CERN officials stress, is essentially an  umbrella one, with no specific commitment to any particular  research effort. It aims rather at providing a "reasonable"  (three-year) transition period for developing relations between  CERN and the Russian Federation, with the ultimate goal of the  latter becoming a full member of CERN. But the place of the  signing was significant - the Institute of High Energy Physics  at Protvino, near Moscow.    Protvino, a typical example of the "big science" beloved by  Soviet planners and propagandists, was originally intended to  possess a 3000 GeV [giga electron volt] accelerator. But even  before the Soviet Union fell apart two years ago, construction  work was at a standstill and plans had been scaled down to a 600  GeV device.    Now CERN is discussing a possible cooperation programme,  working in an energy range now available on accelerators  elsewhere. The lower-energy device will provide a useful  test-beam for gas targets. Indeed, the Protvino scientists are  already planning such a joint project with the United States,  but it is a far cry from the grandiose visions of Protvino's  original plans.    The problem with Russia's "big" physics is not simply one of  money. Western rescue funds are available, and a CERN-Protvino  project is, as PHYSICS WORLD goes to press, currently awaiting  approval from the INTAL foundation where, admittedly, it is  competing against over 7000 other applications.    There is also an ideological factor. "Science" was for  decades hailed by communist theorists as the basis of the Soviet  system; there has now been a backlash of public opinion against  science and science spending. Privatization, rather than  science, is widely seen as the avenue to prosperity, and  interest in "pseudo-science" is growing.    Even if Russia had unlimited funds, the government might  well  find it difficult to justify a major commitment to science. For  a country near bankruptcy, it is well nigh impossible. Yet  scientists at thousands of research institutes have to be paid.  And such is the confusion in the entire science sector that  even Saltykov is in no position to make an unequivocal decision  about the future of so costly an institution as Protvino.    Saltykov, however, does not control all Russian science. The  Serpukhov nuclear facility, for example, still belongs to the  ministry of nuclear energy. There is a long-standing division  of competence between the science minister and the Academy of  Sciences, and one of the most important research facilities the  Dubna Joint Institute of Nuclear Research, is, strictly  speaking, an international rather than a Russian facility.    Dubna belonged to Comecon (the socialist-bloc equivalent of  the EC), which no longer exists. One of its former members,  Hungary, quit Dubna when it joined CERN in 1990. The other  remain members formally but can contribute little financially.  (Paradoxically the late German Democratic Republic still  continues to provide finance: the new united Germany, although  formally only an "observer", has made a financial commitment.)    Under these circumstances, Russia is left to pay - or leave  unpaid - the bills. In November, deputy premier Yegor Gaidar  instructed finance minister Boris Bedorov to find additional  funding for Dubna - although from where was not made clear.    International cooperation in science is now seen by the  Russians as a vital, and perhaps the only, lifeline. It is not  a one-way process. CERN would like to transfer to Protvino a  number of experiments which cannot conveniently be continued at  its own facilities. And cooperation need not be only bilateral.  In spite of Russia's claim to be the legal heir of the Soviet  Union, other newly independent states have inherited part of the  ex-Soviet scientific workforce -- in many cases, with nowhere  for them to work because the laboratories are in Russia.    Now the academies of sciences of the successor republics are  discussing joint research, and an institutional framework for  cooperation is being negotiated. Everything depends on Western  funding. But there seems no reason why a Western commitment to  bail out the scientific workforce of, say, Belarus or Armenia,  should not include supporting scientists from those countries at  Protvino or Dubna.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS BEATS VILLA PARK ON BECKTON'S 109 YARDS, 2 TDS  </P> <P> The return of running back LaQuan Beckton was just the remedy for Los Alamitos  High School's ailing offense Friday night.  </P> <P> Beckton rushed for 109 yards and scored two touchdowns to lead Los Alamitos to  a 17-10 nonleague win over Villa Park in front of 3,800 fans in Fred Kelly  Stadium.  </P> <P> Beckton, a bruising 200-pound senior, missed Los Alamitos' opening two games  with a hamstring pull, but more than lived up to his lofty preseason billing as  one of the county's top backs against a strong Villa Park defense.  </P> <P> Fittingly, Beckton's 12-yard touchdown run with 8:30 remaining ensured Los  Alamitos the victory and prevented the Griffins from losing two straight games  for the first time in seven years.  </P> <P> Only a week ago, Los Alamitos' offense failed to generate a touchdown as the  Griffins had to be content with a blocked punt for a score and a 91-yard  interception return in a 17-14 loss to Servite.  </P> <P> "LaQuan makes a big difference in our offense," said John Barnes, Los Alamitos  coach. "You need that hard-running back to be successful. I thought we got our  offense going a little better and our defense came up with some key turnovers."  </P> <P> Villa Park (1-2) wasted three scoring opportunities as tailback Ellis Williams  fumbled twice and quarterback Jason Martian threw two interceptions. Williams  had 83 yards in 16 carries, but his fumble into Los Alamitos' end zone midway  through the third quarter was the turning point of the game.  </P> <P> Villa Park held a 10-9 lead when Williams fumbled and Los Alamitos responded  with an 80-yard drive that was capped by Beckton's winning score. Martian made  the most of his seven completions, throwing for 159 yards, but his interception  with 4:16 remaining at Los Alamitos' 20-yard line ended any hopes for a win.  </P> <P> The game showcased two outstanding receivers. Los Alamitos split end Tyler  Cashman caught 14 passes for 145 yards and also caught a two-point conversion  pass. Cashman, running primarily short slant patterns, had 12 catches at  halftime.  </P> <P> Aaron Boone, son of Kansas City Royals catcher Bob Boone, caught three long  passes for 96 yards and made some very difficult catches look easy.  </P> <P> "It was a wild football game," Barnes said.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos went into its meeting last year with Villa Park as the county's  top-ranked team and came away smarting from a 24-21 loss. After Friday night's  game, Barnes said the revenge factor was never mentioned.  </P> <P> "We never talked about it," Barnes said. "We talked about the great winning  tradition at this school and the kids decided they didn't want to lose two  straight. We've still got a lot of work to do before we play Esperanza in two  weeks, but we're getting better."  </P></p>

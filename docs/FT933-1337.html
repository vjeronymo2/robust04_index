			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Observer: Gift of the gab While Bank of England governor Eddie George has international director Andrew Crockett to thank for much of the substance of his thoughtful speech earlier this week on how Europe should face up to the post-ERM age, Crockett himself may well already be looking forward to a much larger stage from which to air his own views on world economic affairs. For Alexandre Lamfalussy, the sensible but somewhat crusty general manager of the secretive Bank for International Settlements, steps down next summer and Crockett has emerged as the front runner to replace him at the Basle-based central bankers' bank. His appointment would be cheering news for Britain, which in the BIS's 63-year history has never managed to secure a UK national at the top of the organisation. It would also dovetail neatly with UK aspirations to muscle into the mainstream of European economic thinking now that the continent is staring a broken exchange rate mechanism in the face. An outgoing 50-year-old, who has been marked down for higher things ever since he took over his Threadneedle Street job in 1989 after a 17-year stint at the International Monetary Fund, Crockett is one of the more talkative and free-thinking among UK economic policy-makers. So he would be expected to inject a new sense of drive; the BIS certainly could do with speaking up rather more than in the past when it comes to big discussions on whither the world economy.</p>

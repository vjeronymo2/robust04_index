			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Arts: Nanci Griffith, country girl - Concert Nanci Griffith was a school teacher before she became the self-appointed guardian of country music. And don't you know it. Her Wednesday night appearance at the Albert Hall was as much a lecture as a concert. Not that it was boring: Griffith is too much of an enthusiast, and too, well, odd for that. She has a Texan drawl that stretches into Oklahoma. She also has a disarmingly mimsy speaking voice which miraculously converts into a resonant toe curler when she finally gets around to singing. But the most mesmerising thing about her performance is her ability to centre the universe around her girlish shoulders. Without Nanci, you are made to feel, country music would have gone the way of the drawing room ballad. Fortunately she has playing the guitars in her band both the 'greatest acoustic guitar player in my life time' as well as 'my favourite singer-songwriter'. It was a relief that the percussionist's life time achievement was that he came from Hemel Hempstead. The whole performance is one long roll call of inspirations and good friends. We learn, rather remarkably, that Nanci, and the equally decorative Emmylou Harris, spend their New Year Eves playing lonesome country duets. Other singers actually dropped in on the concert. Carolyn Hester, the primal force behind Griffiths decision to go on the road, turned up to chorus on 'Boots of Spanish Leather', and a crinkly Ralph McTell was happy to share the verses on Nanci's latest single 'From Clare to Here', which he wrote. By the final rousing version of 'Its a hard life wherever you go', the eleven musicians on stage had even been joined by the guitar tuner. Actually Nanci Griffith has good reasons to present herself as the incarnation of country. She was plugging a latest album 'Other voices, Other rooms', which is devoted to songs by contemporaries and precursors, one precursor stretching back to 1877. It made for a strange blend of the personal and the universal. We learned a great deal of Nanci Griffiths experiences with the security system at Dallas Airport; we also heard her covers of fine songs by Tom Paxton and Townes Van Zandt. It has taken Nanci Griffith many years to reach her current eminence. For decades her songs were hits for others; now in repaying the compliment she has somehow appropriated the entire country music catalogue. The audience sat in quiet reverence. Griffith has obviously moved swiftly from school teacher, to head mistress, to chairman of the governors. There is a great deal of steel inside the frock. Nanci Griffith is touring the country until early July</p>

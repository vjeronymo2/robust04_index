Upon being elected in the 8 May elections, our government  will implement the following in all its forms:    1. We will govern with honesty and efficiency and fight  corruption in all its forms.    2. We will increase significantly the punishments applicable  to kidnappers, murderers, thieves, and drug traffickers. We  will substantially reform the judicial system so that there is  justice and the law is enforced.    3. Our main effort will be centered on fighting  malnutrition, extreme poverty, and the neglect in which our  people live. We will give the neediest decent and affordable  housing, whether they own or lease. We will promote economic  growth in hand with social progress.    4. Land and housing allocations made by agrarian reform and  the Housing Ministry will be given equitably to men and women to  protect the family, and to only one of them, except in confirmed  cases involving unwed mothers, who will be the object of our  special attention. [sentence as published] We will protect the  family, promote an equitable and fair treatment to women, tend  to children's needs.    5. We will roll back the retirement age as soon as the  Social Security Fund finances recover and review the amounts of  pensions given to retirees and pensioners.    6. We will promote the creation of new jobs via investment  in public works and give fiscal incentives to private companies  so they can generate jobs.    7. We will continue to defend the 13th month bonus.    8. We will respect and pay the salary increases established  by the law to educators, nurses, firemen, policemen, postal  employees, and other public employees. We will review  periodically the minimum wage of private company employees as  Article 62 of the Constitution establishes.    9. We will protect the agricultural and industrial producer  by guaranteeing the consumption of national products before  foreign products.    10. We will give incentives through scholarships, rewards,  and other stimuli to Panamanians, mostly the young, who stand  out in sports, culture, sciences, and the arts.    11. We will upgrade the quality of the education system so  students can promptly join the labor force; we will pay just  salaries to educators and promote their professional betterment.    12. The Public Force will continue to be headed by civilians  and will be trained and equipped to protect a democratic society  and guarantee that security to all citizens.    13. We will ensure the reverted areas are utilized for the  benefit of all Panamanians, not just a few. We will continue  our historical struggle to make our canal fully Panamanian.    14. We will initiate the territorial delimitations to which  the Indian peoples are entitled and provide them with the public  services of health, housing, and education under equal  conditions with the rest of the country; we will protect and  defend their cultures. The San Blas reservation will be  officially named Kuna Ayala.    15. We will improve and extend the services of garbage  collection, water, electricity, telephone, and health, and at  the same time lower their rates.    16. We will implement a national tourism and a port and  maritime development plan, taking advantage of our country's  natural beauty and geographic location for the sake of artisans,  fishermen, merchants, and, in general, the economy of the  Panamanian people.    17. We will devote special attention to the ecology by  promoting reforestation and sustainable development. We will  sponsor laws that foster the utilization and protection of our  flora and fauna.    18.

The Board shall notify the agent of the class by certified mail, return receipt requested, and the administrative judge of its decision to accept or dismiss a class complaint. At the same time, the Board shall forward to the agent of the class copies of the administrative judge's recommendation and the complaint file.

In addition, it shall inform the agent of the class of the right to file a request for review of the dismissal of the class complaint with the Commission pursuant to &sect;268.401 of this part, or to file a civil action.

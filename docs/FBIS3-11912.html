Tchamlesso] </F>   [Text] With an impressive bureaucracy that includes 22,000  members, an ultra-sensitive budget totaling nearly $30 billion  annually, and operating methods usually described as sinister  and ruthless, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has a  future role that evokes distrust and uncertainty today.    "The CIA's worst of times" is the concise description used  recently by Wolf Blitzer, a CNN correspondent attached to the  White House and an expert on defense issues. This is how Wolf  summarized the low spirits prevailing at the United States'  foremost intelligence service during an interview last night  with James Woolsey, director of the so-called "company," who was  notably vague and elusive when answering questions on the CIA's  real mission.    Can President Bill Clinton trust the classified reports  prepared daily by the intelligence community especially "now  when the CIA seems to have lost its soul and is trying to find  explanations to justify its existence?" Blitzer asked Woolsey.    No clear reply came from the top Langley official, who is  still somewhat confused by the disclosures associated with the  Aldrich Ames case. Ames, a "mole" or double agent, provided  extremely sensitive information to Moscow for 10 consecutive  years prior to and following the Soviet Union's fall.    Blitzer says the arrest of Ames and his wife, Maria del  Rosario Casas, has sparked a scandal and also opened a page that  reveals not only the fissures and moral decay within the CIA but  also, from the operational viewpoint, the level of decline in  internal security control mechanisms, which Woolsey must  reevaluate.    This couple's activities are something of a curiosity,  because they are now being attributed to "motives of profit" as  the result of receiving $2,500,000 for selling classified  information first to the Soviet Union and then to Russia. Ames  and his wife met and were married in 1985 in Mexico City, where  both were diplomats. Some time later, Aldrich Ames was  appointed chief of counterintelligence in the Soviet Union and  Eastern Europe.    He presided over the agency's much coveted and feared  division located in the lower section of the CIA's Virginia  executive building. The entrance hall of this building leads to  a mural lined with 50 stars, each representing agents killed in  action in enemy territory, according to Woolsey's explanations.  Most likely the files can attest to a greater number of agents  killed.    According to the charges filed against Ames by a special FBI  commission, he is suspected of having provided Moscow with the  names and identities of 10 CIA agents infiltrated into the then  Soviet KGB; moreover it is believed they were all executed for  high treason.    Certain experts believe Ames is now being used as a  "scapegoat," because he provides the U.S. intelligence community  with a reason to implement a witch-hunt with the self-evident  goal of somehow justifying the predicaments through which it has  gone, its lack of clear direction, as well as interagency  rivalries.    Now more than ever, the CIA is confronting fierce  competition  from other U.S. intelligence services, which include the Defense  Intelligence Agency (DIA), the FBI, the National Security  Council, which is attached to the Presidency, and the State  Department's External Operations Unit.    Woolsey seeks to establish more cooperation between these  agencies, an objective which, according to some analysts, is  difficult to accomplish.    The CIA was created, supposedly, to gather information  abroad, though it tends to invade the privacy of certain  individuals' homes. What will it do now in the absence of  concrete adversaries?    In the past, the agency ordered the assassination of foreign  world leaders and well-known figures, in addition to conspiring  to topple "hostile" governments.    With the end of an open East-West confrontation, the  "company" lacks a concrete perspective of its real mission. It  is walking blindly behind confusing and unpredictable objectives  and goals, such as regional tensions developing in different  geographical areas.    Democrat Oklahoma Senator David Boren, chairman of the  Senate  Select Intelligence Committee, said recently it is time to  define this agency's role.    The agency's greatest problem is it mistakenly targets  numerous objectives, which include drug trafficking, nuclear  proliferation, or transshipments of missile technology,  activities which it purports to control, as proclaimed by  President Clinton himself, in an attempt to redefine the role of  U.S. espionage.    Another objective on which it focuses includes stressing  intelligence gathering on the latest technological, industrial,  and economical trends, even from some of the country's own  Western allies.    Before the collapse of the European socialist system,  Washington assigned 65 percent of the CIA's budget to  clandestine operations in the USSR and its Eastern allies. It  presently earmarks 40 percent of the same budget to the same  purpose.</p>

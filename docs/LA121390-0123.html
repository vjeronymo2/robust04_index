			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOTTERY BOARD CUTBACK ELIMINATES 50 JOBS  </P> <P> The state Lottery Commission, which once had excess money for operations, cut  50 jobs Wednesday as part of a $59-million, 15%-budget cut this fiscal year to  offset sluggish game sales.  </P> <P> The policy-setting board voted 4 to 0 to approve the latest round of nearly $19  million in reductions, effective Jan. 1, including elimination of 50 vacant  positions.  </P> <P> None of the agency's 1,100 workers will be fired but a freeze will continue on  the hiring of replacements for departing workers.  </P> <P> It is the first serious cutback in the five-year history of the voter-approved  games but is not directly related to the state budget crisis, since lottery  administration is funded by up to 16% of ticket sales.  </P> <P> Lottery officials blamed sluggish sales on the flagging economy and the lack of  a big jackpot needed to attract players.  </P></p>

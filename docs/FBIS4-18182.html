			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified correpondent on address by Foreign </F> Minister Klaus Kinkel in the Bundestag debate on 11 Mar 94:  "There Is No Alternative to Help for the Eastern Neighbors"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] According to Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel, Russia is of central importance for Europe.  Therefore, there is no alternative at all to further support  for President Yeltsin. If stability and economic progress is  achieved there, the whole of Europe will benefit from it.  Russia must be fully integrated within the world economy, where  the division of labor exists, which also applies to the other  CIS states. In particular, Kinkel mentions Ukraine, whose  government he requests to accede to the Nonproliferation Treaty.  Then the minister spoke about his recent meeting with the three  Baltic ministers in Bonn:    Of course, the three Baltic states are a special concern for  us. Ties in the Baltic area that have been buried for years have  to be revived again. Of all former Soviet republics, the Baltic  states can show the most impressive reform successes. Yes, the  dimensions are small, but they are nevertheless impressive.    One objective of our presidency in the second half of the  year will be to conclude an association agreement with the  prospect of association also with Latvia, Lithuania, and  Estonia. The talks that I held with the three Baltic foreign  ministers in the past few days focused on leading these states  to the European Union [EU]. Politically and economically stable  Baltic countries are an advantage for the whole of the region,  and, by the way, also for Russia.    It is the priority task of the European policy of these days  to join the parts of Europe that have been separated for more  than four decades. It presents particular challenges to  Germany, the country in the center. We are particularly  affected by all the risks, but, on the other hand, especially  favored with the chances, too. Since the end of 1989, we have  particularly supported the reform states in Central and East  Europe.    However, the historic chance that lies ahead of us, that is,  to help the chances of freedom in our east to be transformed  into jobs and thus into permanent political institutions, far  exceeds Germany's powers. Also for this reason, it is so  important that the EU continues to advance consistently on the  road toward its enlargement, as was outlined in Copenhagen.    Of course, the European-Atlantic institutions must not be  overstrained or overtaxed when stability is extended to Central  and East Europe. This would not help those who want to become  members, either. Therefore, we have to beware of a course of  action that only permits the choice between entry and isolation.  The right course is a flexible system of increasingly close  pan-European cooperation in addition to the option of entry.    I do not want to fail to mention the Foreign Ministry's  cultural promotion for the German minorities in Central and East  Europe. For example, several representations were newly  established in regions with German minorities. The foreign  representations in Almaty, Bishkek, Tashkent, Gdansk, Szczecin,  and soon Novosibirsk and Saratov are dedicating a considerable  part of their work to the concerns of the German minority in  their administrative districts. This is good and very important.  Help for self-help, from the training and advanced training of  teachers through syllabuses and textbooks to media promotion, is  primarily the issue here. With this policy, we want to build  additional bridges to these countries through our minorities,  but we do not want to create artificial loyalty problems.    We must not forget one thing: Europe is more than growth  figures and foreign trade statistics and also more than the mere  maximization of affluence. Europe is a cultural area. Whoever  wants to put it together again has to restart above all the  intellectual-cultural exchange. A tremendous amount of things  still have to be done in this respect.    Personally, I very much deplore the fact that we have  relatively few funds for this purpose at a time when we have  problems and difficulties. Above all I deplore it so much  because we -- this has often been said in the Bundestag -- have  an enormous chance as far as our language is concerned. It is  not unimportant for the Germans -- it is particularly striking  for me as their foreign minister -- that colleagues, friends,  and partners who speak German come from these countries to the  numerous conferences that we hold and where French and English  have hitherto been the only languages. This is a chance that we  should use. I ask the German Bundestag again to help me when  money is at issue and to give a proper impetus. [passage  omitted]</p>

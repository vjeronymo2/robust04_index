			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Sport: King Lear at the Palace Watching live athletics is almost as different as can be imagined from watching the sport on television. At the World Cup meeting staged last weekend at Crystal Palace, I spent several hours trying to think what, exactly, the spectacle in the arena reminded me of. Eventually it clicked. Anyone who has, during the last year or so, attended a performance by the Royal Shakespeare Company will be familiar with those dumb show opening scenes that directors so love. Convinced that they can improve upon the beginning of, say, King Lear, they have their cast come on to the stage and parade meaningfully, performing bits of silent business as they swerve dramatically in their big boots. To the audience, the whole thing looks pointless, indeed shambolic, though at the same time it is obvious that some choreographic hand, some guiding principle, is behind it all. The World Cup meeting looked just like that. On to the stage strolled phalanxes of attendant lords and ladies, self-important in their badges of officialdom. Then, in their midst, appeared a troupe of taut young men wearing costumes that proclaimed their different factions; after a few moments they began to perform complicated rituals, readying themselves for acts of great dynamism. Suddenly, behind them, a small army of women began to hurl missiles across the stage. The scene had filled with a diversity of displays which pulled one eye in one direction and the other in at least another three. Television invests athletics with intense concentration but, in reality, this is diffused by confusion: little ladies in blazers scuttle past Linford Christie as he runs his lap of honour; discuses are thrown at Sally Gunnell's head; medal ceremonies take place as, behind them, a lone 10,000 metres runner completes her race five minutes after the thing has been won. Of course there are moments when significance is palpable within this scene, as for example at the appearance of King Lear - Christie, himself. But these are fleeting compared with the general impression of amiable chaos. What I remember most is watching preparation rather than action. Most athletes spend about 5 per cent of their time on stage doing what they are supposed to be doing; 95 per cent of it they spend in revving themselves up, hobbling up and down the track as if afflicted with gout, visualising, improvising and, above all, getting dressed and undressed. In fact, what the World Cup meeting really reminded me of was a rehearsal of an RSC dumb-show opening scene. But if the spectacle has the self-obsessed, faintly comical and occasionally thrilling aspect of highbrow theatre, its audience is a very different one from those who worship at the Barbican Centre. This crowd was, in fact, pure David Cassidy concert audience circa 1973. All sporting crowds disseminate different atmospheres, from the testosterone-suffused one at football matches, to the Airwick-fresh one of tennis tournaments; here, the dominant force is that of the teeny-bopper. Adults become afflicted with it too, scurrying around Crystal Palace for a glimpse of Du'ane Ladejo's back. Autograph books are carried like begging bowls. Girlish wails fill the sky as Linford Christie removes his sweatshirt though, since the screaming is just as loud for Gunnell, it is presumably familiarity rather than physicality that causes the excitement. It is a friendly atmosphere, pleasantly remote from the glamorised, moneyed and almost decadent image of athletics that tends to be presented by the media. There is something reassuring in the teeny-boppers' unquestioning love for their heroes. This is partly because they are expressing something that one might feel oneself, but would never dare to express so uninhibitedly; partly too because they are cutting through the crust of cynicism that has grown over the sport, and proving, with their trust, that much of athletics is still trustworthy. It may be that the atmosphere is rather different at, for example, those Grand Prix meetings in which athletes compete for the proceeds of the Brinks-Mat robbery. After all, the World Cup has at its heart a premise that derives from the amateur tradition: it is an event in which competitors represent nations or continents, rather than themselves, and at which winners walk away with honour rather than with an armful of gold bars. For this reason the World Cup is derided by some, who see it as almost hypocritically inappropriate to the world of modern athletics. Paradoxically, they also criticise any top athlete who fails to appear at it. Like the sport itself, such people seem uneasy with the current balance between professionalism and amateurism - what, they wonder, ought to be going on? Is it ridiculous, or is it charming, to expect supreme soloists to want to subsume their identities into that of a nation or continent? The fact is that it doesn't matter. The crowd at Crystal Palace proved that, as it took constant pleasure in the notion of belonging to and owning a team, but found real joy in the sight of individual greatness.</p>

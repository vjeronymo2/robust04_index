			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Grigoryevich Funtikov, Voyentekh </F> general director, by Valentin Rudenko; place and date of  interview not given: "Voyentekh Does Have Something To Offer"]    [Text] From KRASNAYA ZVEZDA files: Lieutenant General  (Reserve) Anatoliy Funtikov was born in 1931. He graduated from  the Serpukhov Aviation-Technical School and from the Air Force  Engineering Academy imeni Mozhayskiy. He served in combat units,  at the Baykonur Cosmodrome, and in the central administration of  the Ministry of Defense. He was employed in the testing of  strategic missiles, for which he earned the State Prize. He is a  doctor of technical sciences, a professor, and an academician of  the International Engineering Academy. Prior to his appointment  as general director of the Voyentekh State Armament and Military  Equipment Sales Company, he was first deputy chief for armament  of the Russian Armed Forces.    [Rudenko] Anatoliy Grigoryevich, when and why was the  Voyentekh State Company formed, and who was its founder?    [Funtikov] The idea of creating our company belongs to the  leaders of the Armed Forces ministries, and chiefly defense  minister, General of the Army Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev. In  order to get money to build housing for servicemen from  somewhere other than the budget, he proposed creating a special  cost accounting foreign trade organization that would export  combat equipment and armament at the disposal of the Ministry of  Defense. This proposal was carefully examined by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin, and in mid-1992 a special government  decree was published forming the Voyentekh State Armament and  Military Equipment Sales Company. The Ministry of Defense, the  Russian Federal Property Fund, the RF State Committee for the  Management of State Property, the Committee for Social Support  to Servicemen, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and  the RF State Committee for Defense Industry acted as the  company's founders.    [Rudenko] How justified was creation of yet another foreign  trade organization, since after all, the Oboroneksport VO, the  Spetsvneshtekhnika GVK or, for example, the GUSK would have been  fully capable of assuming the task of selling freed armament?  They did have the experience and the corresponding structures  for this, didn't they?    [Funtikov] Yes, they did. But they naturally didn't want to  get fully into the business of exporting used armament at a time  when the warehouses of the defense enterprises were literally  bursting with new products: It would have been a lot of trouble,  and the work would not have been very profitable. Each item had  to be fitted out, repaired, and painted.    Because it was established by the Ministry of Defense, and  works in the interests of the Army (97 percent of the proceeds  from weapon sales go specifically to construction of housing for  servicemen), and having support from powerful structures of the  Ministry of Defense such as the GRAU [Main Missile and Artillery  Directorate] and the Main Directorate of Armored Forces, from  engineering and chemical troops, and from the main procurement  directorates of the arms and services, the Voyentekh State  Company was vitally interested in organizing the work of  exporting freed armament.    [Rudenko] Do you share the point of view of those who feel  that the Ministry of Defense shouldn't involve itself in arms  exports at all?    [Funtikov] The Ministry of Defense is of course not a  military trade organization. It has other tasks, and another  purpose. But weapon exports are a special item. The reality is  such that approximately a fourth to a fifth of the assortment of  armament sought by foreign clients can be delivered efficiently  only from the forces. This is not to mention the fact that  comprehensive testing of combat equipment, specialist training  and repair of weapons and combat equipment proceed practically  100 percent at the proving grounds, training centers and repair  plants of the Ministry of Defense.    The Main Directorate of International Military Cooperation  of  the General Staff of the RF Armed Forces could organize arms  exports quite professionally, and well. And it must be said that  it is exerting a great deal of effort to develop  military-technical cooperation, to train foreign specialists and  to render other services.    Considering that a military department is not fully suited  to  purely commercial activity, our state company assumed this  function. It is a state enterprise, fully answerable to  currently effective legislation. Everyone here understands the  interests of both military arms manufacturers and citizens well.  We realize that the role our company plays will grow considering  the inadequate financing of the Ministry of Defense. After all,  selling freed combat equipment and weapons is a realistic way of  obtaining nonbudgetary resources not only to solve social  problems but also to reequip the Army.    [Rudenko] How much "surplus" weaponry does the Army have  today that could be offered for sale?    [Funtikov] Our state company does not keep records on the  amount of armament freed in the course of the Russian Army's  reduction--that's a function of the General Staff, but there is  no debate that there is a large amount of it. Forces are being  withdrawn from countries of Eastern Europe and the Baltics, and  units in internal districts are being disbanded. Moreover there  is much combat equipment in warehouses and storage depots. Given  the extreme deficit in the defense budget, the most reasonable  thing would be to sell it, and use the proceeds to solve social  problems, and develop and produce new models of armament.    [Rudenko] But wanting to sell these weapons isn't enough.  Someone has to want to by them. How do things stand in this  area? We are offering used goods, after all.    [Funtikov] Armament in the forces can be said to be used  only  on paper. It's actually new as a rule. When we train tank crews,  for example, we use a few training vehicles, leaving the rest of  the tanks in storage at depots and bases. Air defense weapons  don't get much use, while infantry weapons get even less. In  this case their price is naturally below that of new models,  which is attractive to foreign customers. Far from all countries  are able to allow themselves to purchase ultramodern weapons  directly from the conveyers of defense enterprises.    [Rudenko] By the way, how are prices of weapons supplied  from  the troops set?    [Funtikov] The main criteria here are the newness of the  model, the date of manufacture, remaining life, and actual  technical condition of the articles. Consider for example a  helicopter that has served half of its useful life. Its price  would be approximately 60 percent of the cost of a new  helicopter. Price policy is a delicate, flexible thing. There  are also many other factors that have to be accounted for when  appraising a particular item. But in any case, under no  circumstances are we offering armament at dumping prices.    [Rudenko] What models of armament enjoy the greatest demand  today?    [Funtikov] I would put infantry fighting vehicles at the top  of the list. And not only the latest BMP-3, but even the BMP-2.  Foreign customers are showing great interest in antitank  weapons, T-72S and T-80U tanks, our helicopters--especially the  Mi-8 and the Mi-24, all models and modifications of the  Kalashnikov assault rifle, the Igla, Strela-10M, Tor, Tunguska,  S-300PMU-1 and S-300V surface-to-air missile systems, and of  course, MiG-29 and Su-27 airplanes, as well as ammunition of all  types. As for naval equipment, small patrol boats are in demand.    When it comes to potential customers, they can be found  today  in countries of Southeast Asia, the Near East and Africa.    [Rudenko] It's no secret that there was too much red tape in  our arms trade system. It sometimes took months to finalize a  contract. Has anything changed recently in this aspect?    [Funtikov] Not much, unfortunately. As before, it takes a  lot  of legwork to get approval of documents for the sale of weapons  or combat equipment from the corresponding ministries and  departments. As an example it took me a little less than 4  months to finalize a contract to sell a consignment of pistols  to the Vietnamese Ministry of Internal Affairs. Such an approach  doesn't of course promote development of military-technical  cooperation. Many customers want the weapons delivered within a  week or a month, they are prepared to pay immediately, and we  need to consider their wishes.    [Rudenko] What should be done in your opinion to retake lost  positions in the arms market? And is such an objective even  realistic for us in principle?    [Funtikov] Of course it's realistic. The main argument in  favor of this assertion can be found in the fabulous  characteristics of our armament. The entire world recognizes  that it is fully competitive, while many models simply have no  analogues, being superior to foreign prototypes. The fact that  we sell 16 times less armament than the USA today is explained  in my opinion primarily by subjective and not objective causes.    If we intend to occupy a truly worthy place in the arms  market, we will need to direct the efforts of not only  specialized exporters and defense enterprises but also all state  structures toward this objective.    Once I went to Kuwait for negotiations. And do you know who  went there to officer a consignment of American weapons to the  Kuwaiti Defense Ministry? A former president of the United  States. It was Bush. That's the level we're dealing with.    It must be said that we have recently been taking steps to  maximally activate military and technical cooperation. Consider  at least the government decree granting enterprises the right to  enter the foreign market on their own. It will doubtlessly sweep  our exports into the mainstream.    The enterprises do have something to offer their foreign  partners. An inspection of specialized exporters carried out  recently by the Russian president's inspection administration  revealed that billions of dollars' worth of weapons and combat  equipment have accumulated in the warehouse of defense firms.    [Rudenko] Wouldn't a mass invasion of the world market by  enterprises mean the end of the state's monopoly on arms trade?    [Funtikov] Of course not. In this case, you see, a monopoly  is defined not as the existence of a single vendor but as strict  regulation of arms trade--on the basis of the corresponding  government decrees, through the licensing committee, and through  restrictions on what can be traded.    I do not support the idea that we should have a thousand  specialized exporters, but large firms such as, for example, the  Antey Concern, the Kurganmashzavod Joint-Stock Company, the OKB  Sukhovo ANPK, MAPO [Moscow Aviation Production Association] and  others should have access to the foreign market. We can only  gain from this.    By the way, while the right to export defense products is  possessed by dozens of organizations in the USA and other  Western countries, the state still maintains a monopoly on  weapon sales.    [Rudenko] What sort of relations are you developing with the  Rosvooruzheniye State Company, recently formed out of three  specialized exporters, and with the financial and industrial  groups being formed out of large defense firms?    [Funtikov] Are you asking whether we are entering the  foreign  market as competitors? I can say quite certainly, no. And there  are simply no reasons for such competition to exist between our  companies. We have different niches. In this case our niche is  far more modest than that of Rosvooruzheniye.    As far as the financial and industrial groups are concerned,  I am convinced that they will play a most active role in the  arms market in the immediate future. It is for this reason that  our company is providing what support it can to their formation.    I would like to say in conclusion that because of the sharp  reduction of appropriations to defense, and consequently to  armament, we should allocate part of the proceeds from exporting  defense products to establishing a firm scientific and technical  foundation upon which to design equipment of the future. These  may perhaps not be full-scale developments, but we believe that  the time will come when our state will have the possibility for  satisfying the Army's demand for the latest weapons to the  fullest.</p>

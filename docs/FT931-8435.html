			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / OECD criticises health reforms THE introduction of an internal market in the health service is unlikely to reduce waiting times for hospital operations significantly, says a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Paris-based OECD has examined reforms in the UK and three other European countries which use market-type mechanisms to control the cost of hospital treatment. The authors found that the reforms have contributed to greater efficiency and helped healthcare systems become more innovative. Health service managers also welcomed the greater freedom. However, the report concludes that there is only limited scope for reducing waiting times for operations in the UK unless the 'chronic scarcity of resources' is addressed. The OECD says the internal market will highlight the shortage of funds which creates long waiting lists for hospital admission. Market Emulation in Hospitals. OECD. Free.</p>

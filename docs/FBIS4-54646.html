			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Extreme Solutions Intended"] </F>   [Text] Prishtina, 29 Apr -- On 24 April, Serbian forces  executed near the village of Miratoc the young Naim Bajrami from  the village of Llashtice [Vlastica] in Gjilan [Gnjilane]  Commune. Witnesses who saw the corpse say that Naim Bajrami was  killed by a single shot in the back, that his jaw was broken,  and that he had facial injuries. The victim and his family had  been recently wanted by the Serbian police on the pretext of a  search for weapons.    A statement issued by the Party for Democratic Action in  Presovo states that a delegation of this party went to the site  of the murder and discovered that Naim Bajrami had been killed 2  km from the border with Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM], while, at about 1000 on the same day, a  Serbian soldier had fired on the minor C.M. from the village of  Miratoc. It is now known that the young man wanted to leave  Kosova because he and his family had been harassed for a long  time by the Serbian police on the pretext of collecting weapons.    It is striking that this murder is a sequel to the torture  and persecution being carried out against the Albanians in  Kosova, especially in recent weeks. However, this murder has  another significance. Of the five murders commited by Serbian  forces in the last two months, four of them, including the most  recent, have been in border areas. Two Albanian citizens were  killed in the border zone of Kosova and Albania. An inhabitant  of Han i Elezit [Djeneral Jankovic] was killed in the  Kosova-Macedonian border zone. The most recent case, the murder  of Naim Bajrami, took place in the Serbian-Macedonian border  zone. These murders are a clear sign of the increased military  presence of Serbian forces in Kosova's border areas with Albania  and Macedonia.    The murders and the increased fortifications of the Serbian  forces occurred at the time when NATO sent the Serbs an  ultimatum to lift the blockade of Sarajevo and when Greece began  to increase the frequency of incidents on the Greek-Albanian  border. The aggressiveness of Serbian forces also increased in  these areas at the time of the NATO ultimatum to lift the  blockade on Gorazde and other UN-protected areas in Bosnia.    The inhabitants of Zhur [Zur], Vermice [Vrmica], and Han i  Elezit have been continually mistreated by Serbian military  forces in recent weeks. Belgrade has so far not made the  slightest mention of the murder of Naim Bajrami, while directly  blaming Albania for the murder of two Albanian citizens a few  days ago at Morine near Gjakove [Djakovica], accusing Albania of  being a factor of "regional instability."    It is evident that the murders of the two last months have  been concentrated on border areas with the intention of sending  a clear warning to the Albanians that, while they live under  torture and continual punishment in Kosova, entrances and exits  to this area are under strict control. It is not difficult to  see that Belgrade now intends to confront the Albanians with  extreme solutions, and with the dilemma of acquiescence or  rebellion.</p>

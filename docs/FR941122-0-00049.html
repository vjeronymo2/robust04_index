On January 11, 1993, the Agency promulgated final rules under title IV. Several parties filed petitions for review of the rules. On August 10, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing certain substitution plan issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on a review of the record, the Agency concludes that the January 11, 1993 regulations concerning the eligibility of units to be designated as substitution units should be revised. Under sections 404(b) and (c) of the Act, a unit that is not listed in Table A of section 404 as being subject to Phase I of the Acid Rain Program (i.e., a non-Table A unit) and that is under the control of the owner or operator of a unit listed in Table A of section 404 (i.e., a Table A unit) may be designated as a substitution unit. The January 11, 1993 regulations state that the Table A unit and each non-Table A unit that the Table A unit designates as a substitution unit must have ``the same owner or operator.'' The Agency is revising the regulations in order to specify more clearly the circumstances under which the statutory ``control'' requirement for substitution plans is met. The rule revision is being issued as a direct final rule because it is consistent with the August 10, 1994 settlement and no adverse comment is expected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This direct final rule will be effective on January 3, 1995 unless significant, adverse comments are received by December 22, 1994.

Control Requirement for Designating Substitution Units <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 404(b) and (c) of the Act set forth the requirements for submission and approval of substitution plans, under which a unit listed on Table A of section 404 designates one or more non-Table A units as substitution units and brings them into Phase I of the Acid Rain Program. Congress established substitution plans as a compliance option to increase units' compliance flexibility and reduce their overall costs of compliance in Phase I while still achieving the emissions reductions intended by Congress under title IV. See 58 FR 60950&hyph;60951 (Nov. 18, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A substitution plan allows the owner or operator of a Table A unit to reassign the unit's emissions reduction obligations to a designated non-Table A unit ``under the control of'' that owner or operator. 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b). Upon approval of the reassignment, the non-Table A unit becomes subject to all requirements for Phase I units with regard to sulfur dioxide and is allocated allowances. Emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit may therefore free up allowances, which may be used by the Table A unit (or any other unit) in lieu of making emissions reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 71.41 of the January 11, 1993 regulations provided that the statutory requirement of control by the Table A unit's owner or operator over the non-Table A unit is satisfied where such units have ``the same owner or operator.'' 40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993). The regulation also provided that having the same designated representative would be treated as having the same operator and would thus meet the control requirement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; see also 58 FR 3600. On March 12, 1993, petitions for review of the January 11, 1993 regulations were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Several petitioners challenged the provisions implementing the control requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 18, 1993, the Agency issued proposed revisions to the January 11, 1993 regulations, including the provisions concerning the control requirement. The Agency proposed to reverse its interpretation that having a common designated representative alone meets the statutory control requirement for substitution plans and to revise the regulations accordingly. 58 FR 60957&hyph;60958. Several commenters addressed the control requirement in their comments on the November 18, 1993 proposal. Some commenters opposed any change in the January 11, 1993 provisions concerning the control requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters noted that, although &sect;72.41(b)(1)(i) requires that the substitution and Table A units have ``the same owner or operator'' (40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993)), section 404(b) of the Act requires that the substitution unit be under the control of the Table A unit owner or operator. They argued that, in implementing section 404(b) and (c), the Agency should also focus on whether there is such control. They suggested that common ownership of the units is not necessarily determinative of whether the control requirement is met. They alleged that where the units have multiple owners only one of which is in common, the control requirement may not be met, e.g., where the common owner owns only a very small percentage of the proposed substitution unit. On the other hand, where the units lack any common owner or operator, the control requirement allegedly may be met through contractual arrangements under which the owner and operator of the substitution unit commit,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , to make emissions reductions and deliver allowances to the owner and operator of the Phase I unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a separate final rule in this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Agency adopted the reasoning, set forth in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60957&hyph;60958) and in the preamble of the Acid Rain regulations on nitrogen oxides (59 FR 13554&hyph;13555 (Mar. 22, 1994)), that a designated representative is not, merely by holding that position, also an operator. In that separate final rule, the Agency revised the January 11, 1993 regulations to use the statutory language requiring control by the Table A unit owner or operator and to provide that having a common designated representative does not alone meet the control requirement for substitution units. However, the Agency did not address in that separate document comments raising issues concerning: under what circumstances the existence of one or more common owners satisfies the control requirement; and whether and, if so, under what circumstances control can be established by contract if there are no common owners or common operators. The Agency addresses below those issues and the comments on those issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Modifications of the January 11, 1993 Regulation Concerning the Control Requirement for Substitution Units <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Control by Common Owner or Operator <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 404(b) of the Act allows that the ``owner or operator'' of a Table A unit to designate, as a substitution unit, a non-Table A unit ``under the control of such owner or operator.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b). The Agency agrees with commenters that, like section 404(b), the regulation implementing that section should focus on whether such control exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because many units have multiple owners with varying percentages of ownership, there is a wide range of possible relationships between a Table A unit and a non-Table A unit, ranging, for example, from no common ownership to 100% common ownership and including all the possible variations in between. In order to avoid burdensome case-by-case determinations of whether each particular set of facts meets the control requirement and in order to provide more certainty for utilities and the public concerning what units qualify for inclusion in substitution plans, the Agency is establishing generic criteria for applying the control requirement. Further, the generic criteria are based on the potential ability of owners and operators to exercise control, not the actual exercise of such control potential. Determining what entities actually make decisions governing the operation of a unit could require the Agency to make lengthy case-by-case inquiries into the details of utility operations and involve the Agency in matters beyond its expertise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In taking this approach, the Agency maintains that section 404(b) should be interpreted to require that owners or operators of a Table A unit have the ability to exercise a significant degree of control over a non-Table A unit. The simplest case for applying this requirement is where the Table A and non-Table A units have only a single owner or where, regardless of their ownership, the units have a common operator. Under these circumstances, it seems clear that the single owner or the operator of the Table A unit has the ability to control the non-Table A unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For units with multiple owners, the application of the control requirement becomes somewhat more complex if they do not have a common operator. If one or more owners and operators of a Table A unit own an aggregate share of 50% or more of the capacity of a non-Table A unit, no major decisions concerning the unit can be made without the concurrence of such Table A unit owners and operators. The Agency maintains, therefore, that they can control the non-Table A unit to a significant extent and meet the control requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even where the aggregate ownership share of the one or more owners and operators of a Table A unit in a non-Table A unit is less than 50%, the degree of control may still be significant. Such control is evidenced by the ability of such non-Table A unit owners to determine the dispatch of their respective shares of electricity generated by the non-Table A unit. Decisions by such owners whether or not to take their shares of generation can significantly affect the overall operation of the unit. While the Agency recognizes that adopting a minimum level of ownership in the non-Table A unit for meeting the control requirement is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, the Agency maintains that, as a matter of logic, there is some level of ownership below which the owners lack significant control. Further, establishing such a minimum level of ownership discourages gaming through the acquisition of minute ownership shares simply to enable the new owner to qualify the non-Table A unit as a substitution unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that an aggregate ownership interest of 10% or more, and less than 50%, of the capacity of the non-Table A unit meets the control requirement, provided that such owners have the ability to determine how their respective shares of the non-Table A unit's generation are dispatched. The Agency notes that, in some regions of the country, utilities have entered into power pool agreements under which the utilities agree to centralize in the power pool the dispatch of their units. Power pools with central economic dispatch enable member utilities to minimize operating costs through the use of the units in the pool that have the lowest generation costs. In light of the important benefits of such power pools, the Agency maintains that utilities in power pools should not be disadvantaged under section 404(b). Consequently, the determination of whether owners of a non-Table A unit have, by right of contract, the ability to dispatch their respective shares of the unit's generation should be made without regard to whether owners that had contractual dispatch authority have surrendered that authority to a power pool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In sum, the Agency is establishing generic criteria for determining whether the control requirement under section 404(b) is met. The first category that meets this requirement is where one or more owners or operators of a Table A unit have an aggregate ownership interest of 50% or more in the non-Table A unit or where the two units have a common operator. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The second category that meets the control requirement is where: a Table A and non-Table A unit lack a common operator; one or more owners or operators of a Table A unit have an aggregate ownership interest of 10% or more and less than 50% in the non-Table A unit; and such owners or operators have the contractual ability to determine the dispatch of their respective shares of the non-Table A unit's generation. The final regulation requires the designated representatives submitting substitution plans to state in the submission what category is applicable to the units in the plan and to provide, upon request, documentation supporting such statements. These statements, like all information included in submissions by the designated representative, are covered by the certification required under &sect;72.21(b) concerning the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In summing the ownership shares of individual Table A unit owners and operators in the capacity of a non-Table unit, a given share, and the generation associated with such share, obviously cannot be double-counted. Otherwise, the sum of the ownership shares of all persons owning a non-Table A unit could exceed 100%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Control by Contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency agrees that, under certain circumstances, control over a substitution unit by the owners and operators of the Table A unit may be established by contract where the above-described criteria based on a common operator or the level of common ownership are not met. The contract must be a binding agreement between the owners and operators of a Table A unit and the owners and operators of the non-Table A unit that is designated as the Table A unit's substitution unit. Several commenters supported an interpretation of section 404(b) that would allow the control requirement to be met through a contract. The final regulation specifies the circumstances under which the Administator will find that control is established by contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several determinations have guided the Agency's development of the regulation concerning control by contract. First, the Agency believes that the regulation should set forth detailed, generic requirements for establishing control by contract. Leaving the specification of detailed requirements to case-by-case development would increase the burden both on the owners and operators interested in submitting contract-based substitution plans and on the Agency, which must review such submissions. A commenter supporting the approval of contract-based substitution plans suggested that the Agency develop generic criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the Agency believes that the control requirement of section 404(b) of the Act should be interpreted in light of the emissions reduction goals of title IV. The Agency maintains that a determination of whether control is established by contract should focus on whether the owners and operators of the Table A unit have the ability, under the contract, to require emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit and thereby to affect the overall operation of the unit. It is not necessary in this context for the Table A unit's owners and operators to have contractual authority over all facets of the non-Table A unit's day-to-day operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, if the control requirement is to be met by simply showing that Table A unit owners and operators have the ability, by contract, to require emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit, the Agency maintains that the contract must require emissions reductions that are significant, new reductions that would not otherwise have been implemented by the non-Table A unit. It is difficult to see how control could be demonstrated if a contract with a Table A unit merely required a non-Table A unit to ``make'' reductions that the non-Table A unit had already implemented, was already in the process of implementing, or would have implemented even in the absence of the contract. Further, because a unit might be able to realize relatively minor reductions while making little change in its operations, the scale of the reductions required by contract should be significant in order to demonstrate control of the non-Table A unit by owners and operators that otherwise lack any operational responsibilities for that unit.

The other emissions rates (i.e., those for 1985, 1989, 1990, and Phase I) are used to ensure that the current actual or allowable rate does not represent a spike in the emissions rate achieved by or required for the unit since 1985. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter supported using all of these emissions rates to set a maximum emissions rate for the non-Table A unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Some units are subject to a non-unit-specific emissions limit (e.g., a utility-wide emissions tonnage or rate limit).

A commenter supporting approval of contract-based substitution plans asserted that it has identified about 30 Phase II units that lack a common owner or operator with a Table A unit and for which such plans would be economically feasible. The commenter stated that this group of units could reduce their current emissions rates by 50 to 70% and indicated that a 30% reduction might be an acceptable requirement for approval of this type of substitution plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a further means of ensuring that the non-Table A unit's reductions are new, the final regulation requires that the contract-based substitution plan include a description of the actions that will be undertaken so that the non-Table A unit will comply with the maximum emissions rate. Such actions may include, for example, the addition or modification of a scrubber or fuel switching. The owners and operators of the Table A and non-Table A units must show that the described actions will not be implemented in Phase I unless the non-Table A unit is approved as a substitution unit. The description of the actions that will be taken must be sufficiently detailed so that the Agency can determine whether the showing has been made. Information relevant to the showing includes,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , whether contracts implementing these actions were entered into before submission of the substitution plan. Under the regulation, the owners and operators must implement the described actions but may seek to amend the substitution plan to change the required actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the Agency maintains that it is difficult to make determinations, particularly in a large number of cases, of whether owners and operators will take certain future actions in the absence of a substitution plan. However, the Agency must make a determination of this type in reviewing the actions described in each contract-based substitution plan in order to make sure that the non-Table A unit is really obligated to make new reductions. This will be a one-time determination made when the plan is approved (or disapproved) unless the designated representative subsequently seeks to modify the description of actions in the plan. Further, the Agency does not expect a large number of contract-based substitution plans to be submitted. As noted above, commenters have identified only about 30 units for which such a plan would be economic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, it is important to ensure that the contract imposes an effective emissions reduction requirement_i.e., a requirement that is likely to be enforced by Table A unit owners and operators claiming control of the non-Table A unit. Consequently, the contract should include a meaningful remedy in the event that the required emissions reductions are not achieved. The concept of requiring a meaningful remedy in the event of default was supported by a commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Table A unit owners and operators must surrender allowances to the Administrator to the extent that the non-Table A unit fails to make the required emissions reductions, then the Table A owners and operators will bear responsibility for the reductions that they claim to control and will have the incentive to take actions to ensure achievement of the reductions. This puts the Table A owners and operators in a position similar to that of owners and operators that control a unit directly by owning or operating the unit. If, instead of such allowance surrender by the Table A unit, the non-Table A unit had to give allowances to the Table A unit (or to the Agency), then the Table A unit owners and operators would bear no responsibility for the non-Table A unit that they claim to control. Further, without elaborate limitations on the transfer of allowances between the Table A and non-Table A units, there would be no way of preventing the units from arranging a future return to the non-Table A unit of any allowances surrendered by the non-Table A unit to the Table A unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the final regulation, if the non-Table A unit fails to comply with the maximum emissions rate during the year, the Table A unit owners and operators must surrender a number of allowances equal to the non-Table A unit's baseline multiplied by the difference between the actual emissions rate for the year and the maximum emissions rate. This approach segregates out the effect of utilization changes and leaves such changes to be handled under the reduced utilization and allowance surrender provisions (e.g., &sect;&sect;72.43, 72.91, and 72.92) applicable to all Phase I units. The surrendered allowances must have the same or an earlier compliance use date as the allowances allocated to the non-Table A unit for the year, and the surrender must be made on or before the allowance transfer deadline. In order to encourage early reductions at non-Table A units and innovative approaches to achieving such reductions, the surrender and deduction of allowances will be the only remedy under the Act for failure to meet the maximum emissions rate. Of course, the deduction of allowances for failure to achieve the maximum emissions rate may result in a unit having insufficient allowances to cover its annual emissions, and the full panoply of remedies for excess emissions will then apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in order to facilitate the Table A unit owners' and operators' exercise of control and the Agency's review and enforcement, where necessary, of the substitution plan, the units involved should have a common designated representative. A commenter supported the need for a common designated representative for this type of substitution plan. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The final regulation provides that the requirement to have a common designated representative is not met by simply having a common alternate designated representative. This is because, as explained in the preamble of the November 18, 1993 proposed rule, an alternate designated representative does not carry the same level of responsibilities as, and thus is not equivalent to, a designated representative. 58 FR 60958.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The commenter also suggested that the non-Table A owners and operators be required to submit quarterly and annual reports to the Table A unit owners and operators and to indemnify such owners and operators for any violations at the non-Table A unit. These requirements are not in the final rule because the Agency believes that these matters are not central to the issue of control and are better left to the owners and operators of the two units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

The final regulation adopted here takes a similar approach. If there are changes that result in the control requirement no longer being met, the designated representative must terminate the plan, whether the plan is based on common owners or operators or on a contract. The Administrator may, on his or her own motion, terminate the plan under such circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only exception to this requirement is for substitution plans approved, and included in final permits issued, under the January 11, 1993 regulations and the Partial Settlement in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Environmental Defense Fund <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carol M.

So long as the Table A and non-Table A units under each plan continue to meet the common owner, operator, or designated representative requirement in the January 11, 1993 regulations, such plans will not be terminated for the first year (and, in some cases, for the second year) for which the substitution unit received a total number of allowances equal to the number provided in those regulations. This exception is consistent with both the May 4, 1993 settlement and the Second Partial Settlement in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Environmental Defense Fund <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carol M.

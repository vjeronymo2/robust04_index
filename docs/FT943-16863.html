			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Former Elders executive jailed Mr Kenneth Jarrett, the former Elders IXL executive who has agreed to give evidence against Mr John Elliott concerning the Melbourne-based businessman's role in ADollars 66.5m (Dollars 48.5m) worth of allegedly fictitious foreign exchange transactions, was sentenced to 18 months in jail yesterday. However, Mr Justice Coldrey suspended 12 months of the sentence, saying it could not have been easy for Mr Jarrett to 'break ranks' and co-operate with the authorities. Mr Jarrett had pleaded guilty to one charge of failing to act honestly between 1986 and 1990 as an officer of Elders IXL, the large Australian brewing and agribusiness group formerly headed by Mr Elliott. Theft charges were brought against Mr Elliott, a past president of the Australian Liberal party and one of Australia's most prominent entrepreneurs in the 1980s, and a number of other Elders executives including Mr Jarrett, shortly before Christmas. Essentially, the prosecution is arguing that the forex transactions were used to funnel money to companies connected to Mr Allan Hawkins, a New Zealand-based businessman who is in jail. Mr Jarrett's account supports these allegations. However, Mr Elliott has consistently denied any wrongdoing. The matter is due to come to trial next month.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH CAPITAL GAINS TAX PLAN PERILED BY POLITICAL REALITY  </P> <P> To President Bush, his proposal to cut the maximum tax on capital gains from  33% to 15% would provide nothing more than a much-needed shot in the arm for  the economy.  </P> <P> "History is clear," Bush contended in his speech before Congress earlier this  month. Reducing the tax on profits from longer-term investments, he said, "will  increase revenues, help savings and create new jobs."  </P> <P> Whatever the proposal's economic merits might be, however, the political  reality is quite different. For lawmakers, the essential calculation about  Bush's plan is that at least half of all the benefits would go to fewer than 1%  of all taxpayers -- those with incomes above $200,000.  </P> <P> As far as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) is  concerned, that alone should be enough to consign the proposal to the ash heap.  "I'm not about to tell the wage earners in Chicago that they should pay a  higher tax than stockbrokers," says Rostenkowski, the top tax writer on Capitol  Hill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Equation Complex  </P> <P> But for all Rostenkowski's clout in Congress, his opposition does not entirely  close the door to a lower capital gains tax rate. As always in Washington, the  hidden political equation is rarely as simple as it seems.  </P> <P> Most Republicans support a change. Moreover, such Democrats as Rep. Beryl  Anthony Jr. of Arkansas, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign  Committee and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, point out that many  heavy Democratic campaign contributors also stand to gain from a lower capital  gains tax rate.  </P> <P> "Why should we do anything to (anger) the rich?" Anthony has asked colleagues.  </P> <P> At the same time, many of the special-interest groups that favor a lower  capital gains tax rate, having failed to protect it from the major tax overhaul  of 1986, are working overtime to recover. Foremost among the lobbyists is  former Treasury Department official Charls E. Walker, who represents some of  the nation's largest industrial corporations and heads the American Council for  Capital Formation.  </P> <P> "Any time you've got a President talking about this and Charlie Walker pushing  it," says Joseph Minarik, staff director of the Joint Economic Committee, "I  don't think you can count on its disappearing."  </P> <P> Mark Bloomfield, executive director of Walker's council, considers Bush's  decision to introduce the plan in Congress now, over the advice of political  aides to wait at least a year, "an indication of how strongly Bush feels about  this. I'm very encouraged that some sort of compromise will ultimately emerge."  </P> <P> Many economists believe that the current taxation of capital gains is deeply  flawed. The large majority would adjust investment profits for inflation so  that taxpayers are not forced to pay taxes on artificial profits that simply  reflect general price increases. They also oppose the feature of the existing  system that allows taxpayers to escape capital gains taxes at death and permits  heirs to avoid any taxes on profits earned before their ownership.  </P> <P> But politicians have never shown much interest in the economists' favorite  reforms. They are worried about the complexity of inflation adjustments and a  backlash from individual entrepreneurs and farmers if accumulated profits from  their family businesses are taxed at death.  </P> <P> The battle on Capitol Hill over capital gains promises to be a particularly  long and nasty one.  </P> <P> Any move to restore a lower tax rate for capital gains would drive a stake  through the heart of the delicate 1986 compromise, in which lawmakers agreed to  cut income tax rates across the board in return for eliminating many of the  business and individual loopholes that previously undermined the fairness of  the tax code and distorted investment decisions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Compare Savings  </P> <P> Nearly all taxpayers with incomes over $200,000 would receive a tax cut from a  lower capital gains rate. The average savings would be roughly $25,000 each  from Bush's proposal, according to an estimate by Citizens for Tax Justice, a  public lobbying group. That compares with minor or nonexistent savings for the  vast majority of taxpayers with incomes under $50,000.  </P> <P> Even Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), who has  supported a capital gains preference in the past, says that any effort to  restore it would require balancing the cut with higher top-bracket rates on  other income.  </P> <P> But given Bush's objections to any changes that would raise taxes, many  lawmakers are reluctant to start down that path at all.  </P> <P> "Right now, tampering with capital gains is playing with dynamite," says Rep.  Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), a senior member of the Ways and Means  Committee. "Anything we might do would open up the whole Pandora's Box just  when we thought it was closed for a while. I'm hoping we don't have any tax  bill this year so we don't have to worry about all the lobbyists descending on  us."  </P> <P> Bush's proposal was cleverly designed to overcome several of the frequent  objections to capital gains tax cuts.  </P> <P> Since the 1986 overhaul of the tax code, capital gains have been taxed at the  same rate as ordinary income. Bush proposed to change that as of July 1.  </P> <P> For persons in the top 28% and 33% tax brackets, their capital gains would be  subject to an effective tax rate of 15%. Most of those whose ordinary income is  taxed at 15% would face an effective capital gains tax rate of 8.25%. And for  those with adjusted gross incomes less than $20,000 -- including their taxable  capital gains -- capital gains would be tax free.  </P> <P> The Administration had earlier floated the possibility of a flat 15% capital  gains tax, but critics said that would provide no relief to low-income  taxpayers.  </P> <P> As of July 1, the Bush proposal would define capital gains as profits from  investments held for at least a year. But the required holding period would  gradually rise to three years, to blunt criticism that the lower capital gains  tax rate encourages the frequent churning of investments.  </P> <P> The Administration also narrowed the scope of capital gains that would be  eligible for favorable treatment.  </P> <P> Previous law allowed taxpayers to invest in tax shelters that both provided  lower-taxed capital gains and allowed large tax write-offs through depreciation  of assets. The Bush plan would exclude corporations from the tax break for  capital gains and profits from collectibles and depreciable assets such as  investment real estate would not qualify as capital gains.  </P> <P> That would serve to restrict the lower capital gains rate generally to stocks  and bonds, although the sale of personal homes, when taxable, would also  receive favorable tax treatment.  </P> <P> The Administration went on the offensive against critics who charge that a  capital gains tax break would drain money from the Treasury.  </P> <P> The Treasury Department assumes that Bush's proposal would encourage investors  to sell more of their stocks and bonds than they otherwise would. That would  more than compensate for the effect of the lower capital gains tax rate,  Treasury says, and the Bush plan would actually generate an additional $4.8  billion in revenues next year and $4.9 billion the following year.  </P> <P> That estimate is highly controversial and is likely to be challenged by  Congress' own tax experts. Nonetheless, economists generally concede that a  capital gains tax cut would initially boost government revenues from  profit-taking.  </P> <P> Over the longer run, however, there is little evidence that a cut in taxes on  capital gains in itself generates higher revenues. Even the Treasury estimates  show a substantial revenue loss several years down the road, forecasting  revenue losses of $6.8 billion in 1994, when the capital gains holding period  would go up to two years, and $11.3 billion in 1996, when the holding period  would jump to three years.  </P> <P> Over a 10-year period, according to the Treasury estimate, there would be no  significant gain or loss in revenues.  </P> <P> Ironically, for all its efforts to overcome such well-known objections to  providing a capital gains tax break, the Bush Administration has split apart  the political alliance that rallied behind earlier efforts.  </P> <P> "We're having a hard time generating much interest in the plan on Wall Street,"  concedes Bloomfield, the capital gains lobbyist.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Cut Profits  </P> <P> The reason is that investment firms reap most of their income from rapid  turnover of stocks and bonds. Although they receive most of their business from  pension funds and other institutional investors that generally are not subject  to taxes, any Administration proposal that encourages individuals to hold their  investments for at least three years might cut into Wall Street's profits.  </P> <P> At the same time, by excluding investments in depreciable property, the White  House plan has also excluded, at least for now, politically powerful real  estate developers from the coalition of supporters of a capital gains tax cut.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of Democrats who have sold their soul to nouveau-riche real  estate developers," contends Michael Barker, the former chief economist of the  Democratic Leadership Council, a group of moderate and conservative Democrats.  "This plan doesn't provide their paymasters with much incentive to wheel and  deal in tax shelters again."  </P> <P> Despite all its problems, though, a capital gains tax cut remains high on  Bush's agenda. And the lobbying support from such important groups as venture  capitalists will provide additional momentum on the grounds that reducing  capital gains taxes will spur more investment in riskier businesses that need  help in competing against foreign firms.  </P> <P> "Because we've got a lot of people in Congress who are worried about the  competitiveness of the U.S., I'm still expecting some sort of restructuring of  capital gains tax rates in time," says New York economic consultant A. Gary  Shilling, a frequent Bush adviser in the past. "But I wouldn't hold my breath  waiting for it to happen."  </P></p>

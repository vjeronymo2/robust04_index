			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 26 (AFP)--China's prospects for  rejoining General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would suffer a  setback if the United States revokes its most-favored-nation  (MFN) trading status, GATT director general Peter Sutherland  said Thursday.    Sutherland, in Hong Kong two weeks after a visit to Beijing,  said Washington's decision on MFN -- due by June 3 -- would  "obviously have a relevance" to ongoing negotiations on China's  GATT membership. "If China was to lose MFN status, it would  have no direct bearing on the GATT negotiations," he told  reporters. "But it would have an indirect bearing... because  the MFN issue is one that is fundamental to GATT membership."    MFN enables foreign goods to enter a GATT member nation or  territory at preferential rates.    The United States extends the status to nearly all its  trading partners but President Bill Clinton has made renewal for  China this year conditional on "overall significant progress" in  human rights.    Sutherland earlier told business leaders there was a very  slim chance that China would be able to join GATT this year in  time to be a founding member of the new World Trade Organization  on January 1. "I'm not saying its impossible... but it is a  very demanding schedule," he said.    China was a founding member of GATT but withdrew from the  arrangement in 1949 when the communists came to power.</p>

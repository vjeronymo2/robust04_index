Prior to that, the U.S. ambassador to the UN [Albright]  and the U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  [Shalikashvili] had talks with Defense Minister Lajos Fur and  Head of State Arpad Goncz. Jozsef Barat reports on the latter  meeting.    [Barat] The Partnership for Peace program is a serious step  towards political integration rather than being just an ersatz  [potcselekves], Arpad Gocz said during talks with Ambassador  Albright and General John Shalikashvili. The terms of the  complex political and military cooperation program are mutually  acceptable, the president of the Republic stressed, and he  called it important that the U.S. initiative treated the region  as a whole. According to Arpad Goncz, it is also shown by the  fact that Prague was chosen for the venue of next week's  meeting. The president agreed that the Partnership for Peace  program was of extensive and not exclusive character, that is it  will do no damage, it will not harm sensitive areas in fostering  ties with the East.    President Clinton's special envoys assured Arpad Goncz that  the security of the United States and that of Central Europe  were interrelated. For Washington, the security of all  countries in the region is equally important.</p>

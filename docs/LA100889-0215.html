			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> The Garden Grove City Council will hold a special public meeting Tuesday on the  banning of so-called safe-and-sane fireworks within city limits. The council  will consider recommendations from the fire department and other organizations  that the possession and sale of such fireworks be illegal.  </P> <P> Garden Grove is one of the six Orange County cities that still allow the sale  of such fireworks. The other cities are Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Fullerton,  Orange and Santa Ana. The Westminster City Council approved a ban in September,  but the Fullerton City Council last week rejected banning the fireworks on a  3-2 vote.  </P></p>

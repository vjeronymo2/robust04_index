			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Firestone in Argentine tax row THE ARGENTINE subsidiary of Firestone, the Japanese-owned tyre company, has threatened to close down if the government forces a demand for an estimated USDollars 60m-Dollars 100m in back taxes. Several other subsidiaries of multinational companies also face heavy taxdemands. Among them is British American Tobacco and Perkins. However, Firestone, headed by Mr Manuel Balbis, who is also president of Argentina's American Chamber of Commerce, has taken the most aggressive stance towards the DGI, Argentina's tax department. He said: 'Our net worth is about Dollars 22m. There is no way we can pay the kind of money they are asking for.' The dispute began in 1985, when companies bought and sold government tax rebates on an apparently legal secondary market. The companies now being pressed for payment paid their taxes with rebates bought from Koner-Salgado, an Argentine conglomerate. A DGI investigation in 1985 found evidence of fraud in Koner-Salgado's tax rebates. It subsequently rejected payments made with its certificates. However, Mr Balbis claims the DGI's findings were not made public until 1988, when Firestone ceased buying from Koner-Salgado. The case has come to a head after a final deadline for payment expired last week. The Supreme Court ruled that companies must pay first before negotiating with the DGI. Growinginterest in Argentina by foreign investors could be undermined unless a satisfactory compromise can be found. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said: 'We are prepared to discuss (anything) within the law and we are doing that.' He added, however, that 'it is not within the powers of the DGI not to collect (taxes) that the law requires it to collect.' However, a diplomat monitoring the case said the government would try to put off the problem until its finances were in better shape.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Election 92: Labour keeps its distance but is tied to dependence - David Goodhart on the difficult relationship between the party's new public image and financial needs for an election EVEN as he announced the election date from the steps of 10 Downing Street, Mr John Major had warned electors that a vote for Labour was a vote for a party in hock to the trade unions. With Labour stressing a greater distance from its union founders and union power at an all-time low, it is not a theme which seems to have benefited the government much in the phoney war. But the conduct of the election campaign itself serves to underline Labour's continuing financial and logistical dependence on the trade union movement. In spite of the desperate financial condition of many Labour-affiliated unions they will provide about Pounds 6.3m of Labour's Pounds 7m election fund. Just as important, especially in a close battle, is the non-cash aid - people, offices and cars. The union leaders will be almost invisible in Labour's campaign. They have rarely played a leading role on the hustings, even less so since the late 1970s when their popularity plummeted. Many leaders say they will be behind their desks working quite normally during the campaign, though they will be doing their best to get the voters out in their own union. Others, such as Mr John Edmonds of the GMB general union and Mr Bill Morris of the TGWU general union, have an official role on Mr Neil Kinnock's 'leader's committee'. It is those two unions that have traditionally provided the lion's share of election assistance. They represent nearly 2m of the 5m union members affiliated to the party, a total that has fallen by 25 per cent in the past five years because of shrinking membership. They give nearly half of the Pounds 6.3m election pot from the unions. Fortunately for Labour the TGWU's political fund has been undamaged by last year's Pounds 12m deficit on its general fund. Both have also placed dozens of full-time officials at the Labour party's disposal for the campaign - indeed the GMB has had 10 officials working for Labour for nearly a year. In areas where Labour's regional organisation is weak this has been a vital asset. Unions such as the AEU engineers, the MSF general technical union, Nupe the public services union, RMT the transport union and UCW the postal union, will provide similar logistical support in the regions and pack Walworth Road, Labour's London HQ, with press officers and other staff. One insider at Walworth Road said: 'Labour won the campaign in the media in 1987, reflecting a new professionalism at the centre, but our organisation around much of the country left a lot to be desired. This time our organisation and our finances are in a much better state.' In 1987 Labour spent about Pounds 4m from the centre - of which only Pounds 200,000 came from non-union sources - compared with more than Pounds 10m spent by the Conservatives. This time Labour will spend at least Pounds 7m (the Conservatives will again more than double that) thanks largely to a more efficient and fairer system of raising election cash from the unions plus more effe-ctive fund-raising from non-union sources, mainly through direct mail appeals. Since 1989 the unions have been paying an average of one third of their annual affiliation fee (Pounds 1.50 per affiliated member) into the special election fund. That is worth Pounds 6.3m in spite of the fact that about Pounds 1m has been spent in the past year. Before 1989 the unions paid their annual affiliation fee in one lump and come election time the party handed the begging bowl round, with mixed results. The new system has allowed Labour to earn some interest and to plan ahead. It has also distributed the election burden between unions more fairly. With a larger proportion of union cash going to the special election fund, Walworth Road has had to cover about 50 per cent of the party's annual Pounds 9m annual running costs from non-union sources. According to Mr Tony Manwaring, head of the general secretary's office at Walworth Road, this has been achieved mainly through raising Labour's standing-order base to Pounds 2m a year. The non-union element of the election fund has also increased from a mere 5 per cent in 1987 to 10 per cent this time after appeals and high-profile events. In 1987 Mr Kinnock was ferried around the country in cars belonging to the GMB general union. This time every key marginal has had a temporary organiser and a computerised electoral roll, with many of the people and machines provided by the unions. That non-cash support, especially fax machines, telephones and offices, is hard to quantify but might well substantially swell the Pounds 7m figure that Labour is expected to spend in the next four weeks. Unions, however, have to remain careful that their political support for Labour comes out of the union's political fund. In spite of the new efficiency of Labour's election funding, the unions, and therefore the party, could ill afford two elections in one year. Yet many union leaders privately believe that a hung parliament and a quick second election is probable. In that event Labour's better-off individual supporters would be called on to provide more cash than ever before.</p>

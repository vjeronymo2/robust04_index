			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Protests grow in Tajikistan Supporters and opponents of Tajikistan's conservative leadership yesterday poured into Dushanbe, the capital of the former Soviet republic, to swell mass protests which have convulsed the city for three days, Reuter reports from Moscow. Leaders of the Tajik parliament held an emergency meeting to try to find ways of curbing the unrest and preventing an outbreak of violence. The Tajik mission in Moscow said that up to 100,000 people were taking part in three separate rallies: supporters and opponents of President Rakhmon Nabiyev and a third group demanding tough measures to end all the protests. It said government supporters, carrying Soviet flags and accusing Russia's President Boris Yeltsin of destroying the former Soviet Union, constituted the largest group. Government opponents, many wearing headbands inscribed with the slogan 'freedom or death,' encircled key state buildings, including Mr Nabiyev's residence. The republic is one of the most conservative in the now-defunct Soviet Union.</p>

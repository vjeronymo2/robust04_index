			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Big-screen display shames drivers speeding on motorway Shame is the latest weapon to be used by the Department of Transport in its effort to curb motorway speeding. Drivers on the M1 in the Midlands were confronted yesterday by a giant screen which flashed the word 'speeding' with their own registration number and their speed. The effect was immediate. Speeding motorists do not merely face embarrassment. Details go to the police computer which disgorges a summons. The system is being demonstrated for six months at roadworks near Junction 21A of the M1 in Leicestershire. Mr Robert Key, roads and traffic minister, who switched on the system known as Speed Violation Detection Deterrent (SVDD), said: 'I believe that speeding should become as socially unacceptable as drink-driving. It can be just as dangerous to other road users.' The county police have substantial experience of dealing with speeding motorists at these roadworks. Leicestershire's chief constable is himself nursing a conviction - Mr Keith Povey was banned for seven days and fined Pounds 350 after driving at 80mph in the 50mph zone. During one fortnight last February 717 motorists were prosecuted for breaching the 50mph limit. Acting Supt Graham Compton, head of Leicestershire Police traffic department, said: 'It is indisputable that speed kills and anything which can bring that message home to motorists and make the county's roads safer has to be welcomed. We will be looking at the outcome of this project with a great deal of interest.' The system was designed by Travers Morgan, transport consultants, and made by the NEI subsidiary of Rolls-Royce. It may affect the weekend motorist straining for freedom rather than the caricatured salesman in a Cavalier or chief executive in a Jaguar. Travers Morgan research has shown that there is more speeding at weekends than during the week.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / No French growth The first quarter of this year will show zero growth in the French economy, the Insee government statistics office predicted yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris. Insee also forecast 'no significant growth' in the first six months of this year. Companies' expectations remain very unfavourable, it said, because they see no early improvement in demand on their main European markets. Output fell 0.5 per cent in the last quarter of 1992.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Arts: Today's Television Duke Ellington, a giant of jazz, is the giant of the evening's viewing. An Emmy Award winning American documentary by Robert S. Levi starts tonight in the Omnibus slot (BBC 1, 10.55) and ends next week. More than 40 of Ellington's 1,500 compositions are on the soundtrack and the programme includes rare footage of the pianist and band leader in action. Although Ellington died 20 years ago, the film is too discreet. It is a pity that the problems faced by a black band leader on the road in the States in the 1930s and 1940s are not investigated. Sir Donald Wolfit was the last of the great actor managers. His acting style owed more to the 19th century greats than the method school and today he is usually dismissed as the meatiest of ham. In Without Walls (Channel 4, 9pm), Ned Sherrin attempts to rescue Sir Donald's reputation, and praises his touring of the provinces with his company, bringing the classics to the people. In the second half of this always intriguing programme, Lesbians Unclothed, Camille Paglia criticises lesbians who take themselves too seriously.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Siyang (0491 1835 2254)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Deng Pufang, president  of the Chinese Federation for the Disabled, disclosed today that  his father, Deng Xiaoping, likes soccer games very much and  regularly watches soccer matches on television. He said his  father would be very much interested in the World Cup Soccer  Tournament this summer.    Speaking at a news conference for Chinese and foreign  reporters held at the State Council Information Office today,  Deng Pufang and Zhang Baifa [vice mayor of Beijing], who are in  charge of the Preparatory Committee for the Sixth Far East and  South Pacific Disabled Games, answered reporters' questions in  connection with the games' preparations and other matters.    An ABC reporter asked: How is Deng Xiaoping's physical  condition? Deng Pufang said: He is in very good health [ta  shen ti hen hao 0100 6500 7555 1771 1170]. He is leading a  normal retirement life at home. The weather is now getting  warmer and outdoor strolling is good for his health.    Answering an ANSA reporter's question about humanitarianism  and human rights, Deng Pufang said: Humanitarianism is closely  related to human rights, involving human values and issues in  many other fields.    Deng Pufang: The things we do concern disabled people. We  often underscore humanitarianism and human rights. Over the  years, we have often advocated the need to protect disabled  persons' rights and interests. He added: Since reform and  opening up, disabled persons' livelihoods as a whole have  improved a lot, but there are still some disabled people who  have food and clothing problems. The work on disabled people  should focus on those disabled people who have the biggest  problems, such as whether they have jobs, have the opportunity  to receive an education, or have enough to eat and to wear. It  is unrealistic if we ignore these basic issues and talk about  humanitarianism and human rights in abstract terms.    Deng Pufang indicated that a sincere humanitarian must be  genuinely sincere to do humanitarian work. He said: We in  China are doing our work little by little, and little successes,  accumulating over time, will result in great achievements and  inspire great hope.</p>

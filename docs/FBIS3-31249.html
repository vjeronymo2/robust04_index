			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 31 January issue of the Belgrade  daily POLITIKA on page 7 discusses a "real political scandal"  going on in Croatia regarding the issue of whether Croatia is  directly involved in the war in Bosnia. The "affair" resulted  from the appearance on Croatian Television's "TV Parliament"  program "several evenings ago" of Vice Vukojevic, a deputy in  the Croatian parliament and, until recently, chief of the  security service in the Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  who was wearing the uniform of the Croatian Defense Council  [HVO], the army of Herceg-Bosna. Moreover, POLITIKA reports,  Vukojevic, responding to a question from the program's host,  "coolly answered" that he had been "a member of the HVO since 11  April 1992" with the rank of brigade commander, a rank above  that of colonel. What is interesting about this affair, POLITIKA  observes, is that Vukojevic's appearance in "a foreign uniform"  provoked "quite a bit of surprise" among the Croatian public and  even astonishment that Vukojevic was a member of the army of  another country while holding a high position in the security  service of Croatia.    Of course, there are very few people naive enough to believe  sincerely the official claims of Croatian leaders that the  Republic of Croatia is not directly involved in the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, POLITIKA states, adding that even Stipe  Mesic, the president of the Croatian Assembly, could not deny  this "very unpleasant fact." POLITIKA cites Mesic's statement in  the 30 January edition of the Split newspaper FERAL TRIBUNE:  "Nothing can be concealed, nothing denied, everything is  accessible to everyone, even to foreign officials. Vice  Vukojevic is a deputy in the Croatian parliament, and I saw him,  just as you did, on television in the uniform of a foreign  country. I do not know how he went there and how he received his  rank, because I was caught by surprise, just as you were.  Regardless of how it happened, this is the first case of a  deputy appearing in the military uniform of another country."    POLITIKA states that the Croatian public knew that  "something  serious was happening with regard to this issue" when the Social  Democratic Union issued information that in Zagreb alone about  2,000 Croatian citizens born in Bosnia-Herzegovina were  mobilized overnight and, following training in the Kroacija  [formerly Marshal Tito] Barracks in New Zagreb, sent to the  front in Bosnia. Those who refused to go were sent to a military  prison, POLITIKA notes, adding that Croatian lawyer Slobodan  Budak has lodged appeals about the imposition of army prison  sentences on two Croat soldiers who refused to fight in another  country, i.e., Bosnia-Herzegovina. One soldier was a member of  the 175th Brigade in Zagreb and the other a member of the 101st  Brigade in Bosanska Posavina.</p>

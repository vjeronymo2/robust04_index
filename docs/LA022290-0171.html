			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> CYPRESS STARTS QUICKLY, OVERWHELMS SANTIAGO  </P> <P> Any doubt that third-seeded Cypress High School could handle Santiago left the  mind of Cypress Coach Fred Leininger one minute 20 seconds into the Centurions'  second-round 2-A boys' soccer match Wednesday.  </P> <P> That's when Mike Rapski headed in a corner kick from Cory Senko to give Cypress  a 1-0 lead.  </P> <P> Senko's pass sailed over the Santiago defenders and met Rapski in front of the  far goal post. Rapski didn't have to move his feet to head the ball in.  </P> <P> The play was executed so perfectly that Leininger said he had a feeling Cypress  would have an easy time advancing to the quarterfinals. As it was, the  Centurions thoroughly dominated Santiago and won, 5-1.  </P> <P> "Everything we ran seemed to work," Leininger said. "When we got that first  goal, I kind of figured the game was over."  </P> <P> Senko's assist gave him 20 for the season and broke the school single-season  record of 19 set by Chad Benson last year. Senko added to his record late in  the second half when he assisted Cypress' fifth goal, a header by Ray Klug. He  also scored a goal on a penalty kick.  </P> <P> In between, the bigger, faster Centurions (18-2-5) showed why they are ranked  among the top three soccer teams in the 2-A division.  </P> <P> Santiago (17-4-4) finally broke through on a penalty kick by Eric Paniagua.  </P> <P> In another 2-A match:  </P> <P> Laguna Hills 3, Brea-Olinda 1 -- Chris Cannenberg, Brian Beaman and Doug Barnes  scored for the Hawks (21-5-0). Jaysn Ochs scored for Brea-Olinda (14-8-2).  </P> <P> In the 1-A:  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran 2, Aquinas 0 -- Host Orange Lutheran (15-2-2) was led by Greg  Pargee, who scored 15 minutes into the match, and Todd Dudley, who scored with  time running out.  </P></p>

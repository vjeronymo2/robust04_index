			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The Food Agency said Friday  [20 May] it made a profit of 53 billion yen in the five-month  period ended March 31 through emergency imports of rice to deal  with the poor rice crop last year. The agency said 48 billion  yen or 90 percent of the profit, which excludes transport and  other expenses, was transferred to a special account to cover a  decrease in income by farming households. The agency said it  made total rice imports of 410,000 tons in the period at an  average price of 68,000 yen per ton and sold the rice at 218,000  yen per ton. The agency expects to make a total profit of 300  billion yen from rice imports in the current grain year ending  Oct. 30, when it plans to import 2.08 to 2.48 million tons of  rice, officials said.</p>

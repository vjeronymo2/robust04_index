			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Queen Mary bids narrowed THE field of bidders for the ocean liner Queen Mary has been narrowed to six contenders from 18, the Long Beach Board of Harbour Commissioners said last night. The rejected bidders failed to post a Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 50,000) bond required of all parties wishing to operate or purchase the vessel. Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based shipping group, last month offered to pay one sovereign for the liner. It is not one of the rejected bidders. The Queen Mary, which has been moored in the southern California port city since 1967 as a tourist attraction, was put up for auction earlier this year after the Walt Disney Company decided to terminate its lease as the tour operator. The ship-board hotel is scheduled to close on September 30. The city of Long Beach paid Cunard Dollars 3.45m for the liner after it was taken out of service, and has since spent Dollars 66m refurbishing the vessel.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Back to basics When both the Sun and The Economist pillory a Conservative administration on the same day, the markets might be expected to tremble slightly. Yet the UK government's travails seem to have left investors completely unruffled. Equities rallied strongly at the end of the week as, significantly, UK institutional buying overcame overseas selling. Long gilt yields are barely above recent lows, and are only 1.1 percentage points above base rates, while sterling threatens to rise above its old ERM floor. In part that may be because the next election is still, in all probability, a long way off. Even a leadership challenge seems unlikely before the autumn. That leaves the market free to concentrate on the improving economic outlook and prospects for the imminent corporate reporting season. Early indications suggest that there may be some pleasant surprises, which is consistent with statistics showing corporate sales rising and unit labour costs falling. That trend may well be continued this year, generating earnings increases higher than many analysts currently predict, and dragging equities back from their current vertiginous rating. The shift in focus from interest rate cuts to earnings increases is needed if the market is to maintain momentum. In the short run the robust recovery means that further rate cuts are unlikely. Only a downward lurch in confidence as the spring tax increases loom is likely to sway a chancellor keen to demonstrate sound money instincts to sceptics in his own party. Gilts thus have little to look forward to, and equities are left standing on their own merits.</p>
